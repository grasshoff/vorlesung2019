       "<h3>Results:</h3><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  as here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south. They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion. The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I). The sun (on ABE) is slower, as on the following day it stands at <b>E</b> and so its setting follows that of the fixed stars at <b>I</b> with which on the previous day it was conjoined on HA. Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG). Hence the Pythagoreans, when they shared out musical tones among the stars, gave the lowest (the hypate among the strings of the lyre)1 to the moon, because the motions of both were slowest. Hence have originated the words προηγούμενος and ὑπολειπτικός ^2. The former of these terms originally corresponded to a star which, on the next day, comes to its setting earlier (the sun <b>E</b> is said to be προηγούμενος with respect to the moon G). The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I). For more on this subject see our Optics, Ch. 10. 3</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them. For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observed—less striking to the eyes—because the diurnal motion was very swift. And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals. But now, that minute division and distribution of the star's proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously. First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun. For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen. At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion. From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5. And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the year 1580 until the year 1596, on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it. These motions, continued farther, would become unintelligibly intricate, for the continuation is boundless, never returning to its previous path. Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram. Moreover, we are forced to ascribe similar spirals to the remaining four planets, and much more complicated ones to Venus, if the earth stands still. Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun's motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun. Nevertheless, both leave the spirals themselves in the heavens. Copernicus, by attributing a single annual motion to the earth, entirely rids all the planets of these extremely intricate spirals, leading the individual planets into their respective orbits7 quite bare and very nearly circular. In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  For it was helpful to astronomers to understand that two simple motions, the first one and the second ones, the common and the proper, are intermingled, and that from this mingling that continuous sequence of conglomerated motions follows. And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile. When a planet (such as the moon at G) is \"left behind\" (by the sun at <b>E</b> or the fixed stars at I), it is carried in consequence* through FG more swiftly than the sun (through AE) or the fixed stars (through HI). It, however, it appears to be 'leading' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion. For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at <b>P</b> while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP.</p><hr>"
