				<p>This paper deals with the application of the creep tide theory (Ferraz-Mello, Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astron. 116, 109, 2013) to the rotation of close-in satellites, Mercury, close-in exoplanets and their host stars. The solutions show different behaviors with two extreme cases: close-in giant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and Earth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of close-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally driven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized with the orbital motion when the orbit is circular, but, if the orbit is elliptical, it has a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The rotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose frequencies are 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, · · · times the mean-motion. The number of attractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital eccentricity. The final stationary state depends on the initial conditions. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3 of the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with a relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped, but not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is estimated to lie in the interval 4.6 &lt; γ &lt; 27 × 10 −9 s −1 (equivalent to a quality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5 &lt; Q &lt; 50). The stars have relaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the only stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may lose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing the at-tractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in companions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of the companions. The paper also includes the study of the energy dissipation and the evolution of the orbital eccentricity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The rotation of the celestial bodies has always been one central problem in Astronomy. The knowledge of the rotation of the celestial bodies is important for a great number of reasons; we may mention the role played by the Earth rotation in the past as time keeper and, currently, the need of accurate ephemerides of planets and satellites to plan astronomical observation and also to plan the flight of space probes to the environment of some nearby ones. Theories of rotational motion involve physical models and parameters, and the comparison of ephemerides to the actually observed motion allows us to better constrain the physics of their interiors. In addition, the knowledge of their rotational evolution gives clues on the physical conditions in which the studied bodies originated and evolved.</p><p>One determinant factor for the rotational evolution of one celestial body is the presence of tidal torques. Almost all existing theories of tidal evolution are variants of Darwin's main theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Darwin, 1880)</ref> in which the elastic deformation of the body due to the potential of an external body is delayed because of its viscoelastic nature. In Darwin's theory, he postulated that the lag of each tidal component is small and proportional to its frequency, an assumption founded on a very first approximation of a creep approach that he had developed before, but abandoned <ref type="bibr">(Darwin, 1879)</ref>. It is worth recalling that following the creep approach, he also multiplied the coefficient of each term by the cosine of the lag, one fact almost forgotten in the variants developed in the second half of the past century. The introduction of lags proportional to the frequencies and the neglect of the factor proportional to the cosine of the lag deeply affect the results of the Darwinian theories. For example, it implies that the synchronization cannot be achieved when an elliptical relative orbit is assumed. The final state of the rotation of one body after synchronization is supersynchronous 1 : Ω ≃ n(1+6e 2 ).</p><p>A simplification introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">MacDonald (1964)</ref>, in which the whole body was displaced of a constant lag, was adopted by many authors. Recent analyses, however, showed that this hypothesis is unphysical and not associated to any reasonable rheology <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Williams and Efroimsky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ferraz-Mello, 2013b</ref>).</p><p>The rheology assumed in Darwin's theory and the unphysical assumptions of the MacDonald's theory were widely accepted almost without criticism. It was only recently that <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Efroimsky and Lainey (2007)</ref> raised the point that the rheology of the Earth as revealed by seismological observations diverges from Darwin's assumption and rather gives support to postulate that, in planetary satellites and terrestrial planets, lags must depend on the frequency through an inverse power law. This new model has been successfully applied to explain the fast despinning of Iapetus (Castillo- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Rogez et al. 2011</ref>). For the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that more general formulations of Darwin's theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kaula, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ferraz-Mello et al. 2008</ref>) exist in which the lags are assumed to occur, but they are kept free of any a priori association to frequencies.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the predictions of the creep tide theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ferraz-Mello, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">2013a</ref>; hereafter paper I) for the rotation of celestial bodies in systems with closein companions. The elastic tide is not considered. The forces due to the elastic tide are conservative and torque free. They do not need to be considered because they do not affect the rotation of the bodies and the energy dissipation. Only the anelastic tide needs to be considered.</p><p>The solution given by the creep tide theory shows different behaviors in the two extreme cases: close-in giant gaseous planets, with high relaxation factor (low viscosity) and large satellites and terrestrial planets, with low relaxation factor (high viscosity). The rotation of close-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally driven towards a synchronous solution when the orbit is circular, but to a super-synchronous solution (a.k.a. pseudo-synchronous), with an angular velocity (1 + 6e 2 + · · ·) times the orbital mean-motion, when the orbit is elliptical 2 . The rotation of satellites and terrestrial planets, however, may be driven to several attractors whose frequencies are 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, · · · times the meanmotion. The number of attractors increases with the viscosity of the body and the orbital eccentricity. The final stationary state depends on the initial conditions and on the eccentricity of the orbits. The well-known case of Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3 of the orbital period (3/2 attractor), is a consequence of the nonzero orbital eccentricity and of the relaxation factor of the planet (large enough to avoid the 2/1 attractor, but small enough to allow it to be trapped in the 3/2 attractor). The creep tide alone is able to produce such a result if the relaxation factor lie in the interval 4.6 − 27 × 10 −9 s −1 (equivalent quality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5 &lt; Q &lt; 50). The fact that Mercury has actually an important azimuthal asymmetry in the mass distribution means that a much smaller dissipation is to be expected (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Makarov, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Noyelles et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The comparison of the results of Darwinian theories to those of the creep tide theory shows that the approximation adopted by Darwin and by almost all authors in the past century corresponds to large relaxation factors and is not valid for terrestrial bodies, in which case, the relaxation factor may be much smaller than the tidal frequencies (see paper I ). The results of the creep tide theory in the case of terrestrial bodies are rather similar to those obtained by Efroimsky and collaborators <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Efroimsky and Williams, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Williams and Efroimsky, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>This paper deals with the rotational tidal evolution of close-in planetary satellites, Mercury, close-in exoplanets and their host stars. The stars behave as the hot Jupiters -they have similar relaxation factors -and their rotation is similarly driven by tides towards the near synchronous attractor. However, the rotation of solar-type stars is also affected by the loss of angular momentum due to the stellar wind which displaces the attractor towards larger rotation periods; old host stars of solar type with big close-in companions have rotational periods generally larger than the orbital periods of the companions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ferraz-Mello et al, 2015)</ref> One point to stress in this introduction is that, as in paper I , we restrict the theory developed in this paper to the case in which the rotation axis of the two bodies is perpendicular to the plane of their relative motion. This is certainly one restrictive hypothesis. However, several points in the development of the theory (stationary rotations, dissipation, transient motions, ...) are the same in this case and in the general case, and to treat them first in this "coplanar" case allows us a better understanding of the difficulties that they involve.</p><p>We also stress that no permanent triaxiality of the body is assumed. By this, we mean that the body is assumed to respond to external torques as a low Reynolds number fluid. The only existing torques are those resulting from the asymmetries introduced into the body by the tidal forces. In the creep tide theory, the rotation is given by a nonlinear first-order differential equation instead of the second-order pendulum-like equation of the classical spinorbit dynamics. (For another tide theory in which the torques are only a consequence of the elasticity of the body and of the action of the tidal forces, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bambusi and Haus, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The paper starts with a recapitulation of the creep tide theory emphasizing the two main modifications with respect to the previous version: the explicit consideration of the polar oblateness and a different technique to compute the torques acting on the body (Section 2). Then, Section 3 presents the equations giving the tidal effects on the rotation of the body, whose stationary solutions are discussed in Section 4. Sections 5 considers the particular stationary solutions whose rotation period is 2/3 of the orbital mean-motion and the cases Fig. 1 Spherical coordinates system with origin at the center of m and reference plane at its figure equator (see text). M(r, θ = π/2, ϕ) is the body creating the tidal potential acting on m. Angles: is the longitude of the (virtual) node N; ω is the argument of the pericenter; v is the true anomaly of Mercury and some extrasolar planets. Section 6 considers the changes in the stationary solutions due to the angular momentum leakage resulting from the magnetic braking of active stars hosting exoplanets. At last, sections 7 and 8 present complementary results on the energy dissipation and circularization of the orbits due to tides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The creep tide</head><p>The basis of the rheophysical approach (paper I ) is the following: We consider a homogeneous body m of mass m and assume that, at a given time t, the surface of the body is a function ζ = ζ( θ, ϕ, t) where ζ is the distance of the surface points to the center of gravity of the body and θ, ϕ are their co-latitudes and longitudes. The body is under the action of a tidal potential due to one second body M of mass M situated in its neighborhood, in the equatorial plane of m. The figure of equilibrium of m under the action of the tidal potential and rotation may be approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid ρ = ρ( θ, ϕ, t) whose major axis is oriented towards M, and whose equatorial prolateness and polar oblateness are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ǫ ρ = a e − b e R e = 15 4 M m R e r 3<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ǫ z = 1 − c e R e<label>(2)</label></formula><p>(see <ref type="bibr">Tisserand, 1891;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chandrasekhar 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Folonier et al. 2015</ref>). In the above equations, a e , b e , c e are the ellipsoid semi-axes, R e is the mean equatorial radius of m (R e = √ a e b e ), r is the distance from M to m, ǫ z is the component of the polar oblateness forced by the rotation of m. Terms of second order with respect to ǫ ρ and ǫ z are neglected in the calculations.</p><p>The approach is founded on the Newtonian creeping law</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">˙ ζ = −γ(ζ − ρ)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the stress in one point of the body was considered as proportional to its (radial) distance to the equilibrium.</p><p>The relaxation factor γ is a radial deformation rate gradient inversely proportional to the related to the uniform viscosity coefficient η through</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">γ = wR 2η = 3gm 8πR 2 η ,</formula><p>where w and g are the specific weight and gravity acceleration at the surface of the body, and R is its mean radius. It is worth stressing that the creep tide theory is strongly founded on the Newtonian creep, but not restricted to it. As the source of the anelastic component of the tide, the creep is the fundamental part of the theory. It is responsible for the more important tidal effects related to the exchanges of energy and angular momentum (synchronization, dissipation, circularization). It was emphatically treated in paper I . But the creep tide theory also includes one elastic tide necessary to give the right shape of the body, the precession of the pericenter and the variation of the longitude at the epoch.</p><p>The creep tide theory is virtually identical to the Maxwell model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia et al. (2014)</ref>. The main difference is that in the creep tide theory, the creep tide (or anelastic tide) is calculated separately and then added to the elastic tide, while the Maxwell model of Correia et al. starts with equations that include ab initio the two components of the tide. The only real difference between the two theories is that the creep equation in the Maxwell model adopted by Correia et al. is not given by Eqn.(3), but, in the notations of this paper, by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">˙ ζ = −γ[ζ −(1−λ)ρ]</formula><p>, where λ is one parameter related to the height of the elastic tide. Except for this difference, the two approaches are mathematically equivalent. (For a discussion on the equivalence of the two approaches, see Ferraz-Mello, 2015.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The creep equation</head><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> is valid in a reference system co-rotating with the body and such a frame was explicitly used in the first astro-ph preprints of paper I <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ferraz-Mello, 2012</ref>). For the actual calculation of the tidal torques, however, it is convenient to note that only relative positions appear in the right-hand side of the creep equation and to use one different frame: the longitude ϕ used in the calculations is reckoned from one of the nodes. Hence, ϕ is a linear function of t; in an explicit way,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ϕ = φ F + (Ω − ˙ )t<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where φ F is the longitude of the point in one frame fixed in the body. In this equation, Ω is the angular velocity of rotation of the body, which is assumed to be rotating in the same direction as the relative orbital motion of the two bodies, and is the longitude of the (virtual) node N in the non-rotating frame. We keep the denominations of the spatial problem to make easier the generalizations of the present study to 3 dimensions. Obviously, in the context of the coplanar problem, we could have adopted ≡ 0.</p><p>Let us consider the creep differential equation corresponding to an equilibrium ellipsoid whose major axis is directed towards M:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">˙ ζ + γζ = γρ = γR e 1 + 1 2 ǫ ρ sin 2 θ cos(2 ϕ − 2ω − 2v) − ǫ z cos 2 θ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>When ǫ z = 0, Eq. (5) is the same differential equation used in paper I with just a small modification coming from the new definition of the angles since, now, ϕ was taken with origin in a virtual node N. Therefore, the angle appearing in the arguments in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(5)</ref> is ω instead of ̟ = + ω. We note that, in the case of planetary satellites, it is not possible to neglect the motion of the orbit's node and pericenter due, e.g., to the oblateness of the central body. In the integration of Eq. (5) in that case, ˙ and ˙ ω are considered as nonzero constants.</p><p>At this point, we need to stress that, as done in all studies of the effects of tides on rotations, the changing deformation of the body is only taken into account in the calculation of the torques; the reaction of the body to these torques is the same as that of a rigid body and names as "figure equator" refer to a surrogate rigid body whose rotation will be affected by the tidal torques. One exception is the theory developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Williams et al. (2001)</ref> that considers the full problem of the rotation of the Moon (not only the tidal perturbations) and where the moment of inertia is decomposed into two parts, one constant -the "rigid" moment of inertia -and the other variable due to tidal and rotational deformations of the body. Here, the influence of the variations of the moment of inertia in the librations in longitude is not considered.</p><p>The sequence of the calculations is easy and the same as in Paper I. We first expand the forced terms in the creep differential equation assuming that the functions r(t), v(t) are given by the two-body (Keplerian) approximation. The resulting equation may be written as </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">˙ ζ+γζ = γR e 1+ 1 2 ǫ ρ sin 2 θ k∈Z E 2,k cos 2 ϕ+(k−2)ℓ−2ω −ǫ z cos 2 θ− 1 2 ǫ ρ cos 2 θ k∈Z E 0,k cos kℓ</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">E q,p (e) = 1 2π 2π 0 a r 3 cos qv + (p − q)ℓ dℓ,<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">ǫ ρ = 15 4 M m R e a 3 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ǫ z = ǫ z − 1 2 ǫ ρ (9)</formula><p>is the polar oblateness due to the rotation of the body (see the Online Supplement).

They are finite (i.e. not small) exact quantities resulting from the integration of the first-order linear differential equation. We note that being a linear equation, every non-homogeneous term (in the r.h.s.) may be treated separately. It is also worth warning that in the integration, the orbital elements a, e, the rotation velocity Ω and the variations ˙ ω, ˙ are taken as constants. In fact, they are variable. However, their resulting variations are of the order O(ǫ z ) and their contributions can be neglected, at least for limited times.</p><p>The free term of the solution, corresponding to the solution of the homogeneous equation ˙ ζ + γζ = 0, is transient (ζ = Ce −γt ) and will not be considered here. It will be assumed that the past elapsed time is such that these transients were fully damped.</p><p>The body surface is R e + δζ and it is simple to compute the force and torque that it exerts on the external body M because δζ is formed by the bulges of a set of quadrics (which may give positive or negative contributions) superposed to one sphere. Since these bulges are very thin (they are proportional to ǫ ρ ), we may proceed as in Paper I and calculate the attraction of M by the resulting composite, as the sum of the forces due to each ellipsoid bulge. The errors of this superposition are of second order w.r.t the oblatenesses (see paper I ).</p><p>In this paper, however, we use a more direct approach. We substitute the bulges by a thin spherical shell of radius R e and assume for the mass element at the shell coordinates ( θ, ϕ), the sum of the masses of the bulges at that point. The generic mass element in the shell is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">dm( θ, ϕ) = R 2 e µ m sin θd ϕd θδζ (18)</formula><p>where µ m is the density of the body. There is a small offset due to the fact that δζ is the height over a sphere of radius R instead of the mean radius R, but the changes thus introduced may be neglected. The offset is of order O(ǫ 2 ρ ). The contribution of the element dm to the potential in the external point P(r, ϕ, θ) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">dU = − Gdm ∆ (19)</formula><p>where G is the gravitation constant and ∆ is the distance from the element dm to the point P(r, ϕ, θ); the potential created by the whole shell is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">U = −GR 2 µ m π 0 sin θd θ 2π 0 δζ ∆ d ϕ (20)</formula><p>The integration is simple and may be easily computed either numerically or algebraically to the desired precision. The result is U= k∈Z (δU k + δU ′′ k ), where we have considered separately the contributions of the sectorial (or, rigorously speaking, tesseral) and zonal components of δζ and neglected terms of higher orders in R e /r:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">δU k = − 3GmR 2 e 5r 3 C k cos σ k sin 2 θ cos(2ϕ − β k ),<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">δU ′′ k = − GmR e 2 5r 3 C ′′ k cos σ ′′ k (3 cos 2 θ − 1) cos β ′′ k .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>The β k are the linear time functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">β k = (2 − k)ℓ + 2ω + σ k (23) β ′′ k = kℓ − σ ′′ k .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>We have ommited from δU ′′ k the term − Gm r k C ′′ k cos σ ′′ k cos β ′′ k which is the potential of an inverse square central force proportional to the mass of the δζ-shell. This term is obviously an artifact due to the chosen approximations and it must be discarded because the undisturbed central force potential already includes the whole mass of the body. It is worth mentioning that such a term only appears when the zonal terms are considered; the contribution to the mass of the terms δζ with sectorial variation is null because the deficit/excess of mass along adjacent sectors of the shell compensate one another since they are similar but with reversed sign.</p><p>It is worth noting that the leading terms in δU k and δU ′′ k are proportional to 1/r 3 . This fact is of importance since it will be responsible for tidal forces inversely proportional to the 4-th power of the distances.</p></div>

In the other cases, the oval is less apparent because of the squeezing of the adopted time scale.

The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">fig. 3 (left)</ref>. In order to see the actual behavior of the periodic solutions, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">fig 3 (right)</ref> the unscaled value of ν.

In the opposite case, when n &gt; γ, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3(right)</ref> shows that ν is generally negligible (i.e. B j ≪ 1). Besides, when n ≫ γ the short period oscillation (B 1 ) dominates over the average (B 0 ) what means that the asymptotic motion is dominated by the so-called physical librations. This result shows that the use of models limited to the averaged motion for the study of the spin-orbit dynamics of natural satellites and other bodies for which γ ≪ n is at least very hazardous as these motions are strongly dominated by a periodic oscillation whose period is the orbital period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The stationary solutions. Dependence on the eccentricity</head><p>The study of the full set of solutions of this system is impaired by the small values of the derivatives y ′ . In order to get a picture of the solutions space, we construct a map that associates to each value y its increment in one complete period of γx (i.e. one orbital period). Formally, these maps are y 0 = y(γx) → y(γx + 2π) − y 0 . The maps are presented using a grid of values of ν/n (= yγ/n) and were computed using an ordinary integrator 6 . They are unidimensional. Because of the small values of the variation of ν/n, the results appear multiplied by 10 6 in figs. 4 and 5.</p><p>The maps shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">fig. 4</ref> correspond to values of n comparable or less than the relaxation factor γ. The curves intersect the axis y = 0 (or ν/n = 0) just once and show the existence of one and only one attractor (or stationary solution). As in every other tidal evolution theory, once the damping is over, the motion tends to one attractor solution which, for e = 0, is supersynchronous This is what occurs in gaseous giant planets (see paper I , <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We remember that in this case, the amplitude of the periodic oscillations is negligible (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">fig.  3</ref> right). One may see that the intersections are situated at roughly ν/n = 12e 2 as given by all Darwin-type theories and by the creep tide theory for the case n ≪ γ (see paper I , eqn. 35). For the largest eccentricities, the observed intersection with the axis ∆y = 0 is located at a value a little higher than 12e 2 because of the contribution of the terms of order O(e 4 ).</p><p>The maps shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">fig. 5</ref> correspond to values of the mean motion n much larger than γ. The curves intersect the axis ∆y = 0 many times and there are many attractors, which are located at ν = −n, 0, n, 2n, · · ·. However, these attractors are defined by an integral over the period and so are not stationary; once the damping is over the motion is a non-negligible forced libration around the pseudo-stationary values. This is what occurs with planetary satellites and Earth-like planets. Classical examples are the Moon oscillating around ν = 0 and Mercury oscillating around ν = n (i.e. 2Ω − 3n oscillating around zero). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> also shows how the existence of the attractors depends on the orbital eccentricity. When e = 0, the only attractor is the synchronous solution. When the eccentricity increases, the other attractors at ν/n ≃ −1, 1, 2, 3, ... gradually appear. It is worth noting that the attractor ν = 0 does not show, in this case, the offset seen in the cases shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">fig. 4</ref>. The averages are now very close to the actual synchronization. (The proximity to the actual synchronization is of order O(γ/n) 2 .) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> In fact, to obtain the maps a first-order integrator would be enough. y ′ is too small and we are allowed to assume y constant (that is, σ k constant) in the r.h.s. and just integrate over one cycle of the periodic terms, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">∆( ν n ) = − 3πM ǫρ (M + m) k∈Z E 2 2,k sin 2σ k .</formula><p>The results are almost the same as those shown.

The maps presented in this Section show the same features shown in the plots of the average torque vs. rotation frequency published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia et al. (2014)</ref>. The similarity is one more consequence of the virtual identity of the creep tide theory and the Maxwell model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Makarov and Efroimsky (2013)</ref> claim that in the Kaula approach with the introduced lags corresponding to the Efroimsky-Lainey regime, the pseudo-synchronous solution may be unstable. However, in the creep tide theory, the damping κ depends on γ and ν through a function which is always positive. So, the considered stationary solutions are always stable. In the two panels of fig 5, ∆(ν/n) (i.e. &lt; y ′ &gt;) is positive and negative at, resp., the left and right of the attractor. However, looking at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">fig. 5</ref>, we may see that between the attractors, there are crossing of the axis ∆y = 0 with increasing ∆y. These intersections correspond to unstable stationary solutions separating the basins of attraction of different attractors, but these unstable solutions are far from the integer values of y. However, Makarov and Efroimsky are correct in the sense that for γ ≪ n the limit solutions is not an equilibrium solution but a periodic attractor.</p></div>

We note that for moderate e, E 2 2,1 is about 50 times smaller than E 2 2,−1 and this case is thus much less favorable than the 3/2 case. For the other stationary solutions, the analyses are similar. However, the powers of the eccentricity entering in the first term become higher. The dampings are much slower and no examples of the other stationary solutions are known in nature. We also remind that the 1/2 solution is shielded by the synchronous attractor. The only way to reach the 1/2 solution is that the body have been in the past in a highly subsynchronous rotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Application: The rotation of Mercury</head><p>Figures 6 show the curves ∆y(y) in the case of one molten planet with the same dynamics as Mercury for three values of the orbital eccentricity corresponding to the range of secular variation of Mercury's eccentricity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Laskar, 1996</ref>). The supported scenario is the same of classical theories: Mercury, like the other terrestrial planets, had primordially a rotation much faster than the current one, which slowly evolved due to tidal dissipation up to reach the 3/2 solution where it remained as "trapped". The analysis of the maps for several values of n/γ, in the neighborhood of the corresponding attractors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 7</ref>), and of the results of numerical integration of the exact equations for the same conditions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">fig. 8</ref>) allow us to get an estimation of the relaxation factor of such emulated Mercury. The fact that it was able to cross the 2/1 solution without being trapped there means that n/γ &lt; 180 (i.e. γ &gt; 4.6 × 10 −9 s −1 ). On the other end, the fact that it got trapped into the 3/2 solution, means that n/γ &gt; 18 (i.e. γ &lt; 46 × 10 −9 s −1 ). A simple formula to transform these values in the commonly used quality factors Q does not exist and the peculiar rotation of Mercury is different from the rotation states assumed to compute the equivalence formulas given in paper I . One may note from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 7</ref> (left) that the 3/2 attractor is not at the exact commensurability. This is more clearly seen in the results of the numerical integrations shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">fig.  8</ref>(left) resulting from simulations in the neighborhood of the 3/2 attractor. The final state of the evolution is below y = ν/γ = 1. That is, the final solution has a rotation speed slower than 1.5n. This offset grows in importance for smaller n/γ. It appears small in the maps of  fig. 7 because they were computed for e = 0.1 but, when the current Mercury's eccentricity (e=0.2056) is adopted, the drifts are yet smaller (see <ref type="figure">fig. 9</ref>) The fact that no significant drift from the 3/2 commensurability could be measured (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Margot et al. 2007</ref>), indicates a rather higher limit: n/γ &gt; 30 (i.e. γ &lt; 27 × 10 −9 s −1 ). This puts Mercury's relaxation factor between those adopted for the Moon and Titan (see paper I ) and allows us to constrain Mercury's quality factor Q, in this case, to the interval 5-50. We may compare this result to the limit Q &lt; 100 determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Peale and Boss (1977)</ref> as necessary to prevent the trapping in the 2/1 solution. The large Maxwell time (500 yr) adopted by Makarov (2012) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Noyelles et al. (2014)</ref> corresponds to values of γ much smaller than those found here and is justified by the fact that those authors consider a complete model including the large azimuthal asymmetry in the mass distribution of Mercury, which supply much of the effects attributed to tides when that asymmetry is not taken into account.</p><p>One more comment concerning Mercury's eccentricity in the creep tide scenario is the following: The rotation of Mercury in the 3/2 commensurability is an indication that never in the past, the eccentricity has been much below 0.1. Indeed, for low eccentricities, the 3/2 attractor disappears (see <ref type="figure">fig.10</ref>) or is so weak that with great probability the trapping will not be able to survive the forced periodic variations. Besides, the nature of the phenomenon is such that once the barrier represented by the 3/2 attractor is overcome, the solution tends to the synchronous stationary solution and no longer returns to the neighborhood of the attractor. At last, let it be said that the rotation of Mercury is the only observable effect of the tide in Mercury. The variation of Ω is proportional to M ⊙ (R/a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and the effect exists because the huge M ⊙ compensates the smallness of (R/a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . The relative variation of the orbital elements: semi-major axis and eccentricity, however, is proportional to M ⊙ (R/a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and the result is strongly dominated by the 5-th power of (R/a) being orders of magnitude smaller than the precision of the nominal values of these quantities appearing in the theories of motion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">3/2 rotation in exoplanets</head><p>The above results may be extended to close-in stiff exoplanets as long as we can assume that they respond to external torques as low Reynolds number fluids. The actual parameters of a given system enter in eqn. (42) only in the coefficient. The solution behavior discussed in previous section remains the same for other bodies; only the vertical scale changes. Therefore one exoplanet for which n/γ is in the interval defined above, 18 &lt; n/γ &lt; 180 in an orbit with eccentricity 0.1, can be trapped in the 3/2 attractor. The only additional condition is that it had evolved with almost unchanging orbits and had, at start, a fast rotation. The huge migration ascribed to exoplanet orbits plays against this scenario and the above result must be rather seen from the opposite direction: one planet outside this interval is certainly not in the 3/2 stationary rotation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 11</ref> shows the limits for trapping by the 3/2 attractor of one planet with e=0.1. Below the lines, the 2/1 and 3/2 attractors exist and one body evolving from a fast rotation is trapped by the 2/1 attractor without reaching the 3/2 attractor. Above the lines, the attractors do not exist and the body evolves straight to become synchronous. Between the lines, the 2/1 attractor no longer exists, but the 3/2 attractor exists.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2014)</ref> have investigated the possibility of a high-order resonant rotation of the planets GJ 581d and GJ667Cc whose masses are, respectively, 6.6 and 4.0 Earth masses. This possibility can be analyzed in the frame of the creep tide theory. One major difficulty, however, is the fact that the radii of these planets are not known. They can be either super-Earths or mini-Neptunes. The relaxation factor of Neptune is in the range 5 − 20 s −1 ; planets similar to Neptune, but smaller, may have, certainly, γ &gt; 1 s −1 . This means n/γ ≪ 1 in which case there is only one attractor and the planets may be expected to be in pseudo-synchronous rotation.</p><p>The most interesting case happens if these planets are indeed super-Earths. In such case, the estimated planet masses allow us to assume a solid-Earth-like relaxation factor: 100 − 500 × 10 −9 s −1 . This may be combined with the orbital periods (66.64 and 28.13 d, resp.) to give n/γ = 5 − 26 and n/γ &gt; 20. The figures of the previous section show that for such values a 3/2 rotation is indeed possible if the eccentricity is high enough. In this respect, the two planets are different. Due to the secular interaction with GJ667Cd, the eccentricity of GJ667Cc undergoes big periodic variations with the minimum reaching e ∼ 0.05 (see Makarov and Berghea, op.cit.). In the lowest eccentricity, the 3/2 attractor only exists for n/γ &gt; ∼ 100 (see <ref type="figure">fig.10</ref>). For smaller values, even if the rotation of GJ667Cc was at a given moment trapped by the 3/2-attractor, it would escape when the eccentricity plunge to its minimum value and the rotation would drift towards the synchronous attractor with a negative derivative, without the possibility of returning to the 3/2-attractor. The given condition for a possible 3/2-rotation is equivalent to γ &lt; ∼ 25 × 10 −9 s −1 , that is, a relaxation factor of the order of those of Titan or the Moon, which in principle is not expected for a large terrestrial planet. So, if a significant permanent C 22 does not exist in the planet potential, the rotation of GJ667Cc may be synchronized with the orbital motion.</p><p>In the case of GJ 581 d, the data are more favorable. It has a less variable eccentricity (half amplitude 0.004 cf. ) and the best-fit values from the several determinations are similar to present Mercury eccentricity (Hatzes 2013), or larger (Tadeu dos <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Santos et al. 2012</ref>). With such eccentricity and n/γ &gt; 20, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">fig. 6</ref> indicates that if this planet is not a mini-Neptune, then we may expect that it be trapped in the 3/2 attractor, or even in the 2/1 one.</p><p>The recent discovery of an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone of Kepler 186 deserves some speculation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Quintana et al. 2014</ref>). In this case, we know the radius of the planet (1.11± 0.4R ⊕ ) but not its mass. Even if exoplanets often disobey educated guesses, the expected mass range of Kepler 186 f (0.32 &lt; m &lt; 3.77M ⊕ ) (Quintana et al. op.cit.) corresponds to non-gaseous bodies. In the average hypothesis, the planet could be assimilated to the solid Earth, whose relaxation factor is in the range 90 − 360 × 10 −9 s −1 , of the same order as n = 560 × 10 −9 s −1 (the orbital period is 129.9 d). Hence n/γ is in the range 1.6 -6, too small to allow the existence of the 3/2 attractor unless the planet has a high eccentricity, say 0.1 or larger. If the planet has some liquid parts, high dissipation is likely to occur there (as in the Earth) the equivalent relaxation factor may be smaller and n/γ higher, in which case the existence of the 3/2 attractor is possible even if the eccentricity is as small as ∼ 0.05. The existence of the other non-synchronous attractors depend only on the orbital eccentricity. In the extremes of the mass range estimated by Quintana et al (op.cit.), the result will depend critically on the value of γ. There are no known paradigms with these extreme size and mass and guesses are not possible.</p></div>

This may be the case even for some stars similar to the Sun and it was used in the study of several other CoRoT systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carone (2012)</ref>. The estimates of the loss of angular momentum of the Sun are in the interval 3 − 6 × 10 30 g cm 2 s −2 while the above value of the numerical coefficient used in Eq.

The justification and the details of the Bouvier's formula are out of the scope of this paper. (For a comprehensive review, see Bouvier, 2013). For the application concerned here, it is enough to know that the above form of the law is valid after the star has completed its contraction (the moment of inertia C no longer changes), is fully decoupled from the disk and no significant mass loss needs to be considered. Besides, the rotation period of the star may be larger than some saturation value (roughly 1.8 days).</p><p>If we adopt the normalized variables introduced in Sec. 3.1, the braking equation becomes When the braking is added to the synchronization equation of Sec. 3.1, the intersections of the map showing the variation of ν/n per period exoplanets are strongly displaced to the left, that is, to negative values of ν/n. The stationary solutions become sub-synchronous. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> shows the solutions for values of n/γ typical of host stars, for several values of the eccentricity. The maps constructed without the braking are shown in the background (dashed lines) to stress the big changes produced by the angular momentum leakage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We have used the creep tide theory to study the evolution of the rotation of bodies due to tides raised in them by the proximity of a second body. Contrary to the classical spinorbit studies of solid bodies, no permanent deformation is assumed to exist. The bodies are assumed to behave as viscous fluids free to deform under the tidal action. Any a priori imparted deformation decays exponentially, by self-gravitation, with a time scale 1/γ. The only torques acting on the body result from the asymmetries of its shape generated by the tidal forces. It is not said that celestial bodies cannot have a permanent deformation -the Moon clearly shows such a deformation; they are just not taken into account and we explore to its limits the creep tide of a fluid body.</p><p>The solutions show two distinct patterns. One, when the relaxation factor γ is much larger than the frequency of the tide, corresponding to the high-γ approximation, dubbed as Darwin regime, in which the energy dissipation due to the tide is proportional to the tide frequency, and the other, when the relaxation factor is much less than the tide frequency, the Efroimsky-Lainey regime, in which the behavior is inverted and the energy dissipation depends on the frequency of the tide through an inverse power law. Between these two extremes would be the cases in which the relaxation factor and the tide frequency are of the same order, but the known celestial bodies fall allways into one of the two mentioned classes. Gaseous planets and stars have relaxation factors of the order of 10 − 100 s −1 , while terrestrial planets and close-in planetary satellites have relaxation factors of the order of 10 − 100 × 10 −9 s −1 We do not know bodies with relaxation factors between these two extremes On the other hand, the semi-diurnal tide frequencies of the known bodies range from 1.24 ×10 −6 s −1 (Mercury) to 180 × 10 −6 s −1 (Jupiter). Thus, we always have either γ ≪ ν or γ ≫ ν. The only way to populate the transition zone in which the relaxation factor and the tide frequency are of the same order, would be with very distant synchronous planets or planetary satellites (hypothetical) in which the semi-diurnal frequency would be very small.</p><p>The main topic discussed in the paper is "synchronization". However, this is a denomination coming from the classical spin-orbit dynamics of solid bodies, which needs to be adapted to be used in the frame of the creep tide theory. On one hand, the consiered bodies are not solids, and in the other hand, a damping resulting in a stationary synchronized rotation never happens. As shown in the paper, there are many possible behaviors. In the simplest Darwinian regime of gaseous bodies, the forced oscillations are damped to negligible values, and the rotation tends indeed to be stationary, but the issue is a bit faster than the orbital motion. The excess of angular velocity is ∼ 6ne 2 and a synchronous solution only occurs when the eccentricity is zero. In the other case, the Efroimsky-Lainey regime of close-in planetary satellites the solutions are damped towards a stationary solution, but it is not necessarily synchronous. The stationary solutions found in the paper have periods nearly commensurable with the orbital period, the ratio of the two periods being a half-integer number larger than −1/2. If the eccentricity is very small, the only possible solution is indeed nearly synchronous but, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, not exactly synchronized. It is slightly supersynchronous (faster than the mean-motion). Besides, this stationary solution only corresponds to the average behavior of the rotation of the body. The actual solution involves important forced oscillations around the attractor.</p><p>At last, we have considered the case of some stars in which, besides the tide, we have to consider the possible angular momentum leakage via magnetic stellar wind. In such cases, the star continuous loss of angular momentum displaces the stationary solutions towards sub-synchronous values. Old active host stars (e.g. G stars) with big close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of their companions. On the other hand, non-active host stars (e.g. early F stars) tend to have rotational periods very similar to the orbital periods of their companions. This behavior was verified in a sample of planetary systems with large close-in companions ).</p><p>The synchronization equation was used to study the rotation of a molten planet with the same dynamics as Mercury. It allows the current stationary solution with a period 2/3 of the orbital period (3/2 attractor; ν = 0.827 × 10 −6 s −1 ) to exist. But it also allows for other possibilities, depending on the relaxation factor of the planet. If we assume that the planet was formed with a rotation much faster than the present and that it was decelerated due to the tide in the planet, it could have been trapped in an attractor corresponding to a faster solution, e,g, with a period of half the orbital period. The fact that it was not trapped in the 2/1 attractor requires that γ &gt; 4.6 × 10 −9 s −1 . In the same way, to remain trapped in the 3/2 attractor we may have γ &gt; 46 × 10 −9 s −1 . Besides, the closeness of Mercury's rotation to the exact commensurability indicates a yet stricter limit: γ &gt; 27 × 10 −9 s −1 .</p><p>The same study can be extended to some exoplanets. Three examples were discussed in the paper: GJ 667Cc, GJ 581d and Kepler 186 f. The only one showing a possibility of trapping in a non-synchronous attractor is GJ 581d. However, one necessary condition for this is that it is a super-Earth, but the unknown radius and density of the planet does not allow to exclude the possibility that it is gaseous, in which case γ would be high and the rotation would be in Darwin regime where no attractors exist beyond the pseudo-synchronous one.</p><p>The paper also includes a discussion of the energy dissipation due to tide raised in the rotating bodies. The general energy variation was discussed in the two main rotation states: pseudo-synchronous and free rotation. If the body is in free rotation, the mechanical energy variation linked to the tide raised on it has two components: the energy variation due to the changes of the system semi-major axis due to the tide, and the variation in the rotational energy of the body. The sum of these two components is the mechanical energy lost by the system and the energy conservation law implies that it may be equal to the thermal energy dissipated inside the body. Indeed, similar variations exist in association with the tide raised in the other body, but in the first approximation we may separate the problem in two parts and treat the energy in each body approximating the other body by a material point. In the case of bodies whose rotation is trapped in a stationary state, we can neglect the variation of the rotational energy and consider only the variation due to the changes in the semi-major axis. Actually, the variation in the orbital axis implies a variation in the mean-motion and thus, to remain synchronized, the rotation of the body has also to vary, but the corresponding energy variation is orders of magnitude smaller than the variation of the orbital energy, and can be neglected.</p><p>The results showed the Maxwellian pattern already discussed in Paper I. In both regimes: γ ≫ n (Darwin regime) and γ ≪ n (Efroimsky-Lainey regime), the dissipation follows a power law. See the straight wings in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 14(Right )</ref>. In the high-γ, or Darwin regime, the dissipation decreases with γ/n, or equivalently, grows with the tide frequency (n/γ). In the language of Darwinian theories, Q is inversely proportional to the frequency or, the geodetic lag is proportional to the frequency). For low-γ, or Efroimsky-Lainey regime, this behavior is inverted. The results obtained in the paper were applied to two important examples: Io and the Earth, and were compared with those found in the literature.</p><p>In what concerns the version of the creep tide theory used, two points are worth being stressed: (1) We consider, in this version, the effects due to the tidal variation in the polar axis. These variations can be easily understood in the frame of the model used in Paper I, where the polar oblateness of the body was not taken into account. In that case, the equilibrium figure was a prolate Jeans spheroid with the axis directed towards the outer body M. When the distance to the outer body varies, the prolateness change. This means that the whole section perpendicular to the line joining the two bodies varies; so not only the minor axis in the equatorial section changes, but also the polar axis. So, when we include the polar oblateness due to the rotation of the body, we have also to consider the variation of the polar oblateness due to the tide. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> We have changed the way in which the forces acting on M were computed. This was not a change in the theory since the results obtained here are the same as in Paper I. The interest of the technique used here, in which the deformation of the outer surface is substituted by the variable density of a thin outer layer, opens the possibility of numerical construction of the theory, which may be instrumental when more complex models are considered.</p><p>The model constructed here is yet as simple as possible and just looks for pushing the investigation on the validity limits of the creep tide theory as far as possible before more complex scenarii are considered. The elastic component of the tide was not considered because it does not contribute to the torques and energy variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ONLINE SUPPLEMENT A The equilibrium ellipsoid</head><p>Let us first remind the equilibrium figure of one body simultaneously submitted to equatorial tide and rotation. In the absence of the rotation, the equilibrium figure is approximated by a prolate Jeans spheroid whose major axis is directed to the body M. In the presence of rotation, the equilibrium figure is approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid whose equatorial prolateness is the same as that of the Jeans spheroid ǫρ (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Folonier et al. 2015</ref>) and whose polar flattening is formed by the flattening of the Maclaurin spheroid plus the contribution of the tidal potential (which depends on the distance r). With respect to the principal axes, the equation of the adopted triaxial ellipsoid is X 2 a 2 + , Re is the mean equatorial radius. One rotation is needed to bring the system whose axes are the principal axes into the adopted system of reference. The coordinates of one point on the surface of the body, in the reference system fixed in the body, are x = ρ sin θ cos ϕF , y = ρ sin θ sin ϕF , z = ρ cos θ where θ and ϕF are, respectively, the co-latitude and longitude of the point. The sought rotation shifts the origin of the system of coordinates to the axis a (i.e. towards M). The angle between the two systems is ̟ + v where ̟ is the longitude of the pericenter counted from the origin fixed in the rotating body and v is the true anomaly of the body M. We thus have where ϕ and ω are counted from a fixed direction in space (corresponding to the nodal line in the spatial theory) (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Hence, after substitution in the equation of the ellipsoid,</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">ρ = Re 1 + 1 2 ǫρ sin 2 θ cos(2 ϕ − 2ω − 2v) − ǫz cos 2 θ (A.4)</formula><p>The polar oblateness is composed of a part fixed by the rotation of the body (Maclaurin) and the increment related to the tidal deformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">ǫz = ǫz + 1 2 ǫρ (A.5)</formula><p>In absence of rotation, ǫz = 1 2 ǫρ (Jeans prolate spheroid).</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Supersynchronous means that the angular rotation velocity is larger than the mean-motion, i.e., the rotation period is smaller than the orbital period. It is often referred to, in the literature, as &quot;pseudo-synchronous&quot; solution.</note>
