<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PREFACE</head><p>For tens of thousands of years humans have looked upward and tried to find meaning in what they see in the sky, trying to understand the context in which they and their world exists. Consequently, astronomy is the oldest of the sciences. Since Aristotle began systematically recording the motions of the planets and formulating the first models of the universe there have been over 2350 years of scientific study of the sky. The earliest scientists explained their observations with the earth-centered universe model and little more than two millennia later we now live in an age where we are beginning to characterize exoplanets and systematically probing the evolution of the universe from its earliest moments to the present day. Human understanding of the universe has leapt forward incrementally with each new technology. Firstly with improvements in the methods of observing with the naked eye and the recording of observations, then, over 400 years ago with Galileo and the first telescopes. There followed a continuing constant evolution to larger collecting surfaces. Larger lenses and much larger mirrors were developed and within the last 150 years the use of photographic plates and spectroscopy coupled with improved mechanical tracking allowed huge advances. The sphere of the observable universe increased to distances and times when the universe was considerably younger than today. With the introduction and availability within the last few decades of electronic detectors, telescopes in space, supercomputing, segmented mirror technologies and adaptive optics, every improvement has allowed existing questions to be answered, spawned the development of new ones and led to almost countless unexpected discoveries.</p><p>As our level of knowledge grows, the next level of questions that arise require facilities with even greater capabilities to gather the observations needed to answer them. With each incremental step in capability, the resulting new questions require an even larger step in capability in order to be answered.</p><p>No single university, no single country, not even a whole continent has the technological resources to build these facilities. In order to answer the key questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and to explore the enigmatic processes, environments and bodies that pervade the universe the Thirty Meter Telescope Observatory was conceived.</p><p>We have now embarked on the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope and its capable suite of first light instruments. Over the past decade a strong and capable international partnership has been established, bringing together the necessary resources, building new international scientific collaborations, developing the design and preparing to build the Thirty Meter Telescope. The Thirty Meter Telescope will be an extremely powerful facility in its own right and will comprise a key component of the future suite of astronomical facilities including JWST, LSST and ALMA. In the pursuit of scientific knowledge, the international partnership brings together the combination of scientific and engineering expertise and industrial capabilities needed to build and operate the TMT and provide each partner with cutting edge facilities to support their research communities as well as creating immeasurable benefits for broader society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This is the 2015 Detailed Science Case for the Thirty Meter Telescope project, a public document, managed by the TMT Science Advisory Committee and updated from the original 2007 version (RD01) with input from the TMT International Science Development Teams. It will be updated as needed during the construction and operations phases of the TMT project. The original Detailed Science Case was developed with the input of the science teams and authors of the 2006 instrument feasibility studies (RD02) and from many scientists across the collaboration. The present updated version builds on the previous work and captures the developments in the envisioned science goals and the status of the first light and future instruments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">PURPOSE AND SCOPE</head><p>The Detailed Science Case (DSC) is the highest-level statement of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) science case. It provides examples of the kinds of exciting, groundbreaking science that will be enabled by a 30m telescope. Wherever possible, synergies with other major new and upcoming facilities (e.g. the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope) are discussed. As appropriate, performance numbers (often conservative) are provided (e.g. sensitivities, integration times, spatial resolutions).</p><p>The DSC is not a requirements document. The Science-based Requirements Document (SRD) (RD03) is the highest-level requirements document for TMT.</p><p>This document is intended to provide a high-level overview of the TMT science case for the following audiences: Astronomers within the TMT partnership and international scientific colleagues Various astronomy strategic working groups and Internal TMT groups</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">APPLICABLE AND REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND CHANGE RECORD</head><p>This high-level document has no applicable documents within the TMT Project.</p><p>Reference documents contain information complementing, explaining, detailing, or otherwise supporting the information included in the current document.</p><p>Documents can be found in the TMT Document Control Center (DCC) using their internal document number in the following URL: https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-XXXX . It will be able to support instruments that are sensitive through the atmospheric windows from 0.31 to 28 µm. Advanced adaptive optics capabilities will allow highly sensitive, diffractionlimited observations from wavelength shortward of 1 µm to the mid-infrared over most of the sky. A 20 arcmin diameter field of view facilitates the deployment of wide-field, multi-object spectrographs. These capabilities will enable groundbreaking advances in a wide range of scientific areas, from the most distant reaches of the Universe to our own Solar System. Powerful new facilities have often opened up unimagined areas of research and made important but unanticipated discoveries. We expect the situation with TMT will be no different and hence look forward to a rich and diverse mix of both expected and unexpected scientific results. The conceptual instrument suite located on the Nasmyth platforms of the latest telescope design. The conceptual instrument suite was used to derive the requirements for the observatory to ensure that the telescope was capable of supporting many different instrument types. The first light configuration includes IRIS, WFOS, and IRMS (see Section 2.3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">THE BIG PICTURE</head><p>Decades of advances with ground and space-based facilities have provided a clear and convincing picture of the overall history of our Universe. We now know that the observable Universe began some 13.8 billion years ago when a small region of empty space became unstable and began to expand, rapidly increasing in size by some twenty or thirty orders of magnitude. This period of expansion, called inflation, lasted but a tiny fraction of a second, yet it resulted in the production of all matter and energy in our Universe. When inflation ended an exceedingly hot mixture of elementary particles of all varieties pervaded space. At the same time, tiny 'quantum' fluctuations in the distribution of this energy were stretched to macroscopic scales by inflation. These fluctuations formed the seeds for the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we see today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2.2: Schematic history of the Universe (Credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team)</head><p>Following inflation, the Universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. This expansion resulted in cooling of the plasma allowing the elementary particles to combine to form the familiar protons, neutrons, electrons, photons, neutrinos and ultimately hydrogen and helium nuclei. Also present were large quantities of what we now refer to as dark matter and dark energy. During this expansion, the gravitational attraction of the small energy fluctuations resulted in the growth of dark matter density fluctuations. Some 400,000 years after inflation, the nuclei and electrons combined to form neutral atoms and the Universe became transparent to the photons left over from the Big Bang. Today we see those photons as the cosmic microwave background. Once freed from the drag produced by interactions with those Big Bang photons, the neutral gas began to fall into the denser pockets of dark matter. In a complex process of gravitational accretion and radiative cooling, the first stars formed. The intense radiation produced by this first generation of massive stars heated the surrounding gas, creating bubbles of ionized gas. Initially, the light from these first stars was trapped in these bubbles but as more and more of the surrounding gas was re-ionized, this first light began to propagate throughout the Universe.</p><p>As star formation continued and dark matter halos merged due to gravitational attraction, the first galaxies were formed. These first galaxies -relatively small collections of stars, gas, and dust caught within the gravitational potential of dark matter halos -merged to form larger more massive galaxies.</p><p>The end products of this process (known as hierarchical structure formation) surround us todayfrom the most massive clusters of galaxies, to our home galaxy the Milky Way, and down to its dwarf galaxy neighbors.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETAILED SCIENCE CASE: 2015</head><p>April 29, 2015</p><p>Within many galaxies, star formation continues as clouds of gas cool and contract. Dense clouds of molecular gas form stellar nurseries that harbor newly-forming stars. These nascent stars are surrounded by disks of gas and dust within which planets develop. We now know that most stars have some form of planetary system planets. However we are only able to directly image a very small subset of known planets, a subset of planets that are particularly young, hot and massive compared to the range of known planets in the universe, vastly different to Earth. To attempt to characterize terrestrial exoplanets that are in the habitable zones around their stars will require the use of a 30m class telescope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">THE BIG QUESTIONS</head><p>The large aperture and field of view of TMT combined with its powerful adaptive optics systems and science instruments will provide unique gains in precision astrometry, high contrast imaging and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through the mid-infrared to open new regions of discovery space on a number of "Big Questions" reaching from the distant Universe to our own Solar System:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is the nature and composition of the Universe?</head><p>The nature of dark matter and energy, the ingredients that dominate the composition of the Universe, remains a complete mystery. The lower limit of the dark matter mass spectrum depends on the nature of the dark particle ("warm" vs "cold"). Diffraction-limited imaging with TMT of anomalies in strong gravitational lenses will probe this limit down to levels at least ten times smaller than currently possible. Different dark energy models predict different rates of evolution for cosmic distances and structures, and deep spectroscopy of very distant supernovae (up to z = 4) with TMT will provide a longer timeline over which these changes may be more readily detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When did the first galaxies form and how did they evolve?</head><p>TMT can study galaxy formation both near and far. It will be able to detect the spectroscopic signatures of metal-free star formation, i.e., of the first stars forming in the first galaxies at redshifts well beyond 10. The sensitivity of TMT will overcome the "photon starvation" plaguing existing 8 m to 10 m telescopes to produce detailed, spatially-resolved maps of morphology, chemistry, and kinematics for galaxies out to z = 5 − 6 with a fidelity equivalent to what is currently done at z &lt; 1. The large field of view and excellent UV throughput of TMT will enable powerful surveys of stellar abundances and ages in the halo of our own Milky Way over a volume nearly 100 times larger than previously possible to build a far more complete census of the smaller fragments that were hierarchically assembled into this halo. TMT will also be able to perform photometry of spatiallyresolved stellar populations in galaxies out to the distance of the Virgo Cluster to provide the firstever "archeological" sample large enough to unambiguously show the stochastic nature of galaxy assembly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is the relationship between black holes and galaxies?</head><p>Black holes with masses as high as a billion times the mass of the Sun are now known to occupy the centers of galaxies. They warp space-time in fascinating ways, and their formation process is unknown, but it must be intimately linked to galaxy formation. If mass is the link, then the black hole mass function should track the galaxy mass function across the entire Hubble sequence and across time. The spatial resolution and sensitivity of TMT will make it possible to measure the black hole mass function down to masses ten times smaller and make dynamical measurements in galaxies more than 20 times farther than currently possible. TMT will expand by a factor of 1000 the number of galaxies where direct black hole mass measurements can be performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How do stars and planets form?</head><p>The birth of stars is a fundamental process closely intertwined to galaxy evolution and chemical enrichment in the Universe, which ultimately results in the diverse range of planetary systems, and possibly in life itself. And yet at present, we cannot answer the very basic questions, such as what determines the stellar mass, and we are far from understanding when, where, and how planets form.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETAILED SCIENCE CASE: 2015</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>Observations with TMT will play a critical role in providing answers to these questions. The initial mass functions will be obtained for distant young star clusters, not only in the Milky Way but also in other galaxies, in a wide range of environments, which is a necessary step toward the development of a predictive theory of star formation. Morpho-kinematical mapping of protoplanetary disks will unveil the inner 10 AU, which will yield detections of growing planets and reveal the spatial distribution of disk material including water and organic molecules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is the nature of extra-solar planets?</head><p>Observations made in the last few years with the Kepler space telescope suggest that most stars harbor a planetary system, that Earth-like planets in habitable zones are quite common and that the easy-to-detect hot Jupiter-type planets are the exception rather than the rule. What formation processes give rise to this variety of exoplanetary systems? Investigating the atmospheric characteristics of the closest and brightest hot Jupiter planets has just begun with existing 10m class facilities, and, space telescopes can only enable very limited characterization of lava-ocean rocky planets. The ability to study Earth analogues in habitable zones will therefore only come with the advent of 30m class facilities, and a key question will be whether or not terrestrial type exoplanets have atmospheres similar to that of Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?</head><p>Are conditions on terrestrial planets conducive to the development of life? Every star has a habitable zone, where a planet would have a surface temperature similar to that of Earth. If, as expected, exoplanetary systems have populations of small icy bodies like comets, it is possible that water and organic molecules could have been delivered to such planets by impacts. If life then develops, it might be detected by signatures of biological activity in planetary atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">THE REQUIRED TOOLS</head><p>To answer these questions, and many others, advances in technology are needed. The most progress will come from combined studies at many different wavelengths using ground and spacebased facilities. Several major new telescopes will begin operation in the next decade. These include the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with a launch date of 2018, covering 0.6 µm to 28 µm near and mid-infrared wavelengths and the ground based optical Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) with commissioning science beginning mid-2022. The highly productive Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) (0.3 to 1mm) was completed in June 2014 and will remain the premier millimeter facility for the next couple of decades. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) (80cm to 6m) will follow with the first phase projected for completion in 2025. The ASTRO-H and eROSITA x-ray telescopes have launch dates of 2016 and will provide survey and follow-up capabilities that will be further complemented in 2028 with the launch of the versatile ATHENA x-ray mission. The ground based submillimeter to millimeter CCAT facility, the radio JVLA (6mm to 5m) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) are other facilities with strong scientific synergies with the TMT.</p><p>Multi-wavelength observations with these powerful, next-generation facilities will undoubtedly open exciting, new frontiers. Yet they will not alone be sufficient. Much as the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope was complemented by the greater light gathering power of the Keck 10-meter telescopes, these new facilities will need a complementary large-aperture ground-based telescope that can provide high spatial and spectral resolution observations in the optical and infrared. In fact, a revolution in technical capability now makes ground-based telescopes even more effective. Adaptive optics (AO) systems allow the largest optical-infrared telescopes on Earth to achieve higher resolution than telescopes in space, which necessarily have smaller apertures. By compensating atmospheric turbulence, AO allows telescopes to reach the diffraction limit, in which the angular resolution achieved is proportional to the diameter of the telescope aperture.</p><p>A useful figure of merit for telescope performance is the time required to achieve a given signal-tonoise ratio for a particular science program or object. The reciprocal of this time is a measure of the sensitivity or productivity of the telescope. Because larger telescopes collect more light, their To take advantage of these huge gains in light collection and spatial resolution, TMT will be equipped with a suite of powerful science instruments. The initial selection of first light instrument requirements from a suite of instrument concepts was made in December 2006 by the TMT Science Advisory Committee based on a careful consideration of the science programs as well as the range of capabilities essential for pursuing science areas that are currently unforeseen. Consideration was also given to technical readiness, cost and schedule. These choices were re-affirmed in 2011 at a project wide science and instrumentation workshop in Victoria. The capabilities of these instruments are summarized briefly in the next sub-sections. All instruments will be mounted and kept operationally ready at all times (except of course for periods of scheduled maintenance or upgrades). It will be possible to switch from one instrument to another in less than 10 minutes (including target acquisition).</p><p>NFIRAOS will also feed IRMS (Infrared Multi-slit Spectrometer). IRMS is a close copy of the very successful and versatile Keck/MOSFIRE instrument, and it leverages the MCAO capability provided by NFIRAOS to boost the amount of light falling within its slitlets. The heart of IRMS (and MOSFIRE) is a cryogenic slit unit that will allow up to 46 slitlets to be configured on-the-fly over a 2.3 x 2.3 arcmin field. The entire Y, J, H, and K bands can be covered (one at a time) in one grating setting with a spectral resolution up to R=4660. In imaging mode, IRMS covers the entire NFIRAOS field-ofregard with 0.06 arcsec sampling.</p><p>The third first-light instrument is WFOS (Wide-Field Optical Spectrometer). WFOS is a seeinglimited instrument that will cover a total spectral range from 0.31 to 1.1 µm using separate red and blue color channels. Three spectral resolution modes will be available (R = 1000, 5000 and 8000) with multiplexing factors up to 200 objects over a 25 arcmin 2 field. The original WFOS concept builds upon the heritage of such workhorse instruments as Keck/DEIMOS and Magellan/IMACS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">First Light Instruments Exposure Time Calculators</head><p>A comprehensive Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) covering both the spectroscopic and imaging modes of the first light instruments has been developed.</p><p>http://tmt.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ETC-e.html An ETC for IRMS has been developed from the existing MOSFIRE ETC.</p><p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3g66sbyRdnOTzRITUFJdHEyaGc</p><p>These ETCs are useful tools to explore the improvement in capability that TMT will bring compared to existing facilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Future Instruments</head><p>The observatory has been designed to support a diverse set of instruments, and its instrument suite will evolve significantly over its 50-year lifetime. The first of the second-generation instruments is expected to be delivered two years after first light, and additional instruments should follow at the rate of one every 2.5 years thereafter. Instrument priorities will be established by the TMT SAC</p></div>

Future instrument concepts studied thus far as part of the observatory design include: HROS (High-Resolution Optical Spectrometer): a single-object, seeing-limited, high-resolution (R=50 000 for 1 arcsec slit) optical-UV echelle spectrograph in the heritage of HIRES at Keck and UVES at the VLT.</p><p>IRMOS (Infrared Multiobject Spectrometer): designed to use multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) techniques over a 5 arcmin field of regard to feed up to 20 deployable IFUs. This future instrument combines the diagnostic power of IRIS with the multiplexing capabilities of IRMS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIRES (Mid-Infrared Echelle Spectrometer):</head><p>is a diffraction-limited, high-resolution (5000 &lt; R &lt; 100 000) spectrometer and imager operating at 8 -18 µm. It will employ a separate AO system optimized for the mid-infrared. A concept for a mid-IR high resolution spectrograph and IFU instrument called MICHI is being actively developed at this time.</p><p>NIRES (Near-Infrared Echelle Spectrometer): fed by NFIRAOS, NIRES is a diffraction-limited highresolution (20 000 &lt; R &lt; 100 000) spectrometer covering 1 -2.4 µm simultaneously. It is a scientific descendent of Keck/NIRSPEC and VLT/CRIRES.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PFI (Planet Formation Instrument):</head><p>an extreme AO high contrast exoplanet imager with spectroscopic (R ≤ 100) capability.

The next design phases are greatly benefiting from all the lessons learned from GPI at Gemini and SPHERE at the VLT. There is already a large overlap between the GPI and PFI development teams and new concepts (Second Earth Imager for TMT -SEIT and Planetary Spectral Imager -PSI) are being developed.</p></div>

Each partner is free to divide up the amount of PI-directed and Service observing awarded. PI-Directed observations may use time blocks as short as an hour (see RD04) but typically half or whole nights will be awarded and will involve the assignment of a support astronomer to the PI to help with planning execution and analysis of the observations. Service observing will effectively be the execution of a pre-planned queue, this will enable many varied programs to be supported including cadence and ToO programs and also enables PI-controlled observations and eaves-dropping modes. Most observing will be carried out remotely, either from the sea level headquarters or remote observing centers in each of the partner countries.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY</head><p>One of the most exciting areas of current research lies at the interface between theoretical and highenergy physics and cosmology. Indeed, the discovery of dark matter and dark energy result from astrophysical observations of the Universe. It is these kinds of careful quantitative cosmological and astrophysical measurements that offer the greatest promise for constraining fundamental physical theories. TMT will contribute in this area by providing highly accurate measurements of the most distant sources, large samples of objects probing the Universe at intermediate distances, and precise studies of the dark matter in nearby and distant objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">THE NATURE OF DARK MATTER</head><p>There is now incontrovertible observational evidence that the main mass component of the Universe is in the form of "dark matter" that interacts extremely weakly with atoms and photons.</p><p>In the standard paradigm, non-interacting dark matter controls the clustering of dark matter, making it a tractable computational problem in which the initial conditions and the evolution equations are known once the nature of dark matter has been specified. Simulations can then be contrasted with the observed galaxy clustering pattern to shed light onto the properties of dark matter. This has led to a scenario where dark matter takes the form of elementary particles that emerge from the early Universe with negligible thermal velocities and a scale-free distribution of Gaussian density fluctuations. Coupled with a "dark energy" field that governs the late expansion of the Universe, this "Cold Dark Matter" (ΛCDM) paradigm has now matured into a full theory without tunable parameters, from which detailed theoretical predictions are possible. These predictions have been successfully verified on large scales (&gt;1 Mpc), but the situation is far less clear on the scale of individual galaxies, where the ΛCDM model is challenged by a number of problems. The rotation curves of dwarf galaxies, for example, seem at face value inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halos predicted by cosmological simulations (Sections 3.1.1 and 7.6.2). Further, ΛCDM predicts a number of low-mass dark matter halos that far exceeds the observed number of faint galaxies (Section 3.1.2). Although some see these challenges as signaling the need to abandon the paradigm, others argue that observations can be accommodated within ΛCDM once the effects of baryons on the scale of dwarfs are properly included. This is a complex problem that is far from solved, and best approached by following multiple lines of enquiry. Despite its complexity, progress has been steady and breakthroughs seem within reach. TMT can play a key role in enabling these breakthroughs by placing definitive constraints on the mass profile of dwarf galaxies and enabling the detection of dark substructure in gravitationally lensed-systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Dwarf galaxy radial mass profiles</head><p>One of the most robust predictions of cosmological N-body simulations is that, in the absence of baryonic effects, CDM halos must have cuspy density profiles. Rotation curve studies of low surface brightness galaxies have hinted that the actual mass profile might be shallower than predicted by simulations, fostering a lively debate regarding the meaning of these results and their consistency with ΛCDM. One possibility is that baryons may transfer energy to the dark matter as dense star-forming regions dissolve, flattening the cusps and turning them into "cores" more easily reconciled with observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b516">Navarro et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Governato et al., 2010</ref>; reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b577">Pontzen and Governato 2014)</ref>. This mechanism, however, can only operate in galaxies where baryons are relatively important. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group (dSphs) have measured line-of-sight velocity dispersions that are much larger than would be inferred from their stellar content. It is believed that these are the most dark-matter-dominated galactic systems.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>Establishing the presence or absence of cusps/cores in dSphs is thus a direct test of one of the most distinctive predictions of the ΛCDM scenario. In addition to the cusp/core problem for the dSphs and the Ultra-Faint Dwarfs (UFD), there is evidence for lower central densities and smaller overall numbers of the largest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). This is the "Too big to Fail" problem. By measuring the distribution of dark matter in these nearby satellites, TMT will make a direct test of cosmology. The best constraints on dark matter profiles in these ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are presently those based on large samples of radial velocities, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">Figure 3</ref>.1. These analyses, however, suffer from the well-known degeneracies associated with the unknown stellar velocity anisotropy distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Binney &amp; Tremaine 1988)</ref>. If radial velocities alone are to be used greatly the increasing the sample of stars is essential to break the degeneracies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">Figure 3</ref>.2 shows how the error on the logarithmic slope of the mass profile, γ, will be reduced as a function of the number of stars in a kinematic sample. Existing and imminent spectrographs such as Subaru's PFS will be able to efficiently measure radial velocities of hundreds of stars in these dwarfs. However, obtaining &lt;5 km/s precision radial velocities for &gt;10,000 stars will require reaching the main sequence in these dwarf galaxies. For Draco, that means g~23 ( <ref type="bibr">Segali et al. 2007</ref>), which will be very challenging for telescopes in the pre-TMT era. Given the relatively small core radius of these dwarf galaxies (~6' for Draco), TMT/WFOS will be an efficient instrument, and should allow us to greatly improve the constraints on the innermost profile of these dwarf galaxy halos (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Hayashi &amp; Chiba, 2012)</ref> In addition to providing radial velocities for thousands of stars in multiple dwarf galaxies, TMT can also help to resolve the anisotropy degeneracies by providing proper motions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b689">Strigari et al. (2007)</ref> have shown that if proper motion data could be obtained with ~ 5 km/s accuracy for just a few hundred stars per galaxy, the accuracy of current kinematic studies would be increased five fold. This is within the reach of TMT's IRIS spectro-imaging near-infrared camera with the NFIRAOS adaptive optics system. Relative astrometric measurement with the Keck AO system already reach the ~150 µas level. IRIS is designed to obtain an accuracy of ~30 µas at comparable signal to noise ratio. Thus, the relative positions of two measurements relative to a reference can be determined to ~40 mas per star. Over a three-year baseline this corresponds to a kinematic accuracy per star of ~7 km/s. Doubling the time baseline would provide TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Furthermore, for red giants brighter than V=18, corresponding to a G magnitude of 17.6, the GAIA mission should yield relative astrometric accuracy of ~70 µas (based on their revised specifications). The Sculptor dwarf contains more than 100 such stars; by combining such a GAIA and TMT position measurement separated by ~10 years, proper motions with sufficient accuracy to distinguish cusp from core with a signal-to-noise ratio of four <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(Evslin 2015)</ref>. A further TMT position measurement, several years later, could be used to measure velocity changes and thus identify binary systems with periods of years. Such binaries can contaminate the velocity dispersions of ultrafaint dwarfs. The synergy with GAIA yields a competitive proper motion determination even in the case of the brighter but more distant Fornax dwarf, whose ecliptic latitude will provide it with more than twice the skyaveraged number of focal plane transits. The TMT will be able to definitively distinguish power-law cusps from constant density cores in many of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies.</p><p>Measuring accurate astrometry for stars covering the full tidal radius of the dwarf galaxies will not be easy, as it will require AO-assisted imaging (to get the astrometric precision) over a very large area. The tidal radius of Sculptor is nearly 75'. Even with short (10 second) exposures (sufficient to reach K=22), fully mapping the proper motions across the entire tidal radius will take some 800 hours (40 nights per epoch for two epochs) of telescope time, assuming 100% overhead for the dithering. Most other dwarfs are smaller on the sky, and their motions can be mapped with &lt;20 nights per dwarf of observing divided into two campaigns separated by multiple years. It will be important to observe both larger dSphs and UFDs, to control whether baryonic effects can affect the cuspiness of the mass profile ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b543">Onorbe et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Dark Matter Substructure</head><p>Simulations of galaxy formation using the ΛCDM under the standard model reveal that massive galaxy halos should be associated with large numbers of small subhalos ("substructure"). On these sub-galactic scales, however, there appears to be a large discrepancy between the theory and observations of satellite galaxies. Simulations predict that there should be thousands of substructures with masses between 4x10 6 and 4x10 9 solar masses, comprising 5-10% of the total halo mass within the virial radius (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b682">Springel et al. 2008</ref>). In contrast, observations of the Milky Way, where the most complete investigations of substructure have been conducted, have found many fewer satellites than predicted, leading to the well-known "missing satellites problem"on the TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Possible explanations for this discrepancy are (1) some type of astrophysical process (e.g., differences in star-formation efficiencies), (2) the Local Group is an outlier, or (3) we have an incomplete understanding of the nature of dark matter. To distinguish between these hypotheses requires a large sample of galaxies in which we can detect even non-luminous substructure. The combination of gravitational lensing with high-resolution observations by the TMT will provide exactly such a sample, and will do so via two independent techniques. Flux ratio anomalies in lensed AGN. The image configuration and predicted fluxes of lensed AGN is set by the smooth mass distribution in the main halo of the lensing galaxy. Deviations from the flux ratios predicted by the smooth mass models, i.e., flux ratio anomalies, are a sign of lumpiness in the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy. This lumpiness may be due to stars in TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

However, the microlensing can be avoided if the angular size of the lensed object is larger than the lensing scale of the stars, which happens if the lensed emission is coming from a region larger than the broad line region in the background AGN. A promising approach utilizes the narrow-line region, which is large enough to avoid microlensing. These observations require sensitive and high-resolution IFU observations, in order to obtain high-SNR spectroscopy of each of the lensed images that are typically separated by an arcsecond or less. This method was originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b504">Moustakas &amp; Metcalf (2003)</ref>, and has recently seen a successful application by <ref type="bibr" target="#b522">Nierenberg et al. (2014)</ref>. The large gains in both sensitivity and angular resolution provided by TMT will allow this procedure to be applied to a statistically significant sample of lens systems. Alternatively, the dusty torus that is seen in the mid-IR can also provide a measurement of flux ratios that is immune from microlensing and dust. Current observations of lensed QSOs have found closely separated images (~0.3"), too faint and difficult to resolve with existing 8m telescopes. JWST will be much more sensitive but its resolution will be significantly less than that of TMT. Diffraction-limited observations using the TMT will be essential to separate and distinguish these images, especially for the (expected) large number (100's) of small-separation lenses (&lt;0.3").</p><p>Gravitational imaging. Gravitational lensing plus sensitive high-resolution imaging provides a second path to quantifying the substructure mass function in distant galaxies. In the "gravitational imaging" technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">(Koopmans 2005</ref>) the targeted systems are not lensed AGN, but rather systems in which a background galaxy is lensed into a long arc or a ring by a massive foreground galaxy. In these systems, the radius and overall appearance of the arc is set by the smooth mass distribution in the lensing galaxy. However, the presence of dark-matter substructure can perturb the shape of the ring on small angular scales. These small astrometric perturbations to the lensed emission allow the presence of substructures to be deduced, even with no detectable luminous component. An excellent demonstration of this technique with ground-based instrumentation resulted from NIR AO observations with Keck. A 10 8 solar mass substructure in a z~0.9 galaxy was robustly detected in three independent data sets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b734">Vegetti et al. 2012</ref>). The substructure was detected at higher significance in the Keck AO data than in HST imaging of the same system, due to the higher angular resolution of the Keck observations, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">Figure 3</ref>.3. With its significant improvements compared to Keck in collecting area, angular resolution, and number of systems accessible with AO, the TMT will move this technique into the regime where interesting constraints can be placed on the substructure mass functions and, furthermore, will allow these parameters to be determined as functions of, e.g., galaxy mass, redshift, and other observables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Dark Matter self-interaction cross-section</head><p>Many dark matter experiments are dedicated to searching for couplings of the dark matter particle to the Standard Model and can be classified into direct detection dark matter experiments (e.g. CDMS, LUX, etc), colliders (LHC) and annihilation experiments (FERMI). If, however, dark matter does not couple (or does so extremely weakly) to the Standard Model these searches will only allow us to rule out parts of a parameter space. Astrophysical experiments, however, can probe interactions between two dark matter particles via their effects on the structures and dynamics of dark-matter halos.</p><p>Interacting clusters have proven very fruitful for constraining the nature of dark matter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Clowe et al. 2006</ref>). In clusters with recent strong merger activity, the positions of dark matter halos and the main baryonic component can become separated. The separation between the X-ray emitting gas and the dark matter provides a powerful upper limit on the DM self-interaction cross section. More recently, it has also been suggested ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Dawson et al. 2012</ref>) that the separation between the dark matter and the galaxies in interacting clusters can provide a lower limit to the self-interaction cross-section, σ m . This measurement is controversial and the significance depends on very accurate determination of the position of the weak lensing.</p></div>

However they leave a considerable room for improvement. The two main observational challenges to measure both gas-DM and galaxy-DM offsets are accurate measurements of the weak lensing centroid as well as accurate determination of cluster membership and hence galaxy centroid. Even more importantly, these studies all require detailed dynamical information of the system to be included in simulations, and only TMT can provide this for a large number of faint cluster members. Furthermore, because the weak lensing centroiding accuracy is a very strong function of the number density of lensed galaxies used, this measurement requires greater depth and resolution than even HST or JWST will provide, meaning that TMT will be required if the issue of a dark matter self-interaction cross-section is to be resolved.</p></div>

The power spectrum of density fluctuations is predicted by theory to have arisen from a "scale invariant" primordial spectrum that is a power law with near unity slope. Small deviations from this unity slope are expected and are related to the degree by which the Universe expanded during the period of inflation and hence to the physical properties of the fields that drove inflation. By measuring the distribution of matter over a wide range of scales, one can constrain both the slope and possible deviations with high precision. Measurement of the power spectrum on large scales is limited by "cosmic variance" (there is only one Universe) -the most precise measurements will necessarily come from measures on small physical scales.</p></div>

On large scales, the most sensitive sample to date is the one studied by the BOSS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">Lee et al. 2013b</ref>), which uses almost 55,000 quasars between 2.1&lt;z&lt;3.5. Power spectrum measurements (combined with CMB constraints from WMAP and Planck) have placed upper mass limits of 0.23eV for the sum of the masses of the standard model neutrinos (see <ref type="bibr">Abazajian et al., 2013</ref> for a discussion). Higher resolution and higher redshift observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Bolton et al. 2012</ref>) have placed the current lower limit of the warm dark matter mass scale m wm &gt;3.3 keV. With TMT, the number of QSOs in the correct redshift range will increase by about an order of magnitude.</p><p>Absorption line studies using quasars are fundamentally limited by their angular density. However, with TMT it will be possible to use the fainter but much more abundant "normal" galaxies. By using galaxies as probes instead of quasars, TMT will allow for the first time the study of the threedimensional distribution of diffuse hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, which is directly related to matter density, thereby increasing the precision of cosmological measurements by at least an order of magnitude over that possible with current telescopes. Here the distribution of matter is affected by complex physical processes, such as gas dynamics, star formation and feedback. TMT, using WFMOS and IRMS, will probe the distribution and composition of gas along the lines of sight to distant quasars and galaxies, providing unique high-quality data essential to an understanding of these processes. Understanding the acceleration of the universe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b607">Riess et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b565">, Perlmutter et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">, Eisenstein et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b743">, Vikhlinin et al. 2009</ref>) is arguably the greatest challenge facing cosmology. In Einstein's theory of gravity, an accelerating expansion requires that the average pressure throughout space be negative. Cosmological fluids with negative pressure are called dark energy (DE).

However ΛCDM on its own provides no explanation for the smallness of the cosmological constant relative to most scales in the theory. Observations to date are consistent with a cosmological constant but also with several distinct dark energy models. The most common way to describe any dark energy candidate is through its equation of state parameter í µí±¤ = p/ρ, ratio of its pressure (p) to its energy density (í µí¼). w=-­-1 is for cosmological constant and for anything other than this, dark energy evolves with time.</p><p>Constraining w and its variation with time is one of the main goals for all present and future cosmological observations including TMT.

Present bounds on the evolution of w are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">Figure 3</ref>.5.</p><p>Another approach to the late time acceleration is to modify the gravity at large cosmological scales without including any exotic component in the energy budget of the Universe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Dvali et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">, Freese et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">, De Felice &amp; Tsujikawa 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Amendola &amp; Tsujikawa 2010</ref>. Often these models are equivalent to dark energy models. TMT will constrain these models through the observational tests described below. Additional tests of GR involving Super Massive Black Holes are described in Section 6.1.1.</p><p>Measuring the properties of dark energy and testing alternate gravity theories is the goal of many experiments and observatories that will be operational at the same time as TMT (e.g. LSST, Euclid, WFIRST). These missions will carry out large-scale surveys in order to exploit popular dark energy diagnostics such as baryonic acoustic oscillations or cosmic shear. TMT can be a competitive probe of dark energy and modified gravity by focusing on diagnostics that require its unique combination of sensitivity and angular resolution, like the ones described below (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">Jain et al. 2013</ref>). By measuring the anisotropy in w 0 and w a (e.g with time delays), TMT may also be able to place competitive constraints on the speed of sound of the dark energy fluid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.6">Time-delay cosmography</head><p>Gravitational time delays between multiple images of lensed quasars have emerged as a powerful probe of dark energy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b695">Suyu et al., 2013;</ref>. A key requirement is the need to image the lensed host galaxy at sufficient resolution to chart the gravitational potential. In the next decade thousands of lensed quasars will be discovered and monitored by upcoming panoramic imaging surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b718">Treu et al., 2013a)</ref>, and high resolution adaptive optics imaging will be used to follow selected systems and thereby provide absolute distances to &lt;1% precision. Furthermore, high resolution spectroscopy is needed to measured the redshift of the lensed quasars and the redshift and internal kinematics of the deflector. The angular diameter of the gravitational lens systems is of order 3-4", well matched to the capabilities of IRIS. The method is particularly powerful when combined with microwave background and Type Ia supernovae experiments, as it breaks many of the residual degeneracies (e.g. between curvature and w). At the moment this method is limited by the small number of known suitable systems. However, more than an order of magnitude increase in the number of known lenses with time delays is expected with LSST <ref type="bibr" target="#b536">(Oguri &amp; Marshall 2010)</ref>. The LSST will also find strongly lensed type-Ia supernovae, for which we can directly measure the magnification factor to further constrain the gravitational potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b535">(Oguri &amp; Kawano 2003)</ref>, see also Section 9.1.1.

For the same lens, measuring the increase in lensing effect with source redshift provides a cosmographic measurement, whether the effect is weak lensing shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">(Jain &amp; Taylor 2003)</ref>, or the position of strong lensing arcs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">Golse et al. 2002)</ref>. In practice, the constraint increases very strongly with the number of arcs per cluster and the number of clusters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">Jullo et al. 2010)</ref>, as long as the large scale structure along the line of sight is known ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Dalal et al. 2004</ref>). Because many arcs are observed to have characteristic widths below 0.1", AO-based imaging is required to resolve them, and to separate them from the background sky. At the same time, spectroscopic measurements required to securely establish arc redshifts and to identify structure along the LOS require the aperture of a 30m-class telescope. For clusters with z&gt;0.5, the entire strongly lensed region spans a &lt;30" diameter region for all but the most massive clusters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b605">Richard et al. 2014</ref>), well-matched to the planned 34"x34" FOV of the IRIS imager. Based on the HST WFC3 imaging of the frontier fields, TMT will be able to observe up to hundreds of multiple images per cluster field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">Jauzac et al. 2014</ref>), and at a resolution (at 1µm) 5x that of ACS. For higher-redshift clusters, weak lensing tomography can be used to extend the measurements to &gt;300kpc, taking advantage of at least partial image correction over the entire AO-assisted FOV. In hierarchical cluster formation scenarios, formation of clusters of galaxies occurs late in cosmic time. Therefore, detection of high mass systems at early redshifts pose a sensitive constraint on cosmological models, and may point to primordial non-Gaussian forms or complex modifications of gravity. Because the mass function is so steep, the cosmological constraining power depends critically on the ability to measure the cluster mass. Clusters at z&gt;1.5 are unlikely to be virialized, and masses derived from scaling relations from the X-ray or optical richness are unlikely to be well-calibrated at that distance. The two techniques which might have promise in determining the mass of high-z clusters both require the unique capability of a 30-m class aperture with both wide-field spectroscopic and high resolution imaging capabilities. For weak lensing, the primary difficulties are measuring shapes for enough galaxies behind the clusters to adequately measure the shear, and having sufficiently accurate redshifts to remove the huge foreground contribution (both to the galaxies and the shear). For clusters at z&gt;&gt;1, this requires a combination of deep optical and infrared spectroscopy (for infall measurements and foreground structure determination) and AO imaging (for shape measurements and redshift measurement of small background galaxies).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.7.3">Cluster abundance and mass function: Calibrating the Mass-Observable Relations</head><p>Cosmological constraints from clusters also derive from the evolution of the cluster mass function as a whole between 0&lt;z&lt;1.5. Although the TMT is not a survey machine, and will not detect or measure masses for the majority of clusters for this measurement, it will play a critical role in many of the steps in the calibration of the mass measurements. For example, the contribution to the uncertainty in the calibration of the mass-temperature relation that arises from uncertainty in assigning photometric redshifts for galaxies behind clusters of different redshift is already comparable to the statistical errors. This uncertainty is expected to dominate the error in the era of large surveys such as eRosita, EUCLID, and LSST. Second, measurement of the relationship between the shear and the mass observable at fixed redshift requires accurate mass measurement. Defining a "golden set" of clusters with very accurate lensing measurements and especially with a dense and reliable set of redshift measurements will be key in deriving cosmological constraints from the evolution of the mass function. The angular sizes of the cluster cores are well-matched to the FOV of the AO system. However, efficient measurement of sufficient redshifts may require a second generation instrument with higher multiplexing or the use of multiple rotated grism exposures.</p></div>

In principle, one can modify GR so that it mimics a cosmological background expansion history similar to that in the ΛCDM model (GR plus vacuum energy as dark energy). This will automatically change the structure growth on all other scales, including the galactic, and even sub-galactic scales, which could violate the stringent solar system confirmation of GR. However, there are screening mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b362">(Khoury &amp; Weltman 2004</ref>) in which the additional degrees of freedom (scalar fields) could be shielded to evade the solar system tests. The screening reduces the signal of modified gravity (MG) on (sub-) galactic scales, Therefore the high angular resolution and sensitivity of TMT makes it ideally suited to carry out this kind of tests. For example, in modified theories, the dynamical mass and lensing mass of the same object are in general different, unlike those in GR. Based on a high-resolution N-body simulation of a f(R) model (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 1</ref> in Zhao, <ref type="bibr">Li &amp; Koyama 2011a)</ref>, it is found that the fractional difference between dynamical and lensing masses (denoted by D M ) depends on the local environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b788">(Zhao, et al. 2011b</ref>).</p><p>Observationally, the lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies can be measured by TMT using strong lensing and velocity dispersions measurements (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b634">Schwab et al. 2010)</ref>. Once this is done, one can similarly subdivide the samples using their lensing mass and local environment indicator, then contrast the fractional mass difference D M of isolated low mass galaxies to those clustered massive galaxies.

The redshift of a source is thus a measure of its distance, and the epoch at which the light was emitted. The frontier for spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies is currently at a redshift of 7.5, when the Universe was roughly 700 million years old, and plausible candidates have been identified as far back as z = 11, but have not yet been confirmed.</p><p>The motivation for finding and studying the most distant galaxies is three-fold. Firstly, astronomers are inspired to undertake a census of the first galaxies seen in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang. This curiosity for exploration is fundamental to science and has driven astronomy to major discoveries in the past; it also excites great public interest. Secondly, and more fundamentally, hydrogen in intergalactic space is ionized by a redshift of about 6, whereas it was fully neutral soon after the time the microwave radiation emerged. At some point there was a landmark event called cosmic reionization, akin to a phase transition in the intergalactic medium (IGM), when hydrogen became ionized. Most astronomers suspect this event was closely related to the birth of the first galactic systems that released copious amounts of ionizing ultraviolet photons. Prior to reionization, hydrogen was still in atomic form and the Universe was devoid of any light emitting celestial sources -a period commonly termed the Dark Ages. Pinpointing when and how the Dark Ages ended, and finding the sources responsible for cosmic reionization is necessary to complete the story of galaxy evolution. Thirdly, the physical processes which accelerate or inhibit the cooling and collapse of hydrogen gas clouds into young galaxies at these early times provide the seeds from which later, more massive, galaxies such as our own Milky Way assembled. Although theory makes predictions of how these early systems grew and evolved, it is currently not directly tested by observations.</p></div>

As gravity inexorably forces larger hydrogen clouds to cool and collapse, low mass galaxies will begin to shine. Calculations taking into account the transfer of UV radiation from these early galaxies through the IGM suggest that "bubbles" of ionized gas will develop around each prominent source. The bubbles will enlarge and eventually overlap, completing the process of cosmic reionization.</p><p>When might this have occurred? The patterns of temperature and polarization signals from microwave background photons detected by the WMAP and Planck satellites suggest that the free electrons responsible reside in ionized gas in the redshift range 8 to <ref type="bibr">20 (Ade et al. 2014a</ref>). Thus it is quite likely there will be an abundance of energetic, UV-luminous, star-forming sources in this interval that are responsible for this reionization. However, it is not yet known if reionization was an instantaneous or protracted event, or whether the ionizing radiation comes from a highly abundant distribution of feeble sources, or a rarer population of brighter, more massive galaxies. Some cosmologists suspect there may also be ionizing contributions from black holes or decaying particles (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b572">Pierpaoli 2004</ref>).

Verifying the existence of chemically primordial galaxies and determining their redshift distribution would represent a major new constraint on the first stages of galaxy formation.</p><p>The hydrogen Lyα line at 1216 Å is a characteristic signature of photoionization by massive stars, and is commonly observed in spectra of star-forming galaxies at z &lt; 6.5. As much as 8% of the light of a metal-poor young galaxy can emerge in the form of Lyα, which has traditionally made it an effective tool for measuring galaxy redshifts. However Lyα is a resonance line, and is easily scattered as the IGM becomes more neutral in the early universe. The presence and strength of Lyα will depend on the size and geometry of local ionization bubbles around young galaxies that may allow Lyα photons to escape. Recent observations suggest that the fraction of Lyα-emitting galaxies drops from z~6 to 7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b563">Pentericci et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b541">, Ono et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b629">, Schenker et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b719">, Treu et al. 2013b</ref>).

Only a handful of secure Lyα lines have been detected so far at 7 &lt; z &lt; 7.6, and none (yet) at z &gt; 8. The disappearance of Lyα is presumed to be due to the increasing neutrality of the IGM at higher redshifts. It may be that Lyα is only detectable under rare circumstances at z &gt; 8, perhaps in compact galaxy overdensities where ionization bubbles overlap, or in merging systems where peculiar motions aid the escape of Lyα photons.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>For very young galaxies, the harder photo-ionizing spectrum from metal-poor stars should excite higher-ionization UV emission lines that are not ordinarily seen in more evolved systems. Recent observations of gravitationally lensed dwarf galaxies at redshifts 2 to 3, which may be close analogs to the galaxy population at z &gt; 7 in terms of mass and metallicity, have detected moderately strong high-ionization metal lines such as CIII] 1909 Å, OIII] 1663 Å, and CIV 1549 Å, with equivalent widths as high as 15 Å ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b684">Stark et al. 2014</ref>). In principle, these UV metal lines can be detected out to z~14 with TMT, whose infrared spectrographs IRMS and IRIS will be more sensitive than JWST/NIRSPEC to faint, narrow line emission in compact galaxies. These high-ionization metal lines are a very promising tool for studying young star-forming galaxies, given recent evidence from ALMA that the ordinarily strong low-ionization <ref type="bibr">[CII]</ref> 158 µm line can be extremely weak in galaxies at z ≈ 7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b547">Ouchi et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>For truly primordial galaxies, without metals, the last resort is observing the HeII emission line at 1640 Å (the equivalent of Hα, for ionized helium). Model atmosphere calculations by Schaerer (2002, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.2) suggest this helium line could emit up to ~0.8% of the luminosity of a metal-poor young galaxy. Although the signal of HeII is weak, TMT would be able to see this line in galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. Assuming the sources are physically small, there will be a significant signal-to-noise advantage over JWST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Detecting the sources of reionization</head><p>In the course of early galaxy formation, high-mass stars produce abundant UV photons that are believed to have been primarily responsible for cosmic reionization. Once reionization proceeds, the UV background radiation heats gas so as to suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. Thus, early galaxy formation leads to reionization, initiating a "negative feedback loop" that actually delays the subsequent stellar mass build-up of the lowest mass systems. . Thus, early galaxies and cosmic reionization would have a profound effect on the more recent history of galaxy formation. At the end of the reionization era, at z ≈ 6, galaxies that are directly detected in deep Hubble Space Telescope observations, with M UV ~&lt;-18, appear to be sufficiently luminous and abundant to maintain the ionization of the IGM, provided that a substantial fraction (~30%) of the H-ionizing photons emitted by massive stars escapes the galaxies in which the stars are forming (the so-called``called``escape</p></div>

Recent observations suggest that the slope of the galaxy UV luminosity function steepens significantly between z~4 and z~7-8, where its slope is (at observed magnitudes) approaches that expected for the dark matter halo mass function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Bouwens et al. 2014</ref>). The validity of extrapolations of the luminosity function to unobserved faint magnitudes is currently untested.</p><p>According to current theoretical models, the abundance of very faint galaxies is determined by the radiative cooling efficiency of gas within low-mass dark matter halos, which is extremely sensitive to the metallicity of the gas and (for truly zero-metallicity gas) by molecular hydrogen cooling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">Jaacks et al. 2013</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 4.</ref>3). Moreover, the abundance of faint galaxies also depends on the effects of poorly-understood feedback processes (such as supernovae) on subsequent star formation activity in the same regions. In short, the abundance of faint galaxies encodes the essential physics of star-formation and feedback in low mass dark matter halos.</p><p>Cosmic reionization models suggest that galaxies in the range M UV ~ -13 to -18 produce more hydrogen ionizing photons than the luminous (~M UV *) galaxies at z &gt; 7. However, the abundance of such faint galaxies is essentially unknown and unexplored even with the deepest data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Ellis et al. 2013</ref>). The on-going Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) initiative exploits gravitational lensing to search for still fainter galaxies behind six massive galaxy clusters. Scaling from the first HFF results, we may expect that the full HFF data set will identify a total of ~20 faint galaxies at z~6-10, typically down to M UV ~ -16, and typically magnified by a factor of ~10 ( <ref type="bibr">Ishigaki et al. 2014</ref>). Although this is an important step for exploring the high-z faint galaxy population, the HFF galaxy sample may be too small for robust statistical constraints on the faint end of the high-z luminosity function, and there may be lingering uncertainties on magnification factors that depend on mass models of the lensing clusters. Moreover, the Hubble imaging data alone do not provide spectroscopic information needed to evaluate the metal abundance, ionization state, or velocity fields in this important early galaxy population.</p><p>If, as expected, the very faint galaxies responsible for reionization are compact, then diffractionlimited observations with TMT will detect galaxies an order of magnitude fainter than those seen in the HFFs or that will be seen by JWST whilst allowing previously unstudied structures within the lensed galaxies to be resolved. An imaging campaign with TMT IRIS will unambiguously determine the abundance of high-z faint galaxies. Moreover, the combination of sensitivity and angular resolution of TMT/IRIS and IRMOS will permit detailed spectroscopic studies of metal enrichment and outflow processes of these key sources.</p></div>

With its large aperture and fast response time for target of opportunity observations, TMT will be able to obtain high-S/N spectra of faint GRBs out to very high redshifts. Nearly all of the information at these redshifts must come from Lyα damping profiles and metal lines longward of Lyα.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>As described in Section 4.1.1, recent observations suggest that Lyα damping wing absorption due to a substantially neutral IGM suppresses Lyα emission from galaxies at z~8 and beyond. However, galaxies are also useful for probing the later progress of cosmic reionization history at z &lt; 8, especially for investigating the topology of ionized bubbles in the late stages of reionization. Although neutral hydrogen in the IGM reduces the visibility of Lyα emission from distant sources, it also affects the line profile in a manner that is well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b495">(Miralda-Escude 1998)</ref>. Accurate observed line profiles as a function of environment and redshift can thus constrain the neutrality of the IGM, although present studies cannot discern the subtle differences in Lyα damping wing profiles expected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b546">Ouchi et al. 2010</ref>). The measurements are challenging because of the need for high spectral resolution for individual sources, as well as the requirement to probe very faint, low-mass systems in low-density regions, where Lyα damping wing absorption would be prominent as a result of patchy reionization. Once a large number of high redshift Lyα line emitters are located, e.g., by the on-going deep narrowband survey of Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, more detailed TMT spectroscopic follow-up studies will become practical.

The relationship between JWST and TMT will be somewhat different, although just as important. Both TMT and JWST have impressive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. JWST has the advantage of a reduced near-infrared background in space, and its sensitivity at wavelengths longer than 2.5 microns provides sensitivity to galaxies at redshifts beyond 20. However, TMT has a much larger collecting area than JWST, and superior angular resolution (a factor of 5 higher) with AO-fed instruments, offering greater sensitivity for physically small, faint galaxies. TMT can resolve and study finer structures in galaxies than is possible with JWST. Unlike HST, JWST will offer sensitive TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

To overcome this problem one can use galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes that, similar to ordinary glass lenses, magnify objects behind them. These cosmic telescopes allow us to find and study a unique set of faint, high-redshift galaxies, achieving an order-of-magnitude gain in sensitivity and spatial resolution over blank-field surveys. In addition, the detected sources behind a cluster lens are magnified in apparent size, allowing us to probe order of magnitude smaller physical scales. Several large campaigns are now underway to take advantage of this, particularly CLASH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b578">Postman et al. 2012</ref>) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF). The first results from these surveys are extremely encouraging. Not only did they deliver the current record holder in redshift space (z=10.7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Coe et al. 2013</ref>, (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.7), these observations allow us to push the intrinsic luminosity limits further than the UDF and study properties representative galaxies at z ~ 7 and 8.

Both of these galaxies are lensed by a foreground cluster (A1703 and the Bullet Cluster, respectively), confirming the power of cosmic telescopes. Increasing the sample size is crucial, because with measurements of the equivalent-width (EW) distribution in Lyα Emitters (LAEs) we can distinguish between effects of ISM dust and neutral IGM and study the epoch of reionization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b717">Treu et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Treu et al. , 2013</ref>.

The main missing observational ingredient is a measurement of the EW distribution for both luminous and sub-L* galaxies at the redshifts of reionization. Cosmic telescopes allow us to probe the sub-L* regime particularly efficiently. However, despite the magnification, spectroscopic redshifts have been measured for only a handful of sources close to the reionization epoch. As discussed earlier (Section 4.1.1), Lyα may be disappearing due to the increasing opacity of the intergalactic medium at z &gt; 6.

However, there remain many unanswered questions about how the observable universe of galaxies is related to the growth of the underlying distribution of dark matter; most of this uncertainty relates to our poor understanding of the complex baryonic processes that must be included in any successful theory of galaxy formation: gas cooling, star formation, feedback, merging. Understanding how these processes operate on galaxy scales is an inherently multi-wavelength observational problem that is limited at present by the sensitivity of our tools for extracting detailed physical information, for both stars and gas, as a function of cosmic time.</p><p>Figure 5.1: Current census of the integrated star formation rate per unit co-moving volume since redshift z ~ 8..

Physical understanding of galaxy formation has been limited by the observational difficulties in studying the detailed physical processes acting on high redshift galaxies, due both to their faintness and their small angular sizes. Through the recent advent of IFU (integral field unit spectroscopy) and adaptive optics (AO) systems on ground-based 8-10m class telescopes, however, we are just now beginning to witness the relevant processes in situ by resolving galaxies both spatially and kinematically; at present, however, such studies are limited to the brightest examples. TMT, with its huge light gathering power coupled with diffraction-limited angular resolution, will revolutionize our understanding of the structure of forming galaxies throughout the peak epoch of galaxy formation.</p><p>During this "peak epoch of galaxy formation", most of the baryons in the Universe actually reside outside of galaxies, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circum-galactic medium (CGM). The IGM/CGM is thus a vast reservoir of normal material acting as both a source of gas to fuel galaxy formation, and a ``sink'' of the waste products of that process. The structure of the IGM/CGM is increasingly modified by the energetic processes occurring in forming galaxies, and thereby acts as a laboratory where the most sensitive measurements of the physics of the galaxy formation process may be made. For these reasons, understanding galaxy formation in the Universe requires measurements of all material, both inside and outside of galaxies. Fortuitously, observational access to both galaxies and the IGM during this crucial epoch is excellent for large-aperture telescopes placed at the very best terrestrial sites.</p><p>TMT will thus play a fundamental role in providing the detailed physical measurements necessary to understand the development of present day galaxies. TMT will provide rest-frame UV spectra of unprecedented sensitivity and depth: WFOS and HROS will together provide exquisite information on the physics of gas associated with forming galaxies and the IGM using the rich rest-frame far-UV transitions made observable from the ground by the redshift of the sources. IRIS, IRMS, and IRMOS, all taking advantage of the diffraction-limited capabilities of TMT in the near-IR, will provide spectra of extremely high sensitivity and spatial resolution, allowing the first detailed studies of galaxy structure, dynamics, and chemistry while they are in the process of forming the bulk of their stars. The near-IR observations with TMT will enable studies of distant galaxies, as they are growing, using the same well-calibrated rest-frame optical diagnostic spectral features of both stars and gas, that have been established by decades of research on nearby galaxies.</p></div>

A universal peak in overall star-formation and black hole accretion, as observed, is not necessarily expected. Neither is the observation that the most massive known galaxies appear to finish forming their stars earliest, nor that typical galaxies at redshifts z ~ 1 -3 appear to be forming stars at rates that are 10 -100 times higher than for typical galaxies in the local universe. The symbiotic relationship between the formation of galaxy spheroids and central black holes also does not follow directly from a cosmological framework alone. The complexity of galaxy formation requires following the behavior of dark matter and the astrophysics of star formation, feedback of energy, accretion and expulsion of gas, and effects of environment. Paradoxically, the former task is easier, even if we know very little of the properties of the precise nature of dark matter, because the physics of baryons are much more complex to model in a cosmological context. To make progress, observations of the baryonic component (both gas and stars) must inform theoretical developments with substantially better precision than possible today.</p><p>Among the key remaining unanswered questions in galaxy formation are:</p><p>• How does the distribution of dark matter relate to the luminous stars and gas that we see?</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

The combination of WFOS, IRIS, IRMS, and (later) IRMOS and HROS mounted on TMT provide a near ideal instrument suite for attacking the problem of structure formation in the distant universe. Across a wide wavelength range (0.3 -2.4 µm), TMT complements or exceeds the spectroscopic capability of JWST while providing higher spatial resolution. In combination with ALMA, which tracks thermal emission from dust and provides information on the molecular gas content and kinematics of galaxies at similar spatial resolution, TMT +AO will be a powerful tool for tracking the process of the galaxy formation during the most active period in the history of the Universe.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">How does the distribution of dark matter relate to the luminous stars and gas we see?</head><p>In the present day Universe, the distribution of galaxy stellar masses (M*) --the "stellar mass function"--of galaxies appears to have a different shape from that of the theoretically expected distribution of dark matter halo masses. Galaxies with small M* have a much "flatter" distribution than (i.e., fewer galaxies with lower M*) than expected if galaxies formed with the same ratio of stellar-todark matter at all masses. At high M*, the stellar mass function drops exponentially with increasing halo mass, following the Schechter function (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Cole et al. 2001</ref>). This behavior, where galaxy formation appears to be less efficient at low-and high-M*, is almost universally ascribed to "feedback"; the qualitative picture advocated by the majority at present is that is ionizing photons, energy, and momentum produced by massive star formation and supernovae are the dominant effects for lower-M* galaxies, while AGN (i.e., energy/momentum produced by accreting supermassive black holes) play the dominant role at the high-M* end of the galaxy mass function.</p><p>While the need for feedback is universally recognized for any viable galaxy formation model, it is fair to say that we do not yet understand how, when, and where it operates, nor which of the many physical processes dominates at a given time in a given galaxy. Making progress will require observations sensitive to the details of all of the relevant physical processes, in a range of galaxy masses and over a range of cosmic times. These observations, at a minimum, must include measurement of AGN activity, massive star formation, stellar content, and gas-phase physical conditions both inside forming galaxies and in the surrounding IGM/CGM.

The effect of these mechanisms (e.g., gas inflows, outflows, galaxy mergers) is imprinted on the star-formation histories of galaxies. From the theoretical side, hydrodynamical simulations suggest that galaxies living in relatively massive halos at intermediate redshifts accumulate most of their gas through relatively smooth accretion, rather than through major mergers, resulting in star-formation histories that can be well-approximated as smoothly varying functions, typically as exponentially declining or rising, or constant (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Noeske et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b598">Reddy et al. 2012</ref>). Clustering studies and cosmological simulations suggest that starformation histories may be more stochastic at lower stellar masses (≤10 9 M ¤ ) at higher redshifts (z&gt;1.5). The effect is that outflows in these faint galaxies may be enhanced by short bursts of star formation, and thus responsible for a majority of the globally-averaged metal enrichment of the IGM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b544">Oppenheimer et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>A promising method to deduce the level of stochasticity is to use probes that are sensitive to star formation on different timescales, such as UV continuum and Hα emission. Measuring these tracers for very faint and low mass galaxies will become routine with TMTs WFOS and IRMS instruments, and can be used for detailed studies of the "burstiness" of star formation in low mass galaxies. Combined with information from WFOS (and eventually HROS) on the CGM/IGM occupied by these objects will lead to a complete picture of IGM chemical enrichment from the outflows of faint galaxies. Further constraints on the stellar populations will come from the modeling of high-resolution spectra (e.g., from WFOS and HROS) of the stellar emission/absorption features in the rest-UV, giving detailed information on the massive star populations and the impact of binarity and mass loss on the effective temperatures, ionizing parameters, Lyman continuum escape fractions, and recombination line strengths in HII regions. Similarly, rest-optical spectroscopy of the Balmer absorption lines, Ca HK, MgB, and Fe lines will yield constraints on the star-formation history from both overall metal enrichment and measurement of metallicity ratios <ref type="bibr">[α/Fe]</ref>.</p><p>Critical to observations of high-redshift galaxies is the degree to which stellar light is obscured by dust. Local prescriptions for dust corrections appear to work reasonably well on average for ~L* galaxies at z~2, but there are subsets of galaxies (e.g., the youngest galaxies, and the dustiest galaxies) where such relations break down (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b597">Reddy et al. 2010)</ref>. At redshifts of ~5, there is evidence that the attenuation curve in typical Lyman-break galaxies may be more consistent with that found in present-day low metallicity galaxies, like the Small Magellanic Cloud ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b654">Shim et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Capak et al 2015)</ref>. WFOS and IRMS will enable detailed studies of the shape of the attenuation curve, potentially for individual galaxies where the intrinsic spectrum revealed through dust-free lines of sight can be spatially resolved from the dustier regions of the galaxies. The measurement of multiple Balmer line ratios (Hα/Hβ, Hβ/Hγ, Hγ/Hδ) will constrain the shape of the nebular reddening curve in individual galaxies. Together, the stellar and nebular reddening curves can be used to obtain more robust constraints on the stellar masses, ages, reddening, and star-formation rates of galaxies, as well as better understanding of the impact of nebular line emission on the stellar population modeling from photometry alone.</p><p>Aside from a better understanding of the effects of dust obscuration, dust in the gaseous phase (i.e., the metallicity) can be used as another probe of star-formation history and chemical evolution. Gasphase metallicities measured with rest-optical emission lines, in concert with galaxy stellar masses and star-formation rates, provide important empirical constraints on the effect of galactic winds (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Davé et al. 2012</ref>) on the chemical evolution of galaxies.

At the same time most cosmological simulations suggest that, at z &gt;2, high mass galaxies can maintain high star formation rates over long timescales from continuous accretion of cool gas from the IGM (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Kerez et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Dekel et al. 2009</ref>), while at lower redshift both the accretion rate and the physical state of accreted gas changes at fixed stellar mass, leading to a dwindling of the gas supply available for star formation. While direct evidence that "quenching" of high mass galaxies must occur is plentiful, the processes physically responsible for it have not been clearly identified. At present, it seems that quenching depends on both galaxy mass and larger-scale environment (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b562">Peng et al. 2012</ref>, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.3.</p><p>At z&gt;2 the population of galaxies in which star formation has ceased (i.e., they have becomè`passivebecomè`passive'') is dominated by those having very compact morphologies and large stellar masses (M ★ &gt;10 11 M☉), suggesting that these systems are the first to quench and pointing to very high density of gas and stars as conditions conducive to effective "mass" quenching ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Bell et al. 2012</ref>).

Recent observations of low metallicity dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way's neighborhood further argue in favor of an IMF which is "bottom-light" i.e. showing an underabundance of stars between 0.5-0.7 M ¤ compared to a Salpeter IMF. Is there a metallicity dependence to the IMF? Does a top-heavy IMF in the first galaxies provide the intermediate mass seed black holes for the formation of quasars?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.6">The Census of Baryons and the Baryon Cycle</head><p>Most baryonic matter, particularly during the early history of the Universe, is actually outside of galaxies. Intergalactic space is filled with a tenuous gas that provides "fuel" for forming galaxies, and is a repository for material expelled by galaxies by energetic processes such as supernova explosions and accretion-powered AGN activity. The interplay between the galaxies and the intergalactic medium is of prime importance for understanding the history of normal matter in the Universe, the process of galaxy formation, and the effects of the "feedback" of energy produced by forming galaxies. A number of studies have found the ubiquitous presence of galaxy-scale outflows at high redshift, and the direct correspondence between HI and metal absorption systems in the inter-galactic medium (as probed by background quasars) and galaxies in the same volumes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b569">Pettini et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Adelberger et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b687">, Steidel et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b615">, Rudie et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hennawi &amp; Prochaska 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b725">Turner et al 2015)</ref>. The imprint of such galaxy flows can be seen most readily in the rest-UV, where the naturally dark terrestrial background in the optical (defined for the present purposes as 0.31 -1µm) makes spectroscopy of faint objects feasible for at least the brightest examples with 8 -10m telescopes. As illustrated earlier in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.2 the rest-UV spectra of galaxies contain a vast amount of information because of the very large number of ground-state transitions of astrophysically abundant ions at these wavelengths, including hydrogen Lyα, CII, CIII, CIV, NI, NV, OI, OVI, SiII, SiIII, SiIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, to name a small subset. The offsets between lines arising from the nebular regions (e.g., HeII in the rest-UV, or <ref type="bibr">[OII]</ref>/ <ref type="bibr">[OIII]</ref> and Balmer lines in the rest-optical), and those arising from the ISM allow for direct measurements of galaxy-scale outflow velocities, along with a host of other physical information including the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass end, stellar chemical abundances, and the chemistry of the interstellar gas, and the kinematics of gas motions within the galaxy. Currently, these details can be ascertained with spectral stacks or for individual bright lensed LBGs (e.g., cB58; <ref type="bibr" target="#b569">Pettini et al. 2002)</ref>.   <ref type="bibr">April 29, 2015</ref> Fortunately, spectra of the quality and diagnostic power of the cB58 spectrum will be within reach for relatively typical ~L* galaxies using TMT/WFOS, while obtaining spectra of high quality but lower resolution will be possible for objects significantly fainter than L* even at z ~ 6 with modest ~1 hour integration times -the gain in sensitivity over current 8m telescopes for spectroscopy over the 0.31 -1 µm wavelength range will be a factor of at least 14. The sensitivity gain will bring intrinsically faint galaxies during the epoch of galaxy formation within spectroscopic reach for the first time, and will vastly increase the fraction of the high redshift populations for which extremely high quality spectra will be achievable, and where gas inflows and outflows can be measured in detail.</p><p>Using IRMS, it will be practical to obtain nebular spectra of hundreds of high redshift objects within a survey region, where every spectrum will be of high enough quality to measure velocity dispersion, chemical abundance, star formation rate, stellar excitation, and characteristic electron density -and to evaluate whether or not active AGN are present--for galaxies at the limits of current imaging surveys.</p><p>Near-IR IFU spectroscopy will also be essential for finding evidence of outflows induced by AGN winds and jets, that are thought to provide a crucial role in preventing runaway star formation in the most massive galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Fabian 2012)</ref>. Current 8-m class telescopes are only capable in finding such outflows in rare, highly-luminous AGN at z~0.5-2 where these feedback effects are most important (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Cano-Diaz et al. 2012</ref>). TMT will be able to observe these outflows on smaller spatial scales, and in more typical, less luminous AGN. Together with ALMA observations of the corresponding molecular outflows, and sensitive VLA observations of the synchrotron emission from jets and outflows (even in traditionally "radio quiet" AGN), we can build up a complete picture of the nature and energetics of AGN feedback. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.5: Gallery of images of galaxies between redshift 1.4 and 3, from the HST CANDELS survey (ACS F814W/ WFC3/IR F125W / WFC3/IR F160W, ~4.5" x 4.5"; <ref type="bibr">Grogin et al.2011 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b372">Koekemoer et al. 2011.</ref> Galaxies at this epoch have diverse morphologies, including highly compact objects, dust-enshrouded disks, and highly disturbed merger candidates.

Observations of these galaxies will exploit both the light gathering power and the unique angular and spectral resolution at near-IR wavelengths provided by TMT. Large samples of galaxies throughout the redshift range z = 1 -6 are already known, and HST, JWST, and the current generation of 8 -10m telescopes will help us learn a great deal more in the coming decade. However, spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing differences in chemistry, kinematics, and physical conditions to be mapped as a function of spatial position within the galaxies, is required to go beyond measurements of crude global properties, and thereby gain fresh understanding into the physics of galaxy formation.</p><p>Galaxies at z = 1 -5 exhibit a variety of structures in the high spatial resolution images such as those recorded in the near-IR (H band) with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.5). Massive galaxies with low star-formation rates typically appear compact and smooth at these times, with sizes significantly smaller than local early type galaxies. Star-forming galaxies have a wide diversity of spatial structures, from the blue compact analogues to the quenched compact galaxies, to dusty disk-dominated systems, to highly irregular, clumpy and/or diffuse systems. Interpreting the physics underlying these varied morphologies is particularly challenging in the early universe, when frequent galaxy mergers, high gas accretion rates, and dynamically unstable disks are predicted. A key question for TMT will be to understand how the structures of distant galaxies are connected to their assembly and star-formation histories.</p><p>To maintain the typical high star formation rates of ~100 M ¤ /yr observed in these galaxies without a major merger event requires rapid and semi-continuous replenishment of gas, which favors smooth accretion mechanisms such as through "cold flows" or rapid series of minor mergers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Dekel et al. 2009</ref>). Some numerical simulations predict that the gas rich heavy disks are fragmented to several clumps due to gravitational instabilities and that gas and stars in the clumps are then migrated to the center of galaxies, and they merge together and form a bulge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">Hopkins et al. 2012</ref>). Despite of the effort to constrain the origin and evolution of the z~2 massive disk galaxies by numerical simulations, these evolution scenario have not been observationally confirmed yet. To put constraint on the scenarios of galaxy assembly, it is essential to obtain the spatial distributions of stellar mass and on-going star formation activities, since past/on-going dynamical processes must be imprinted/visible in the stellar populations. Current studies with 8-10m telescopes are limited to bright, thus massive or highly star-forming galaxies, and they need to be expanded to much wider domain of the SFR-M* diagram. The key question here is how the internal structures or physical processes depend on the location in the SFR-M* diagram, namely sSFR (burstiness) and stellar mass. In particular, we can investigate whether the compactness of star forming regions is related to the mode of star formation (burstiness/dustiness), and whether smaller galaxies undergo different formation processes from massive galaxies related to the down-sizing effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Cowie et al. 1996</ref>). Moreover, the internal properties should also be investigated as a function of environment (such as the number density of galaxies), as some environmental impacts must also be imprinted in the spatial distribution of stellar populations, such as a centralized starburst driven by ample gas inflow during galaxy-galaxy mergers, for example.</p><p>To truly understand the physics of galaxy assembly and structure, it is essential to have maximum information about the velocity field of the gas and stars within it. As in the local universe, the most sensitive measures of galaxy kinematics come from measurements of the narrow nebular emission lines such as those illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.6. These lines, whose diagnostic power has been calibrated through decades of work in the local universe at rest-frame optical wavelengths, also provide information on chemistry, density, and excitation in the regions where stars are forming. Integral-field spectroscopy can be used to obtain spectral and spatial information over contiguous regions simultaneously. Initial attempts using AO-equipped 8m-class telescopes and IFU spectroscopy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">Genzel et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b401">Law et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b402">Law et al. , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Forster Schreiber et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b773">Wright et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b339">Jones et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b341">Jones et al. , 2013</ref> to observe galaxies at z &gt; 2 have shown the promise, but TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Stellar bars thus serve as important signposts for measuring maturity of disks.</p><p>Using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck, a precise measurement of the rate of assembly for L* and brighter disk galaxies on to the Hubble sequence has been demonstrated (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure  5</ref>.11, <ref type="bibr" target="#b651">Sheth et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b652">Sheth et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Cameron et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b387">Kraljic et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b483">Melvin et al. 2014</ref>). These studies have found that the decline in the bar fraction is not uniform across all galaxy types and the largest rate of evolution is seen in the low mass galaxies (M* &lt; 10 10.5 M ¤ ), while redder, bulge-dominated massive disks are already in place 7 Gyr ago.</p><p>A combination of JWST and TMT will allow us to extend this type of research in three important areas: disk-wide stellar velocity dispersion measurements for L* disks at z &lt; 1, study of the bar fraction and disk stability for lower luminosity 1/10th L* disks at z &lt; 1, and study of the assembly of massive disks from z ~ 1-3 using bars as a signpost for disk maturity using rest-frame optical light.</p><p>The TMT will allow us to finally measure the stellar velocity dispersion across L* and brighter disks to z ~ 1. Analysis of the gas velocity dispersion from 0 &lt; z &lt; 1 from the DEEP2 Keck/DEIMOS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b520">Newman et al. 2013</ref>) showed that a small fraction of L* disk galaxies may be offset from the stellar Tully-Fisher relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b355">Kassin et al. 2007</ref>), but deeper observations have countered that this is a spurious result ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b491">Miller et al. 2011</ref>). In any case, study of galactic structures in these high-redshift disks has revealed that stellar bars are only present in disks that are on the T-F (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5.</ref>11; <ref type="bibr" target="#b653">Sheth et al. 2012</ref>). In other words, bars form only rotationally supported and dynamically cold disks, as in the nearby Universe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Courteau et al. 2003</ref>), but not all rotationally supported and dynamically cold disks have a bar.

Another exciting capability of the TMT is to provide two-dimensional gas kinematics in individual galaxies at sub-kpc resolution to ascertain the gas inflows by stellar structures like bars and spiral arms. These studies will allow us to constrain how quickly the gas being funneled to the galaxy centers, how that impacts central starburst and AGN activity and the build up of bulges.

As a result we will be able to trace in detail the sub-L* disk population.

Studies of high-redshift galaxies, particularly since the peak of cosmic history at z ~ 2, diverge on the evolution of galaxy-pair fractions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">Kartaltepe et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b423">Lotz et al. 2008</ref>) and the dominance of mergers in fueling nuclear starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">Kocevski et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Comerford et al. 2009</ref>).

Indeed, the observed scaling relations of the masses and kinematic properties of galactic bulges with their central supermassive black holes (SMBH) are prime examples of such an effect: M BH -M bulge <ref type="bibr" target="#b382">(Kormendy &amp; Richstone 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b443">Magorrian et al. 1998</ref>), M BH -L bulge <ref type="bibr" target="#b449">(Marconi &amp; Hunt 2003)</ref>, and M BH -σ ★ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b715">Tremaine et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Ferrarese &amp; Merritt 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Gebhardt et al. 2000)</ref>. However, the possibility that the M BH -σ ★ relation may evolve with redshift (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b784">Zhang et al. 2012</ref>) has led to suggestions that the scaling relation depends most directly on stellar mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b330">Jahnke et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cisternas et al. 2011a)</ref>; in this case, the evolution of the M BH -σ ★ relation with redshift would reflect the changing fractions of mass in galaxy bulges versus disks. Cogent arguments have also been made that the growth of black holes and the stellar content of galaxies are both "self-regulated" and that ultimately it is galaxy dark matter halo mass which dictates the equilibrium state <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Booth &amp; Schaye 2010</ref>).</p><p>In any case, the coevolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies is one of the keys to understanding the driving force of galaxy evolution, as it has direct implications on the interplay between the central source and the surrounding interstellar medium. However, this interaction has posed serious challenges to our understanding due to observational difficulties. Detailed observations of the morphology and kinematics of nuclei in interacting galaxies have been afflicted with dust extinction opaque to optical telescopes, and have been impossible until the recent technological advancement of near-infrared integral-field spectrographs with adaptive optics (AO) in the past decade ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Davies et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b529">Nowak et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b472">McConnell et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">Gebhardt et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Medling et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">U et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b478">Medling et al. 2014</ref>). TMT, with its nearly two order of magnitude increase in sensitivity for diffraction-limited imaging/spectroscopy, will undoubtedly revolutionize our understanding of processes in galactic nuclei.</p><p>The mechanism through which black hole masses correlate with galaxy properties has often been associated with gas-rich galaxy mergers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Hopkins et al. 2006</ref>). Gravitational torques funnel the gas into their centers, triggering two phenomena: an intense burst of star formation to feed the bulge, and accretion of gas on to the black holes in the centers of each galaxy. It has been postulated that black hole growth can regulate this process through AGN feedback ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b681">Springel et al. 2005</ref>) via massive winds that evacuate the gas from the galaxy on short timescales, cutting off star formation and future black hole growth. This sense of self-regulation has been confirmed observationally by <ref type="bibr">Kauffmann &amp; Heckman (2009)</ref>, who find that the Eddington ratio of a sample of AGNs depends on the supply of cold gas in the galaxy. Though the detailed mechanisms causing these correlations are still unconfirmed, star formation and black hole growth are fed by the same reservoir of inflowing gas; their growth histories are intertwined. It is likely that these two processes compete for fuel in a predictable fashion.</p><p>To understand this interplay, it is critical to examine systems during the period of maximum fueling of central starbursts and super-massive black holes. During a merger, does the black hole grow first, leaving the stars to slowly consume the remaining gas? Or is star formation quenched once the black hole reaches a bright quasar phase of extreme growth? The position of a merger on black hole scaling relations would indicate the relative growth timescales, and confirm whether the putative quasar-mode feedback occurs. Theoretical arguments have suggested that the starburst has preferential access to the available gas and that, therefore, a black hole would grow substantially only after star formation has quenched itself and the galaxy bulge is in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Cen 2012)</ref>; this scenario would predict that these mergers fall below black hole scaling relations.</p><p>Observationally, no clear verdict on the location of mergers along the M BH -galaxy scaling relations has yet to be established, as different studies have presented apparently-conflicting evidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b383">Kormendy &amp; Ho (2013)</ref> show five merging galaxies falling below the M BH -σ ★ and M BH -L K,bulge relations and suggest that black hole growth lags bulge formation in mergers; however, using Keck/OSIRIS integral-field spectrograph behind AO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b478">Medling et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Feedback and the Physics of Galaxy Quenching</head><p>Over the last decade, observations have revealed a number of surprising discoveries about how the baryonic content of galaxies is assembled. Roughly half of the stellar mass in present-day galaxies was assembled since z ~ 1, over an era when the cosmic star formation rate steadily declined. While the stellar mass in passive, red-sequence galaxies continued to grow, the mass in star-forming galaxies remained essentially constant. Over this period, some process, yet to be securely identified, quenched star formation in massive galaxies. This quenching was not predicted by theoretical models of the underlying cosmology and the hierarchical growth of gravitationally bound structures. Understanding the growth of the baryonic component of galaxies requires following the accretion and ejection of gas from galaxies. This gas physics depends on the highly non-linear gas cooling rate and the feedback of energy, momentum, and heavy elements produced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN).</p><p>Among the many new questions which these results have raised, some critical ones that can be investigated with TMT include the following:</p><p>• How exactly do the properties of the circumgalactic gas (on scales from roughly the galactic radius to the virial radius) influence the rate of baryonic accretion onto the star-forming (Toomre Q ~ 1) galactic disk?</p><p>• How does the mass ejection rate from star-forming galaxies vary with galaxy mass and cosmic time?</p><p>• How does the coupling among the various feedback processes (stellar winds, supernovae, AGN) shape the efficiency of mass and metal ejection from galaxies?</p><p>• Which physical processes (supernova thermal energy, radiative momentum, cosmic rays, etc.) dominate the acceleration of galactic winds?</p><p>• Why is the characteristic stellar mass at which galaxies cease forming stars essentially independent of redshift?</p><p>• Why is star formation most efficient in galaxies similar in mass to the Milky Way?</p><p>• How does environment affect the cycling of matter between galaxies and their surroundings?</p><p>Progress requires more detailed studies of galaxies over the era of strongly evolving star formation activity from roughly z ~ 1.5 to the present. Multiple sight-lines to beacons behind the halos of individual galaxies will clarify the global structure and filling factor of circumgalactic gas. Spectral imaging of galaxies will resolve metallicity gradients within galaxies and provide sensitivity to filamentary structures connecting galaxies to their surroundings.</p><p>The TMT first-light instruments offer powerful capabilities for these types of studies. The WFOS provides the blue sensitivity required to attack the halo absorption issues with observations of prominent resonance lines all the way down to z ~ 0.1; this science is not accessible with JWST. The IRIS instrument will generate spectral maps of star-forming structures within distant galaxies at higher resolution than JWST; and, combined with maps of molecular gas and dust obtained with ALMA, directly reveal which regions within galaxies form stars most efficiently. IRIS and IRMS provide infrared spectroscopy of diagnostic emission lines which begin redshifting out of the optical bandpass at z ≳ 0.5, and complement JWST by offering higher spectral resolution.</p><p>Absorption-line Measurements of Galaxy Outflows: Good spectral resolution (R ~ 5000) is key to obtaining accurate measurements of the properties of gas outflows from galaxy spectra. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.14 shows examples of galaxy spectra at intermediate redshifts.

Recent studies of large-scale structures at z ~ 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b428">Lubin et al. 2009</ref>) have found that many of the infalling galaxies experience significantly increased star-forming, starburst, nuclear activity, and rapid quenching of star-formation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Dressler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b712">Tran et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Lucia et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b699">Tanaka et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koyama et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Best 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eastman et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Kocevski et al. 2009</ref>). Altogether, these results imply that strong galaxy evolution occurs while galaxies assemble into clusters.</p><p>Several mechanisms had been proposed for these environmental effects. One class of mechanisms is cluster-related, such as ram-pressure stripping, galaxy harassment and strangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">(Gunn &amp; Gott, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b399">Larson et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Balogh &amp; Morris, 2000</ref>). Other events such as galaxy interactions and galaxy mergers, which occur in both the field and in clusters, have also been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b490">(Mihos &amp; Hernquist, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Barnes &amp; Hernquist, 1992</ref>). We do not know which of the many possible physical mechanisms associated with the cluster environment are responsible for eventually suppressing this star formation and nuclear activity and transforming gaseous disk galaxies into passive spheroids. We do know that many of these mechanisms are associated not with the densest cluster regions, but rather with the infall regions and lower-density environments far from the cluster cores ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b716">Treu et al. 2003</ref>). We must therefore examine galaxy populations over the full range of environments to form a complete picture of galaxy evolution.</p><p>We observe strong differences in the high-mass end of the stellar mass function, even for clusters with similar dynamical (halo) masses and redshifts, implying different evolutionary histories. Thus both late quenching and merging are responsible for populating the bright end of the red sequence and that halo mass and mass specific processes play crucial roles in galaxy evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">Lemaux et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b775">, Wu &amp; Zhang 2013</ref>). We also observe <ref type="bibr">[OII]</ref> in many passive galaxies that is the result of nuclear emission from LINERs, not normal star formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b410">Lemaux et al. 2010</ref>). These observations, for instance, require a combination of rest-frame optical and IR spectroscopy, for which WFOS and IRIS are ideally suited. There is also an increasing fraction (10-15%) of post-starburst (K+A) galaxies than the &lt; 3% in the distant field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b713">Tran et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>These K+As are as massive as the passive (red) galaxies, implying a clear connection between the two populations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b775">Wu &amp; Zhang 2013)</ref>. Their distribution seems to be intimately connect to their environments at z~1, indicating an important role for different processes in different environments.</p><p>Today, we require the use of the world's largest telescopes (Keck, Subaru, VLT, etc.) to study even modest samples of the brighter galaxies in these environments. The challenge increases as we approach redshifts z&gt;1, where many of the spectral features needed to measure galaxy metallicities (stellar and gas-phase), identify quenching events (post-starburst signatures), distinguish starbursts from AGN, and determine other essential galaxy properties, all shift into the near-infrared. These realities necessitate multi-object near-IR spectroscopy, which has just today become feasible on select facilities. But even there, large amounts of telescope time must be invested to observe modest samples at moderate resolution and S/N. Because much of the galaxy evolution at z~1-2 occurs in the lower mass (and lower luminosity) galaxies, only TMT will be able to observe the most interesting targets. Workhorse instruments such as WFOS will enable optical spectroscopy of potentially interesting targets, identifying objects at z~1 for followup rest-frame optical spectroscopy using IRMS. The most interested candidates will be dissected using IRIS, whose extremely high spatial resolution will finally allow us to clearly see where AGN, starbursts, mergers and tidal interactions are at play. The two infrared spectrometers will probe the most important spectral features - <ref type="bibr">[OIII]</ref>, Hβ, Mgb, Hα, and <ref type="bibr">[NII]</ref> -that can be used to distinguish the internal processes at work during this important epoch of galaxy transformation.</p><p>Evolution of Satellite Galaxies: Over the past decade, models of galaxy formation and evolution have made significant progress in explaining the observed properties of massive galaxies as a function of cosmic time.

Beyond the well-known missing satellites problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b498">Moore et al. 1999a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b367">Klypin et al. 1999)</ref>, recent work has shown that the most massive subhalos in simulated Milky Way-like systems are dramatically inconsistent with the dynamics of the brightest Milky Way satellites (otherwise known as the "Too Big To Fail" problem (Boylan- <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kolchin et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Kolchin et al. , 2012</ref>. This result suggests a serious problem with our understanding of how low-mass galaxies populate dark matter halos within ΛCDM. In particular, the "Too Big To Fail" problem indicates a failure of subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) at low stellar masses (&lt; 10 8 M ¤ ). Abundance matching or SHAM, a common technique for populating simulated dark matter distributions with galaxies, assumes a one-to-one relation between a galaxy's stellar mass and the mass of its parent dark matter (sub)halo ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Behroozi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b502">Moster et al. 2013</ref>). This simple empirical approach to modeling galaxy formation has yielded great success for massive galaxies, matching a wide range of clustering statistics as a function of cosmic time (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Berrier et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Conroy et al. 2006</ref>). The importance of this success is that it indicates that a galaxy's stellar mass is determined, to a very large extent, solely by the mass of its parent halo.</p><p>To robustly probe the dark matter content on these low-mass scales requires observations of a statistically meaningful sample of systems beyond the very local Universe, ideally extending to higher redshift. Unfortunately, current kinematic constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation are barely able to reach the critical scales where breakdown in abundance matching arises (M ★ &lt; 10 8 M ¤ ; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.15). Moreover, the required observations are very challenging, requiring 5-10 hours of integration with Keck/DEIMOS and are limited by the spatial and spectral resolution afforded by current facilities. The sensitivity of TMT combined with the spectral capabilities of IRIS and WFOS will open up the ability to constrain the dynamics (and thus dark matter halo masses) of low-mass systems far beyond current limits and across a range of environments (including both field and satellite populations). Beyond the apparent breakdown of abundance matching, the limitations in our understanding of galaxy evolution at low masses are further illustrated by the inability of current models to reproduce the number of passive or quenched satellites in the local Universe, such that models overpredict the quenched satellite population locally (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b757">Weinmann 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b754">Weinmann , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b363">Kimm et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b570">Phillips et al. 2014</ref>). Recent observations of the quenching efficiency for satellite galaxies find that only about 25-30% of in falling satellites are quenched in local groups and Milky Way-like systems. Moreover, this quenching efficiency is relatively independent of satellite stellar mass, such that lower mass systems (&gt; 10 8 M ¤ ) are equally likely to quench as their more massive counterparts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b759">Wetzel et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b760">Wheeler et al. 2014</ref>). From studies of the Local Group, however, we can conclude that this trend likely breaks down at yet lower stellar masses -below ~10 8 M ¤ , nearly all satellites in the Local Group are quenched (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.16), potentially indicating a dramatic change in the efficiency of satellite quenching at ~10 8 M ¤ .</p><p>The major limiting factor in understanding the quenching of satellite galaxies or more generally the evolution of low-mass systems is the limited observational information at stellar masses &lt; 10 8 M ¤ . While simulations have pushed their resolution limits down to very low masses, our observational knowledge is severely lacking.

TMT will represent a dramatic leap forward in our observational capabilities, pushing observations of low-mass galaxies (~10 6 M ¤ ) beyond the Local Group and more importantly out to intermediate redshift (z ~ 1) over a broad range of environments. In particular, TMT will place invaluable constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation (and its evolution), while testing models of galaxy formation (including satellite quenching) in the yet-poorly-understood low-mass regime.</p><p>Spatial distributions of stellar populations: Stellar mass functions of quiescent and starforming galaxies evolve with time in such a way that quiescent galaxies become progressively more dominant with time.

The superb spatial resolution of TMT may give us a handle on this long-standing question. Deep, AO-assisted, IFU spectroscopy will allow us to study the spatial distribution of stellar populations within galaxies. By examining spectral features that are sensitive to star formation on different timescales (e.g. Hδ vs. D 4000 ), we can see which part of a galaxy is quenched and on what timescale. There are a number of physical processes that are expected to shut off the starformation activities of galaxies. Their quenching efficiencies differ between the central part and outskirts of galaxies -e.g. ram-pressure stripping first occurs in the outskirts where the potential well is shallower and star formation is expected to cease progressively from the outskirts to the center. On the other hand, strangulation suppresses star formation on a galaxy-wide scale.</p><p>Together with the conventional wisdom that different processes are more or less effective in different environments (e.g. ram-pressure is most effective in dense cluster cores, while galaxygalaxy interactions may be least effective there), mapping the spatially-resolved stellar populations may help identify the physical process(es) at work. Another clue may come from the dynamical status of the outer part of the quenched galaxies. Some processes are expected to transform star-forming galaxies into S0's instead of classical, dispersion-dominated elliptical galaxies. The E/S0 classification is notoriously difficult at high z even with HST, but they are dynamically distinct (S0 has a rotating disk, while E does not). So, if we can measure the dynamics of the outer part then that would be another important clue toward solving the problem.</p><p>The spatial distribution of stellar populations is also interesting from the point of view of the size evolution of galaxies. Current theories predict that the core of these galaxies forms at high redshifts and they are observed as the compact, massive galaxies at z ~2. Then, low-mass galaxies accrete onto these galaxies and fill out the outer part to form an extended envelope. We can test this theory by direct observations of early-type galaxies over a range of redshifts. Lowmass galaxies are metal-poor galaxies and we expect that the metallicity gradients of massive early-type galaxies should become stronger with time. It may be challenging to measure stellar metallicity with sufficient signal-to-noise even with TMT, but a stacking analysis would make it possible.</p><p>Synergy with Large Surveys: TMT is not a survey telescope. Its field-of-view is relatively small compared to the largest panoramic telescope facilities; its power lies in spectroscopic follow-up observations. Clusters and groups of galaxies that we have discussed in this section are rare objects and one needs to survey a large volume to cover a wide enough range of environment. There are a number of on-going/future surveys such as the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. These surveys cover more than 1000 square degrees and are highly complementary to TMT. By using cluster catalogs from these surveys, we can efficiently point TMT to interesting groups and clusters to cover a wide enough parameter space in environment. The superb spatial resolution and depth of TMT will then allow us to gain much deeper insights into galaxy properties than these wide-area surveys can achieve.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Background</head><p>The overwhelming majority of baryons at z&gt;2 reside in a diffuse, highly ionized plasma that lies between galaxies known as the intergalactic medium or IGM. This IGM is a fundamental prediction of hierarchical cosmology where baryons trace the underlying dark matter distribution giving rise to the Cosmic Web ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.17). Observationally, this web is manifested in the spectra of distant sources as a thicket of HI Lyα absorption-lines commonly termed the Lyα forest. Because the physics of diffuse gas can be very simple, the theory has told us that the neutral hydrogen (HI) optical depth, as well as the gas temperature, is controlled by the gas density and the intensity and spectral shape of the extragalactic UV background (EUVB). This simplicity makes it possible to turn a Lyα forest spectrum, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.17, into a one-dimensional map of the density along the line of sight, as a function of redshift. These data provide information on the spectrum of initial density fluctuations without the non-linear gravitational processing that affects denser regions of the Universe, and thus the Lyα forest may offer the best means of measuring the spectrum of these perturbations on small scales where other techniques cannot.</p><p>The highest quality data on the physical properties of the IGM have been recorded for the redshift range z = 1.6 -3.5, for several reasons: first, Lyα must be redshifted above the atmospheric UV cutoff of 0.31µm, setting the minimum redshift; second, the Lyα forest evolves extremely rapidly with redshift, so that by z&gt;3.5, it is so dense with absorption that it loses dynamic range for measuring weak spectral features; third, QSOs bright enough for echelle observations (m &lt; 19) are very rare even at their peak near z = 2.5, and by z = 6 there are still only a small sample known in the entire sky. Thus, in general, our current view of the IGM is "one-dimensional", in the sense that we do not get the picture on the lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.17 but only the one on the upper panel</p><p>Indeed, experiments designed to examine the gas surrounding galaxies -their so-called circumgalactic medium or CGM -reveal a substantial reservoir of cool, enriched gas. Establishing the interplay between the IGM and galaxies is a major focus of current research and bears directly on theories of galaxy formation in modern cosmology.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

The surface density of suitable IGM probes increases exponentially for R &gt; 22 due to the very steep rest-UV luminosity function of star forming galaxies. By R ~ 24, the surface density of galaxies+QSOs exceeds 1 arcmin -2 , sufficient for tomographic mapping of the IGM on Mpc scales.</p><p>Nevertheless, decades of research on the IGM using high-dispersion, absorption-line spectroscopy have established the basic properties of this medium: the surface density distribution of the HI gas, the PDF of its transmission with redshift, that the gas is highly ionized, constraints on its temperature and thermal history. These data have also revealed that portions of the IGM are enriched in heavy elements (C, Si, O). High-resolution spectra are capable of detecting trace amounts of metals, down to metallicities as low as 1/5000 of the solar abundances. In fact, such lines of sight provide a very high quality "core sample" of the intervening universe, from which we have learned (e.g.) that there may be no gas, anywhere in the Universe, that was not "polluted" with the products of stellar nucleosynthesis at some early epoch. This enrichment implies an interplay between galaxies and the IGM throughout the early universe including, perhaps, the first stars. Current galaxy formation theory requires that the IGM provide galaxies with a nearly continuous supply of fuel for star formation.</p><p>Complementing the single-sightline, high-dispersion data, several projects have generated massive spectroscopic datasets (e.g. SDSS, BOSS) to study the IGM across large-scales and to use it as a direct probe of cosmological models. Despite the lower spectral resolution, the large sample size and sky-area-coverage offer unique analyses including measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the IGM transmission field, cross-correlation of the HI gas to IGM metal absorption and high-z quasars and galaxies, and measurements of the mean free path to ionizing radiation. In the TMT era, there will be powerful synergy between the high-fidelity data one can obtain on narrow fields with these large spectroscopic datasets spanning the full sky.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">TMT and the IGM</head><p>As emphasized above, our view of the IGM on Mpc scales is essentially one-dimensional, limited by the number density of luminous quasars on the sky. To resolve the Cosmic Web on scales of 1 Mpc one must obtain IGM spectra of a denser set of background sources. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.18 shows the space density of compact, UV-bright star forming galaxies at apparent magnitudes sufficient to yield very high quality spectra. For galaxies with R ~ 24.5 (~0.6µJy), approximately the apparent magnitude at which TMT/WFOS can obtain a spectrum at R ~ 5000 with S/N ~ 30, galaxies in the appropriate redshift range (z = 1.8 -4) outnumber QSOs by more than a factor of 30. This means that the IGM properties can be densely sampled on physical scales of &lt; 1 Mpc, approximately the maximum sphere of influence of individual galaxies on the IGM and comparable to the expected coherence length of the undisturbed IGM. Thus, the 3-D IGM can be effectively reconstructed tomographically over the range 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 where the Lyman-α forest can be observed from the ground with good dynamic range. With a sufficiently dense grid of closely-separated background sources, including faint QSOs and bright LBGs, it becomes possible to interpolate across the transverse plane to 'tomographically' reconstruct the 3D Lyα forest absorption field. Lyα tomographic maps with ∼Mpc resolution will extend 3D cosmography beyond the z ∼1 currently achievable by deep galaxy redshift surveys (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Davis et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b415">Lilly et al. 2007</ref>). In addition, as illustrated by the simulated reconstruction maps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.18, Lyα tomography is far more effective at mapping out overdensities of order unity and cosmic voids. Since each Lyα forest sightline probes ∼ 500 h −1 Mpc (comoving) along the line-ofsight, large cosmic volumes can be efficiently mapped. The resultant maps reveal the topology of large-scale structure in the high-z universe, constrain the power-spectrum of dark matter, and resolve extrema in the density field such as proto-clusters and voids.</p><p>Our current, one-dimensional view of the IGM has primarily been derived from several tens of echelle spectra at high S/N (&gt;30 per pixel) recorded on 10-m class telescopes. These data pale in comparison with the S/N &gt;&gt; 100 per pixel one obtains for stars in our Galaxy (and its neighbors). With an echelle spectrometer on TMT one could achieve S/N&gt;1,000 on the most luminous sources to give an unprecedented view of the low-density IGM. Such data could, for example, reveal the presence of a CIV 'forest', akin to the HI Lyα forest of current datasets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.20). The spectra would establish the distribution of metals at below the mean density of the universe (i.e. the majority of the volume), testing models of pre-enrichment. These extremely high quality spectra will also place high-precision constraints on the temperature of the IGM to better resolve its thermal history. The IGM temperature with redshift is a complex balance between adiabatic cooling from cosmic expansion with photoionization heating by quasars and star-forming galaxies and (possibly) heating by exotic sources (e.g. blazars) and structure formation. These data will also examine systematics that affect the large-field surveys of the IGM (e.g. continuum normalization). The solid small rectangle overlaid on the left-panel shows, for comparison, the footprint covered by the 12 LRIS pointings of our pilot program, while the large dashed rectangle shows the area equivalent to 1 deg 2 on the sky, which we hope to eventually cover in future programs.</p></div>

These spectra would directly establish whether a CIV 'forest' exists in the z~2 universe. In turn, the data would reveal the full distribution of metals in the high-z IGM.</p><p>Another emerging area of IGM research is to study the gas in emission. Once illuminated by ionizing photons from the EUVB or a nearby source, the HI gas fluoresces with approximately 60% of the photons converted to HI Lyα (Adelberger et al 2006; Cantalupo et al 2007; Kollmeier et al 2010) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.21 shows the "Slug nebula" surrounding the bright UM287 quasar at z=2.1 which extends hundreds of kpc across, i.e. far beyond the dark matter halo hosting the source. Using the boosted ionizing radiation field of the nearby quasar, gas from the surrounding IGM may be studied in emission. Narrow band imaging and IFU spectroscopy on TMT could detect much fainter sources including optically thick gas ionized only by the EUVB. TMT's greater impact, however, would be deep optical and near-IR spectra of this extended emission to diagnose properties of the IGM in an entirely complementary fashion to absorption-line techniques. The surface brightness of even the bright nebula in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.21 requires several night-long integrations on a 10-m telescope to sensitively study Lyα, CIV, HeII, and Hα line-emission.

Present studies of the CGM are primarily limited to examining the gas in absorption in the rare cases where a quasar or luminous galaxy lies behind a foreground galaxy. One obtains singlesightline information, one galaxy at a time, and primarily at low spectral resolution with correspondingly limited constraints on the physical conditions. The IGM tomography experiment described in the previous section may be expanded to include analysis of the CGM. Star-forming galaxies with R &lt; 24.5 used to characterize the IGM absorption represent only the "tip of the iceberg" for the high redshift galaxies. The combined sensitivity of WFOS and TMT allows for spectroscopy of much fainter galaxies (to R ~ 27, albeit with lower spectral resolution than for the IGM probes) with a high degree of completeness. Galaxies at such apparent magnitudes have surface densities of &gt;20 arcmin -2 for each interval in redshift of Δz ~ 0.5 from z ~ 2 to z ~ 3.5 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">Figure 5</ref>.22). Fortuitously, this redshift range also encompasses what we believe to be the most important era for galaxy growth, star formation and massive black hole accretion in the history of the Universe. Thus, with TMT, it will be possible to simultaneously obtain a densely sampled map of the distribution of galaxies and their CGM, in 3-D, providing the most complete possible census of all normal matter, and its relationship to dark matter. For the first time, the empirical picture of the high redshift universe would be of as high fidelity as those that currently exist only inside simulations. More importantly, the observations will reveal the inner workings of all of the poorly understood physical processes that must be incorporated in order to understand how galaxies form -feedback (both hydrodynamic and radiative) from AGN and galaxies, gas accretion, details of the relationship between structure in diffuse gas versus that traced by galaxies.</p></div>

These will include precision measurements of BH masses spanning a range of more than four orders of magnitude in mass, examining the relationships between SMBHs and their host galaxy environments, understanding the physical processes of the fueling and feedback of black holes and their redshift evolution, determining the early growth history of SMBHs through observations of high-redshift quasars, and carrying out fundamental tests of General Relativity through high-precision measurements of stellar orbits around the Galactic Center. In this section, we describe a few of the most exciting science cases for understanding the fundamental properties, accretion physics, and cosmological growth history of SMBHs. The Galactic Center's proximity makes it a unique laboratory for addressing issues in the fundamental physics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their roles in galaxy formation and evolution. Current AO studies have transformed our understanding of the Galactic Center (GC). In the past decade, proper motion studies have determined the orbits of some individual stars moving within 0.04 pc of Sgr A* <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">(Figure 6.2)</ref>. These provide the strongest evidence for the existence of a central black hole in the Galactic Center and the best mass measurement in any galactic nuclei. However, the star density in this region is so high that source confusion has limited studies to the brightest stars, and introduces biases in astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. TMT's gains in resolution and contrast will enable detection and mapping of the orbits of stars four magnitudes fainter ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 6</ref>.3). This will allow the detection of many stars closer to the black hole than we can observe (resolve) today. The measurement of the orbits of these short period stars will be essential for tests of General Relativity in this region. </p></div>

It was recently reported that flares in Sgr A* are highly polarized, supporting a synchrotron origin for the NIR emission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b487">Meyer et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">, Nishiyama et al. 2009</ref>). However, the spatial resolution limits our ability to draw strong conclusions. TMT's high-spatial resolution and its time-domain capabilities will enable it to perform polarimetric monitoring campaigns that will help to break model degeneracies and test relativistic effects. The NIR (1-2.5 µm) polarimetry with TMT will be sensitive enough to monitor rapid changes on time scales of less than 5 minutes, with an accuracy of 0.1%.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

For example, center of our nearest neighbor Andromeda (M31) is about a hundred times more distant than Sgr A* (730 kpc), but compensates by harboring an SMBH roughly 35 times larger (1.4x10 8 M ¤ ). The resulting sphere of influence of the M31 black hole subtends about 6" in the sky, and the expected proper motion is about 6 percent of that in the Galactic center (see E-ELT simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b722">Trippe et al. 2010</ref>). Current adaptive optics near-infrared observations with 8-10 m telescopes of M31 are strongly confusion limited. With the D 4 advantage of TMT in the confusion-limited case in addition to ability to operate at Z-band, the IRIS instrument will have both the angular resolution and sensitivity to measure both the proper motion and radial velocities of individual stars to reconstruct their orbits (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 6.4)</ref>.

For redshifts z&gt;1 there are hints that both the M BH -M bulge and M BH -σ relations evolve, in the sense that the black hole tends to be over-massive with respect to the galaxy, but these findings are uncertain and controversial, depending on highly indirect estimates of M BH and host galaxy parameters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Bennert et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schulze &amp; Wisotzki 2014</ref>).</p><p>The most reliable method to measure the mass of a black hole is from the orbital dynamics of gas or stars in the region within which the black hole dominates the gravitational potential.

TMT's IRIS instrument will provide the next great leap in observational capabilities for measurement of the kinematics of galaxy nuclei on sub-arcsecond scales. TMT's AO capability will enable IRIS to achieve a spatial resolution close to the diffraction limit, 8 mas (λ/µm), which surpasses the spatial resolution of the HST by almost one order of magnitude. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure  6</ref>. and at z = 0.4, M BH = 10 9 M ¤ . Black holes with M BH ∼ 10 10 M ¤ can be detected at any redshift, provided that suitable dynamical tracers (stellar absorption lines or emission lines from ionized or molecular gas) are accessible in wavelength ranges that can be observed using IRIS.</p><p>SMBH masses can be probed using either stars or gas as dynamical tracers. The stellar-dynamical method is more general in that it can be applied to a much larger set of targets, but modeling the full distribution of stellar orbits in a galaxy is a formidable challenge. Complications include the presence of the dark matter halo, possible triaxial structure in the bulge, and stellar population gradients. These issues can be mitigated if the SMBH sphere of influence is very well resolved by the observations, and the exquisite angular resolution provided by TMT's AO system will enable major improvements in the quality and accuracy of SMBH mass measurements even for nearby galaxies in which SMBHs have already been detected using currently available capabilities. Velocity dispersion around a 10 7 M ¤ BH is ~67 km/s requiring a spectral resolution of R~9000 to properly characterize it. Measurement and modeling of the kinematics of a thin gas disk in circular rotation is far simpler, but only a small fraction of galaxies contain a circumnuclear gas disk in regular rotation that also has emission lines (from ionized or molecular gas) sufficiently bright for kinematic mapping.

Using AO-assisted IFS on Gemini and Keck, <ref type="bibr" target="#b473">McConnell et al. (2012)</ref> indeed succeeded in detecting such ultra-massive black holes, the largest having M l = 2.1×10 10 M ¤ in NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in the Coma cluster. Black holes of this size have a sphere of influence that can be resolved, and thus potentially detectable, at all redshifts by TMT. Details of the orbital dynamics need to be determined, which could show whether stellar cusps form around the SMBH, and if there is evidence of mergers. The principal limitation, which places this problem beyond current telescopes and instrumentation, is the low surface brightness of the centers of massive early-type galaxies. IRIS can be used to search for very massive black holes in a complete sample of the most massive galaxies between z = 0 and z = 4, straddling the peak of quasar activity at z = 2.5. To date, SMBH mass measurements have been completed for only a small handful of local BCGs, but TMT and IRIS will make it possible to achieve the S/N and angular resolution necessary to detect SMBHs in dozens of nearby BCGs (D&lt;200 Mpc) in just a few hours of on-source integration time per target ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Do et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>

Determining the demographics of IMBHs in nearby, lowmass galaxies is of great importance since these objects are much closer to the mass scale of their original "seeds", unlike high-mass SMBHs which have essentially lost any physical "memory" of their original seed masses and environments. Theoretical models suggest that the occupation fraction and M BH -σ relation of IMBHs may contain unique clues to the distribution of BH seed masses and the efficiency of their formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b744">Volonteri et al. 2008</ref>). IMBHs are also of great interest as sources of gravitational waves, either from binary BH mergers or from extreme mass-ratio inspiral events (in which a stellar-mass compact object inspirals into a low-mass nuclear BH). The probable hosts of these intermediate-mass objects are globular and other massive star clusters, and the nuclei of latetype bulgeless spirals and dwarf galaxies.</p></div>

However, the existence of intermediatemass black holes is still controversial partly due to the insufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity of current telescopes. Some late-type galaxies, even those that are completely bulgeless, host a central black hole with a mass as low as M BH = 10 5 M ¤ <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Filippenko &amp; Ho 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">Greene &amp; Ho 2007)</ref>, but all such estimates are based on secondary methods of mass determination that rely on AGN broad emission lines. At the same time, HST stellar-dynamical observations have been used to set an astonishingly-tight upper limit of 1500 M ¤ to the mass of any BH in the nucleus of the Local Group Spiral M33 <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">(Gebhardt et al. 2001</ref>). This observation provides the best demonstration that not all galaxies contain a central BH, but the occupation fraction of BHs as a function of galaxy mass remains almost entirely unconstrained by available data for late-type and dwarf galaxies. There is tantalizing evidence for IMBHs in a small number of low-mass dwarf galaxies from X-ray observations (such as the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10; <ref type="bibr" target="#b601">Reines et al. 2011</ref>), but the critical confirmation via spatially resolved dynamics is still lacking. At present, direct dynamical searches for IMBHs are restricted to the Local Group and its closest neighbors.</p><p>Nuclear star clusters in dwarf and late-type galaxies are the likely homes of IMBHs (if they indeed exist), and will be high-priority targets for IMBH searches in the TMT era. These clusters typically have stellar velocity dispersions of 15-30 km s <ref type="bibr">-1</ref> , and the need for simultaneously high angular resolution and high spectral resolution to resolve the kinematic structure of these objects is the primary factor limiting observational progress at present. The proposed high spectral resolution mode for IRIS (R ∼ 8,000-10,000) will be critically important for carrying out IMBH searches in nearby lowmass galaxies, and it will be a uniquely powerful capability for TMT. At a resolving power of R=8000, it becomes possible for IRIS to deliver accurate measurements of mean velocity, velocity dispersion, and higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity profile in individual spaxels for observations of central star clusters in galactic centers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Do et al. 2014</ref>) and for objects such as the M31 globular cluster G1. Other targets for IMBH searches with TMT will include ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in nearby groups and clusters; these objects may be the remnant nuclear clusters of tidally stripped low-mass galaxies and could host BHs in the range 10 5 -10 7 M ¤ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b489">Mieske et al. 2013</ref>).

In combination with the velocity width of the emission lines, ΔV, we can compute the virial product M virial = R BLR ΔV 2 /G, which is related to the true black hole mass through a normalization factor f = M virial /M BH that depends on the unknown structure and kinematics of the broad-line region <ref type="bibr" target="#b650">(Shen 2013</ref>). In practice, it is customary to calibrate f empirically by assuming that AGNs obey the same M-σ relation as inactive galaxies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b540">Onken et al. 2004</ref>). This is a highly uncertain and unproven procedure. There is no guarantee that AGNs follow exactly the same M-σ relation, and it is quite likely that f differs from object to object. Yet, this is the fundamental assumption on which all current methods for estimating black hole masses in AGNs and quasars are based. With IRIS, we will be able to directly calibrate f in reverberation-mapped AGNs by independently deriving M BH through stellar-dynamical analysis. This has been attempted for a few of the nearest Seyfert 1 galaxies using AO data from 8-10m telescopes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Davies et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b301">Hicks &amp; Malkan 2008)</ref>, but it is not within reach of current capabilities to expand the sample to a meaningful size.

However, it is also very challenging, particularly for AGNs at higher redshift. TMT's superb spatial resolution and sensitivity will bring us a major breakthrough in separating the host signatures from the bright unresolved nucleus. This can help us to better constrain the M BH -σ relation, particularly for AGNs at high redshift. Measuring the central velocity dispersion requires a strong spectral feature redshifted to an accessible wavelength. There are multiple absorption lines that can be used for this purpose. For example, the Ca II triplet at rest-wavelength of 0.85 µm, centering it in the JHK bands corresponds to redshifts of 0.4, 0.9, and 1.6, respectively. Given the expected spatial resolution of IRIS in each of these bands, the minimum resolved radius of influence of SMBH corresponds to 60, 100, and 150 pc at these redshifts. For comparison, note that the radii of influence for M87 (M BH ~ 3 x 10 9 M ¤ ) and M31 (M BH ~ 7 x 10 7 M ¤ ) are approximately 100 and 12 pc, respectively. Thus, it will be possible to probe the upper end of the SMBH mass function with TMT at these redshifts.</p><p>TMTwill also allow us to study in much more detail the mechanisms of feeding and feedback of AGNs. It will provide observations not only for nearby AGNs in unprecedented quality, but also to galaxies reaching redshifts out to z~2, where galaxies are most active, and AGN feedback is suspected of playing a major role in shaping galaxy evolution. In the mean time, TMT's high-spatialresolution spectroscopy will reveal fainter AGNs at higher redshifts, allowing us to probe the evolution of AGN luminosity function over a far wider range of luminosities.</p></div>

Current wide field surveys of AGNs have been identifying active 10 8 to 10 9 solar mass SMBHs during their violent growth epoch of redshift around 2. They are the most massive SMBHs in the local universe, and in order to trace the growth history of typical 10 7 to 10 8 solar mass SMBHs, it is necessary to identify at least one order of magnitude fainter AGNs, which are moderate-or lowluminosity AGNs at high-redshifts.</p><p>TMT's superb spatial resolution will bring significant improvement in this aspect. Spectroscopy done with narrower slits will be less contaminated by the light from the host, particularly for galaxies at higher redshift.

However due to the limited sensitivity of those surveys, all the discovered high-redshift quasars are already mature ones, the mass of their SMBHs being M BH ~ 10 9 M ¤ and the metallicity of their broad-line regions is higher than the solar metallicity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kurk et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Juarez et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b501">Mortlock et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b735">Venemans et al. 2013</ref>).

However, the spectroscopic characterization of those faint candidates requires very sensitive near-infrared spectroscopic observations that are beyond the ability of the current 8-10 m telescopes. More specifically, the determination of M BH (and consequently the Eddington ratio, L/L Edd ) requires the measurement of the CIV 1549 and MgII 2800 velocity profiles, while the determination of the chemical property requires the measurement of the NV 1240, CIV 1549, HeII 1640, CIII]1909, MgII 2800, and FeII multiplet fluxes. For quasars at z~6-8, those spectroscopic features are seen at λ obs ~ 0.8-2.5 µm, and sensitive spectroscopic observations at this wavelength range are well-suited to IRIS on TMT. Even the discovery spectrum of a true first generation quasar should reveal its much weaker metal lines. And quasars with low-mass SMBHs are expected to show relatively narrow (i.e., FWHM ~ 1000-2000 km/s) velocity profiles in emission lines as inferred from the properties of nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, and thus a moderatelyhigh spectroscopic resolution of R~3000-4000 is needed for measurements of M BH . Such a moderately high resolution is preferred also for avoiding the effects of the strong OH airglow emission that is crucial for sensitive near-infrared spectroscopic observations.

With IRIS observations of the centers of nearby galactic centers of all types, it will be possible for the first time to determine how SMBHs are fueled, and how they in turn control the evolution of their host galaxies.</p><p>Near-IR IFU spectroscopy will also be essential for finding evidence of outflows induced by AGN winds and jets, that are thought to provide a crucial role in preventing runaway star formation in the most massive galaxies at higher redshift <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Fabian 2012)</ref>. Current 8-m class telescopes are only capable in finding such outflows in rare, highly-luminous AGN at z~0.5-2 where these feedback effects are most important (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Cano-Diaz et al. 2012</ref>). TMT will be able to observe these outflows on smaller spatial scales, and in more typical, less luminous AGN. Together with ALMA observations of the corresponding molecular outflows, and sensitive VLA observations of the synchrotron emission from jets and outflows (even in traditionally "radio quiet" AGN), we can build up a complete picture of the nature and energetics of AGN feedback at these redshifts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.4">Distinguishing star formation in the host galaxies of AGNs</head><p>IRIS will be a powerful instrument for resolving the central bulge component of the host galaxy. A key ingredient to understanding whether the black hole and galaxy grew in a synchronized manner is to be able to independently constrain the growth of the black hole (accretion rate) and the host (star formation rate -see Section 7.8.8). For this purpose, it is necessary to observe not only inactive galaxies but also AGNs, systems where the black hole is actively accreting. Under these circumstances it is normally very challenging to disentangle the contributions from the AGN and star formation. The high angular resolution IFS capabilities of IRIS again will be a key new breakthrough (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 6</ref>.6).</p><p>For some objects, such as the Ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs), controversy still rages about the dominant IR emission process: either it is very powerful AGN or a vigorous starburst component. A highly effective methodology to distinguish between emission mechanisms is the estimation of the emission surface brightness of energy sources ( <ref type="bibr">Imanishi et al. 2011</ref>). The energy generation efficiency of nuclear fusion inside stars is only ~0.5% of Mc 2 , and the maximum emission surface brightness of a starburst is found to be ~10 . Due to the limited sensitivity and image size with 8m class telescopes, this method has been applied to only to a limited number of ULIRGs. As ULIRGs are more prevalent at higher redshift, probing the emission source from the local universe and constructing templates is crucial preparation for observations using space-based telescopes. Hence, MICHI on the TMT will be able to conduct key research in this area, as well supporting subsequent observations with the JWST and SPICA at higher-z. Comprehensively understanding the evolution of ULIRGs versus redshift is a powerful way to investigate the evolution of AGN and galaxies, and their effect on each other, of significant importance to cosmology.</p></div>

In the hierarchical paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy mergers bring their central massive black holes (BHs) together. Initially, the BHs are expected to have a separation of more than a kpc. The dynamical friction caused by stars then brings the two BHs closer on a time scale of 100 Myrs, making them a gravitationally bound binary system with a separation of about a parsec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Begelman et al. 1980</ref>). The massive binary BHs will eventually spiral in and merge to form a single central SMBH of the new galaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b494">(Milosavljevic &amp; Merritt 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">, Di Matteo et al. 2005</ref>). However, binary coalescence via emission of gravitational waves requires that binary must first shrink to much smaller radii (~0.001-0.01 pc) from the parsec scale separation where standard dynamical friction stops acting. Possible solutions to the so called "final parsec problem" include the interaction of the binary with the surrounding stars and gas e.g., slingshot ejection of approaching stars can shrink the binary orbit further. The resulting gravitational binding energy is released to the surrounding stars. N-body simulations show that this process can convert a steep power-law cusp into a shallow power-law cusp within the radius of gravitational influence of the BHs <ref type="bibr" target="#b492">(Milosavljevic &amp; Merritt 2001)</ref>.

The torus is suspected to be a 'clumpy' distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b518">Nenkova et al. 2002)</ref>, rather than a homogenous distribution of dust. Tentative new results seem to show the torus structure and perhaps its presence is strongly affected by the level of activity in the AGN, which in turn is related to the fueling of the central engine. However, surveys of AGN tori using 8m class telescopes are confined to the local universe due to the combination of flux and spatial resolution limitations.</p><p>Through the nearly four-fold increase in the spatial resolution of TMT, compared to 8-m telescopes, observations of fainter and/or more distant objects can be performed. At z=0.5, the spatial resolution of JWST/MIRI is 1.5kpc (hence heavily contaminated by galactic star forming rings, etc.), whereas the TMT spatial resolution is 330pc (nuclear dominated) (similar comparison on spatial resolutions between Spitzer and Gemini observations is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 6</ref>.6). Through careful imaging and spectral observations of the torus in z&lt;~0.5 objects, templates can be produced that will be of crucial importance to calibrating and interpreting observations from JWST.

In this scheme, the hydromagnetic wind can lift the plasma from the midplane of the accretion disk to form a geometrically thick distribution of dusty clouds surrounding the central engine. The magnetic field can induce a preferential orientation of dust grains within the dusty clouds that can give rise to a measurable degree of polarization. Thus, NIR polarimetry has the advantage of providing information about the magnetic field at locations where FIR/sub-mm emission is weak.</p><p>Recent studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b420">Lopez-Rodriguez et al. 2013</ref> have shown that the magnetic field strength (few mG) and geometry (aligned with the torus axis) within the obscuring material of a few AGN can be determined through NIR (1-2.5 µm) polarimetry. However, due to the flux sensitivity of the current suite of IR polarimetric instruments in 8-m class telescopes only a few objects are observable limiting the statistical analysis to obtain general and/or extraordinary magnetic properties. The high-angular resolution and the D^4 advantage of TMT will 1) minimize starlight dilution within the central region, important to estimate the intrinsic polarization of the AGN; and 2) increase the number of objects allowing us to measure general and/or extraordinary magnetic properties within the torus of AGN. This study will allow us to study the evolution, dynamics and morphology of the obscuring material and its interaction with the central engine and host galaxy from a magnetohydrodynamical framework.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CENTRAL ENGINE</head><p>TMT will see first light in an exciting era for time domain astronomy (see Chapter 9). Particularly exciting for the study of supermassive black holes is the identification and study of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), which occur when a star on an orbit around SMBH makes a close approach and is ripped apart by tidal forces. Once the stellar debris rains down on the black hole, soft X-ray and UV radiation characterized by a 10 5 K blackbody emerges from the inner accretion region. Reprocessing of this radiation in the debris results in a fraction of the emission emerging in the optical. Large numbers of TDEs can be detected by the current big transient surveys like the Palomar Transit Factory (PTF, <ref type="bibr">Arcavi et al., 2014)</ref>, and many more will be found in the next generation of large-area surveys such as with the LSST. Observations of TDEs are important because they in principle provide a means of measuring the masses and spins of black holes in optically 'normal' galaxies.</p><p>The TMT will allow the detection and study of TDEs up to much higher redshifts than previously possible (see Section 9.8). Because of the "negative" K-correction (TDEs emitting primarily in the restframe UV with a characteristic 10 5 K black body) TDEs will be visible by TMT to redshifts of 6 or larger, enabling constraints on SMBH properties and evolution over a vast range of cosmic time.</p><p>The study of a large number of TDEs will help to anchor the observational signatures to preciselymeasured black hole masses. While analytic models and numerical simulations exist, there are still large uncertainties in the conversion from a measured light curve to a black hole mass estimate -the ultimate goal of TDE studies. Finding TDEs in a nearby galaxy with an independent measurement of the black hole mass, either from the M-σ relation or better yet maser disk kinematics will provide a better calibration of the models. With current observational capabilities the probability of finding such nearby events is low, and measuring their lightcurves is challenging. But, with LSST and the greater follow-up sensitivity and angular resolution of the TMT, it should be possible to build up a sample of "low-z" TDEs.</p><p>Variability of AGN provides a powerful means to explore and characterize the innermost regions. Time resolved spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry allow for highly confident identification of the excitation processes powering AGN jets. Variability studies coupled with the method of reverberation mapping discussed in Section 6.2.4 can be used to expand the present sample of a handful of AGN systems where their inner accretion disc structures and sizes can be measured up to many thousands of systems, covering the vast ranges of types and characteristics of AGN and Blazars that are observed, see also Section 9.9.</p></div>

Diffusion acts very slowly with time scales ∼10 9 yr, so it is most important on the main sequence, and is particularly important for metal-poor stars. Diffusion of He is important in the Sun and affects helioseismology models. Diffusion is also important in precision distance determinations based on main sequence fitting, since the abundances adopted for the model isochrone must agree with those of the stars, while the abundances deduced for the stellar atmosphere may not be those of the interior. Diffusion may also be the solution to a disagreement of a factor of ∼2 between the Li abundances derived for halo turn off stars, assumed to be the primordial lithium abundance, and the (lower) value predicted by standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis models that adopt the baryonic density inferred from the current concordance cosmology of WMAP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">Melendez &amp; Ramirez 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b384">Korn et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Bonifacio et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A key project to observe diffusion in action is to compare the elemental abundances for heavy elements near the Fe-peak of main sequence versus red giant and sub-giant stars in metal-poor globular clusters. Stars within a particular globular cluster, assuming its mass is not too high so that gas cannot have been retained beyond the first generation of star formation, are believed to have the same initial chemical inventory, and are sufficiently old that diffusion should have had time to act. The RGB stars have convective envelopes, and thus whatever diffusion might have occurred on the main sequence, the surface helium and heavy elements will have been restored to very close to their initial value, while the main sequence stars will be subject to the predicted larger effects of diffusion for metal-poor stars over their entire lifetime, i.e. that of the Galactic halo, ∼13 Gyr. Such observations require high spectral resolution spectroscopy of main sequence stars in globular clusters with SNR difficult or impossible to achieve with existing 8 -10 m telescopes.

Massive stars of very low metallicity were, until quite recently, believed not to lose very much mass through radiatively driven winds due to their weaker absorption features. This would mean that such stars might often end up as black holes, locking up their heavy element chemical inventory in perpetuity, while a solar metallicity star of similar mass would lose enough mass to end up as a neutron star. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">Meynet et al. (2007)</ref> have suggested that these stars are rapid rotators that lose up to 50% of their initial mass through a rotationally driven wind. The mass loss rates they predict for the main sequence phase of a 60 M ¤ star are more than 20 times larger than if rotation were ignored. Coupled with rotationally driven instabilities that transport both angular momentum and chemical species (Zahn 1992), this means that massive low metallicity stars can significantly enrich the ISM in H-and He-burning products.</p><p>This theoretical development is very attractive as it solves a number of problems, but the observational evidence to support this development it is essentially non-existent at present. The low metallicity required to produce main sequence rotation rates of ∼600 km/sec, close to the breakup rate at which the effective surface gravity becomes zero, is less than that seen at any place in the Milky Way where star formation is still underway. The metal depletion of the ISM in the LMC and in the SMC is also not sufficient. A population of young massive stars in a low metallicity galaxy is required, i.e. a very metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxy.

More recent searches use medium resolution spectroscopy using large multi-object spectrographs (SDSS, SEGUE, LAMOST survey) or selecting metal-poor candidates from photometric survey data. The SkyMapper telescope is photometrically surveying the southern sky in specific filter sets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Bessell et al. 2011</ref>) that allow candidate selection in a very efficient way. Follow-up high resolution spectroscopy is still required for confirmation and detailed chemical abundance studies.

To acquire high resolution spectra required for detailed abundance analysis to understand the origin and evolution of such faint objects (V mag of HE 1015-2050 ~ 16.3) is extremely difficult and time consuming with the existing 8 -10 m class telescopes particularly if such objects happen to undergo significant brightness variations. Similarly, enhancement of fluorine abundance observed in the Extreme helium (EHe) and R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b552">Pandey et al. 2008</ref>) by factors of 800 -8000 relative to its likely initial abundance raises questions about F synthesis mechanisms and the prevailing conditions in the stellar interiors. Measurement of fluorine abundance from the HF band in the near IR in a large sample of K and M giants covering a wide range in metallicities and ages would be essential to understand the origin and evolution of fluorine. Many such potentially interesting objects will form important targets for TMT due both to the large collecting area and more efficient spectrograph. TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

The spectroscopy yields the masses of the remnants (Balmer line fitting - <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Bergeron et al. 1992)</ref>, and the initial masses are known given the ages of the clusters. Despite the tremendous progress, two of the biggest uncertainties in the relation today are:</p><p>• What is the upper mass limit to white dwarf formation (i.e., what is the lower mass limit to a type II supernova)? The threshold mass separating white dwarf formation from type II supernovae is a fundamental threshold for stellar astrophysics and affects several linchpins at the heart of understanding the impact of stellar evolution on galaxy evolution. For example, the transition impacts chemical evolution models and the enrichment of the ISM (and subsequent stellar populations) by setting the balance between stellar yields from lower mass stars (e.g., He, C, N) and those from Type II supernovae (e.g., alpha elements).</p><p>• What is the metallicity dependence of stellar mass loss? The total amount of mass loss that a star suffers in post main-sequence evolution dictates the lifetime of the star in different phases of stellar evolution, the luminosity function of those phases, the morphology of the horizontal branch, and the structure of planetary nebulae. To accurately use the initial-final mass relation to predict the evolution of mixed stellar populations with different star formation and chemical abundance histories, we need to measure how mass loss varies with metallicity. This is unconstrained from theoretical work.</p><p>The WFOS instrument on TMT offers a unique opportunity to answer these two questions. With Keck/LRIS, our current sample of target star clusters for which spectra of white dwarf members suitable for mass determination can be obtained is limited to the nearest open star clusters within ~3 kpc, and the single nearest globular cluster within ~2 kpc. Within this volume, there is a lack of very young clusters with massive turnoffs to address the first challenge, and a lack of a metallicity spread within the clusters to address the second challenge. With TMT's light collecting area, white dwarf spectroscopy can be pushed to systems at 10 kpc. This volume includes three dozen globular clusters with a wide range of metallicities, as well as numerous rich open clusters with ages from 30 to 100 Myr (i.e., present day evolving mass ranging from 5 to 10 M ¤ ). Searching for white dwarfs in these clusters, and linking them to their progenitor masses, will answer these fundamental questions.</p><p>The key requirements for this program that would directly impact many areas of galactic and extragalactic astrophysics are ultra high throughput at UV wavelengths down to 3600 Angstroms (covering the high order Balmer lines), MOS capability and low resolution spectroscopy with R = 2000 -4000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">BINARY POPULATION:THE BINARY FREQUENCY OF FIELD STARS</head><p>A large fraction of stars in the Milky-Way are part of binary or higher order systems, with separations &lt; 0.04 parsecs (Larson 1995). Binaries can be identified by direct imaging or spectroscopically. The spectroscopic detection of binaries can be a laborious process that typically requires observations that span a long time baseline. Two possible imaging programs are discussed here that exploit the unprecedented angular resolution of the TMT to probe the binary frequency in very different environments:</p><p>1) A targeted study of star clusters. A survey of targets selected according to mass, age and dynamical state will prove useful for constraining the factors that define the binary frequency. The improved angular resolution delivered by NFIRAOS will be useful for resolving multiple objects with small projected separations on the sky that might otherwise appear as a single object. Such blends will appear as erroneous points on color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and confuse efforts to characterize cluster properties. By measuring the brightness of the individual components of such systems as opposed to their blended light, it will be possible to obtain cleaner CMDs.</p><p>2) A serendipitous survey of low mass binaries in the field. The TMT has the potential to become a binary-identification factory, as binary systems will be discovered serendipitously by the NFIRAOS WFSs during routine target acquisition and set-up. The angular resolution of the NFIRAOS NGS probes in J is 0.01 arcsec FWHM, and these will guide on sources as faint as J=22. Heretofore unknown binaries (as well as extragalactic objects with modest angular extensions) could be identified by the NFARIOS RTC as objects causing problematic corrections. Binary stars could be identified visually in the WFS output display during target acquisition. If preimaging of the field is used to identify guide stars then proper motions can be measured and thereby obtain distance information. Some of the selection biases due to separation and mass ratio inherent to imaging studies could be overcome, for example, by grouping systems according to proper motion. An interesting aspect of this investigation is that the stars that will be detected at the faintest magnitudes will have low intrinsic masses. With long term observations a binary database that spans a range of environments in the Galaxy could be sampled.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Star cluster formation and evolution and their environmental dependence</head><p>Stars, and in particular the most massive stars, rarely form in isolation. In fact, it is now well established that the vast majority of active star formation occurs in clusters of some sort. Despite significant recent progress, the evolutionary connection between the recently formed young massive clusters (YMCs) in starbursts and old globular clusters in the nearby Universe is still contentious. The evolution and survivability of young clusters depend crucially on their stellar initial mass function (IMF) (see also Section 8.2): if the clusters are significantly depleted in low-mass stars compared to, for example, the Solar neighborhood, they will likely disperse within about a Gyr of their formation. As a simple first approach, one could construct diagnostic diagrams for individual YMCs, of mass-tolight ratio (M/L; derived via dynamical mass estimates using high-resolution spectroscopy and the virial approximation) versus age (derived from spectral features), and compare the YMC locations in this diagram with models of "simple stellar populations" (SSPs) governed by a variety of IMF descriptions. However, such an approach has serious shortcomings and suffers from a number of fundamental problems.</p><p>The essential conditions to make a major leap forward are to obtain high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of a significantly larger cluster sample than available at present (to distinguish between trends and coincidences), covering a much more extended age range. These observations will need to be backed up by detailed N-body simulations of clusters containing both a realistic number of test particles (upwards of several x <ref type="formula">10   5</ref> ) and all relevant physical processes occurring over the clusters' lifetimes. Using TMT-sized apertures will allow us to probe both the dynamics and the luminosity function of young and intermediate-age star clusters (and their host systems) out to cosmologically interesting distances, where we can obtain statistically significant samples of galaxy types spanning the entire Hubble sequence, and of their YMC systems. Using this approach, the initial conditions for cluster formation (and evolution) can be modeled fully self-consistently. This will, for the first time, provide us with the firmest handle yet on potential IMF variations in external galaxies. For the expected velocity dispersions of ~7−15 km s −1 (for masses of ~ 10 5 − 10 6 M ¤ ), a spectral resolution of R &gt; 40, 000 is essential to efficiently sample the prevailing IMF conditions in a statistically significant number of YMCs. As long as the masses of the clusters are not too small (M cl &gt; 10 5 M ¤ , depending on the cluster's size), one can extract their velocity dispersions using suitably chosen cool giant and supergiant template stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">(Ho &amp; Filippenko 1996</ref> </p></div>

The spectral range around the CaII triplet (λ central = 860 nm) with a large number of metal lines in this spectral range can be used, and cross-correlated with a number of properly selected (super-)giant velocity template stars over the entire observed wavelength range, to obtain our velocity dispersion measurements.</p><p>Complementary imaging observations covering -ideally -at least 4 pass bands spanning a minimum of the entire optical wavelength range will allow to independently and robustly determine the cluster properties (age, mass, metallicity) using the sophisticated multi-parameter AnalySED algorithm (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Grijs et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Anders et al. 2004</ref>), which has been shown to produce robust results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2">Globular Clusters: their origin and evolution</head><p>Research on Galactic globular clusters by many investigators over the last few decades has led to a new paradigm for the formation and evolution of these not-so-simple stellar populations. Photometric and spectroscopic evidence confirms the presence of multiple stellar populations in nearly all Galactic globular clusters. Both dynamical models of clusters and the total mass of first generation stars needed to produce the second and subsequent generations suggest that globular clusters were originally as much as 2-10 times more massive than they are today. It is believed that the less centrally concentrated first generation stars have mostly been lost to merge into the population of field halo stars, whose composition the first generation stars resemble.</p><p>This new paradigm suggests that the star formation events that created globular clusters in the early universe were significantly more luminous and more massive than star forming regions we see in the local universe today, and that the star formation process to produce a young globular cluster extended over a time scale of roughly 100 million years. At the same time, we find bimodal populations of globular clusters in external galaxies, red and blue clusters with perhaps different metallicities and/or ages, and with different spatial distributions around their host galaxies. These different cluster systems are interpreted as resulting from different formation mechanisms, either through in situ formation processes or through major or minor galaxy mergers from host galaxies that experienced different histories of star and cluster formation.</p><p>To understand the star forming regions in the early universe that may be detected with TMT, we must first learn what we can about the origin and evolution of such clusters in the local universe. While Galactic clusters can be studied with smaller telescopes up to 8 and 10 meters, understanding the implications of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters beyond the local group will require the spatial resolution and light gathering power of TMT. Study of radial gradients in colors and spectral indices that reveal the nature of the constituent stellar populations will require spatial resolution exceeding what is possible with Hubble (which can barely resolve clusters at the distance of Virgo) and even JWST. Such studies with TMT will help us constrain the properties of the original star forming events that produced globular clusters in different environments, and allow us to connect the clusters we observe today with the observation of high redshift cluster-forming events in the early universe observed directly with TMT.</p></div>

Some of them are ultra-luminous, known as ULX and have X-ray luminosities greater than 10 39 ergs/s. AGNs are much more luminous and emit equally at all wavelengths with a strong correlation between the X-ray and IR luminosities from a dust torus (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">Krabbe, Böker &amp; Maiolino 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b435">Lutz et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Asmus et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b324">Ichikawa et al. 2012)</ref>; it is important to look for similar X-ray IR correlations in ULX candidates. A study conducted for NGC1399, using archival data from Spitzer IRAC and Chandra showed that there are two categories of bright X-ray sources, one in which, like in AGNs the mid-IR luminosity correlates with the X-ray, and the other where the IR and X-ray luminosities are uncorrelated (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figures 6 and 7</ref> of Shalima TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1">Probing the oldest stars in the Milky Way</head><p>The first, so-called Population III stars are believed to have been formed from gas unpolluted by heavy elements, after which all subsequent generations of stars contained increasing fractions of metals. This process has continued during the entire lifetime of the Universe. Hence the most metalpoor stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies are the oldest stars. In their atmospheres these old objects preserve details of the chemical composition of their birth gas cloud. These very old stars are hidden amongst a vast number of stars formed later in time. Once found, understanding the chemical composition of the oldest stars provides a direct probe of the initial conditions of star formation as well as the details of chemical evolution and nuclear astrophysics in the early universe. In the spectra of the metal-poor stars, since the relevant absorption lines appear quite weak ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure  7.</ref>2), the necessary chemical composition studies require high spectral resolution (R = λ/δλ~ 50 000 or greater), high SNR (~ 100 per spectral resolution element) observations. These requirements lead to extremely long integration times on the largest telescopes currently available. For example, an 18-hour integration with UVES on the VLT was obtained in an attempt to determine the oxygen abundance in HE1327-2326, the most extreme metal-poor turn-off star known ([Fe/H] ~ -5.5 dex, U 13.8 V 13.5), but even with such a long exposure, the UV-OH band was not detected; its spectrum TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Recent discoveries of halo stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -5 and measurements of their chemical abundances suggest that the progenitors of such objects are massive stars with several tens of solar masses, which might be typical masses of the first stars in the universe. Detailed measurements of their chemical compositions require high quality, high resolution spectra which will become available with TMT/HROS. For instance, only an upper-limit of Fe abundance ([Fe/H] &lt; -7) is determined for the most Fe-deficient star discovered very recently ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">Keller et al. 2014</ref>). Candidates of such stars will be discovered in the surveys of metal-poor stars over the next several years and follow-up spectroscopy with TMT will play an essential role. Moreover, searches for evidence of very massive stars (&gt; 100 M ¤ ) in the first generations of stars are important to examine the simulations of the formations of first stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Aoki et al. 2014</ref>).

The local population of old stars from the Galactic halo is expected to hold a larger fraction of M dwarfs and white dwarfs. These stars however have low luminosities, and are not amenable to detailed spectroscopic analysis with current telescopes unless they lie within about 100-200 parsecs of the Sun.</p><p>Low-mass stars and white dwarfs can be highly useful to map out the halo population for three reasons: 1) they are by far the dominant stellar population of the halo; they are the old population, holding the majority of the baryonic mass, 2) their 3D velocity components can be determined to much higher accuracy, because of their large proper motions, 3) physical properties of low-mass stars, and in particular their metallicity, can be constrained using low to medium resolution spectroscopy, because their spectra are dominated by broad molecular bands, and with suitable spectrum synthesis techniques, can now be modeled in detail.</p><p>Upcoming deep imaging surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST are expected to identify lowmass stars in huge numbers (millions) through proper motion analyses. These surveys will effectively provide a statistically complete census of the halo population out to several kiloparsecs from the Sun. Spectroscopic data is required to measure and constrain the temperature and metallicity of M dwarfs, and also to determine the mass and ages of white dwarfs. As the photometric distances of M dwarfs and white dwarfs are generally unreliable, spectroscopic data are needed to constrain their luminosities. Thus a better understanding of the spatial distribution and kinematics of these objects depends on spectroscopic follow-up observations.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Being bright and widely distributed, they are excellent tracers to study the chemistry, kinematics, and stellar contents of substructures in nearby galaxies. As the nearest large spiral system to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is an ideal laboratory to assess the theory of hierarchical cosmology. PNe are easily detectable at the distance of M31 (~780 kpc; <ref type="bibr" target="#b471">McConnachie et al. 2005</ref>) and can be used to investigate the properties of the intriguing substructures such as the Northern Spur and the Giant Stream in the outskirt of M31, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure 7</ref>.3. High-quality spectra of PNe in these regions are still conspicuously lacking. It is proposed to create the first 2D maps of nebular abundances and properties of the PN progenitors, which will allow the tracing of different substructures.</p><p>Out of nearly 3,000 PNe in M31 revealed by kinematic survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b484">Merrett et al. 2006</ref>), reliable elemental abundances have been derived for only a few dozen M31 PNe. Recently, the LAMOST telescope has discovered PNe in the out skirts of M31, including the most distant one, 3.6° from the center see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure 7</ref>.3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b780">Yuan et al. 2010</ref>).

If the substructures are the debris of dwarf galaxies of M31, the stellar populations therein could be different from those on the disk.  temperatures for different excitations and consequently accurate elemental abundances for N, O, Ne, S, and Ar. Given the excellent observing condition at Mauna Kea, the 30m aperture of TMT will achieve an optical spectrum with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 10 for a faint (m5007 ~22) PN in M31 with only 15min exposure. With 30min exposure for each observing field of WFOS (~15 PNe targeted simultaneous), one can cover about 12-14 fields, or ~200 PNe, in a single night. Thus, a one-week survey will produce more than 1000 high-quality spectra for the M31 PNe in a homogeneous manner. These spectra, together with the accurate luminosity information of the PNe (given that distances of all PNe are known), could be used as inputs for the nebular code CLOUDY, which has been modified and will be used to determine the luminosities and effective temperatures of the CSPNe. The masses and ages of the progenitor stars can then be estimated using stellar evolution models. The elemental abundances and the properties of PN progenitors in the substructures will be compared with those on the disk to investigate the origin of substructures. The survey will allow a determination of properties of a significant number of PNe (&gt; 1,000) across M31 and creation of the very first 2D maps of nebular abundances and the ages and masses of progenitor stars, these maps will allow the tracing of different substructures. </p></div>

Stars can be grouped into these components based on their kinematic properties, and their chemical composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Eggen, Lynden-Bell &amp; Sandage 1962)</ref>. In addition to the above three components, the Milky Way galaxy is found to have sub-structures which are in agreement with the theoretical predictions for a hierarchical formation of the Galaxy via mergers. Understanding the different structures of the Milky Way -their origins, and dynamics, is one of the fundamental issues in astronomy. This clearly requires decomposing the components of the Galaxy based on the age, kinematics, and chemical composition of the stars.</p><p>For a decomposition of the Milky Way, measuring accurate astrometry (parallaxes, proper motions) and hence the kinematic motion for a large number of stars is essential. The Hipparcos Space Mission in 1998 provided accurate astrometry for around one hundred thousand stars in the solar neighbourhood (d ~ 200 pc). Combining the ground based high resolution spectroscopy and the Hipparcos astrometry, the Galactic disk is decomposed into thin and thick disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b595">Reddy et al. 2003</ref>). Stars in the thick disk are old (~8 -10 Gyrs), metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6) and have distinct kinematic motions and chemical composition from that of the thin disk population. Abundances of elements with different nucleosynthesis history suggest that the thick disk stars formed mainly from SN II ejecta, the formation of the thick disk was rapid (&lt;2 Gyrs) and there is no current star formation. The thick disk population is believed to be the result of a major merger of a metal-poor dwarf galaxy when the Milky Way was just 1-2 Gyrs old. There are many unanswered questions regarding the thick disk and the composition of the Milky Way galaxy: Is the thick disk really a frozen entity? What is the metal-poor end of the thick disk? Are there any smaller components in the disk? What is the structure of the bulge and the halo?</p><p>To answer these questions one needs to measure astrometry for a large number of stars beyond the Solar neighbourhood and obtain high resolution spectra for chemical tagging of individual stars. The space observatory GAIA will measure astrometry for one billion stars up to mv~20. GAIA will also measure radial velocities for a large number of stars. Together with astrometry and radial velocity, it would be possible to construct a 3-D view of our Galaxy and identify the distinct components based on kinematic motion. Chemical tagging of individual stars of different kinematic groups would help understand better the evolution of the Galaxy in a chronological order, its merger history etc. due to the expanding scope of faint and old stars that can be observed with the TMT.</p></div>

Undoubtedly, many more such galaxies are orbiting the Milky Way that are currently beyond our ability to detect. Segue 2, is the least massive galaxy in the known universe consisting of about 1000 stars with dark matter holding them together. Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of 25 members of Segue 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b366">Kirby et al. 2013b</ref>) revealed that the stars' [alpha/Fe] ratios decline with increasing [Fe/H], indicating that Segue 2 retained Type Ia supernova ejecta despite its presently small mass and that star formation lasted at least for 100 Myr. The mean metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -2) was found to be higher than expected from the luminosity-metallicity relation defined by more luminous dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way. The dynamical and chemical characteristics of Segue 2 are suggestive of two possible scenarios for its formation: Segue 2 may be the barest remnant of a tidally stripped, Ursa Minor-sized galaxy that came to be ultra-faint through tidal stripping. Gravitational interaction with the Milky Way's gravitational potential removed nearly all of its stars and dark matter halo, leaving only the dense center of the galaxy. Further studies and simulations are needed to test whether tidal stripping of a dSph with the stellar mass of Ursa Minor could produce Segue 2. Alternatively, Segue 2 could have been born in a very low mass dark matter subhalo. fainter satellites. Some of these may have velocity dispersions too small to be resolved with mediumresolution, multi object spectrographs. The TMT equipped with a high resolution spectrograph will provide the essential combination of light collecting area and spectral resolution required for measurements of the velocities of the fainter, more common stars in Segue 2, as well as in yet undiscovered galaxies like it, and measure their dynamical masses.</p></div>

The orbital timescales of these halo stars are very long compared to the age of the Galaxy, thus the phase-space structure of the stellar halo is intimately linked to its accretion history. The extreme radial extent of halo stars, well beyond the baryonic center of the Galaxy, makes them excellent tracers of the dark matter halo.  relaxation, and may indicate the presence of a shell-type structure at a distance of ~24kpc ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure  7</ref>.9). Rather than a constant or continuous decline, the velocity anisotropy is found to have a `dip' at 20 kpc. The location of this`dipthis`dip' is coincident with a break in the stellar halo density. Although the origin of the break radius is still uncertain, Deason et al suggest that the break radius in the Milky Way may be due to a shell-type structure built up from the aggregation of accreted stars at apocenter.</p><p>An independent measure of velocity anisotropy is vital to derive the mass profile of our Galaxy. A measure of the tangential motion of the distant halo stars will allow astronomers to address whether or not this cold radial velocity dispersion is due to a shift in pressure from radial to tangential components. Currently, using multi-epoch HST images seems to be the only way to measure velocity anisotropy at these large distances. The GAIA mission will measure proper motions for an unprecedented number of halo stars with V &lt; 20, and will likely revolutionize our understanding of the inner stellar halo. However, even with bright halo tracers (e.g. Blue Horizontal Branch or carbon stars), the PM accuracy of GAIA ~0.3 mas/year will be unable to accurately constrain the tangential motion of very distant halo stars.</p><p>In the ideal case, one would like to directly measure the tangential motion of the halo stars. At large distances in the halo, 10 -100 kpc, a tangential velocity of 100 km/s would correspond to a proper motion on the sky of 2 -0.2 mas/year. This requires an astrometric accuracy that is un-feasible for current PM surveys. TMT is likely to enable such studies with desired accuracy.</p></div>

The surviving ultra-faint dwarfs are the least luminous and most dark matter-dominated galaxies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b658">Simon et al. 2007</ref>) and they possess very few stars despite containing some extremely metal-poor stars.

They carried out a critical examination of the possible mode of formation of this system in the halo (R ~ 30 kpc, Z ~ -10 kpc), by comparing the ratio of RR Lyraes to M giants with other structures in the Galaxy. They found that unlike any of the known satellites of the Milky Way, this ratio for Tri And gives a value more like the population of stars born in the much deeper potential well inhibited by the Galactic disk. N-body simulations of a Milky Way like galaxy perturbed by an impact of a dwarf galaxy demonstrate that, in the right circumstances, concentric rings propagating outwards from that of the Galactic disk can plausibly produce similar over-densities. These results provide support for the recent proposal by <ref type="bibr" target="#b777">Xu et al.

So, the isotopic abundance of these elements are more fundamental indicators of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis and can be directly compared to r-process and s-process predictions without the smearing effect of multiple isotopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">Mashonkina et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b462">Mashonkina et al. , 2006</ref>). The combination of Ba, Nd, Sm and Eu isotopic fractions can provide more complete knowledge of the ncapture nucleosynthesis, constrain the conditions (e.g., temperature, neutron density, etc.) that are required to produce the r-process elements, and determine the actual r-process path by identifying the individual isotopes that participate in this process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b613">Roederer et al. 2008</ref>). To reconstruct the evolutionary history of neutron-rich elements in the Galaxy it is thus important to extend our study to the isotopic level. Along lines of sight with low interstellar reddening, HROS will enable high-precision measurements of the isotopic ratios of Li, C, Mg, Ba, and Eu throughout the Milky Way, its globular cluster system, and its halo.</p></div>

Based on seven chronometer abundance ratios, the age of HE 1523-001, the metal-poor star with the strongest enhancement in neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process that has been found thus far <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">(Figure 7.13)</ref>, was found to be ~13 Gyr <ref type="bibr">(Febel, 2010)</ref>. The lead abundance is usually measured using the Pb I line at 4057.81 Å. High resolution &gt; 90K is required to separate the Pb I 4057.81 Å line from a CH line lying less than 0.1 Å blueward. For a number of r-process metal-poor stars stellar ages have been derived using Th/Eu chronometer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b667">Sneden et al. 1996</ref>). These age estimates range from ~11 to 14 billion years and provide a lower limit to the age of the galaxy. With the TMT, lines due to these elements could be measured more easily in fainter old stars than can be done with existing 8-10m telescopes, thus reducing the uncertainties in the age estimate. Measurement of isotopic ratios provides a completely new window into nucleosynthesis, galactic chemical evolution, mixing within stars and stellar evolution. Such data, when available, significantly improves our understanding of nuclear processes in various astrophysical sites. However, as the isotopic shift is very small at optical wavelengths, very high spectral resolution and S/N (R ~90,000, S/N ~200) are required to measure isotopic ratios in stellar spectra.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.2">Probing chemical evolution in Local Group dwarf galaxies</head><p>CDM simulations of the growth of galaxy structure suggest that halos of the galaxies like the Milky Way have accreted (and subsequently destroyed) 10s to 100s of small, dwarf galaxies in the past 10 Gyr. However, detailed stellar atmosphere analyses of individual red giant branch (RGB) stars in current day Local Group dwarf galaxies show very little in common with the chemistry of stars in the Milky Way halo, disk, bulge, and moving groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b736">Venn et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b517">Navarro et al. 2004</ref>). Furthermore, the number of surviving dwarf galaxies in the immediate neighborhood of the Milky Way is far lower than predicted.</p><p>To resolve these questions it is necessary to investigate environmental differences between the various dwarf galaxies, detailed examination of the kinematics, metallicities, and abundance ratios of stars in dwarf galaxies beyond the Milky Way halo. With TMT/HROS, it will be possible to carry out detailed abundance analyses of stars at or just above the tip of the red giant branch throughout the Local Group. For example, current generation high-resolution spectrographs on 8 -10m telescopes have been able to study tens of stars in Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies at V = 17 -18 with exposure times up to 14 hours. Those systems lie as far away as 250 kpc. TMT/HROS will be able to obtain similar results for stars at V ~ 20 in more distant (~ 400 -500 kpc) and hence more isolated systems. These optical measurements can be supported by K-band measurements -TMT/NIRES can easily reach below the tip of the red giant branch throughout the Local Group (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_29">Table 7</ref>-1). Such K-band measurements will be invaluable for CNO abundance measurements. With such data, the chemistry of the old stellar population in dwarf irregular galaxies (which tend to be more distant and more isolated satellites of the Milky Way) can be compared directly to the old populations of the dwarf spheroidals and Magellanic Clouds. These latter systems are within the dark matter halo of the Milky Way and are thought to have been interacting with the Galaxy over most of their lifetimes, likely affecting star formation histories and chemical evolutions. A comparison with cleaner, more isolated dwarf irregulars will allow us to establish and characterize, for the first time, the effects of environment on chemical evolution through the chemical similarities and differences in old populations. To compare dwarf irregular galaxies to the Galactic halo and other Local Group dwarf galaxies, and test their impact on merging hypotheses of galaxy formation, detailed chemical analyses of their old RGB stars is required.</p><p>Analysis of spectra of young giant stars in nearby active star forming galaxies in the Local Group has become possible in the past decade due to a combination of observational data from 8 -10 m telescopes and advances in model atmosphere techniques. The latter include the development of non-LTE hydrodynamic 3D extended stellar atmospheres, necessary to understand absorption features influenced by supersonic outflowing stellar winds. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_29">Table 7</ref>-1, observations with TMT will extend these studies to very large distances allowing the investigation of a variety of star formation environments and galaxy morphologies.</p><p>Sophisticated models of galactic chemical evolution are based on nucleosynthetic yields of various elements from each of the possible sources together with the amount of mass ejected from each of these sources, all as a function of stellar initial mass (and to a lesser extent stellar initial metal content). These are folded in with assumptions regarding gas flows within the galaxy and possible accretion of primordial material. Formation rates and an initial mass function for stars, both as a function of time, must be adopted as well. Prediction of trends of abundance ratios within the galaxy as a function of location require knowledge of any dependencies of all of these inputs on position as well as an assumption regarding migration of stars within the galaxy.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure 7</ref>.16 shows the same for the ironpeak element Co. The solid lines are predictions for Galactic chemical evolution by <ref type="bibr" target="#b579">Prantzos (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b579">Prantzos ( , 2014</ref>). The gentle rise towards lower Fe-metallicity is generally ascribed to the difference in characteristic timescale for SNII, the major production site for the alpha-elements, as compared to SNIa, where most Fe is produced. The former is much shorter than the latter, which may be as long as ~1 Gyr after the initiation of star formation.</p><p>Although creating a model of galactic chemical evolution requires many assumptions, it does work most of the time. In other words, such models can reproduce in a general way most observed trends of abundance ratios with time since the formation of the Milky Way with what are agreed to be involved reasonable input data. Such models, with different inputs, justified by observational data, also appear to work for the nearby galaxies, although our knowledge of their stellar populations and their chemical inventory is much more limited than is that for our own galaxy. TMT will make a major contribution to improve our knowledge of the chemical evolution of nearby galaxies. In the TMT era, high dispersion spectroscopy using HROS and NIRES will enable detailed abundance analyses with high accuracy for individual stars in the outer parts of the nearest groups of galaxies, including the M81 group, and for the brightest globular clusters well beyond the Virgo cluster. We will then finally obtain a full picture of the chemical evolution of the nearest galaxy groups out to the Virgo cluster, and be able to compare it to that of the Milky Way. There must be a problem either in the nuclear yields or in the stellar abundance analysis. (Source: J. Cohen)</p></div>

TMT has the potential to obtain spectra of stars with r=20-21 at S/N~50 and R=15,000 or greater (once HROS is implemented). WFOS will have multislit spectroscopy of a field of order 3X3 arcmin or greater, sufficient to cover the size of ultrafaint dwarfs (UFDs) in the Milky Way, or dwarf galaxies in M31. For the TMT, the Andromeda/M33 system becomes available for study in much the same way that the Magellanic Clouds have been unveiled for 8m class telescopes.</p><p>One of the striking accomplishments of our current era of 6.5-10m class telescopes is that moderate to high resolution spectroscopy of stars to as faint as V=18.5 has become routine. The multi-object fiber-fed FLAMES at VLT has made high resolution investigation of hundreds of stars in the bulge and globular clusters a routine program. Keck with HIRES and MIKE at Magellan have delivered high dispersion spectra of metal poor stars in the halo and dwarf spheroidals. Experiments that push the limits of high dispersion spectroscopy are underway to get spectra of thousands of giants in dwarfs and also to derive composition from the integrated light spectra of globular clusters in M31 and beyond. This study will include all populations in M31, including the bulge.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">Koch et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The TMT with high resolution spectrographs places us on the threshold of investigating chemical evolution throughout the Local Group and by using globular cluster integrated light, throughout the Local Volume. Such work can address the cause for the multiple subclasses of metal poor stars (e.g. carbon enhanced) and chemical oddball stars, and one can ask whether the picture of chemical evolution seen in our Milky Way halo extends to the Local Group, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">Figure 7</ref>.17.</p><p>Some cherished ideas are under challenge. Is the "knee" in the [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] trend where elemental trends move toward Solar scaled composition, due to the onset of iron produced in Type I SNe? Or is the knee arising from the natural metallicity dependent yields of massive star SNe? Is our now roughly 40 year old depiction of chemical evolution therefore in need of major restatement? What is the full range of primordial chemical enhancements that are observable in various stellar systems? Although the broad brush description of chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis is well known, it is clear that many aspects of nucleosynthesis are poorly understood and our best hope for pushing theoretical work is new observations. Large improvements in our modeling of stellar atmospheres are expected soon as non-LTE 3D models will become available in large grids within the next few years.</p></div>

While a range of morphological types are present, the statistics are poor and some notable galactic types are entirely absent (in particular massive elliptical galaxies). The resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope pushes such studies out to distances of several megaparsecs, improving statistics and sampling a broader range of galaxy type. But even here such studies are limited, and importantly the galaxies still sample the rather benign environment of our local cosmic neighborhood. Only with the collecting power and exquisite spatial resolution of TMT can resolved stellar population studies come of age and reveal the evolutionary histories of galaxies at all luminosities and morphologies, spanning a complete range of environment, from isolated systems, through loose groups, to groups and clusters.</p><p>Studies of the integrated light of galaxies necessarily rely on stellar population synthesis to reproduce the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the galaxy. The galaxy's light represents the sum-total of the baryonic evolution of the system over cosmic time, and is contributed to by stars of varying mass and of varying age, the proportions of which depend upon the star formation history specific to that galaxy. In this respect, the star formation history is one of the most significant uncertainties in these studies.</p></div>

However, progress with obtaining good CMDs within more massive galaxies (or their denser sub-components) has been limited by stellar crowding. Recently, higher spatial resolution observations have become possible using near-IR adaptive optics systems on ground-based 8 -10m class telescopes. By scaling up to 30m and implementing AO systems with improved performance, TMT will enable another giant step forward. The calculations demonstrate that TMT will be able to resolve individual stars in regions with Σ K = 19 mag arcsec -2 in galaxies as far away as 15 Mpc. Of course, as distance increases, the required photometric accuracy becomes more difficult and only feasible for the intrinsically brightest stars.</p><p>A long sought goal is to construct a deep CMD for a normal elliptical galaxy.

The high resolution of TMT will help us observe, model and understand the chemical evolution of these low luminosity disks. Also, TMT IRMOS-IFU integral-field spectroscopy would be able to map SFR to a much higher level of resolution than current Hα imaging (where, again, resolution is sacrificed for S/N). Although LSB galaxies are gas rich their dark halos lead to low star formation rates and hence overall lower luminosities. The low luminosity and low stellar surface density makes the disks difficult to study, especially the galaxies at larger distances and beyond our local universe.

The spatial extent of star formation in high-z (U)LIRGs more resembles local LIRGs than local ULIRGs. With diffraction limited resolution (λ/D = 0.008′′ at the 1.2µm), TMT/IRIS will reveal the morphology and gas conditions in low-z LIRGs with a physical scale of ~15 pc at 1.2µm at the luminosity distance (d L ) of ~400 Mpc (or z = 0.088, the largest distance for IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample; <ref type="bibr" target="#b621">Sanders et al., 2003)</ref>.

In addition, where an AGN exists, the high resolving power of TMT will be able to distinguish the emission from the AGN and nuclear star formation. With a planned spectral resolution of R = 4000 (potentially R = 8000) for IRIS, we will be able to resolve diagnostic emission lines, and together with a spatial resolution that is better than HST, we will be able to disentangle heating from young stars, shocks and AGN in hundreds of starburst galaxies.</p><p>High resolution TMT observations of molecular hydrogen, H 2 , together with atomic hydrogen emission lines will provide new insights into the molecular gas temperature and density structure of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), the primary heating and cooling processes, and the mechanism of H 2 formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b693">Sugai et al., 1997</ref>) on a scale of each individual HII regions in the local universe.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">THE BIRTH AND EARLY LIVES OF STARS AND PLANETS</head><p>Formation of stars is the principal driver of galaxy evolution and chemical enrichment in the Universe, which in turn affects the process of star birth. On the other hand, it also provides the sites of planet formation and development of life. Therefore, understanding how stars and planets form has long been one of the central problems in astrophysics. In fact, significant progress has been seen especially in the last decades, but the detailed processes are still quite elusive. ALMA, JWST, and next generation instruments on ground-based telescopes will yield further scientific advances prior to the TMT's first light. However, we definitely need TMT to have unprecedented angular resolution with very high sensitivity in near-to mid-infrared, which is critical for this science topic. TMT, with the great complementarity with those telescopes and instruments, will provide a big step forward to more complete understanding of star and planet formation as outlined in this chapter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">STAR FORMATION</head><p>Star formation is a fundamental astrophysical process; and yet we still lack a quantitative and predictive theory for how stars and clusters form <ref type="bibr" target="#b392">(Krumholz 2014</ref>). Amongst the key ingredients for building such a theory are observations of young star clusters over a wide range of environments that can be used as benchmarks to test star formation models. Young clusters serve as laboratories with controlled conditions (same age, metallicity, distance, initial conditions) and many stars to sample the distributions of stellar masses, kinematics, and multiplicities that arise during the star formation process. The requisite range of initial conditions in metallicity, external pressure, cloud mass/density, and environment can only be found outside of our own Galaxy where studying clusters in detail has been extremely challenging. Fortunately, TMT's spatial resolution and sensitivity will allow individual young stars to be spatially resolved, even in the largest star clusters, within a wide range of environments throughout the Local Group galaxies and beyond. TMT observations of young clusters, which are the output of the star formation process, will complement ALMA studies of the gas clumps and cores that are the input to the star-formation process.</p><p>In the section below, we highlight TMT science cases for measuring the initial mass function (IMF), internal kinematics, and multiplicity in young clusters, followed by the sections focusing on high-and low-mass ends of the IMF. These observations will help constrain star formation theories such that reliable predictions can be incorporated into models of planet formation, stellar evolution, galaxy formation and evolution, and cosmology.</p></div>

The Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law establishes a correlation between the integrated rate of star formation and the surface density of dense gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b631">(Schmidt 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kennicut 1998</ref>) in extra-galactic sources. <ref type="bibr">Heiderman et al.

Other smaller-scale (≲100 pc) measurements also tend to show the deviation from the K-S law or the larger scatter, which may be plausible since high angular resolution distinguishes local, inhomogeneous distribution of dense gas and stars. The problem is that the current spatial resolution is not enough small to explore the cause of the observed behavior. One way to tackle this issue is going to finer scales to have a more comprehensive understanding of the IMF by resolving stellar populations (providing a more accurate yield of star formation), and to know the local star-forming environment (e.g, metallicity, radiation TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

This is the area where a 30 m-class telescope, with AO, has a real niche in the field of star-formation; HST and its successors including JWST are less competitive due to their significantly smaller mirror diameters. </p></div>

(2003)</ref>. The K-band magnitudes are for crowding limited photometry to 10% accuracy. The input luminosity function used for these calculations is a hybrid based on measurements in the Arches cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Blum et al. 2001</ref>) for the high-mass stars (≥ 2 M ¤ ) and measurements in the Trapezium by <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">Hillenbrand &amp; Carpenter (2000)</ref> for the low-mass stars (≤ 3 M ¤ ). The Arches radial profile is a re-fit to HST data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Blum et al.

TMT will allow us to probe the brown-dwarf, and even the planetary-mass regime in young clusters at distances of several kpc. It will also enable investigations of the low-mass (≲1 M ¤ ) stellar regime in a representative slice of the Universe, including the nearest large spiral galaxies (M31 and M33) (Table 8-1) and the very low-metallicity environments provided by Local Group galaxies such as NGC 6822 and IC 10. Preliminary results for the low-mass IMF in the Magellanic Clouds suggests that metallicity-related differences affecting the shape of the stellar mass distribution require significantly lower metallicities to become apparent (e.g., da <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Rio et al. 2009</ref>). The stellar density in a given cluster, which is another environmental parameter, can be retrieved from such resolved observations, enabling us to establish the relationship with emerging stellar mass.</p><p>Based on the expected performance of the IRIS IFU, it will also be possible to obtain spectra of stars with masses significantly smaller than 1 M ¤ at the Galactic Center, while the mass limit lies at ~10 M ¤ with current 10 m class telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b426">Lu et al. 2013</ref>). With TMT, the similar detection limit as currently obtained in the center of the Milky Way can be achieved in the Local Group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">(Figure 8.1)</ref>. ALMA, on the other hand, will provide superb spatial resolution at complementary, dust-penetrating (sub-)millimeter wavelengths. This is a fortunate situation, as it will allow us to probe right into the core of the most active, dust-enshrouded star-forming regions, covering the entire useful wavelength range from the infrared to millimeter waves. This will potentially help solve the key outstanding issue of how star formation occurs, proceeds, and is triggered, as well as the importance of the interaction between the newly-born stars and their environments. We will be able to study the early evolution and the transformation from the youngest star-forming cluster-like regions to more mature, partiallyvirialized systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Kinematic evolution</head><p>Young stars within a star-forming region interact with each other in complex ways. Simulations of star cluster evolution generally assume that the stars are initially smoothly distributed and in dynamical equilibrium. However, both observations and theories tell us that this may not be how clusters form. Emerging evidence suggests that star formation in molecular cloud cores follows a spatial distribution imprinted by the properties of the prevailing turbulence, which can be conveniently approximated by a fractal (clumpy) distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Bastian et al. 2009</ref>); numerical simulations of such initial stellar distributions suggest rapid subsequent formation of dense cluster cores by the collapse of protoclusters, given the expected cool (subvirial) dynamical conditions in such environments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Allison et al. 2009</ref>). Dynamical mass segregation is predicted for stellar masses down to a few M ¤ on timescales of a few Myr during the collapse.</p><p>To answer the question of the nature of early dynamical mass segregation, precise mass, position and velocity measurements are required. It is also critical to systematically study the most likely initial conditions for cluster formation which lead to the observed configurations. The radial density profiles of young and embedded clusters can shed light on the structure of those clusters. Colors can help classify types of young stellar objects to trace the progress of star formation and help distinguish between different star formation models. Analytical techniques like the nearest-neighbor method for infrared-excess stars can be used to identify structures in star-forming regions. Those data can show if clusters are expanding or contracting. The TMT instruments, IRIS, WFOS, NIRES, and in particular MICHI will play a very important role on this subject with the very high angular resolution (~10 AU at 140 pc at 10 µm) and the capability of high-dispersion (R~100,000) spectroscopy.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015 8.2.3 Multiplicity</head><p>The multiplicity properties of young stars offer a powerful diagnostic of the star formation process. The binary fraction has been shown to be a function of primary mass, with nearly 100% of the highest mass stars having companions, down to a mere ~20% for brown dwarfs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b589">Raghavan et al. 2010</ref>). The multiplicity fraction also seems to be a function of stellar age and environment, with younger stars exhibiting a generally higher multiplicity fraction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Duchêne 1999)</ref>. It has also been demonstrated that the mass ratio distribution is roughly constant except amongst the lowest mass objects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Duchêne &amp; Kraus 2013)</ref>. These multiplicity statistics inform our understanding of the overall star formation process, as different formation theories often make different predictions for the multiplicity fraction as a function of mass and environment (e.g., Bate 2012).</p><p>Although recent technological advances allowed for the charting of new realms of parameter space, significant uncertainties still exist in the distribution of all types of binaries at all separations. In particular, the range of period/separation space typically left unprobed by current spatially resolved imaging or radial velocity monitoring is log(P) ≥ 3 and/or ρ ≤ 0.05 arcsec <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Duchêne &amp; Kraus 2013)</ref>. This regime is easily observable with any diffraction-limited imager on TMT, such as IRIS. Furthermore, TMT's unparalleled spatial resolution will allow us to resolve known spectroscopic binaries, a niche previously only available to long baseline interferometry. The combination of astrometry and spectroscopic orbital monitoring provides a means of measuring component masses, which are essential for calibrating theoretical evolutionary models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Hillenbrand &amp; White 2004</ref>). In addition, instruments such as PFI and/or SEIT will discover high contrast ratio binaries, such as brown dwarfs around O or B type stars, at separations unachievable with current generation high contrast imagers. This will fill in currently unknown regions of mass ratio parameter space.</p><p>There is tantalizing evidence of differing multiplicity fractions for stellar types as a function of environment. It has been suggested that the density of a star-forming environment will ultimately drive the final multiplicity fractions. Dense, high mass environments may trigger dynamical interactions that ionize binaries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Bonnell et al. 2003</ref>) or disrupt disks before they have a chance to collapse and form low mass companions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b794">Zinnecker &amp; Yorke 2007)</ref>. The resolution and sensitivity of TMT will also allow us to push multiplicity surveys to more distant, and often more massive, star-forming region such that the statistics match those of nearby regions such as Taurus and Upper Scorpius (~150 pc, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b388">Kraus et al. 2011</ref>). Current AO-fed instruments on 8-10 m class telescopes can achieve physical separation limits of ~7 AU for these regions. With TMT, the equivalent will be achievable for star-forming regions as distant as ~2 kpc, encompassing clusters such as M8, M16, and M20. Furthermore, instruments such as HROS and NIRES will vastly improve our identification of spectroscopic binaries in star forming regions, particularly for the lowest mass objects that are too faint to target with current instrumentation. By achieving new statistics on more star forming regions, TMT with IRIS, PFI/SEIT, HROS, and NIRES will offer a new window into the complicated dynamical processes during star formation that ultimately drives the multiplicity fraction we observe amongst field objects.</p><p>An additional niche of TMT will be its ability to probe the multiplicity of Class I protostars with high resolution using instruments like MICHI. Catching binaries shortly after formation has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the binary formation process. Thus far, the multiplicity statistics of this class of objects are poorly constrained over a limited set of regions and separations (~50-2000 AU, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Connelley et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Connelley et al. , 2009</ref>. Probing closer separations has thus far been limited in spatial resolution or spectral sensitivity. With MICHI, binaries with separations &lt;20 AU will be resolvable visually in nearby star forming regions. With the high-resolution spectroscopy mode of MICHI and the sensitivity of TMT, radial velocity variables will also be identifiable, providing important statistics on the tight binary frequency in this regime. For this science case, TMT offers a unique complement to JWST and ALMA. TMT will have superior spatial resolution for visual binary identification. ALMA will achieve similar statistics for even more embedded Class 0 protostars, providing an important comparison sample for Class I objects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.1">Formation of high-mass stars</head><p>Massive stars impact many astrophysical systems, including forming galaxies, their interstellar media, young star clusters and protoplanetary disks therein. Several theories for massive star formation are debated: core accretion, competitive accretion, and stellar collisions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b697">Tan et al. 2014</ref>). These vary in their assumptions about how material is accreted to the protostar and thus make different predictions for the structure of the gas envelope, the accretion disk, outflows, and possibly binary properties and (low-mass) protostellar crowding around the forming massive protostar.</p><p>TMT can make several important contributions to our understanding of massive protostellar environments. First, high resolution NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) imaging will reveal the structures of heated dust around massive protostars, which can arise from the accretion envelope, accretion disk (including spiral structure and binary companions forming in the disk), outflow cavities and other protostellar companions forming as part of a fragmenting protocluster. Typical Galactic massive protostars are at ~3 kpc (the closest is in Orion KL at ~400 pc), so structures on ~1000 AU scales, e.g. approximately corresponding to disk diameters, extend over ~0.3 arcsec. IRIS and MICHI will enable dramatic improvements over current observations of NIR (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b579">Preibisch et al. 2011</ref>) and MIR (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">de Wit et al. 2009</ref>) dust continuum from massive protostars, first by having a factor of three better angular resolution compared with current 8-10 m class telescopes and second by being sensitive to fainter emission features (coronographic capabilities will be useful to block compact emission from the target protostar to help reveal disk, envelope and outflow structures). These images will constrain radiative transfer simulations of massive protostars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b786">Zhang et al. 2014</ref>). Galactic massive protostars are bright, so it will be necessary to check that saturation is not a problem. In addition, imaging at wavelengths of 24 µm or longer may be feasible (potentially differentiating TMT from other ELTs), increasing the wavelength range over which radiative transfer models can be constrained. Galactic massive star-forming regions often have relatively extended MIR morphologies, requiring relatively large chop throw angles of ≳30 arcsec. IRIS IFU and/or MIR studies of Galactic ultra-compact HII regions have the potential to reveal their kinematic structure in unprecedented detail, and this can help to discriminate between different formation and feedback models: e.g., Is the ionized gas associated with outflows, accretion flows or both? How ordered/symmetric are the accretion and outflow structures around massive protostars? Such questions could begin to be addressed by a survey of the nearest ~30 massive protostars that sample a range of luminosities/masses and star-forming environments, ideally with a velocity resolution reaching or exceeding ~10 km/s (i.e. R~30,000).</p></div>

While the distinction between stars and brown dwarfs is clear enough by taking hydrogen-burning limit as the boundary, the mass boundary with planets is still vague. Various works have adopted the criteria of free-floating objects above the deuteriumburning limit (~13 M Jup ) to distinguish brown dwarfs from planets, though the discovery of freefloating planets seems to have further muddied the water. While there is an overall consensus on the formation of stars (molecular cloud collapse) and planets orbiting parent stars (accretion of planetesimals in the circumstellar disk), the formation mechanisms of BDs and free-floating planets are still puzzling. The main sticking point of the BD formation appears to be the fact that a much larger molecular gas density than observed is required for the low Jeans mass of BDs. Explanation for this has necessitated invocation of scenarios such as dense core ejection and turbulent fragmentation. Free-floating, planetary-mass objects may represent an extension of BDs sharing the same formation process, but it is also possible to attribute them to dynamical ejection from planetary systems forming around stars via mutual gravitational interaction between multiple planets.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Chabrier (2005)</ref> with the normalization to roughly match the data.

For comparison, Peña <ref type="bibr" target="#b561">Ramírez et al. (2012)</ref> have reached the lowest mass of 6 M Jup with a 4 m telescope, thus TMT will enable us to study sources with the completeness going down to or lower than the Jupiter mass in nearer clusters. We can hence obtain statistically significant samples of candidate BDs and giant planets, then examine and compare a number of properties (such as SED slopes) to distinguish between BDs, free-floating planets, and bound planets (see also Chapter 10). This could help in solving the long standing confusion over whether a source is to be considered a BD or a giant planet.</p><p>The bottom of the IMF has long been a significant topic of analysis. Though there is wider consensus on the high mass end, the sub-stellar end still needs significant observations and proper analysis <ref type="figure">(Figure 8.2)</ref>. Spectroscopy is important to better constrain the IMF as it provides more reliable estimate of temperature, thus mass and age, compared to using photometric color information. Alves de <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Oliveira et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Oliveira et al. ( , 2013</ref> have carried out such a study in the ρ Ophiuchi and the IC 348 regions. They have achieved the detection limit of the order of ~10 M Jup using various telescopes. Much deeper samples can certainly be obtained with TMT, especially in close-by stellar clusters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b632">Scholz et al. 2012</ref>). It should also be noted that constraining the multiplicity could play a key role in IMF determinations (Section 8.2.3).</p><p>In addition, spectroscopy of BD candidates enables us to detect signatures from accretion disks/jets/outflows as well as chemical properties, thus help in understanding if they form in any manner similar to stars. Thus far, it has been difficult to do this on a statistically significant basis due to the lack of BD candidates. With TMT, BDs of ~1 Myr with 13 M Jup at the distance of a few kpc can be observed in NIR spectroscopy, depending on the amount of visual extinction, which will greatly enlarge the current BD sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">YOUNG PLANET-FORMING DISKS</head><p>Protoplanetary disks are flattened rotating structures of gas and dust, formed as a natural outcome of star formation process. They are the birth places of planets, and hence provide the initial condition of planet building including density and temperature distributions of disk material which are the ingredients for planets and possibly life. Disks also interact with newly-born planets, resulting in redistribution of gas and dust or orbital migration of planets. After most gas dissipates, evolution of a planetary system is expected to further proceed, such as with violent orbital re-configuration and growth of rocky bodies in debris disks around young main-sequence stars (see Section 10.2). Therefore, observational understanding of young disks is essential to address the questions of when, where, and how planets form and evolve?</p><p>What is most critical for disk observations is high angular resolution. It is required to spatially resolve the local physical and chemical conditions in a disk to finally constrain planet formation theories. In this respect, there is no doubt that TMT will play a major role in this science field, providing a resolution of ~1 AU at 1 µm for disks in the nearest star-forming regions at 140 pc. The high sensitivity of TMT allows us to significantly increase the sample size for resolved observations and to discuss any dependence in planet formation as a function of stellar properties. The list of diskbearing objects has been growing thanks to Spitzer, AKARI, Hershel, and WISE (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Evans et al. 2009</ref>), thus it is not hard at all to extract hundreds of targets for TMT.</p><p>The inner (≲10 AU) regions of protoplanetary disks are particularly interesting. Given the abundance of exoplanets, we know that protoplanets must be common in the 0.5-10 AU range ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>), while current direct detection surveys show that they are rare beyond ~30 AU (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Chauvin et al. 2010</ref>). These inner regions also intersect the habitable zone of their parent stars. Such inner disks can be resolved either directly, or kinematically where the (nearly) Keplerian rotation of disks can be used to separate disk regions in velocity (and hence radius). Spectro-astrometry is another advanced, promising technique to probe spatial scales much smaller than the nominal spatial resolution. Given the expected temperatures of these disks, atomic and molecular lines of interest will lie between 1 and 25 µm. The classical infrared "finger-print" region contains transitions from many molecular species, including important bulk tracers, such as water, CO and CO 2 , as well as a potentially long list of organic species (HCN, C 2 H 2 , CH 4 , etc.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">(Figure 8.3</ref>).</p><p>Disk observations, including detection of footprints of planets, can be extensively done from the early phase of TMT without coronagraphy. As high contrast 2nd generation instruments become available on TMT, lots of detections of exoplanets will be expected.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.1">Planet formation vs. host star properties</head><p>The diversity of exoplanets and circumstellar disks seen thus far is, in many cases, related to properties of the stellar hosts. Metallicity is strongly correlated with the presence of giant planets but not necessarily small planets. Warm debris disks, indicative of collisions between planetesimals near the star in asteroid-like belts, are much more common (by a factor of ten or more) around intermediate mass stars than solar mass stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b690">Su et al. 2006</ref>). Debris disks are also surprisingly frequent for binary star systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b720">Trilling et al. 2007)</ref>, and the Kepler survey confirms that planets around and within multiple star systems are present, although the statistics are not yet robust ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Armstrong et al. 2014</ref>). All of these observations indicate that properties of the host star strongly influence protoplanetary disks and their evolutionary paths towards new planetary systems.</p><p>With an inner working angle of approximately 70 mas using high contrast coronagraphy, TMT will be able to detect young planets in K and L bands within disks found by Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel in nearby star-forming regions and young associations out to the distance of Orion, greatly expanding the range of stellar properties that can be directly related to characteristics of disks and planets. In some cases these planets may be detectable spectroscopically with TMT, so atmospheric composition of the planet may be compared with the abundances of the host star. Although TMT may not have the mid-infrared power of JWST or cryogenic space surveys for detecting disks, with high quality AO correction it can resolve the sources of near and mid-infrared excess emission from young stars in crowded fields and tight multiples. TMT will also have the ability to resolve sharp structures within disks and will be especially powerful for study of the gaps in transitional disks. For distant star-forming regions, TMT will obtain metallicities and spectral types for stars with disks, as well as resolving their multiplicity.</p></div>

The timescale for gas dissipation provides a valuable upper limit on the timescale for giant planet formation, as giant planets must accrete their gaseous envelopes on a shorter timescale than this. The dissipation of the gaseous disk also limits the time available to circularize terrestrial planet orbits through interactions with the gas disk. For example, if the late stages of terrestrial planet formation occur during an epoch when the disk has a surface density ~0.01-0.1% that of the minimum mass solar nebula, planets with the masses and eccentricities of Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury can be produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b376">(Kominami &amp; Ida 2002)</ref>.</p><p>While stellar accretion rates, which are known to decline with age (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fig 2 of Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2010)</ref>, measure the amount of disk gas that reaches the star, it is difficult to be certain how much gas remains in the disk without an understanding of the mechanisms that drive disk accretion. Hence what is needed is in situ measurements of the gaseous reservoir. As one example diagnostic, the 12.8 µm [Ne II] line is appealing because Ne is expected to remain in the gas phase; [Ne II] is expected to be ionized and heated by stellar X-rays, which are long lived compared to the expected gas dissipation timescale, and the 12.8 µm line is expected to robustly probe small column densities of gas (N H ~ 10 19 -10 20 cm − 2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Glassgold et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The 4.7 µm CO fundamental rovibrational lines are also attractive diagnostics of the gaseous disk at larger column densities. The high abundance of CO in disks and the modest A-values of the fundamental transitions have made them a reliable and often used tracer of the inner regions of disks surrounding T Tauri stars and Herbig Ae/Be stars. A versatile diagnostic, the formation of CO is robust in disks even in the absence of grains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Glassgold et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Bruderer 2013)</ref>, and the transitions can be excited into emission by UV fluorescence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Brittain et al. 2009</ref>), IR pumping <ref type="bibr" target="#b577">(Pontoppidan &amp; Lockwood, 2015)</ref>, as well as thermally.</p><p>In addition to measuring the gas dissipation timescale, these diagnostics may also probe the dissipation process itself. Theoretical arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Ercolano &amp; Owen 2010)</ref> and blue-shifted line profiles (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sacco et al. 2012</ref>) suggest that photo-evaporative winds can be probed by <ref type="bibr">[Ne II]</ref>. The CO rovibrational lines can also show line profiles suggestive of a wind origin, suggesting its potential role in studying the gas dissipation process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b575">Pontoppidan et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The measurement of line profiles as well as spectro-astrometric signatures of these diagnostics can be used to determine where the emitting gas arises (disk or wind, and at what radii) and to constrain the gas reservoir in the disk as a function of stellar age. When combined with theoretical model predictions, these measurements could also be used to measure the rate of gas removal from the disk (e.g., the disk photo-evaporation rate).</p><p>Giant planet formation itself is another disk dissipation pathway and locating CO emission within a disk can be used to look for radial gaps created by planets (see next section). Constraints from the lack of UV fluoresced emission are particularly useful in showing that there are gaps in the gas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Brittain et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>

Once formed, the gap can excite instabilities due to the pressure gradient at its outer edge, resulting in dust traps which can be favorable locations of planetesimal formation and growth, providing the formation site of additional members of a young planetary system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b437">Lyra et al. 2009</ref>). Dynamical processes can also excite small-scale structures such as spiral waves either in association with instabilities or companions even for those insufficiently massive to carve a gap. In fact, via direct imaging with 8-10 m class telescopes, gaps have been uncovered in transitional disks of T Tauri and Herbig Fe/Ae/Be stars, while spirals were detected preferentially toward warmer disks around earlier type stars in scattered light (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b512">Muto et al. 2012</ref>). Yet, with the current instruments, the primary focus is still onto the disk regions of several tens of AU. New high-contrast instruments are now being delivered, but if their extreme AO systems are not equipped with laser guide stars, most T Tauri stars, which are relatively faint at optical wavelengths, will not be observable.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>Higher angular resolution and contrast, afforded by a 30 m class telescope with an advanced AO system, are the key to detect planetary signatures in the inner disk region and to resolve smallerscale structures. For instance, the typical requirement for the detection of spirals is to resolve the spatial scale comparable to the disk vertical thickness. In the case of nearby star-forming regions at 140 pc, the resolution of about 0.01 arcsec is needed to distinguish tightly-wound spirals at 30 AU in a colder T Tauri disk than Herbig systems, with the aspect ratio (the ratio of the scale height to the radius) of ~0.1. This can be confirmed in the simulations of disk scattered light <ref type="figure">(Figure 8.4</ref>) which demonstrate that TMT has an ability to reveal signatures of an embedded planet of ≲0.1 M Jup at ≲10 AU from the central star at 140 pc. A gap and spirals by a planet at 10 AU can be detected in the mode of direct imaging, preferably with polarimetry. Structures within 10 AU can be studied with the smaller inner working angle provided by PFI or SEIT. Furthermore, the innermost region lying beneath the coronagraphic mask or the bright stellar halo in NIR can be explored in thermal emission in MIR. The diffraction-limited resolution in N band is ~0.07 arcsec for TMT, which allows us to study distributions of warm dust with a spatial scale of about 0.02 arcsec, corresponding to 3 AU at 140 pc.</p><p>It is worth noting that multi-epoch observations are quite useful to put a strong constraint on planet location through disk dynamics. A spiral arm caused by a planet in a disk is expected to co-rotate with the planet, resulting in the pattern rotation velocity slightly different from the local Keplerian velocity. With the spatial resolution of TMT, the rotation of the spiral can be detected by observations several years apart if a planet is orbiting at 30 AU around a solar-mass star.</p><p>Near-and mid-infrared observations are sensitive to the distribution of small, micron-sized grains at the surface of an optically thick protoplanetary disk, while (sub-)mm observations probe large, mmsized grains in the mid-plane in the continuum as well as the gaseous component at various heights through line emission. The synergy of ALMA with TMT is thus of great importance to understand the 3D distribution of different components that make up the disk. Needless to say, such comprehensive understanding has a strong impact on theory of planet formation, and is critical to understanding the origin of the observed structures; a dust trap ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Birnstiel et al. 2013</ref>) or a planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b793">Zhu et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.7">GROWTH OF PLANETS</head><p>Giant planets form during the gas-rich protoplanetary disk phase with the first few million years after the formation of the central star. Beyond a certain mass, the forming protoplanet will interact with its natal disk in multiple ways that may lead to direct or indirect detections of the planet itself. A giant planet may open a gap in the gas disk, inducing local non-Keplerian velocity fields with characteristic structure and time variability. This has been proposed to create observable spectroscopic signatures in the 4.7 µm rovibrational CO lines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b600">Regály et al. 2014</ref>). The planet may form a relatively massive, moon-forming, circumplanetary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b431">Lubow et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b439">Machida et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Brittain et al. 2013</ref>), and it may even produce strong emission lines from accretion flows ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b791">Zhou et al. 2014</ref>). All of these tracers will be accessible to TMT. Indeed, they are already being pursued with existing 8-10 m class telescopes as well as with ALMA, and initial results are promising.</p><p>Therefore, while TMT may detect protoplanets through broad-band imaging of their thermal continuum emission, there is also the prospect of using kinematic gas tracers to detect the growth of giant protoplanets. TMT is able to detect gas tracers in the optical and infrared at very high spatial resolution; 40 mas for the four main CO isotopologues around 4.7 µm that trace the velocity field of the protoplanetary material, as well as a host of tracers of accretion onto the planet itself, including hydrogen recombination lines such as Brγ (2.16 µm).</p><p>It should be empathized that the detection of a gap-opening, accreting planet will have a strong impact on the theory of planet formation and migration. Measurements of the gas accretion rate onto a planet along with the depth and width of the gap are critical to know the angular momentum transfer rate through the gap, and therefore the final mass and type-II migration of the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b698">Tanaka et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Crida et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Fung et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

This is the dust originating in the inner region at ~1-10 AU where the habitable zone resides, and can be interpreted to be an evidence for ongoing, oligarchic growth of terrestrial bodies. The high spatial resolution of TMT will be critical in characterizing this terrestrial material to gain new unique insight into the building blocks and mechanisms of terrestrial planet formation. In nearby debris disks, imaging from K to N band will be capable of resolving the 1 AU region. The precise structure such as azimuthal asymmetries and sharp boundaries of the disk edges can inform us of the presence of planets and help establish the connection between the dust belt and planet formation/evolution activity.</p></div>

The formation of giant planet cores is believed to be enhanced because the solid surface density increases and the inward radial drift of solids may be slowed-down across the snow line ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Brauer et al. 2008)</ref>. It helps to explain why Jupiter-like gas giants are not the closest to the Sun in our Solar System. While the snow line is located at a radial distance of ~3 AU in the current Solar System, it may have been as close as ~0.7 AU in the early, optically thick phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">(Garaud &amp; Lin 2007)</ref>, and therefore abundant water ice may have been present in the terrestrial planet region. Thus understanding the location of the snow line, at various evolutionary stages, is important given its relation to both planet formation and the origin of the water in terrestrial planets. and the scattered light spectra (right). The ~3.1 µm absorption feature, probably due to the scattering by water ice grains, is clearly seen in the spectra. As we go closer to the central star inside of the snow line, this absorption band will disappear due to the absence of water ice, which will directly show the snow line location at the disk surface.</p><p>The snow line in protoplanetary disks can be predicted through observations of water vapor. Water emission lines in NIR and MIR can be used to determine the radial extent of water vapor in the warm disk atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b573">Pontoppidan et al. 2010a</ref>).

Comets can also form in such a cold region and could be ingredients of icy planets. Although comets are known to contain pristine frozen material, they also have incompatible, high-temperature product such as crystallized silicate grains, which infers dynamical mixing between the hot inner and the cold outer regions. It is still a matter of debate how the mixing occurs and how the high-temperature material is incorporated into comets. A key to understand such a process is obtaining the spatial distribution of various kinds of grains in young planet-forming disks. With the high-spatial resolution of TMT, MICHI will offer a unique opportunity to uncover both mineralogical evolution of solids and transport of material within a disk by spatially-resolved MIR spectroscopy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b538">Okamoto et al. 2004</ref>).</p></div>

However, some amounts of these elements and the molecules that carry them do end up on terrestrial planetary surfaces, and the processes that deliver them are intimately linked to protoplanetary disks (see reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b732">van Dishoeck et al. 2014</ref>). The amount and molecular form of CHONPS molecules delivered to potentially habitable planets ultimately provide the basis for the formation and evolution of terrestrial atmospheres. Complex organic species may also be synthesized in the warm irradiated environments of disks. Indeed, the warm, energetic environments of disks within a few AU of the central star are thought to be highly chemically rich, with short timescales for the formation of a wide range of organic species (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">Henning &amp; Semenov 2013</ref>).</p><p>Spitzer demonstrated that strong emission from gas-phase species is from disks around solar-mass young stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Carr &amp; Najita 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b574">Pontoppidan et al. 2010b</ref>). Favorable geometries can also lead to deep absorption lines from disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b397">Lahuis et al. 2006</ref>), which at high dispersion is sensitive to much rarer species ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Knez et al. 2009</ref>). We now know that planet-forming regions are chemically rich, highly heterogeneous objects, with strong chemical differences between demographical groups. Herbig stars have relatively simple surfaces, dominated by harsh, destructive UV fields (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Fedele et al. 2011</ref>), while inner disks around solar-mass stars are rich in both oxygen and carbon-dominated species ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b619">Salyk et al. 2011</ref>), and inner disks around low-mass stars are dominated by organics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b556">Pascucci et al. 2013</ref>). Critically, it was also demonstrated that many of these lines are accessible to ground-based facilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b573">Pontoppidan et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b446">Mandell et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>There are several aspects of pre-biotic chemistry that can be uniquely explored using molecular emission lines from warm gas. 1) The warm gas represents the most volatile reservoir that is lost to planetesimal and terrestrial planet-formation. Observations of it therefore tests whether the CHONPS depletions observed in the Earth and the inner solar system are universal. For instance, the Earth's carbon is orders of magnitude more depleted than what would be expected, given the relatively large fraction of refractory organic carbon in the interstellar medium and in comets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b406">Lee et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Observations of volatile carbon carriers with the TMT can constrain models for carbon grain destruction. 2) Icy bodies in protoplanetary are generally affected by aerodynamics.

It may also affect the local carbon/oxygen ratio, thereby producing a sharp transition from an oxygen to a carbondominated chemistry, with potentially profound consequences for prebiotic chemistry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b513">Najita et al. 2013</ref>). Finally, observations of some exoplanetary atmospheres have compositions that suggest the influence of large-scale elemental re-distribution in their natal disks ( <ref type="bibr">Öberg et al. 2011</ref>). Observations of planet-forming CHONPS molecules with the TMT will therefore provide observable links to the growing population of exoplanets. Medium (R~10,000 for maximizing the line-to-continuum ratio) and/or high-resolution spectroscopy (R~100,000, for kinematic information) in the thermal infrared (3-14 µm) on the TMT is poised to deliver transformative data on this subject. The increase in sensitivity over the previous generation of mid-infrared spectrometers on 8-10 m class telescopes, both due to the larger aperture and improvements in detector technology, leads to a tremendous increase in the numbers and types of protoplanetary disks for which molecular lines can be observed. Specifically, while ground-based high resolution N-band spectroscopy can only reach the few brightest protoplanetary disks, the TMT can select targets from a reservoir of 100-1000 protoplanetary disks across the stellar mass range (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.6).

Transients are usually the result of some kind of explosion or collision that leads to a change in the physical character of the source (e.g. supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, neutron star mergers), or a result of accretion of matter (nova outbursts, tidal disruption events, AGN flares). These events are unpredictable, show a temporal evolution of the physical conditions, and often fall below the detection threshold when faint. Such Target of Opportunity (ToO) transient events generally require a rapid response to a trigger of observations. Variability in sources can be intrinsic; caused by either a change in the physical conditions (e.g. Cepheid Variables, stellar flares), or accretion induced (e.g. cataclysmic variables, AGN), or extrinsic; as a result of geometry (e.g. binaries, lensed objects, transiting planets). Variability observations can be time dependent, or time critical requiring observations that are time-resolved. Time-domain astronomy will be an exciting area of research in the TMT era, in part thanks to the synergy with various surveys from up-coming facilities such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), WFIRST, and Euclid, and the search for gravitational wave sources, see Section 9.5.

Of the existing methods to measure the dark energy equation-of-state (EOS) parameter w, the distances to SNe Ia provide the best single constraint up to date. This recently inspired many wide-field supernova surveys such as the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), the La-Silla Quest Supernova Survey (LQSS), and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that discovered thousands of SNe Ia that exploded in the local and distant universe. This number is expected to increase dramatically, especially at high redshifts with the planned future wide field surveys.</p><p>An increased sample of SNe Ia will reduce the allowed ranges of various cosmological parameters due to improved statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b553">(Pandey, 2013)</ref>. However, accurate determination of the dark energy EOS parameter still relies on a better control of the systematic effects in determining the distance to each SNe Ia. The larger systematic uncertainties include dust absorption, environmental dependencies of the observables, and possible evolution with redshift (e.g., Howell 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b747">Wang et al. 2013</ref>).

Adopting a velocity cut of vSi II = 12,000 km s −1 to divide these two groups puts 40 SNe Ia in the HV group and 83 in the NV group. Accordingly, we estimate the fraction of the HV population to be 1/3 of the Branch-normal sample and 1/5 to 1/4 of the entire SN Ia sample. The Si II velocity distinction is not sharp between these two groups, so blending could occur to some extent. Nevertheless, this blending is small at larger velocities and will not affect the result that the SNe Ia with higher velocities tend to occur nearer the galaxy centers. HV SNe Ia show the highest central concentration among the samples, with 90% occurring in regions within RSN/Rgal ≤ 0.7; this fraction is 66, 77, and 89% for NV SNe Ia, SNe II, and SNe Ibc, respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The contrast is even more apparent when examining the distribution toward the galaxy center. We caution, however, that a higher fraction of CC SNe may be missing in the central regions of galaxies during LOSS because of their lower luminosity relative to SNe Ia.</p><p>A Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff (K-S) test finds a probability of 0.5% that HVand NV SN Ia groups have a similar radial distribution in galaxies. This probability further decreases to 0.1% if one increases the velocity cut dividing these two groups from 12,000 to 13,000 km s −1 . Possible selection effects in the radial distribution have been explored, and none can account for such a significant discrepancy between HV and NV SN Ia groups (supplementary text S2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">fig.

Thus, HV SNe Ia have higher metallicities, and their progenitors are therefore less likely to be from the halo population that consists of old, metal-poor stars located far away from the galactic center <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref>.</p><p>Because the radial distances give only a rough estimate of the properties of SN progenitors, more sophisticated methods are necessary to provide additional constraints. A simple statistic of the "fractional flux" allows a measurement of how SNe are distributed within their hosts (35). This can be achieved by measuring in the host-galaxy images the fraction of total galaxy light contained in pixels fainter than or equal to the light in the pixel at the location of the SN.

Adopting a velocity cut of vSi II = 12,000 km s −1 to divide these two groups puts 40 SNe Ia in the HV group and 83 in the NV group. Accordingly, we estimate the fraction of the HV population to be 1/3 of the Branch-normal sample and 1/5 to 1/4 of the entire SN Ia sample. The Si II velocity distinction is not sharp between these two groups, so blending could occur to some extent. Nevertheless, this blending is small at larger velocities and will not affect the result that the SNe Ia with higher velocities tend to occur nearer the galaxy centers.</p><p>HV SNe Ia show the highest central concentration among the samples, with 90% occurring in regions within RSN/Rgal ≤ 0.7; this fraction is 66, 77, and 89% for NV SNe Ia, SNe II, and SNe Ibc, respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The contrast is even more apparent when examining the distribution toward the galaxy center. We caution, however, that a higher fraction of CC SNe may be missing in the central regions of galaxies during LOSS because of their lower luminosity relative to SNe Ia.</p><p>A Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff (K-S) test finds a probability of 0.5% that HVand NV SN Ia groups have a similar radial distribution in galaxies. This probability further decreases to 0.1% if one increases the velocity cut dividing these two groups from 12,000 to 13,000 km s −1 . Possible selection effects in the radial distribution have been explored, and none can account for such a significant discrepancy between HV and NV SN Ia groups (supplementary text S2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">fig.

Thus, HV SNe Ia have higher metallicities, and their progenitors are therefore less likely to be from the halo population that consists of old, metal-poor stars located far away from the galactic center <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref>.</p><p>Because the radial distances give only a rough estimate of the properties of SN progenitors, more sophisticated methods are necessary to provide additional constraints. A simple statistic of the "fractional flux" allows a measurement of how SNe are distributed within their hosts (35).

The HV and NV populations have different colors around maximum brightness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b746">Wang et al. 2009</ref>). These results suggest that high-velocity SNe Ia most likely originate from more metal-rich progenitors than normal-velocity SNe Ia, and are restricted to galaxies with substantial chemical evolution. As an alternative to the probable distinction between the HV and NV SNe Ia as different populations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b441">Maeda et al. (2010)</ref>, based on the ejecta kinematics in the deepest layer as seen in the optically thin, late-phases, suggest the viewing direction is another function to produce the HV and NV appearance, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.2B. The dependence of SN Ia ejecta velocity on progenitor environment could be relevant when using SNe Ia as cosmological yardsticks, as this may lead to a change in the ratio of the HV and NV population with redshift. The observed relative fraction of the HV to NV population might become smaller at great distances due to a real decrease in the HV SN Ia rate in low-metallicity environments and/or the increased difficulty of observationally spectroscopically classifying SNe in the central regions of distant galaxies. Observationally testing for evolution in the low-z and high-z samples is important for precision cosmology but can be only tested with future high-redshift SN Ia samples having better spectroscopic classification, as the spectral quality and wavelength coverage of current high-z samples are not good enough for this kind of analysis. Since the LSST will discover thousands of high-redshift SNe Ia (z ~ 1.0) within 1 to 2 days of explosion, one would need spectroscopic follow up for these SNe, beginning within a few hours of target discovery, with repeat observations starting with 1 day cadence to understand the progenitor and explosion mechanism. Near-infrared space missions such as Euclid and WFIRST can discover SNe Ia at higher redshifts (z &gt; 1.0). In addition, gravitational lensed SNe can be discovered even at higher redshift (z &gt; 1.0, Amanullah et al. 2011), and such surveys looking for SNe behind a massive galaxy cluster are ongoing with 8m-class telescopes and HST, to go beyond the redshift of 2, see Section 3.1.6. In addition, SNe can also be strongly lensed by a relatively faint galaxy, as seen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b585">(Quimby et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">&amp; Kelly et al. 2015</ref>, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9.</ref>3), and discovery of such a system could be accelerated by new selection techniques. Present ground-based facilities cannot obtain highquality spectra for SNe Ia beyond z = 1.5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.2">Unveiling The Explosion Mechanism of Type Ia Supernovae</head><p>The explosion mechanism of SNe Ia is yet to be clarified. The explosion mechanism can be dependent on the progenitor systems, e.g., single degenerate (SD) vs. double degenerate (DD), but also there are variants within the same progenitor model. Since the explosion mechanism sets the ejecta structure and 56</p><p>Ni yields, which determine the optical luminosity and light curve, understanding the explosion mechanism is a key toward developing precision SN Ia cosmology. An understanding of the physical causes of the peculiar SNe Ia, such as SN 2005hk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b617">Sahu et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b649">, Foley et al. 2013</ref>) and 2005gj ( <ref type="bibr">Hughes et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prieto et al. 2007)</ref>, has the promise to constrain models for normal SNe Ia and illuminate the underlying reason for the diversity of normal SNe Ia.</p><p>Very early spectroscopic follow-up is still rare for SNe Ia, and so far is restricted only to the local Universe. The early-phase spectra reveal the outermost ejecta composition, which is highly dependent on the mode of the explosion. Especially, carbon abundance is quite sensitive to the progenitor evolution and thermonuclear flame propagation mode. Recent results suggest that unburned carbon frequently remains in the outermost layer of SNe Ia, more commonly for the NV SNe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b554">Parrent et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Folatelli et al. 2012</ref>). Given the environmental/explosion difference between the HV and NV SNe, investigating the carbon signature in the high-z sample is an important step. In the NIR, the magnesium feature is expected in addition to carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b450">(Marion et al. 2009)</ref>, and this oxygen-burning product is a key to diagnose the extent of the thermonuclear burning. An early response follow-up of a series of observations with a few minute cadence for a few hours within 2 days of the start of explosion with IRIS, IRMS or WFOS, of a large sample of SNe Ia, including those at high redshift, will make an important contribution.</p><p>On the other extreme, very late-time spectroscopy is a strong diagnostic of the ejecta kinematics and thermonuclear products at the explosion trigger, thus being a direct method to constrain the explosion mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b441">Maeda et al. 2010</ref>). The high spectroscopic sensitivity of IRIS, IRMS, and WFOS of TMT will open up a new window to study the explosion mechanism: (1) NIR spectroscopy at ∼ 1 year and (2) a very late-time (at &gt; 1 year after the explosion) optical spectroscopy. Due to sensitivity limits with 8m/10m-class telescopes such study is limited in the optical to ≤ 1 year after the explosion. As for NIR, there are only a few examples so far taken by 8m-class telescopes, showing that NIR spectra provide qualitatively different diagnostics on the explosion mechanism than in optical ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b503">Motohara et al. 2006</ref>). As for the very late-time spectroscopy, it is an almost unexplored area due to the faintness of the SNe at such late phases. At such late phases, the dominant energy source is no longer γ-rays, but positrons from the 56 Co decay and other minor radioactive species ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b635">Seitenzahl et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>

As a result of core-collapse, a shock wave is formed in the star, which propagates its stellar mantle outward. When the shock wave emerges from the stellar surface, a fireball suddenly appears. This is the brightest radiative phenomenon in a supernova, called "shock breakout", see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.4. Its observational properties, e.g., duration and color, strongly depend on the pre-supernova radius; the shock breakout of a star with a larger presupernova radius has a longer duration and redder color. Therefore, detection of shock breakout will provide a direct link between SNe and their progenitor stars. The typical duration and peak wavelength are several seconds to 1 day and soft X-ray to ultraviolet, respectively. Since the shock breakout can be detected even z &gt; 1, it can be used to probe the star formation rate at high redshifts TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

The first role of TMT for studies of shock breakouts is a spectroscopic identification. This is achieved only with a rapid (&lt; 1 night) target of opportunity (ToO) observation. Since the shock breakout is blue and has smooth spectra, the most suitable instrument is WFOS with R≤500. Spectroscopic data taken with 1-2 hr sampling would give unique information of the temperature evolution on the first day of SNe. The second role is a continuous (∼ 2 − 3 days) observation following the first ToO observation to reveal the spectral evolution of supernovae during the very early epochs, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.4, in which metal lines gradually become prominent. The evolution will provide clues to properties of shock breakouts and supernovae, e.g., pre-supernova radius, CSM structure, and mass loss at the last stage of the evolution.</p></div>

These classes of SNe tend to show a blue spectrum, thus TMT/WFOS will be the best to obtain the rest-frame far-UV emission. A response time of ~10 days is enough as these classes of SNe show relatively long-lived light curves. An interesting application of identification of high-z SNe is probing the IMF in the early Universe. At high redshifts, we may also be able to detect pair instability SNe (PISNe, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b625">Scannapieco et al. 2005</ref>). Since superluminous SNe and PISNe are thought to arise from very massive progenitors, a number ratio of these types of SNe and normal SNe will provide unique information about the initial mass function.</p><p>To study the high-z Universe with SNe, a better understanding of SN rate in the low-z Universe is also critical. Currently, the SN search and follow-up in the most active star-forming regions are rather limited, while such regions can provide a large fraction of the star formation in the local Universe and even a dominant fraction toward high redshifts, interstellar extinction is one of the major limiting factors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b466">Mattila et al. 2012</ref>). The main problem is that the spectroscopic follow-up is currently nearly impossible, thus even the SN typing has not been secured -at z = 0.03, a typical SN would have a peak magnitude of J ~ 22 -23 if J band extinction toward the SNe is ~ 5 mag. TMT will make the spectroscopic follow-up for these obscured SNe possible, clarifying for the first time the SN populations and stellar evolution in the active star forming galaxies. </p></div>

Such a dichotomy might be related to differences in the progenitor environments, as suggested by the correlation of the ejecta velocity V SiII with the location in their host galaxies (see Section 9.1.1). Nevertheless, the origin of the absorbing clouds is still controversial, as such absorptions may also arise in a DD scenario or interstellar medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Chugai 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b649">Shen et al. 2013</ref>).

A resolution of R~7500 enables measurements of the overall evolution of Na I and Ca II absorption, allowing important parameters of the absorbing material that may be associated with the progenitor system to be determined.

They are expected to directly detect GWs from neutron star (NS) mergers at a distance within about 200 Mpc. The number of GW detections will be in a range of 0.4-400 per year (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Abadie et al. 2010</ref>). With the GW detection alone, the position of the sources can only be moderately determined with a localization of about 10-100 deg 2 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abadie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b524">Nissanke et al. 2013</ref>). Therefore, to fully understand the nature of the GW sources, electromagnetic observations should pin down the position of the sources and identify the host galaxy and environment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.6">UNDERSTANDING PROGENITORS OF GAMMA-RAY BURSTS: CONNECTION TO SUPERNOVAE AND KILONOVAE</head><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are observed through the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from GHz radio waves to 10 MeV gamma-rays. Although each is unique, the bursts fall into two rough categories. Bursts lasting less than two seconds are classified as short, and those that last longer, the observed majority, as long. All of the confirmed long GRB host galaxies are actively forming stars. The total stellar mass in these host galaxies is low and their colors are bluer than present-day spiral galaxies. The ages implied for the progenitors of long GRBs are estimated to be &lt; 0.2 Gyr which is significantly younger than the minimum ages derived for the early-type galaxies found to be associated with short GRBs. These results suggest that (1) long GRBs arise from young massive stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b771">Woosley &amp; Bloom 2006</ref>), and (2) short GRBs are results of neutron star mergers (e.g., Berger 2013).</p><p>Observations of long GRBs at low redshifts clearly show that SNe arise from the GRBs themselves. However, clear spectroscopic confirmation of SNe is limited to low-redshift GRBs because at z&gt;0.5-1.0, the SN component is too faint and most of the important features are redshifted to NIR wavelengths. TMT/IRIS will enable spectroscopic identification of SNe in long GRBs at z=0.5-1.0. For this purpose, continuous spectroscopic monitoring from ~1 day to 30 days after the GRB is important. Even at low redshifts, for some GRBs, no SN component was discovered down to a flux limit at least hundreds of times fainter than the expected SN flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Gehrels et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Della Valle et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Gal-Yam et al. 2006</ref>). Spectroscopy with TMT/WFOS will be important to search for the SN component in low-redshift GRBs if GRBs are possibly associated with faint SNe.</p><p>In contrast to long GRBs, any supernova-like event accompanying short GRBs is currently limited by observation to being over 50 times fainter than normal Type Ia SNe or Type Ic hypernovae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">Kann et al. 2011</ref>). Recently, a NIR excess associated with a short GRB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b703">Tanvir et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Berger et al. 2013</ref>) was broadly consistent with the expectation of an r-process powered kilonova <ref type="bibr">(Bernes &amp; Kasen 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b700">Tanaka &amp; Hotokezaka 2013</ref>) (see Section 9.5). However, current observational data is only one NIR photometric point with HST, and the source is too faint for spectroscopy. To fully understand the progenitor of short GRBs, TMT/IRIS will be the ideal instrument to perform ToO NIR spectroscopic observations of kilonova event associated with short GRBs, at a timescale of &lt;~ 1 day.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

There are three basic ways of investigating the evolution of luminous matter and gas in the Universe: (1) direct detection of host galaxies in emission (in the UV/optical/NIR for the un-obscured components, in the FIR/sub-mm/radio for the obscured component), (2) the detection of galaxies selected in absorption along the lines of sight to luminous background sources, traditionally QSOs, (3) diffuse extragalactic backgrounds. Studies of GRB hosts and afterglows can contribute to all three of these methodological approaches, bringing in new, independent constraints for models of galaxy evolution and of the history of star formation in the universe.</p><p>Absorption spectroscopy of GRB afterglows is now becoming a powerful new probe of the ISM in evolving galaxies, complementary to traditional studies of background-quasar absorption line systems. The key point is that the GRBs probe lines of sight in the dense, central regions of their host galaxies. In contrast, the background-quasar absorption systems are selected by the gas cross section, and favor large impact parameters, mostly probing the gaseous halos of intervening or foreground field galaxies, where the physical conditions are very different to the dense central regions where GRBs occur. The growing body of data on GRB absorption systems shows exceptionally high column densities of gas, when compared to the typical quasar absorption systems. This opens the interesting prospect of using GRB absorbers as a new probe of the chemical enrichment history in galaxies in a more direct manner than with the quasar absorbers, where there may be very complex dynamics of gas ejection, infall, and mixing at play.</p><p>Possibly the most interesting use of GRBs in cosmology is as probes of the early phases of star and galaxy formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b611">Robertson &amp; Ellis 2012)</ref>, and the resulting re-ionization of the universe. GRBs are bright enough to be detectable, in principle, out to much larger distances than those of the most luminous quasars or galaxies detected at present. Within the first minutes to hours after the burst, the optical light from afterglows is known to have a range of visual magnitudes far brighter than quasars, albeit for a short time. To identify GRBs to be high-z events, prompt NIR spectroscopic observations of high-z GRBs are essential. Required response time is ~5 minutes from the discovery (discovery is essentially instantaneous) and brightness changes of up to a factor 10 per minute can occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.8">STUDYING TIDAL DISRUPTION EVENTS AND SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES</head><p>The nuclei of some galaxies undergo violent activity, with quasars being the most extreme instances of this phenomenon. Such activity is short-lived compared to galactic lifetimes, and was more prevalent when the Universe was only about one-fifth of its present age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b382">Kormendy and Richstone 1995)</ref>. Dead quasars -massive black holes now starved of fuel, and therefore quiescent -should be more common than active quasars and are now being discovered in nearby galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Ho 2008)</ref>. The presence of these black holes is not surprising -we expect to find a black hole in most galaxies on the basis of the number density of quasars and their typical lifetimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b674">(Soltan 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Chokshi and Turner 1992)</ref>. But we must ask a further question: can a black hole lurk in these quiescent galaxies without showing other evidence for its presence? So could a black hole be so completely starved of fuel that it does not reveal its presence? The search for switched off, dim or dead engines -starving black holes -has therefore become one of the hottest topics in extragalactic astronomy.</p><p>Each star near a massive black hole traces out a complicated orbit under the combined influence of all other stars and the black hole itself. Due to the cumulative effect of encounters with other stars the orbits gradually diffuse. If a star wanders too close to the black hole it is violently ripped apart by the black hole's tidal field -a tidal disruption event (TDE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b599">(Rees 1988)</ref>. About half of the debris of tidal disruption eventually falls back and accretes onto the black hole. This accretion powers a flare, which is a definitive sign of the presence of an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a powerful diagnostic of its properties, see also Section 6.5.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Capturing all three phases photometrically and with additional spectroscopic information, these impressive data sets have already shown several interesting behaviors indicating that TDEs are not as simple as one might first guess. The light curve is consistent with the bolometric luminosity closely following the rate of mass fallback ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">Guillochon et al. 2014</ref>, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.7), suggesting that the accretion disk viscous time is significantly shorter than the fallback time, and that the returning material must circularize by the first epoch of observation. The spectra resemble a single blackbody, with a temperature that evolves weakly in time, and a radius 10 times larger than the tidal disruption radius. As the light from the accretion disk itself should appear as a superposition of hotter blackbodies, this hints at the presence of a spatially extended reprocessing region surrounding the disk. The fact that broad HeII emission lines are seen, but hydrogen lines are missing suggests that material may be highly ionized, and outflowing at velocities ∼10,000 km s −1 , reminiscent of the broad-line regions (BLRs) found around some steadily-accreting AGN.</p><p>Ongoing and future transient surveys and future radio surveys are predicted to discover 10-100 such events per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b732">(van Velzen et al. 2011</ref>). Depending on the black hole mass, these events are expected to last for a few days to a few months. Imaging with TMT's IRIS would precisely establish the position of the source. Optical spectroscopic follow-up observations provide diagnostics which help elucidate the demography of massive black holes in the local Universe. Data should be taken in the rise, peak, and decay phases with frequent cadence. Each of these phases of a TDE contains vital information about the disruption, and can be used to constrain the properties of the host black hole and the object that was disrupted.</p><p>The modeling of tidal disruption will also be significantly improved once a large sample of TDEs has been collected. Tidal disruptions offer a unique opportunity to study a single black hole under a set of conditions that change over a range of timescales. Tidal disruption events offer the firmest hope of studying the evolution of their accretion disks for a wide range of mass accretion rates and feeding timescales. For a disruption with a well-resolved light curve, models permit a significant reduction of the number of potential combinations of star and black hole properties, enabling a better characterization of the massive black hole and the dense stellar clusters that surround them. The TMT will allow the detection and study of TDEs up to much higher redshifts than previously possible. Because of the "negative" K-correction (TDEs emitting primarily in the restframe UV with a characteristic 10 5 K black body) TDEs will be visible by TMT to redshifts of 6 or larger, enabling constraints on SMBH properties and evolution over a vast range of cosmic time.</p></div>

Since the radiation observed from blazars is non-thermal and the luminosities are so high yet extremely time-variable, electrons (including any positrons) in the jet must be accelerated with high efficiency to energies exceeding ~10 4 to 10 5 mc 2 as blazars are seen to emit TeV gamma-rays. Shock waves, turbulence, and magnetic reconnections have all been proposed as the main means of particle acceleration, and all three might be operating inside relativistic jets. The efficiency of particle acceleration by these processes is strongly dependent on the magnetic field geometry. In the case of shocks, charged particles follow the magnetic field lines back and forth across the shock front. The efficiency of acceleration depends on the angle that the magnetic field subtends to the shock. In MHD turbulence, the energization occurs statistically as particles bounce off randomly moving regions of strongerthan-average magnetic fields. In reconnections, particles become trapped in shrinking magnetic flux tubes or in converging, oppositely directed field lines created by current sheets. Each of these processes has a different signature of time-variable linear polarization: in shocks, a favored polarization direction parallel to the shock front during peaks in flux; in turbulence, low, rapidly fluctuating polarization vectors with higher amplitudes of variations on longer time-scales; and in reconnections, polarization in a direction that remains stable during a flare but changes from one flare to the next. Discerning among these possibilities requires precise spectro-polarimetric monitoring on time scales as short as a few minutes with the TMT in order to measure fluctuations in polarization and flux on. This will determine the power spectrum of the fluctuations down to small size scales, testing emerging models of particle acceleration and blazar variability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b661">Sironi &amp; Spitkovsky 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b457">, Marscher 2014</ref>). It will be particularly important to follow with the TMT the changes in optical/near-IR polarization during the night of a blazar being observed by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array in order to relate acceleration of the highest-energy electrons to the magnetic field direction.</p><p>Variability of AGN in the optical is typically about 10% over all timescales from less than an hour to years. There is a wide range of stochastic behavior between different AGN. Fully characterizing the stochastic properties of spectro-photometric measurements is vital to refining the model for the emission process and discerning between the possible AGN emission mechanisms. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.8 shows light curves collected with Kepler of two AGN, the power spectra show that neither lightcurve is consistent with the simple stochastic random walk model for variations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b511">Mushotzky et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Carini &amp; Ryle 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b353">Kasliwal et al. 2015</ref>). The lack of faster sampled spectro-photometric measurements constrains further understanding,the Kepler data is insufficient to study AGN variability data as a function of radial position within the accretion disk of the AGN.</p><p>The Thirty Meter Telescope will provide new capabilities for studying the structure of AGN. Moderate resolution optical and mid-IR spectra will make it possible to observe rapid changes in the spectral features of nearby AGN on timescales as short as ~1 hour, sampling every few minutes, allowing us to map out the structure of the accretion disk and broad-line regions with great accuracy and providing new insights into the structure of the jet region. TMT's instruments will also be able to probe the structure of the accretion disk region by performing rapid optical and mid-IR observations (t samp ~10mins) to carry out reverberation mapping.

CVs display rapid variability related to the accretion process that has timescales from sub-second to hours due to a number of reasons; interactions of the disc and mass transfer stream, processes in the accretion disc itself (as modeled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b603">Ribeiro &amp; Diaz, 2008)</ref> and accretion onto the compact primary, which may be influenced by magnetic fields. The location of the source of the variability can be isolated by studying the temporal variations in the velocity of the emission and in some systems by eclipse mapping. Combining the velocity and temporal information from time resolved spectroscopy with the method of eclipse mapping and monitoring disc changes on a weekly basis will transform our understanding of the processes occurring within CV accretion discs, particularly in systems whose discs display changes in state or have regular outbursts on timescales of months.

Nova outbursts are seen in all wavelengths from γ-ray to radio and can reach M V = −10 mag, placing them among the brightest transient sources known. The outburst intervals range from decades (recurrent novae) to thousands (classical novae) of years. Novae can rise in luminosity by &gt;6 mags in a day, with a rise time of about 1 to 2 days in the very fast novae, while the slowest novae have a rise time of the order 10's of days. The outbursts generally cause the systems to increase in brightness by about 10 mags at the peak. The decline rates can be between ~1 mag/day to ~0.03 mag/day, depending on the speed class of the nova. The nova outburst characteristics are particularly sensitive to the mass of the accreting white dwarf (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b685">Starrfield et al. 2012</ref>). The high luminosities, coupled with a rate of ∼ 35/yr in a galaxy like our own (Shafter 1997), make novae ideal for probing the properties of close binary stars in varied (extragalactic) stellar populations. The geometry of novae is important for understanding the explosive process on the surface of the compact star. Nova shells have revealed polar-blob, equatorial-ring geometry and/or multiple bloblike condensations in the shell. There is also increasing evidence that nova phenomenology is best explained by non-spherical ejecta, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.10 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b772">Woudt et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b604">Ribeiro et al. 2011</ref>). One leading scenario to explain such observations as well as spectrophotometric development of novae is bipolar (although not jet-like) mass ejection (Shore 2013). Alternatively, the ejecta may consists of blobs of very high density gas that expand to create within each clump a wide range of emitting density, ionization, and velocity, while the circumbinary envelope is more homogeneous (Williams 2013).</p><p>The geometry of the postoutburst structure of novae will be further constrained by coordinated spectroscopic follow up of novae over all wavelength regimes. Since important aspects of the ejecta activity occur at the time of outburst, spectral studies are best conducted as early as possible. The timely discovery of outbursts before maximum light occurs by the large surveys, such as LSST, will enable early observations. Spectrophotometry and spectropolarimetry (R ~ 5000 -30,000) would be required to establish the presence of the two distinct components and blobs, and the evolution of the spectrum as the fireball progresses. Spectropolarimetry, in particular, holds the key as polarimetric measurements will help quantify the degree of non-spherical symmetry in the early expanding nova shell.</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETAILED SCIENCE CASE: 2015</head><p>April 29, 2015</p><p>The geometry of the expanding fireball can also be studied by direct imaging. A nova at 5 kpc (novae have been observed at distances 1-10 kpc) which is ejecting mass at 1000 km/s (ejection velocity ranges from 300 km/s for slow novae to 10000 km/s for the very fast novae), as seen from the Earth, will have an ejected shell of size 10 mas (0.01") in around 87 days. For a very fast nova, the time taken would be around 9 days. [10 mas is chosen because it is ∼ 2x pixel sampling of IRIS]. If the nova is at 1 kpc and ejecting mass at 1000 km/s, it will have a size of 10 mas in 17.4 days. Thus, outbursting novae can be observed as extended objects after the first week of outburst. A nova situated even 10 kpc away would be very bright (e.g. M = -9 =&gt; m = 11 even with 5 magnitudes of extinction) for the TMT. A solution to this would be to use AO combined with coronographic techniques. For studying the early fireball phase of novae, the occulting mask needs to be 10 mas or slightly bigger <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . The geometry and evolution of the expanding fireball have in recent years been studied using NIR interferometric imaging (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Chesneau &amp; Banerjee 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b626">&amp; Schaefer, et al. 2014</ref>) but studies are limited to the very rare cases where the system rises to M app &lt;6. Direct imaging with TMT+AO will open up several orders of magnitude more targets to studies with IFU type instruments.</p><p>In addition to Galactic novae, novae have been observed in more than a dozen galaxies, some as distant as the Coma Cluster ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b643">Shafter et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Shafter et al. , 2013</ref>. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of novae in the Local Group suggest that galaxies dominated by a younger stellar population (M33 and the LMC) generally tend to host novae with a faster photometric evolution. The question that arises is; are there really two distinct populations of novae that are dependent on the metallicity and star formation history of its host galaxy? Observing the evolution of the spectrum of an increased number of extragalactic novae would provide an answer. So far, 8-10m class telescopes have been efficiently used to photometrically detect novae in the Fornax cluster of galaxies at 20 Mpc, but spectroscopic observations have been difficult. With the TMT, one could easily do optical spectroscopy of novae at this distance.</p></div>

Extrasolar planets have been found orbiting the youngest stars to post-main sequence stars and around subsolar to intermediate-mass stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b389">(Kraus &amp; Ireland 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Currie et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b623">Sato et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">Johnson et al. 2010</ref>). Statistical studies of exoplanets suggest that planet formation is common, occurring around about half of nearby Sun-like stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">Howard et al. 2013a</ref> and references therein).</p><p>Extrasolar planets are a diverse population, spanning a wide range in mass and orbital separation. Some exoplanets have similar properties (i.e. mass, orbital separation) to those in our own solar system. However, nearby exoplanets detected by two main methods -Doppler radial velocimetry and transit photometry, and distant exoplanets discovered by microlensing and direct detection, have revealed entirely new classes of planets such as hot Jupiters, Super-Earths, and wide-separation super-jovian planets.</p><p>Although extrasolar planets discovered thus far have provided important clues about the context within which the Earth and other solar system planets fit, our knowledge of the overall census remains highly incomplete. We have good constraints on the (high) frequency of planets larger than the Earth with orbital periods less than 100 days and on (the dearth of) the widest-separation, most massive planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b521">Nielsen et al. 2013</ref>). However, other classes of planetary systems are almost entirely unexplored -e.g. massive planets beyond a few AU, or planets with radii smaller than Earth. Furthermore, our knowledge about the physical properties of exoplanets (e.g. density, atmospheric/bulk composition) is much weaker, and is restricted to a handful of favorable cases. While we have detected both rocky planets and planets located on Earth-like orbits (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Howard et al. 2013b</ref>), we have yet to conclusively identify a true (potentially habitable) Earth twin around a Sun-like star, let alone determine their frequency.</p><p>The Thirty Meter Telescope will provide an enormous advance in our ability to identify and characterize extrasolar planets. New technological advances --e.g. high-precision Doppler measurements, high-precision space-based photometry, and advanced adaptive optics -have driven a large number of exoplanet discoveries. The TMT's instrumentation will generate an incredible number of additional discoveries, will drastically expand the kinds of planets we can detect, will provide a rich understanding of these planets' physical properties, and will potentially yield the first detections of habitable rocky planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">DOPPLER DETECTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS</head><p>With echelle spectrometers approaching the 0.1 m/s radial velocity (RV) measurement precision threshold needed to detect habitable Earth mass planets around Sun-like stars, the continuation of Doppler surveys on state-of-the-art telescopes is imperative. Such surveys, conducted with the optical and infrared echelle spectrometers being built for the TMT, have the potential to complete the census of Earth-mass planets in our stellar neighborhood. The collection of such systems will provide a valuable sample for follow-up programs to characterize their atmospheres through direct imaging.  The radial velocity method originally focused on finding exoplanets around main sequence FGK stars. These targets are ideal, both due to their similarity to our Sun, and due to the abundance of atomic lines in their spectra. The gravitational velocity perturbation exhibited by the host star is directly related to the mass of the planet and is inversely related to its orbital distance. Hence, the RV detection method is most sensitive to massive, close-in planets. This ease of detection led to a substantial number of early discoveries of 'hot Jupiters', but as observing temporal baselines grew longer and as measurement sensitivities improved, the Doppler searches gradually expanded into more of the exoplanet phase space. As more planets were discovered, key physical trends began to emerge. Notable examples include a correlation between planet occurrence and stellar metallicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">Johnson et al. 2010</ref>), a peak in the distribution of planets with orbits of 3 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>, and a gradual increase in the number of planets with increasing period and decreasing mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>). RV surveys have also lead to the discovery of complex planetary systems like HD 69830, which has three Neptune-mass planets and an asteroid belt ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b424">Lovis et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Beichman et al. 2005</ref>), the multiple-planet system orbiting the M dwarf, GJ 581 ( ) and the planet around the nearby young dusty star ε Eridani ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">Hatzes et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Benedict et al. 2006</ref>). RV planet detection programs are naturally limited to planets with periods that are shorter than the length of the survey, which currently amounts to somewhat more than 5 AU for the longest-running projects (Jupiter, for example has a 11.86 year orbital period and induces a 12 m/s radial velocity half amplitude). In recent years, a major focus has been on RV observations for characterization of transiting systems, particularly those discovered by the Kepler mission; the joint detection of a planet via radial velocimetry and transit photometry is exceptionally powerful, allowing measurements of planetary densities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">(Figure 10.1</ref>).</p></div>

Doppler precision measured in mere centimeters per second will only be accomplished with instruments that have very high spectral resolution (R&gt;100,000) and fiber-scrambling capabilities to aid with spectral stabilization. Achieving this precision, of course, also requires very high signal-to-noise and hence a bright star with long exposures. Probing a large sample of stars at this precision will require a telescope such as TMT. The past decade has also shown the exceptional power of RV techniques in synergy with transit observations. Only for planets with both transit radius measurements and RV mass measurements can we determine density, and by extension, clues to the physical composition of the planets. With Kepler's demonstration that small (1-4 R E ) planets are common, the next step in understanding the frequency of earthlike planets is to determine the density of a significant number of these planets, especially those at large semi-major axes. The time needed for these RV observations are a significant bottleneck in completing Kepler's scientific legacy. The TESS mission will have a similar need for RV follow-up (albeit around brighter stars, but needing even higher levels of precision.) A high-precision RV capability, particularly optimized for late-type stars, on TMT, would be a powerful component of an integrated exoplanet roadmap, and would forge a near-complete understanding of nearby planetary systems.</p></div>

The benefits of this investment would be substantial, and could extend those surveys being completed with SPIRou, CARMENES and the Habitable Zone Planet Finder ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Amado et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Delfosse et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b444">Mahadevan et al. 2012</ref>) to cover sub-Earth-mass planets across the entire range of the habitable zones for the more massive M3-M4 dwarfs that are the most common star in the Solar neighborhood. The larger aperture will also extend our ability to detect planets around the latest M dwarf spectral types that are too faint to be efficiently surveyed down to the RV precision necessary to detect habitable Earth-mass planets. By combining the results from both the optical and infrared surveys, the TMT will we will enable the definitive census of habitable planets around our nearest neighbors.</p><p>RV surveys of young stars have yet to produce a sufficient sample of planetary systems from which we can search for changes in the architecture of planetary systems with age. Such trends would provide insight into planet formation and evolution models. At distances of a hundred parsecs and more, only the most massive stars in nearby star formation regions like Taurus, the Hyades, Orion and Sco Cen are bright enough for RV planet search programs (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b559">Paulson et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b587">Quinn et al. 2014</ref>). The TMT will be able to push detection limits to solar-mass stars and below as well as allow for thorough surveys of hundreds of stars in much less time than what is currently possible with 10m class telescopes. Direct imaging techniques (Section 10.2) will also favor young stars; the combination of Doppler monitoring and ExAO direct imaging could completely sample the giant planets around nearby young stars. Section 10.1.3 discusses how we might overcome the photospheric noise inherent to young stars.</p><p>Although a precision Doppler capability for TMT would be powerful, the exact scientific optimization is complicated. Targets for most programs are relatively bright, and although high SNR is needed for 10 cm/s precision, achieving that also requires multiple exposures to average over stellar oscillations.</p><p>Instrumental and stellar noise sources may well set a floor that lies substantially above the photon noise floor of a 30-m telescope. Indeed, the development of Doppler capability on TMT would augment, rather than replace, large-scale programs on 6-10m telescopes for mass determination of TESS transiting planets, coronagraphic planet discoveries, and blind searches for earth-mass planets. TMT could be exceptionally important for follow-up of fainter stars hosting highly unusual or interesting planet candidates (e.g. Kepler and Plato discoveries or low-mass stars imaged with direct techniques), high cadence observations (e.g. Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), and of course for the characterization of the transiting planets' themselves (see Section 10.3).</p></div>

If the TMT can deliver sufficient precision, its observations will determine whether the planetary mass-radius diagram for large terrestrial-mass planets differs for M dwarfs as compared to more massive solar type stars. This will directly probe the differences in planet formation, evolution, and migration as a function of stellar mass. Given the expected plethora of newly discovered and potentially complex planetary systems from these missions, the shorter total on-sky time needed to collect a statistically robust sample of RV measurements at RV precisions of &lt; 1 m/s will be key to the efficient characterization of exoplanetary systems.</p></div>

Such stellar "jitter" has lead to the mis-identification of a few extrasolar planets including the one around the young star TW Hydra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b639">Setiawan et al. 2008</ref>) which was quickly shown to be a false-alarm ( <ref type="bibr">Huelamo et al. 2008</ref>) produced by starspot activity. On the other hand, the recent discovery of Alpha Cen Bb with an RV semiamplitude of only 51 cm/s in <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Dumusque et al. (2012)</ref> demonstrates that high cadence observations can partially overcome the limitations of stellar jitter. (Even the Alpha Cen Bb result, however, comes with a note of caution, see Hatzes 2013). Future RV surveys of young stars are being designed to collect measurements at both optical and at infrared wavelengths where the starspots produce a reduced RV perturbation (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Crockett et al. 2012</ref>). Similarly, the combination of RV measurements from the TMTs optical and near-IR echelle spectrometers could be used to discern between lowmass planets and stellar activity which plagues both M dwarfs and young stars.</p><p>Recent efforts comparing the photometric and RV variability of Kepler targets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Bastien et al. 2014)</ref> show a correlation between RV jitter and a value called the "flicker" which is the rms of the photometry on an 8-hour timescale. It is currently unclear as to whether making similar measurements of nearby stars in an attempt to predict their RV jitter is feasible. If our goal is to survey all nearby stars for the presence of terrestrial planets, the M dwarfs -which constitute the majority of nearby stars -with typical rotational velocities and starspot populations will require hundreds of individual measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Barnes et al. 2011</ref>). With all this in mind, future RV programs can and will be able to detect rocky planets around nearby stars with improved instrumentation, photometric target vetting and high cadence observations.</p></div>

Observations obtained in the past 7 years on the largest ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics (AO) have yielded the first images of planetary companions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">(Figure 10.</ref>3). The planets imaged thus far only trace the extremes of the population, typically orbiting at ~30-150 AU around stars more massive than the Sun and having masses of ~5-10 M Jup . The vast majority of planets imaged to date have been detected from their thermal emission, with only one planet (or its surrounding disk) detected in reflected light (Fomalhaut b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>) and one multi-planet system imaged (HR 8799; <ref type="bibr" target="#b452">Marois et al. 2008</ref>) so far. Imaged planets are mostly young (~1-100 Myr), where the planet-to-star contrasts are most favorable. Thus our current knowledge represents only a mere glimpse of the full range of planet demographics across stellar hosts, planet masses, orbital separations, and compositions. Direct imaging discoveries thus far have sparked intensive follow-up efforts and, despite their limited number, illustrate the potential advances from comparative studies of exoplanets. These include the first insights into the atmospheric properties of young gas-giant planets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 10.4)</ref>. Near-infrared photometry indicates that young planets are dustier/cloudier than their older, field brown dwarf counterparts at similar effective temperatures (e.g., Bowler et al 2010a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Currie et al. 2011</ref>). Near-IR spectra clearly show the empirical hallmarks of reduced surface gravity, as expected given the young Spectra and photometry also show evidence for non-equlibrium chemistry. However, obtaining similar data for larger samples of gas-giant planets, as well as extending such work to lower-mass planets, is currently well out of reach.  <ref type="bibr">et al. 2008, 2010a)</ref>, Fomalhaut b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>), GJ 504 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b395">Kuzuhara et al. 2013</ref>), HD 95086 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b590">Rameau et al. 2013</ref>), ROXs 42Bb ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Currie et al. 2014b</ref>), and β Pic b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Lagrange et al. 2010</ref>). Other companions with masses below/near the deuterium-burning limit (~13 M Jup ) have also been imaged, many of them at wider separations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Chauvin et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Goldman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b326">Ireland et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b432">Luhman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Bowler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Delorme et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b390">Kraus et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bailey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b515">Naud et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Many more discoveries are expected from new planet-hunting instruments on 8-10 m telescopes such as the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">Macintosh et al. 2014</ref>), the Spectro-Polarimetric Highcontrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Beuzit et al 2008)</ref>, and the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics project (SCExAO; Martinache and Guyon 2009). Large AO imaging surveys so far have shown that Jovian planets at large (tens of AU) separations are relatively rare (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b742">Vigan et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b521">Nielsen et al. 2013</ref>).

Near-future AO surveys with these planet-hunting instruments should reveal much of the gas-giant population at intermediate separations. One of the most significant steps in the study of extrasolar planets in the years leading up to TMT will be direct imaging and spectroscopy of a large sample of young self-luminous exoplanets. Direct imaging with the Thirty Meter Telescope will deepen our understanding of exoplanet properties and formation. Here we provide a brief list and in subsequent sections we expand upon these ideas:</p><p>• First-light NFIRAOS+IRIS observations will provide unique and powerful follow-up observation of gas-giant planets found by GPI, SPHERE, and SCExAO. High spectralresolution spectroscopy will establish chemical abundances and rotation speeds, thereby shedding light on planetary origins. High-precision astrometry will enable monitoring of planetary orbits, providing a unique window into the dynamical history. Potential upgrades to IRIS for thermal-IR (L' band) imaging and low-resolution near-IR imaging would also boost its ability to directly detect self-luminous planets and characterize their ultracool atmospheres.</p><p>• NFIRAOS+IRIS will also be a unique instrument for extending direct imaging studies to new domains, by targeting optically faint stars that are inaccessible to current AO systems. (1) Low-mass stars (M dwarfs) may be the most common type of planetary host, and NFIRAOS+IRIS will be able to detect sub-Jupiter mass planets around these stars. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> Similarly, high-contrast imaging of dust-extincted young stars in the nearest star-forming regions will observe planet formation in action during the critical ~1-10 Myr epoch when gasgiant planets are assembling.</p><p>• TMT's proposed extreme-AO (ExAO) imaging platforms, Planetary Systems Imager (PSI; originally referred to as the Planetary Formation Imager) and Second Earth Imager on TMT (SEIT), will achieve deeper contrast at much (&gt;4x) closer separations than GPI and SCExAO.

Both GPI and SCExAO will allow us to detect and characterize Jovian planets that are much lower mass and closer to their stars (e.g., 2 M Jupiter at 5-15 AU around an A-type star at 30 pc) than can currently be done with conventional AO systems (e.g. Subaru/AO-188 and Keck/NIRC2). Adaptive secondary systems on LBT and Magellan telescopes are also showing the power of high-contrast imaging in the 3-5 µm region where giant exoplanets are exceptionally bright.</p><p>The startlingly-advanced capabilities of these upcoming instruments stem from new science modules and wavefront control architectures, which will serve as important technical milestones on the road to exoplanet imaging by TMT. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> The GPI and SCExAO integral-field spectrographs (IFS) yield lowresolution spectra that are amenable to the development of post-processing algorithms to boost planet detection capability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b454">Marois et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Currie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b456">Marois et al. 2014</ref>).

(3) GPI and SCExAO are commissioning novel coronagraphs and other speckle removal techniques to suppress the stellar halo. GPI uses an apodized-pupil Lyot coronagraph to improve contrast for planet detection. SCExAO is deploying a suite of technologies, such as the Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization coronagraph and employs "speckle nulling", a form of coherence differential imaging, to better suppress static speckles near the diffraction limit and observe at very small inner working angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">(Martinache et al. 2014</ref>). Overall, the technical advances emerging from upcoming instruments on 8-10m telescopes will boost the scientific gains to be garnered from TMT's much larger aperture, far beyond what could be imagined during the initial round of TMT instrument studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">Macintosh et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Finally, direct imaging with the Thirty Meter Telescope will complement upcoming space-borne missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the proposed SPICA and WFIRST-AFTA missions. SPICA and JWST are mid-IR optimized 3.5-and 6.5-meter telescopes, respectively, with superb sensitivity to mature, wide separation planets. While such planets are probably not detectable at the shorter wavelengths probed by TMT, JWST and SPICA have far poorer planet detection capabilities at the ~0.2-0.6" separations probed by 8-10 m telescopes and no capabilities at the much smaller separations (~0.02-0.1") that TMT can probe.</p><p>TMT's discovery space likewise is complementary to the proposed coronagraph component of WFIRST-AFTA. The coronagraph architectures being considered for WFIRST-AFTA focus on exoplanet imaging at 0.15-0.6" separations. Smaller separations will remain the exclusive domain of TMT. For some nearby stars, WFIRST and TMT could both search for and characterize planets in different regions: Neptunes to Jupiter-sized planets near the ice line for WFIRST and Super-Earths to Neptune-sized planets at smaller separations for TMT. While WFIRST may be able to target large habitable zone planets around Sun-like stars or those slightly more massive, TMT would allow us to search for planets in the habitable zones of the nearest sub-solar mass stars.</p><p>Working in concert, TMT and space-borne missions will transform our knowledge of the diversity of nearby exoplanetary systems and take significant steps toward being able to image and characterize a habitable Earth-like planet. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.2">Exoplanet Imaging at First-Light with NFIRAOS and IRIS of Young Gas-Giants</head><p>TMT's near-IR integral field spectrograph (IRIS) coupled with the facility AO system (NFIRAOS) will provide a powerful exoplanet imaging capability at TMT's first light. The raw planet detection capability for NFIRAOS/IRIS is unlikely to exceed the current/upcoming ExAO systems targeting the bright stars. However, NFIRAOS/IRIS will vastly expand the range of systems around which we can image planets and also will yield significant gains in studying the atmospheres and dynamics of GPI/SCExAO/SPHERE-discovered exoplanets.</p><p>One unique and powerful capability offered by TMT will be laser guide star (LGS) AO imaging of a variety of potential planet host stars, thanks to the far greater angular resolution and sensitivity than currently possible. Many nearby stars are too faint for ExAO systems on current telescopes (which are limited to I = 8-9 mag) but are highly desired as science targets in order to reveal the diversity of planetary systems. Low-mass stars (&lt;0.5 M ¤ ) are the most common types of stars in the stellar neighborhood and thus represent the most common hosts of planetary systems. Since these stars are much less luminous, NFIRAOS+IRIS imaging using ADI and SDI will be able to detect subJupiter planetary companions. Determining the frequency and properties of gas-giant planets as a function of stellar host mass is a necessary step toward understanding the planet formation process. Extending this concept, deep imaging of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (both young and old) can detect companions at colder temperatures than those previously found. We know that at the youngest ages (~1-10 Myr), brown dwarfs can possibly harbor planetary-mass companions, e.g. the ~5 M J companion to the ~25 M J object 2MASS 1207-39 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Chauvin et al. 2004</ref>). TMT will be able to identify the evolved (cooler, fainter) counterparts to these brown dwarf companions around older brown dwarfs and obtain detailed spectra for objects as cold as ~250 K. Imaging planets around lowmass stars in nearby open clusters (e.g. the Pleiades and Hyades) and young moving groups (e.g. TW Hya Association) will provide strong benchmarks for testing thermal evolution models. These stellar associations have well-calibrated ages based on stellar isochrones and metallicities based on spectroscopic analyses, thereby providing a sample of benchmark planets with well-established physical properties.</p><p>Similarly, NFIRAOS+IRIS will open new regimes for identifying and characterizing exoplanets, around stars at larger distances from Earth than what is possible with current ground or space-based telescopes. LGS imaging will enable studies of faint companions around the young (&lt;~10 Myr) stars in the Taurus, Sco-Cen, and ρ Ophiuchus regions (~150 pc). According to the core-accretion model, direct imaging at such young ages would discover these planets as they are in the act of forming (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b389">Kraus &amp; Ireland 2012)</ref>. The relevant physical scales correspond to angular separations of ~0.5" or less. NFIRAOS+IRIS would be sensitive to the most luminous, wide separation objects, and then future TMT ExAO systems (see Section 10.2.3 below) will probe lower masses and smaller separations. Colors and spectra of these young planets will provide their temperatures, surface gravity and accretion activity, all of which are highly uncertain in present theoretical models.</p><p>Building on pre-TMT planet discoveries, one of IRIS's major advances will come through follow-up spectroscopy and high-precision astrometry <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">(Figure 10.6)</ref>. Only a fraction of the directly-imaged exoplanets have been amenable for spectroscopic observations given their contrast. Upcoming instruments such as GPI will only provide low-resolution (R~50) spectra. An illuminating example of the gains possible from TMT comes from the high spectral resolution (R~4000) study of the HR 8799 c planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Konopacky et al. 2013</ref>), where such data provide a wealth of information about the planet's atmospheric composition and chemistry inaccessible from photometry or low resolution spectroscopy.</p><p>TMT's continued astrometric monitoring of known directly imaged planets will open a unique window into additional planetary properties such as mass and orbital eccentricity. The GPI, SPHERE, and SCExAO surveys are expected to directly image tens of young Jovian planets in orbits larger than 5-TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

While IRIS will deliver lower raw S/N than the original discovery instruments, the 3x smaller angular resolution of TMT will result in comparable or better astrometric precision.

Stars in the β Pictoris (10-20 Myr), AB Doradus (~100 Myr old), and Argus (~40 Myr old) moving groups are at the right distance. In addition the Gaia mission should greatly expand the sample of such stars. SEIT would relax the target distance constraints considerably with its planned contrast inner working angle of 10 mas. Such an instrument would be sensitive to the terrestrial planets around those stars around which giant impacttype collisions have recently occurred (e.g., HD 15407; <ref type="bibr" target="#b482">Melis et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Mapping Planetary Debris Systems -Planetesimal belts are more than just signposts for larger planets. They are crucial components of a complete planetary system, capable of influencing the final configuration of the matured planets. Dynamical friction between these small rocky bodies and planets can drive orbital migration of the planets and circularize planet orbits. In our Solar System, such processes are envisioned to have occurred through interaction with the Kuiper Belt which drove the giant planets into new orbits (the so-called Nice model). Thus, to have a complete understanding of any planetary system and its current configuration (and hence develop robust formation and evolution models) it is necessary to characterize any belts of planetesimals that may also be orbiting the same host star.</p><p>TMT near-IR ExAO instruments and the Mid-Infrared Camera, High-Disperser, and IFU spectrograph (MICHI) will be capable of detecting and characterizing planetesimal belts through the thermal TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

Transiting planetary systems can usually be better characterized than systems detected by other methods because the radius of the planet and the inclination of the orbit are established. Observations during transit also probe a planet's atmospheric composition, therefore, one of TMT's most compelling science cases is the potential for detection of O 2 or other biosignature gases via transmission spectroscopy.</p></div>

TMT's observations of transiting planetary systems will involve either spectroscopy or spectrophotometry to obtain more information about the properties of the planet or its host star, or high-spatial resolution imaging to identify stellar companions to stars or unassociated background objects. The observational modes will be dictated by the brightness of the target and the required cadence of the observations, e.g. at least several exposures per hour for monitoring during a planetary transit. Fainter stars or short cadence observations demand compensatory trade-off, i.e. with spectral resolution or resorting to spectrophotometry. This suggests that future instrumentation and configurations for TMT studies of transiting planets can be organized along three science goals:</p><p>(1) characterization of faint host stars of transiting (candidate) planets using high-resolution spectroscopy and high angular-resolution imaging; (2) photometric and low-dispersion transit spectroscopy of the brightest systems observed by Kepler and K2, and many of the fainter systems discovered by TESS, (3) high-resolution transit spectroscopy of the brightest transiting systems discovered by TESS and eventually PLATO.</p><p>The NASA Kepler mission <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref> dramatically expanded the scope of transit studies to Earthsize (and smaller) planets and to populations of thousands of planets on which robust statistical methods can be applied. However, Kepler surveyed only ~1/400th of the sky and the host stars of most Kepler systems are relatively distant (~1 kpc) and faint (V~14, K~12), making follow-up observations such as Doppler radial velocity measurements of mass or transit spectroscopy difficult or impossible even with 10-m class telescopes. For example, many Kepler host stars at ~1 kpc are probably unresolved binaries and it is often important to establish which star the planet transits to accurately determine its mass and rule out the possibility of a "false positive" (see Section 10.3.4): the K-band diffraction limit of a 10-meter telescope is 55 AU and spectroscopic detection of singleline systems with separations of tens of AU requires high-SNR, high-resolution spectra that are difficult to obtain for these faint stars.</p><p>The next decade will welcome new space-based telescopes that will survey more of the sky and include many more brighter and nearby and hence observationally accessible host stars for transiting planets.

Such observations attempt to serve two masters: brighter stars provide more photons and higher precision, but comparison stars of comparable brightness are only found at increasing wider angular separations on the sky. At first light, IRMS will likely be the instrument of choice for infrared work because it will obtain integral field spectra that do not suffer from slit loss effects: however, the relatively narrow field of view (2'x2') will prevent IRMS from observing all but a few of the systems being studied today (2014). At visible wavelengths, WFOS has a wider field of view (40 sq. arc minutes) therefore it could be use to observe some of the faintest Kepler transiting systems where the density of comparative stars is sufficiently high.</p><p>Considering only statistical noise, TMT should measure transit-derived quantities 3-4x more precisely than what is possible with 8-10m telescopes. Observations with these telescopes already show hints of a systematic photometric noise floor in the infrared, with observations coming within factors of 2-3x of the Poisson limit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Croll et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Bean et al. 2011</ref>).

Moreover, the presence of unresolved stellar companions can make interpretation of the signal ambiguous (it is necessary to know which star is being transited) as well as requiring correction for the fact that the transit signal is being diluted by the star that is not being transited. Finally, planet occurrence rates and the properties around single vs. multiple stellar systems provide tests of theories of planet formation and evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b588">Quintana et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>Most Kepler and K2 systems are too faint and the planets too small to have detectable Doppler radial velocity signals (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 10</ref>.10). Ten-meter class telescopes can rule out large Doppler signals from stellar companions but these measurements are observationally expensive and not practical for the hundreds or even thousands of systems of interest, but TMT/NIRES could rapidly screen these systems with well-timed observations at quadrature points in the orbit of the candidate planet where the maximum change in radial velocity is expected. High-resolution AO imaging using the PFI should also allow more rapid screening of binary systems, with detection at closer inner working angles than is possible with ten-meter telescopes or adaptive optics systems on smaller telescopes ( <ref type="bibr">Law et al. 2013</ref>).

In carrying out this strategy, follow-up groups make high-cadence, round-the-clock observations of a few microlensing events selected from those discovered by the survey groups with low-cadence monitoring. These discoveries have offered us some early glimpses into the distribution of planets more massive than ~few Earth mass near or beyond the so-called nebular "snow line" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Gould et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Gould et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Cassan et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>In the coming decade, high-cadence, continuous, wide-field surveys without the aid of follow-ups are expected to dominate the landscape of microlensing planet detections (Gaudi 2012). It consists of three dedicated 1.6m, 4 deg 2 FOV telescopes completely covering the longitudes to observe the bulge continuously with ~10-minute cadence. Their survey will have an order-of-magnitude leap in planet sensitivity, and in particular, it is expected to probe the low end of planet mass function by discovering ~10 planets with 0.1 M Earth &lt;M&lt;5M Earth per year ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">Henderson et al. 2014</ref>). The planned launch of the wide-field IR survey space mission WFIRST(-AFTA) at the end of the decade would bring a further order-of-magnitude leap in planet detection sensitivity. The mission is sensitive to planets down to ~2 lunar masses and is expected to detect ~3000 bound planets in the range of ~0.3 -30 AU as well as probe the free-floating planet population down to Mars mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b678">Spergel et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>

For the ground-based observations, a microlensing target is typically blended with significant flux from unrelated stars due to crowding of the bulge field. High-resolution follow-up observations from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or with AO systems on ground-based 10m-class telescopes have been performed to resolve the unrelated stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Bennett et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">, Dong et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b334">, Janczak et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Batista et al., 2014</ref>). The typical relative proper motion between the source and lens is ~6 mas/yr for a lens in the disk and ~4 mas/yr for a bulge lens, so it generally takes more than a decade for the lens to be separately resolved from the background star even with such high-resolution images <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">(Han &amp; Chang 2003)</ref>.

Only the combined flux of the source and lens have been measured for planetary microlensing events with HST or AO, and the lens flux is constrained by subtracting the source flux, which can be precisely extracted from the light curve. In practice, the measurement uncertainty is dominated by the accuracy in aligning the high-resolution and microlensing light curve photometric systems, and the lenses have been robustly detected for source/lens contrast ratios up to factor of a few ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Dong et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b334">Janczak et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 29, 2015</head><p>With a 30m telescope, the lens would be separated from the source by ~2 λ/D in H-band in ~5 years after the peak of the detection of the event. Therefore, at the time of commissioning, TMT/IRIS would be able to resolve most of the planet hosts collected by a few years of operation by the KMTNet survey (see, e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Henderson et al. 2015</ref>). An average source would be at H ~ 18, and for a typical ~0.3 M ¤ M dwarf lens at ~4 kpc, the required contrast ratio is about 10:1, easily observable by IRIS</p><p>LGS. At ~2-3 λ/D, the achievable contrast ratio is ~1000:1, capable of detecting the lens population down to the bottom of the stellar mass function for the majority of events except those with the brightest giant sources, which only comprise a few percent of all KMTNet detections ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Henderson et al. 2015</ref>). For some nearby lens systems, it is also possible to image the brown dwarf planet hosts. In these cases, the lens identification is considerably more secure, as its separation from the source can be checked with the independent relative source-lens proper motion due to finite-source effects, which are well measured for most planetary microlensing events. The lens flux measurements would offer a mass-distance relation for the lens after including models of extinction and mass-luminosity relation. The relative lens-source proper motion and event time scale provide tight constraints on the angular Einstein radius, which offer another mass-distance relation for the lens. The mass and distance of the lens star can be constrained down to ~10% by combining these constraints.</p><p>Once the lens is resolved, an exciting prospect for TMT is to obtain a medium resolution (R~4000) spectrum of the star with the IRIS near-IR IFU, which has the smallest plate scale of 9 mas. An exposure of approximately ten minutes on IRIS could obtain a spectrum of typical lens at reasonable SNR (≥10 per wavelength channel). The IRIS spectrum would enable identification of planet host's stellar type, metal abundance as well as kinematic constraints through radial velocity measurements. It has been well established by RV surveys that the frequency of close-in Jovian planets increases as a function of host metallicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b622">Santos et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005)</ref>.

Spectroscopic characterization of microlensing hosts by TMT would open up a new window in studying whether the distribution of planets ranging from super Jupiters to sub-Earths at long periods depends on the environment of the star (metal rich vs. metal poor, bulge vs. disk).</p><p>During the operational span of a mission like WFIRST, the lens and source are typically not sufficiently separated to be completely resolved. However, thanks to a well-calibrated PSF, even when the lens and source are separated by a fraction of the PSF, it is possible to measure the lens flux from modeling the image elongation. It is expected that ~10% mass measurement can be routinely done in this way <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Bennett et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b678">Spergel et al., 2013)</ref>. TMT can still contribute to studying the WFIRST planet discoveries by making spectroscopic measurements of the planetary hosts.

When exposed to the sun by the removal of a protective layer of debris, this ice sublimates, producing the comet-like appearance. Active asteroids are potentially important because some are located in a region of the main belt from which the terrestrial planets are thought to have acquired their volatiles and some biogenic precursor molecules. Study of the active asteroids may help us to understand the origin of the oceans. TMT will be useful because most active asteroids are faint. TMT's large aperture will permit spectroscopic studies in search of volatiles released by outgassing.</p></div>

Asteroids with satellites (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b448">Marchis et al., 2005</ref>) are the best study cases for understanding the dynamical history, impact process, and physical properties of the primary.

Density, which is directly related to the composition and internal structure of the asteroid, can be estimated if the shape of the primary is available. If the primary is associated with a young dynamical family, then the combination of the moon and the dynamical family provides strong constraints on the family-forming process.

They may consist of materials that formed the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, or they may be objects formed at larger distances (perhaps in the Kuiper belt) and then scattered inwards to their present locations. The physical and dynamical properties of these objects enable key tests of the competing scenarios for the evolution of the early solar system. Composition of an asteroid can be best determined through moderate resolution (R ~ 1,000) spectroscopy in the near-infrared (1 -2.5 µm; NIR), where most important ices and organic materials show diagnostic features. It is expected that hundreds (if not thousands) of km-size Cybeles, Hildas and Trojans will be observable spectroscopically by IRIS on TMT. Investigating the outer-belt objects, especially the small ones, with TMT may provide answers to the outstanding issues, such as: What are the cores of the giant planets made from? Where and how did the Trojans form? What is the dynamical history of the solar system? </p></div>

The most promising method to estimate the shape, and subsequently infer the density, is via analyzing light curves of binary systems. For ground-based measurements, the precision on the diameter is the limiting factor of the most accurate density estimates. Giving the advantage of its high-angular resolving power (~7mas), TMT will be able to resolve a dozen large Trans-Neptunian objects and ~50-100 Trojan asteroids, providing a good estimate of their size. If a moon is detected, TMT will also derive high-precision densities of these objects. This study will greatly improve the number and quality of density measurements of the outer-belt asteroids, to a degree not possible before TMT.</p><p>Because of the vast distance (30-50 AU) of this region from the Sun and the Earth, even with the largest telescopes currently available, only the largest KBOs (&gt; several hundred km) are observable. The Kuiper Belt is therefore the region about which we know the least in the solar system. On the other hand, due to the low temperature and the relatively slow dynamical evolution, the Kuiper belt can be considered a "debris disk" of our planetary system, comparable to the counterparts of other stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">Kalas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b721">Trilling et al., 2008)</ref>. The belt contains essential information about the planetary formation processes, including both the "cold disk" that harbors the objects that are thought to formed in situ with the whole planetary system, and the "hot/scattered disk" that is the refuge of objects that are dynamically scattered into it during the dynamical evolution of the inner solar system. Comparisons of the Kuiper belt with the debris disks around other stars provide important indications about both the Kuiper belt itself and the planetary environment around other stars. TMT allows the characterization of more small KBOs by providing greater sensitivity. Compositional data will also greatly aid the study of dynamically families, which are generally formed during collisions of the parent bodies. Finally, spectroscopic analysis may also reveal evidence of evolutionary processes on KBOs, such cryovolcanism, volatile loss and surface gardening. The large aperture of TMT allows for the collection of the spectra of relatively smaller KBOs, vastly increase the number of samples for which we can study surface compositions.</p></div>

And ices can be investigated, through their solid-state absorption bands, in a variety of objects -from active comets to satellites and TNOs. At optical wavelengths, high resolution spectroscopy can be used to determine nuclear spin temperatures in NH 3 and H 2 O through emission lines of their dissociation products NH 2 and H 2 O+. The nuclear spin temperature is believed to be preserved indefinitely after the formation of a molecule, and hence gives an estimate of the temperature prevailing at the time of the last condensation of the ice.

Temporal evolution of giant planet atmospheres to study fundamental dynamics, meteorology, chemistry and global circulation. 2. Vertical structure analyses to see how the 'visible atmosphere' responds to energy, momentum and material fluxes from (a) below the clouds and (b) the upper atmosphere.</p><p>3.

However, due to the long integration time of the low-resolution telescopes, many characteristics of these waves, such as the phase speed and propagation direction, have not been measured directly. TMT observations with short integration time will be able to map thermal waves in giant planet atmospheres in much enhanced details and reveal the characteristics of thermal waves on different giant planets.</p><p>Interestingly Io's calderas can be used as occultation sources to study waves propagating through Jupiter's atmosphere and the vertical structure of Jupiter by targeting volcanic calderas on Io as Io goes into eclipse. The volcanic calderas have temperatures of ~1,300 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b677">Spencer et al. 2007</ref>) with spatial extents of 10-50 km 2 . These bright emission sources are just below the spatial resolution of TMT at all wavelengths so they could serve as point like emission sources to be observed while going in and out of eclipse. With an orbital period of 42 hours about Jupiter, this would afford repeated ingress and egress observation possibilities every 4 Jovian rotations. There are often several volcanoes active on Io simultaneously. Using an integrated field unit one could imagine observing all of Io's disk simultaneously, gathering possibly as many as 5-10 occultation light curves nearly simultaneous, yet slightly offset both in time and spatially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.3">Planetary Seismology from Impacts on giant planets</head><p>The internal structures of giant planets are much less well known than those of main-sequence stars because of uncertainties in the equation of state of degenerate gas, the composition (typically nonsolar), the interaction with the magnetic field and, in the upper layers, the relative magnitudes of internal heat and energy deposited from the sun. Giant planet interiors are inaccessible to direct study from above, but oscillations excited by asteroid and comet impact can generate waves that are potentially observable. Such waves will propagate through the planetary interiors, allowing giant planet seismology to constrain internal structure in much the same way as done for our planet using earthquakes. The model is the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994, although the state of technology then did not permit the detection of planet-wide waves. Asteroid impacts, especially the large ones, can excite atmospheric waves capable of revealing information about the internal structures of the planets that probably cannot be obtained in any other way. TMT would be able to measure the propagation direction, propagation speed, as well as the energy containing wave number of the atmospheric waves. Such measurements will probe the atmospheric structure and composition, providing unique information useful not just in the solar system but also in the study of Jupiter-like exoplanets, where no comparable data will be available for the foreseeable future.</p></div>

They remain the least understood and most mysterious planets in the solar system and yet Kepler has already shown that planets of similar mass (in between that of Earth and Jupiter) are widespread outside the solar system. Thus, TMT observations will play a very important role in understanding these ice giants. High angular and high spectral resolution observations by TMT will be used to constrain the bulk composition and the mean vertical distribution of temperatures and gas abundances, to shed light on how planetary atmospheres form and evolve as a function of distance from their host stars.</p><p>TMT observations can also determine the different spatial variability of temperature and gaseous abundance on Uranus and Neptune. The spatial variability is strongly connected to the atmospheric dynamics, such as the vertical propagation of waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere. TMT can observe these waves by taking direct optical images of the planets. In combinations with numerical simulations, these observations can help constrain the properties of the waves, as well as the background states for wave propagation, for instance, the atmospheric stratification.

Its atmosphere is often compared to that of the young Earth, albeit cooled too much lower temperatures (&lt;90 K) than ever found on our planet. It offers a valuable opportunity to study a high mass atmosphere on a solid-surface planetary body, and so to advance models of atmospheric circulation, precipitation and seasonal response. Current observations suggest that Titan has lakes mainly in the northern polar region and has tropospheric clouds mainly in the southern middle latitudes and polar region. Recent numerical simulations suggested the lake formation is due to the cold-trapped methane accumulated in the polar region, and predicted prominent clouds will form within about two (Earth) years while lake levels will rise over the next fifteen years due to the seasonally varying solar radiation on Titan. TMT will be a powerful telescope with which to observe and monitor exciting climate change on Titan. In particular, the high spatial and spectral resolution offered by TMT will reveal the spatial distribution and temporal variation of methane clouds, and separate the high clouds generated by deep convection from the low clouds formed over the surface methane reservoirs. When combined with General Circulation Models, such observations would be essential in understanding the hydrological cycle and seasonal variation on Titan.</p></div>

Spacecraft imaging shows a world littered with volcanic eruptions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 11</ref>.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 11</ref>.5). Current research has shown that the atmosphere of Io is supported both by SO 2 frost sublimation as well as SO 2 and other gasses erupting from the volcanoes found there. However, the relative dominance of the frost or volcanic input is still a subject of controversy. SO 2 has molecular bands at 7, 8 and 19 µm. At these wavelengths Io can just barely be resolved by an 8 meter telescope without AO (the case for TEXES on Gemini North). However, with the TMT Io will be resolved by 26 and 10 spatial resolution elements across its disk at 7 and 20 µm, respectively. This will transform the way we study Io. Eclipse observations, where Jupiter eclipses Io for a few hours approximately every two days, also offer another way of testing atmospheric support. Eclipse events inhibit solar heating required for frost sublimation. Observing the atmosphere during eclipses will help to see if and how much the atmosphere condenses onto the cold surface. This process has never been observed for the primary atmosphere due to the lack of telescope light collecting power. Ultimately, MICHI on the TMT will be able to measure the spatial variation of SO 2 on Io both meridionally (with latitude) and zonally (with longitude), but critically as a function of local time and during Jupiter eclipses that are both strong functions of frost sublimation, and will allow us to determination of how much of Io's atmosphere is supported purely by sublimation and how much by volcanic activity.</p><p>Additionally, we can expect that individual plumes will be recognizable using MICHI as well. During the New horizons flyby of Jupiter the volcano Tvashtar was imaged with a plume height varying between roughly 320 and 360 km and a full width of about 1,100 km, consistent with the diameter of the pyroclastic deposits. With spatial resolutions ranging from 100 km at 5 µm, 240 km at 12 µm and 400 km at 20 µm, we should expect to be able to directly measure the composition of volcanoes with TMT and MICHI. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 . 1 :</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Figure 2.1: The conceptual instrument suite located on the Nasmyth platforms of the latest telescope design.

Deason et al. (2013) using the HST to observe Andromeda galaxy serendipitously identified a dozen foreground stars in the Milky Way halo. They measured the first sideways motions (represented by the arrows) for such distant halo stars. The motions indicate the possible presence of a shell in the halo, which may have formed from the accretion of a dwarf galaxy.

Based on long baseline (5 -7 years) multi-epoch HST/ACS photometry, Deason et al. (2013) have 
measured proper motions (PMs) of 13 main-sequence Milky Way halo stars at an average distance 
of ~24 kpc from the Galactic center with a root-mean-square spread of 6 kpc and median proper 
motion accuracy of ~5 km/s at this distance. These observations point to a fairly complex velocity 
anisotropy profile at large distances which is likely affected by substructure in the stellar halo. Their 
results suggest that the stellar halo velocity anisotropy out to a distance of ~30 kpc is less radially 
biased than solar neighborhood measurements. This is opposite to what is expected from violent

Several possible solutions, such as stellar destruction and astration, nuclear uncertainties and new physics, atomic diffusion etc. have been proposed to explain this discrepancy. The Li abundances observed in hyper metal-poor stars that are still in the main-sequence turn-off phases (Aoki et al. 2006, Caffau et al. 2011) might provide a clue to this problem. High resolution and high sensitivity of TMT/HROS are required for measurements of low Li abundance and Li isotope ratios in hyper metal-poor stars as well as in extreme metal-poor stars. An understanding of the Li problem and depletion processes inside stars may be achieved better from a detailed study of metal poor globular clusters. Estimating the Li abundance in the faint main-sequence stars is very challenging with existing 8 to 10 meter telescopes but will be relatively</figDesc><table>TMT.PSC.TEC.07.007.REL02

5 Sampling time relates to the integration and deadtime of individual exposures in sequences of 
time resolved observations that require fast detector readout schemes. If single observations that 
are repeated on longer timescales then this is captured in the Cadence and nothing is reported in 
the Sampling time.

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Stehl Ratio: When considering an unresolved point source, an adaptive optics system can be thought of as gathering a fraction of the light from the seeing disk and concentrating that fraction into an image with a diffraction limited width, superimposed over the remaining uncorrected light. The Strehl Ratio is the ratio of the actual peak intensity over the theoretical diffraction limited peak intensity for a perfect image.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> A 10 milli-arc second occulting mask translates to 22 microns at the TMT focal plane.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> Prompt observations with response time of &gt;10 minutes, sampling cadence of ~1s, spectral resolution of ~100 in the optical and NIR are needed to study the GRB fireball. 7 Some ideas for observations of High-z GRBs require faster sampling and lower spectral resolution.</note>
