				<p>Motivated by the possibility that a coronagraph will be put on WFIRST/AFTA, we explore the direct detectability of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) in the optical. We quantify a planet&apos;s detectabil-ity by the fraction of its orbit for which it is in an observable configuration (f obs). Using a suite of Monte Carlo experiments, we study the dependence of f obs upon the inner working angle (IWA) and minimum achievable contrast (C min) of the direct-imaging observatory; the planet&apos;s phase function, geometric albedo, single-scattering albedo, radius, and distance from Earth; and the semi-major axis distribution of EGPs. We calculate phase functions for a given geometric or single-scattering albedo, assuming various scattering mechanisms. We find that the Lambertian phase function can predict significantly larger f obs &apos;s with respect to the more realistic Rayleigh phase function. For observations made with WFIRST/AFTA&apos;s baseline capabilities (C min ∼ 10 −9 , IWA ∼ 0.2), Jupiter-like planets orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 parsecs of Earth have volume-averaged observability fractions of ∼12%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively. At 10 parsecs, such observations yield f obs &gt; 1% for low-to modest-eccentricity planets with semi-major axes in the range ∼2 − 10 AU. If C min = 10 −10 , this range extends to ∼35 AU. We find that, in all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for detection in a blind search is low (&lt; 5%). However, with orbital parameter constraints from long-term radial-velocity campaigns and Gaia astrometry, the tools we develop in this work can be used to determine both the most promising systems to target and when to observe them.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the burgeoning field of exoplanetary science, the scientific return from direct imaging has so far been meager when compared to the very successful radial-velocity and transit methods. This delay in progress has been primarily due to the technological challenge of performing high-contrast observations at small angular separations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oppenheimer &amp; Hinkley 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Traub &amp; Oppenheimer 2010)</ref>. For a Jupiter twin, the plant/star flux ratio is expected to be ∼10 −7 in the mid-infrared and ∼10 −9 in the optical, and if the planet is in close proximity to Earth (&lt; 30 pc), these contrasts must be achieved at angular separations of a few tenths of arcseconds. Making the problem harder still, the direct detectability of a given planet will vary with time, depending upon its Keplerian orbital elements and atmospheric properties-which will depend upon the planet's age, mass, orbital distance, and parent star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sudarsky et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these challenges, recent progress has been made via high-contrast observations in the near-infrared of nearby, young extrasolar giant planets (EGPs)/brown dwarfs at very wide orbital separations (∼10 − 200 AU). Such substellar companions are self-luminous and provide contrasts and angular separations that are far more favorable than the case of a nearby Jupiter twin. Indeed, there have been a number of notable discoveries and partial characterizations, including 2MASS 1207b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chauvin et al. 2004</ref>), AB Pic b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. 2005</ref>), GQ Lup b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Neuhäuser et al. 2005</ref>), β-Pictoris b (Lajgreco@astro.princeto.edu † burrows@astro.princeton.edu <ref type="bibr">grange et al. 2009</ref>), HR 8799bcde ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Marois et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barman et al. 2011</ref>), and GJ 504b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuzuhara et al. 2013</ref>). In the coming years, a plethora of high-contrast instruments such as the ground-based GPI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>), SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>), LBTI <ref type="bibr">(Skrut- skie et al. 2010</ref>), ScExAO/Charis/HiCIAO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Suzuki et al. 2010</ref>) and the space-based NIRCam and MIRI on JWST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming et al. 2009</ref>) will almost certainly produce a rich sample of directly imaged and characterized young EGPs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beichman et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>All of the above high-contrast imaging efforts are focused on measurements in the infrared.

Additionally, optical reflectedlight observations are sensitive to cool, mature EGPs at wide orbital distances, a population of planets that has been inaccessible to infrared measurements. Direct imaging and characterization of cool, mature EGPs will require a space-based high-contrast instrument such as the anticipated optical imaging and spectrophotometric coronagraph that is being designed for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)/Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (AFTA) mission. If realized, this instrument will achieve planet/star contrast ratios better than ∼10 −9 and an inner working angle near or better than ∼0. <ref type="bibr">2 (Spergel et al. 2015</ref>), well within the necessary capability to detect a Jupiter twin located ∼20 pc form Earth <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Therefore, studies of the observational signatures and direct detectability of reflected light from EGPs are particularly timely and will aid in the design and optimization of WFIRST/AFTA or a similar spacebased effort.</p><p>In this work, we present an exploration of the direct detectability of cool EGPs at visible wavelengths (∼0.4−1.0 µm). We quantify a planet's direct detectability by the fraction of its orbit for which it is in an observable configuration (its observability fraction f obs ). Using a suite of Monte Carlo (MC) experiments, we explore the dependence of f obs upon various input parameters such as the inner working angle (IWA), minimum achievable contrast (C min ), planetary albedo and radius, distance from Earth, and the semi-major axis distribution of EGPs. We assume cloud-free, homogeneous atmospheres and calculate phase functions for a given geometric or single-scattering albedo, assuming different scattering mechanisms. Although partly motivated by the possibility of an optical coronagraph on WFIRST/AFTA, our study is relevant to any effort to directly detect exoplanets in the optical.</p><p>In §2 we describe how we model reflected-light observations of EGPs. We tabulate and provide analytic fits to the geometric albedo as a function of single-scattering albedo for scalar and vector Rayleigh, Lambert, and isotropic scattering. In addition, we present representative albedo spectra for homogeneous atmospheres of cool EGPs. This section is supported by an appendix, which reviews the equations that connect the Keplerian orbital elements to the observed phase angle and time. In §3 we present illustrative calculations of the variation of planet/star flux ratios and angular separations with orbital parameters, which ultimately determines an exoplanet's direct detectability. In §4 we describe our MC experiments and discuss the assumptions we make about the orbital parameter distributions of EGPs.</p><p>Our results are given in §5. In §5.1 we present a parametric study of the mean observability fraction, f obs , for many MC experiments, which are run under different sets of assumptions. In §5.2 we highlight the fact that f obs for a population of planets is proportional to the probability that a blind search for such planets will yield a detection. Equivalently, f obs can be interpreted as the probability for detection, assuming all stars have one such planet. In §5.3 we briefly consider the optical signature of thermal emission from young EGPs. The paper is brought to close in §6 with a summary of our results.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we define a "Jupiter-like" planet to be an EGP with the radius of Jupiter, a geometric albedo of 0.5, and a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere. Although these atmospheric properties are not consistent with Jupiter at all wavelengths, near ∼0.565 µm, which is at the center of one of the WFIRST/AFTA bandpasses, they provide a decent approximation to observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Karkoschka 1994)</ref>.</p><p>1 For a summary of the diagnostic potential for cold exoplanet characterization using the anticipated WFIRST/AFTA coronagraph, see Burrows (2014), <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marley et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GIANT EXOPLANETS</head><p>To directly detect an extrasolar planet, its dim light must be separated from the overwhelming glare of its bright parent star. For a given high-contrast imaging observation, this requires that two conditions be simultaneously satisfied: 1) the planet/star contrast ratio (F p /F ) must be above the minimum achievable contrast (C min ), and 2) the planet/star angular separation (δφ) must be both larger than the inner working angle (IWA) and smaller than the outer working angle (OWA). As a further complication, C min will typically be a function of δφ, and both of these parameters will depend upon the wavelength of the observation. Thus, the direct detectability of an exoplanet ultimately depends upon its location in (F p /F ) − δφ parameter space, which is a complicated function of time, orbital and atmospheric parameters, and the high-contrast imaging technology used to make the observation. In this section, we describe the methods we employ to predict the direct detectability of EGPs as they move through (F p /F ) − δφ parameter space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Planet/Star Contrast Ratios: Albedos and Phase</head><p>Functions At optical wavelengths (∼0.4−1.0 µm), the flux from a giant exoplanet is dominated by reflected starlight, provided the planet is sufficiently old and of low enough mass that its thermal emission is negligible (see §5.3 for a discussion of thermal emission from young EGPs). Observationally, the wavelength-and phase-dependence of this reflection is encompassed by the geometric albedo spectrum, A g (λ), and the classical phase function, Φ(λ, α). Here, λ is the photon wavelength, and α is the exoplanetcentric angle between the star and the observer. In terms of these parameters, the planet/star flux ratio is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F p F = A g (λ) R p d 2 Φ(λ, α),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where R p is the planet radius and d is the orbital distance (see appendix, Equation (A.2)). Φ(α, λ) is normalized to unity at full phase (α = 0 • ), which defines the geometric albedo. The planet's atmospheric composition, temperature/pressure structure, cloud/haze profiles, and scattering properties govern A g (λ) and Φ(λ, α). Hence, observations of optical planet/star flux ratios, as a function of wavelength and phase angle, have great potential to constrain the theory of exoplanet atmospheres (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ca- hoy et al. 2010</ref>). Furthermore, the shape and magnitude of an exoplanet's phase-folded light curve are highly sensitive to the Keplerian elements of its orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sudarsky et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dyudina et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>, providing an independent method for measuring orbital parameters that complements astrometric and radial-velocity methods. In this work, we are interested in the general character, as opposed to detailed quantitative predictions, of the direct detectability of EGPs. We, therefore, generally assume planets with constant A g (the exception is in §5.1.5, where we vary A g with orbital distance using two simple models) and use the formalism presented in <ref type="bibr">Mad- husudhan &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> to calculate the associated single-scattering albedo (ω) and phase function for an as- Note. -These calculations were carried out with the formalism described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows (2012).</ref> sumed scattering mechanism. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we have tabulated A g as a function of ω for scalar and vector Rayleigh scattering, Lambert reflection, and isotropic scattering. Unless stated otherwise, we will hereafter refer to vector Rayleigh scattering as Rayleigh scattering.</p><p>The geometric albedo for a Lambert surface has a well-known analytic expression: A g (ω) = (2/3) ω. Analytic fits to A g (ω) for isotropic (iso) and scalar/vector (sca/vec) Rayleigh scattering are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A iso g = 0.6896 (1 + 0.4380s)(1 − s) (1 + 1.2966s)(1 + 0.7269s) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A sca g = 0.8190</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(1 + 0.1924s)(1 − s) (1 + 1.5946s)(1 + 0.0886ω) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>A vec g = 0.6901</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(1 + 0.4664s)(1 − s) (1 + 1.7095s)(1 − 0.1345ω) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where s ≡ √ 1 − ω. These fits are accurate to within 0.5% for all ω, with the largest discrepancies corresponding to ω &lt; 0.4 2 . Fits such as these are particularly useful for efficient theoretical calculations of the geometric albedo, as well as for retrieving a representative atmosphereaveraged scattering albedo from an observed geometric albedo.</p><p>It is common to assume the Lambert phase function when modeling reflected-light observations. However, this assumption neglects the albedo-and wavelengthdependence of physical phase curves, and generally predicts higher values than the more physically motivated Rayleigh phase function <ref type="bibr">(Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2 Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> also provide an analytic fit to A vec g (ω), which is marginally better than Equation (4) for small ω, but considerably less accurate for ω close to unity. 2012). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> compares the phase curves for scattering due to Rayleigh, isotropic, and Lambert scattering. We see that Rayleigh scattering phase curves are systematically lower than isotropic and Lambert phase curves for α 120 • , differing by as much as a factor of ∼2 for phase angles in the range 60 • α 90 • (see also, Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012). For most phase angles, increasing ω results in better agreement between these scattering processes. Rayleigh phase curves generally increase with increasing ω, whereas isotropic scattering phase curves show the opposite trend. In §5.1.1, we compare predictions of the direct detectability of EGPs with Rayleigh, isotopic, and Lambert phase functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Keplerian Elements</head><p>Once Φ(λ, α) is obtained for a particular planet, the observed phase curve depends on the Keplerian elements of its orbit 3 . These include the semi-major axis (a), orbital inclination (i), eccentricity (e), argument of periastron (ω p ), time of periastron passage (t p ), and longitude of the ascending node (Ω) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sudarsky et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dyudina et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Bur- rows 2012)</ref>. For an assumed stellar mass, the period of the planet's orbit (P ) can be calculated from a. Note Ω is necessary when an absolute celestial frame is designated (e.g., when measuring the full Stokes polarization or cataloguing many different systems in the same solar-system frame). However, one can assume Ω = 90 • or simply ignore this parameter when the system itself is allowed to provide a natural orientation (e.g., in exoplanet radialvelocity measurements). Throughout this work, we will assume Ω = 90 • .</p></div>

The models are cloud-free, homogeneous, semi-infinite, and use opacities at a pressure of 0.5 atmospheres. For the temperatures and pressures relevant to cool EGPs, we find ω(λ) is relatively insensitive to variations in atmospheric pressure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Planet/Star Angular Separation</head><p>In addition to the planet/star contrast ratio, the planet/star angular separation is an essential parameter in determining the feasibility of the direct detection of reflected light from an exoplanet. For coronagraphic observations, the figure of merit is given as an IWA and OWA. An IWA (OWA) is the minimum (maximum) planet/star angular separation that can be resolved by a given instrument. Using the formalism outlined in the appendix, the projected angular separation, as a function of phase angle and time, can be obtained via the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">δφ = d D ⊕ cos 2 (θ + ω p ) + sin 2 (θ + ω p ) cos 2 i ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where D ⊕ is the system's distance from Earth and θ is the planet's orbital angle as measured from periastron (the true anomaly). Inspection of the above equation reveals that, as with the planet/star flux ratio, the time dependence of the planet/star angular separation will depend sensitively upon the Keplerian orbital elements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEPARATIONS WITH ORBITAL PARAMETERS</head><p>Using the methods presented in §2 to calculate planet/star flux ratios and angular separations, we now present example realizations of the (F p /F ) − δφ parameter space for EGPs. The calculations in this section are representative of those that will be used in our Monte Carlo experiments, which are presented in §4. Several previous studies have also investigated this parameter space. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino (2010</ref>) considered the eccentricity and inclination dependence of exoplanet phase signatures, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kane (2013)</ref> used the eccentricity distribution of known exoplanets to study the completeness of imaging surveys, and Janson (2010) studied the effect that prior knowledge of orbital inclination has on the efficiency of directly imaging Earth-like planets. In this paper, we build on previous work by performing a systematic study of the dependence of the direct detectability of EGPs upon a wide range of technological and astrophysical parameters ( §5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Eccentricity and Inclination</head><p>As mentioned in §2.1.1 and §2.2, observed flux ratios and separations are strong functions of the Keplerian or-  bital elements. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> demonstrates this dependence for circular orbits with many different inclinations (left column) and face-on orbits with many different eccentricities (right column). The top row shows planet/star flux ratios, and the bottom row shows the corresponding angular separations for a system located 10 pc from Earth. All calculations in this figure assume a Jupiterlike planet in an orbit with a = 5 AU and ω p = 0 • . Although it has been pointed out previously in the literature, it is worth reemphasizing that direct-imaging observations are well-suited for studying face-on systems (the opposite is true for the radial-velocity and transit methods, which are biased towards high-inclination systems). The reason for this is that an exoplanet on a circular, face-on orbit with F p /F &gt; C min and δφ &gt; IWA will be directly detectable at all times (note we are assuming δφ &lt; OWA ). If, on the other hand, its inclination is ∼90 • , both the planet/star flux ratio and angular separation will drop below their detection thresholds for some fraction of the orbit as the planet passes through the full range of possible phase angles. For instance, if C min = 10 −10 and IWA = 0.3 , then a face-on orbit (flat purple lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) will be well above the detection thresholds at all times. However, as we increase the inclination in the left column of this figure, we see that the flux ratio dips below C min for an increasingly larger fraction of the orbit centered at new phase (α = 180 • ). Similarly, the minimum planet/star angular separation decreases with increasing inclination, falling below the IWA for an increasingly larger fraction of the orbit centered at new phase and full phase. Although the flux ratio near full phase is largest for high-inclination orbits, the planet will still be undetectable due to the small planet/star angular separation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F p /F ω p =0 • i 0 • 10 • 20 • 30 • 40 • 50 • 60 • 70 • 80 • ω p =90 • ω p =180 • ω p =270 • -0.5 -0.25 0.0 0.</formula><p>In the right column of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, we show the effect of increasing the eccentricity of a face-on orbit from circular (e = 0) to highly eccentric (e = 0.8). In this case, the phase variations are due to the time dependence of the orbital distance. On one hand, a planet on a highly eccentric orbit can be an excellent direct-imaging target, as it spends a large fraction of its orbit at larger orbital distances from its parent star, and for certain sets of Keplerian elements, this can provide angular separations that are highly favorable for direct-imaging observations. This, however, comes at the cost of lower flux ratios throughout most of its orbit and very small angular separations when it is near periastron passage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Argument of Periastron and Inclination</head><p>As has been pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino (2011)</ref>, the interaction between the argument of periastron and inclination in (F p /F ) − δφ parameter space can be quite complex. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows various combinations of these parameters for a Jupiter-like planet on an eccentric orbit with e = 0.6 and a = 5 AU. Each column shows planet/star flux ratios and angular separations for orbits with inclinations that vary from 0 • to 80 • , with the argument of periastron held constant at the value indicated in each top left corner. Note we use the convention that when α = θ = 0 • , ω p = i = 90 • . In other words, periastron passage coincides with full phase when the argument of periastron is 90 • and with new phase when it is 270 • .</p><p>The detectability of planets on face-on orbits is independent of ω p , as can be seen by the constant purple curve in all panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. As we increase the inclination, the flux ratio can either increase or decrease, depending upon the periastron argument and phase of the orbit. For ω p = 90 • , the flux ratio decreases with inclination for most of the orbit as the planet transitions from being permanently oriented at quarter phase when i = 0 • to displaying nearly all phase angles when i = 80 • . At full phase, which corresponds to periastron passage, the flux ratio achieves its maximum for this set of parameters. However, as is typically the case, this maxi-mum flux ratio corresponds to a minimum planet/star angular separation that, in the limit of a perfectly edgeon system, drops to zero at the time of periastron passage. Interesting behavior also occurs when ω p = 270 • . For this periastron argument, periastron passage corresponds to new phase, and, in exactly the opposite sense from the ω p = 90 • case, the flux ratio increases with inclination for most of the orbit and results in a minimum at the time of periastron passage for high-inclination orbits. For orbits with i 50 • , the minimum angular separation actually coincides with the minimum flux ratio, and the maximum angular separation coincides with the relatively large fraction of the orbit with a large flux ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">MONTE CARLO EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We have performed a set of Monte Carlo (MC) experiments, in which we generate random orbits and calculate the fraction of time a giant planet on each orbit would be directly detectable in the optical. We define this fraction to be the observability fraction, f obs , and we calculate its value under many different assumptions. An illustrative calculation of f obs for a Jupiter-like planet on a random orbit around a star located 10 pc from Earth is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. We have assumed a direct-imaging observatory with C min = 10 −9 and IWA = 0.2 , which are the baseline coronagraph design parameters for WFIRST/AFTA. The purple curve represents the planet/star contrast ratio (left axis), the red curve shows the corresponding angular separation (right axis), and the corresponding detection thresholds are indicated by the dashed lines. For the planet to be detectable, each curve must be above its associated dashed line. This is true only for times within the gray hatched region. A Jupiter-like planet on this particular orbit would have f obs ≈ 20%. Given an estimate of the occurrence rate of such planets, the mean f obs for many systems can be translated into the probability that a direct-imaging observation of a random star will result in a detection (see §5.2).</p></div>

To accomplish this, we assume planetary orbital orientations are isotropically distributed with respect to the observer, which leads to periastron arguments distributed uniformly in <ref type="bibr">[0, 2π]</ref> and cos i distributed uniformly in <ref type="bibr">[−1, 1]</ref>. The semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions must be determined empirically. Most of our knowledge of these distributions has come from radial-velocity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Howard et al. 2010</ref>) and transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>) surveys that are biased towards short-period planets and have only been in operation long enough to fully describe planets with periods up to a few thousand days.</p><p>Nevertheless, we assume both the semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions derived from radial-velocity planets can be extrapolated to wider separations.

For the eccentricity distribution, we use the twoparameter Beta distribution given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipping (2013)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P β (e; a, b) = Γ(a + b) Γ(a)Γ(b) e a−1 (1 − e) b−1 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where Γ is the Gamma function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Mean Observability Fractions</head><p>Here, we present a parametric study of the mean observability fraction, f obs , for different sets of MC experiments, each composed of 5 × 10 5 random orbits. For a given population of planets, f obs can be interpreted as a detection probability, assuming all stars have one such planet. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, we show the distribution of f obs as a function of orbital parameters for three illustrative MC experiments. Each column corresponds to an independent experiment, where we have assumed C min = 10 −9 (left column), C min = 5 × 10 −10 (middle column), and C min = 10 −10 (right column). In all three cases, we use our fiducial orbital parameter distributions, and calculate f obs for direct observations of a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a star at a distance of D ⊕ = 10 pc from Earth, using an instrument with IWA = 0.2 , OWA = 1.75 , and the minimum contrast specified at the top of each column.</p><p>In a given panel, each dot represents a single orbit, and the color-scale shows the observability fraction for the indicated assumptions about the planet and directimaging observatory. For a fixed minimum contrast, the semi-major axis has by far the largest effect on f obs , creating highly clustered regions of low and high values of f obs . The sharp drop in observability interior to 2 AU corresponds to an angular separation of 0.2 , which is the assumed IWA. Note, however, that eccentric orbits with a &lt; 2 AU are able to achieve nonzero observability fractions, since a planet on such an orbit spends a large fraction of its time near orbital distances of a(1 + e), making it possible for the observed angular separations to fall outside the IWA, provided the full set of Keplerian elements allows for such geometries. These results make it clear that f obs is very sensitive to the assumed semi-major axis distribution. Steeper (shallower) powerlaw indices will result in narrower (broader) regions of high f obs values, and the assumed values of a max and a min determine the region within which the 5 × 10 5 planets are distributed. In addition, decreasing the minimum contrast increases the range of semi-major axes that are detectable and leads to an increasing number of orbits for which f obs ∼ 1.0 (i.e., orbits that are observable at all times). For C min = 10 −9 , low-to modest-eccentricity orbits with f obs &gt; 1% are confined to 2 AU a 10 AU. As we decrease C min from left to right in this figure, we see orbits with increasingly larger semi-major axes achieve nonzero f obs , reaching a ∼ 15 AU and a ∼ 35 AU for C min = 5 × 10 −10 and C min = 10 −10 , respectively.</p><p>As mentioned previously, low-inclination orbits are beneficial to direct-imaging observations. In the top left panel, it is particularly clear that orbits with f obs ∼ 1.0 are associated with low inclinations. However, planets with i 50 • can have f obs ∼ 15% out to a ∼ 10 − 30 AU, depending on C min , since phase angles near full phase become observationally accessible. There is also an interesting feature near ω p ∼ 270 • , which corresponds to orbits with periastron passage occurring at new phase. Near this periastron argument, the region of large f obs extends to semi-major axes as large as ∼20 AU for C min = 10 −10 . For a planet with ω p ∼ 270 • , the planet/star flux ratio rises with increasing inclination throughout most of its orbit, and the largest angular separations coincide with the highest flux ratios when i 50 • (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). These factors collectively increase the semi-major axes for which a planet on such an orbit can have a large observability fraction.</p><p>For the remainder of this section, we present the mean observability fraction, f obs , for many MC experiments, which are run under different sets of assumptions. In each case, our goal is to study how the observability fraction depends upon input parameters such as albedo, planetary radius, distance from Earth, minimum achievable contrast, and the semi-major axis distribution. For each experiment, we vary one parameter with respect to a fiducial model, which is comprised of the following assumptions:</p><p>• the planetary atmospheres are Rayleigh scattering with A g = 0.5 (this corresponds to ω ≈ 0.95 for Rayleigh scattering),</p><p>• the planets have the radius of Jupiter and orbit stars located 10 pc from Earth,</p><p>• the direct-imaging observatory has an OWA = 1.75 and C min = 10 −9 (similar to what is anticipated for WFIRST/AFTA),</p><p>• the Keplerian orbital elements are distributed according to the distributions given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Of course, the above assumptions do not fully represent realistic physical/statistical properties of planets or any future direct-imaging mission. Nevertheless, by varying each parameter of this very simple reference model, it is possible to gain insight into the general problem of directly detecting giant exoplanets in the optical, both in the case of a blind search and observations of stars known to host giant planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Dependence on Scattering Properties</head><p>We start by varying the first of our fiducial model assumptions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> shows the dependence of f obs upon the geometric albedo (left panel) and the single-scattering albedo (right panel), assuming Lambert (black), isotropic (red), and Rayleigh (blue) scattering atmospheres. Each curve is composed of many distinct MC experiments, and the three sets of curves in each panel correspond to the indicated IWAs. The WFIRST/AFTA coronagraph is anticipated to have IWA ∼ 0.2 . Note this value will depend upon the angular separation and wavelength of the observation. For each scattering mechanism, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ω and A g (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Additionally, the phase curves for isotropic and Rayleigh scattering are direct functions of ω, and the Lambert phase curve is independent of ω (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. Thus, given A g or ω, it is straightforward to calculate the product A g · Φ(α), which is proportional to the planet/star flux ratio, for an assumed scattering or effective scattering mechanism.</p><p>In the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, we show the dependence of f obs upon A g . For each MC experiment, we assume A g and interpolate <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> to infer the corresponding ω, which is needed to calculate the phase curves for Rayleigh and isotropic scattering. For a given A g , the scattering phase functions are entirely responsible for the differences seen between the assumed scattering processes. Note that, since the Lambert phase function is independent of ω, the phase function is the same for each black curve. As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, Rayleigh scattering phase curves are systematically lower than isotropic and Lambert phase curves for α 120 • . It is for this reason that f obs is always the lowest for Rayleigh scattering. For most A g , Rayleigh scattering predicts observability fractions that are ∼20% below the predictions of isotropic and Lambert scatting, regardless of the IWA. At the anticipated IWA for WFIRST/AFTA, f obs decreases sublinearly with A g for each scattering process, with maximum and minimum values for Rayleigh scattering of ∼11% for A g = 0.65 and ∼1% for A g 0.1. For context, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> suggests that cool EGPs may have large geometric albedos (A g ∼ 0.6−0.8) in the optical, particularly for wavelengths 0.6 µm and near the broad water band at ∼0.94 µm. As expected, these results suggest planetary geometric albedos can have a dramatic effect on the results of an optical direct-imaging survey.</p><p>In the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, we show the dependence of f obs upon ω. In contrast to the left panel, here we assume ω for each MC experiment and use <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> to infer the corresponding A g . In this case, both A g and Φ(α) contribute to the differences between the assumed scattering processes. We see that f obs is comparable for Rayleigh and isotropic scattering for all ω. This arises from the fact that, for a given ω, A g for Rayleigh scattering is systematically higher than that for isotropic scattering, whereas Φ(α) for Rayleigh scattering is systematically lower, leading to roughly consistent observabil-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> to infer the corresponding ω for each scattering process. In contrast, in the right panel, we assume ω and infer Ag for each scattering process.

Variation of the mean observability fraction f obs with planet radius. With the exception of planet radius, all assumptions are as listed at the end of §5.1.

We note that gas giants are expected to have 0.8 R Jup Rp 1.2 R Jup , but we show a wider range of radii for illustrative purposes.</p><p>ity fractions. For conservative scattering (ω = 1.0), the geometric albedos for Lambert, isotropic, and Rayleigh scattering differ by less than ∼13%, and f obs is essentially independent of the assumed scattering mechanism. However, for non-conservative scattering (ω &lt; 1.0), the geometric albedos for isotropic and Rayleigh scattering can be less than those for Lambert scattering by as much as a factor of ∼4. As a consequence, Lambert scattering generally predicts significantly higher f obs than both isotropic and Rayleigh scattering. As a specific example, consider ω = 0.6. For this scattering albedo, the Lambert phase function corresponds to a geometric albedo that is a factor of ∼3 larger than isotropic scattering and a factor of ∼2 larger than Rayleigh scattering. At the WFIRST/AFTA IWA of 0.2 , this results in f obs ∼ 3% for Rayleigh and isotropic scattering and f obs ∼ 10% for Lambert scattering. Thus, when the geometric albedo is calculated self-consistently with the single-scattering albedo, the assumed scattering phase function can greatly influence the predicted yield from an optical direct-imaging survey. In particular, assuming the Lambert phase function generally results in an overestimate of the detectability of giant planets with respect to the more physically motivated Rayleigh phase function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Dependence on Planet Radius</head><p>The planet/star flux ratio is proportional to the square of the planet radius. Therefore, we expect f obs to be sensitive to small variations in planet size, which we have heretofore assumed to be that of Jupiter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> shows f obs as a function of planet radius, assuming observations made with a coronagraph that has IWA = 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 . All assumptions other than planet radius are as listed at the end of §5.1. We note that gas giants are expected to have 0.8 R Jup R p 1.2 R Jup , but we show a wider range of radii for illustrative purposes. Within the range of expected radii for gas giants, an increase in radius by a factor of ∼1.5 leads to an increase in f obs by a factor of ∼1.5 − 2.5, depending on the IWA. We find that smaller IWAs are less sensitive to variations in planet radius. This effect likely arises from the d −2 dependence of the planet/star flux ratio, which-because of the increasing number of planets at smaller orbital distances that are accessible to smaller IWAs-reduces the weight carried by the R 2 p dependence of the flux ratio. The fiducial model listed at the end of §5.1 assumes direct observations of planet/star systems located a distance D ⊕ = 10 pc from Earth with a minimum achievable contrast C min = 10 −9 . It is obvious that the direct detectability of EGPs will vary strongly with both of these parameters. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we investigate this variation in the context of the mean observability fraction. We show f obs for planet/star systems located 0.01 − 50 pc from Earth, assuming minimum achievable contrasts of 10 −9 (dashed lines) and 10 −10 (solid lines). The calculations assume a coronagraphic instrument with an IWA = 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 . All other parameters are as listed at the end of §5.1.</p></div>

In this case, Jupiter-like planets located 10 pc from Earth spend on average ∼10% of their time in observable configurations, whereas the same planets located 30 pc from Earth spend on average ∼0.1% of their time in observable configurations. If instead a minimum contrast of 10 −10 can be achieved, then these fractions become ∼30% and ∼16%, respectively. At small distances from Earth, we see f obs increases with distance. This trend is the result of planets at sufficiently wide orbital distances to spend some fraction of their orbit outside the OWA, which we have assumed to be 1.75 . Assuming a uniform distribution of stars and IWA = 0.2 , Jupiter-like planets orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 pc from Earth have volume-averaged observability fractions of ∼12%, 3%, and 0.5% for C min ∼ 10 −9 and ∼28%, 20%, and 13% for C min ∼ 10 −10 .</p></div>

However, the validity of this assumption is highly uncertain, and, as evidenced by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, the semi-major axis distribution has a large influence on the distribution of observability fractions. In this section, we explore the dependence of f obs upon the semi-major axis distribution by varying each of its components: the minimum semimajor axis (a min ), the maximum semi-major axis (a max ), and the power-law index of the distribution (β).</p><p>Our fiducial model assumes a min = 0.03 AU (note we set e = 0 for any planet with a &lt; 0.1 AU), which has been inferred for radial-velocity planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, we show f obs as a function of a min , assuming the indicated IWAs. At a given IWA, the mean observability increases with increasing a min until a min /D ⊕ ∼ IWA, where D ⊕ = 10 pc in our fiducial model. Since all of the MC experiments use the same number of planets (5 × 10 5 ), increasing the minimum semi-major axis forces more planets to exist at larger orbital separations, leading to larger f obs when a min /D ⊕ IWA and smaller f obs when a min /D ⊕ IWA.

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, we test the sensitivity of f obs to a somewhat larger range of a max . For a fixed number of planets, smaller a max values yield larger f obs values, which is sensible given that more planets will exist at smaller, but still detectable, orbital distances. As a max increases, f obs slowly decreases as a result of the increasing number of planets at very large orbital distances, which are too faint to be detected and, in the case of nearly face-on orbits, fall outside the OWA.

Our fiducial model assumes this index can be extrapolated to planets at much larger orbital separations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.5.">Geometric Albedo as a Function of Distance</head><p>Thus far, we have assumed the geometric albedo is constant throughout the orbit of each planet. However, the atmospheric temperature of a planet varies strongly with orbital distance, and such variations determine whether water or ammonia clouds will form. We, therefore, expect the albedo spectrum to vary significantly with orbital distance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sudarsky et al. 2005</ref>). We also expect the albedo spectrum to depend sensitively upon the planet's mass, age, and parent star. In this section, we compare our fiducial assumption of A g = 0.5 = constant with two simple models that account for the distance dependence of the albedo spectrum.</p><p>The first model is an interpolation of the models shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sudarsky et al. (2005)</ref>, which depicts the geometric albedo spectra of a Jupiter-mass, 5-Gyr planet orbiting a G2 V star at distances in the range 0.2−15 AU. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, we show the predictions of this model for the distance dependence of the geometric albedo for various wavelengths, including wavelengths associated with methane (0.74 µm and 0.89 µm), ammonia (0.65 µm), and water (0.94 µm). We see the geometric albedo, and hence the planet/star flux ratio, is a strong, nonmonotonic function of both distance and wavelength.</p><p>Using this model for A g , we carried out MC experiments for observations at the wavelengths shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 14</ref>, keeping all other parameters as listed at the end of §5.1. For orbital distances d &gt; 15 AU, we set A g equal to its value at 15 AU; this does not significantly influence our results, since planets at these separations contribute very little to f obs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 15</ref>, we show f obs as a function of IWA assuming the "Sudarsky et al." albedo model (solid lines) and our fiducial assumption of A g = 0.5 = constant (solid black line). As can be seen in the first column of Figure 7, most planets with nonzero f obs values have semimajor axes in the range 2 − 10 AU, so it is the variability of A g in this region that has the strongest effect on f obs . In the wavelength range we have considered, this model suggests the optimal observability fractions occur for λ ∼ 0.5 − 0.6 µm, which <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> indicates is the effective bandpass of our fiducial assumption A g = 0.5. At the IWA of WFIRST/AFTA, direct observations in the wavelength range λ ∼ 0.5 − 0.6 µm of a Jupiterlike planet located 10 pc from Earth will, on average, be possible for ∼10% of its orbital period. We note that the observed reflected fluxes shortward of ∼0.6 µm from Jupiter and Saturn are less than what this model would predict, which is made manifest by the reddish hues of these solar-system planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Karkoschka 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burrows 2014)</ref>.</p><p>For the second model of the distance dependence of the albedo spectrum, we calculate the equilibrium temperature for each planet as a function of orbital distance in a self-consistent fashion with the albedo spectra. This is accomplished as follows. For each planet in an MC experiment, we assume the planetary atmosphere is homogeneous and Rayleigh scattering. In addition, solar metallicity and a pressure of 0.5 bar are assumed (albedo spectra for such a planet with T = 200 K are shown as black lines in the left column of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). At a given phase of the planet's orbit, we assume an initial Bond albedo and calculate the equilibrium temperature. Assuming this to be the temperature of the atmosphere, we generate (scattering, geometric, and spherical) albedo spectra with the methods described in §2.1.2. We then integrate the spherical albedo spectrum to obtain the Bond albedo and calculate a new equilibrium temperature (T eq ). We iterate this process until we have achieved self-consistency between the equilibrium temperature and albedo spectra. This procedure is performed at every phase of the planet's orbit, resulting in a geometric albedo spectrum and phase function that varies with orbital distance. The results of MC experiments assuming this "T eq model" (solid lines) and "Teq" (dashed lines) models account for the distance dependence of the albedo spectrum, whereas the Ag = 0.5 model (solid black line), which is our fiducial model, holds it constant throughout each planet's orbit.

We see that this model is roughly consistent with the Sudarsky et al. model for λ &lt; 0.7 µm, but its predictions are very different at longer wavelengths. This model also predicts that the wavelength range λ ∼ 0.5 − 0.6 µm offers the optimal observability fractions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Detection Probabilities</head><p>Given assumptions about the orbital parameter distributions and occurrence rates (f p ) of a population of planets, the mean observability fractions presented in this work can be translated into the probability that a blind search for such planets will yield a detection. Statistical studies of planets discovered by the radial-velocity and microlensing methods suggest that the frequency of giant planets with a &lt; 20 AU falls in the range f p ∼ 10 − 20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>). If we assume f p = 15%, then calculations based on our fiducial model assumptions, which are listed at the end of §5.1, suggest that the probability of detecting a Jupiterlike planet in a blind search around a star located 10 pc from Earth is p = f p · ·f obs ∼ 1.5%, where we have assumed IWA = 0.2 . If a minimum contrast of 10 −10 is assumed, then this probability increases to p ∼ 4.2%. If the star is located 20 pc from Earth, we find p ∼ 0.4% for C min = 10 −9 and p = 3.2% for C min = 10 −10 . The scaling of p with parameters such as the IWA, planet radius, distance from Earth, and atmospheric scattering properties can be inferred from the figures presented in this paper. In all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for detection in a blind search carried out with WFIRST/AFTA's baseline coronagraphic capabilities is low (&lt; 5%).</p><p>By the time direct detection in the optical becomes feasible, long-term radial-velocity campaigns will have likely discovered many wide-separation EGPs, for which a subset of Keplerian elements will be known. Further, it has been estimated that Gaia will discover and determine robust orbits for ∼1500 planets with periods 6 yr within 50 pc from Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Perryman et al. 2014</ref>), including ∼100 giant planets around known M dwarf host stars within 30 pc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sozzetti et al. 2014</ref>). Direct-imaging surveys that leverage this information can improve their detection probabilities with respect to blind searches, and the tools we have developed for this work can be used to determine both the most promising systems to target and when to observe them. It is important to point out that, as can be inferred from Figures 4−6, the window of time that an EGP is directly detectable can be very brief and sparsely distributed throughout its orbit, suggesting that previous orbital parameter constraints must be very precise if they are to be used to optimize direct-imaging surveys. For a detailed study of the impact of uncertain radial-velocity orbital parameters on direct imaging and spectroscopy of radial-velocity exoplanets, see Brown (2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Thermal Emission from Young Planets</head><p>Throughout this work, we have focused on cool, relatively old giant planets, for which the flux from thermal emission is negligible compared to the flux from reflected starlight. The thermal emission from a giant planet is age, mass, and metallicity dependent. Furthermore, the particular formation mechanism of giant planets significantly influences the cooling of the planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012</ref>). Regardless of the assumed cooling model, it is reasonable to expect the thermal emission contribution to the optical planet/star flux ratio will increase with planet mass and decrease with planet age.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>, we show the planet/star flux ratio (top panel) and associated Rayleigh scattering geometric albedo spectrum (bottom panel) for a representative 7 Jupiter-mass planet orbiting a Sun-like star at an orbital distance of 5 AU, where we have included the effect of blackbody thermal emission from the planet.

We assume solar metallically and an atmospheric pressure of 0.5 bar. Both the planet and star are assumed to be uniformly luminous blackbodies.

Nonetheless, we see it briefly dominates the flux ratio at wavelengths 0.5 µm when the planet is a mere few tens of millions of years old, resulting in a planet that transitions from red to blue with increasing age and decreasing effective temperature. The age range over which thermal emission is important will be larger (smaller) for giant planets more (less) massive than 7 Jupiter masses. The decrease in flux at short wavelengths (∼0.4 − 0.5 µm) for ages 100 Myr is due primarily to the contraction of the planet's radius, which decreases from ∼1.4 R Jup to ∼1 R Jup throughout its evolution. In contrast, the geometric albedo spectrum is approximately constant over this same wavelength and age interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>With the planning of future exoplanet-focused missions such as WFIRST/AFTA well underway, it seems likely that the direct detection of EGPs in the optical will become feasible in the coming decade. Therefore, studies of the observational signatures and direct detectability of reflected light from EGPs are particularly timely and will aid in the design and optimization of these missions. In this work, we have presented an exploration of the direct detectability of EGPs at visible wavelengths, quantified by the fraction of a planet's orbit for which it is in an observable configuration-its observability fraction f obs . Using a suite of Monte Carlo experiments, we investigated the dependence of f obs upon various technological and astrophysical parameters such as the inner working angle and minimum achievable contrast of the direct-imaging observatory; the planet's scattering phase function, geometric albedo, single-scattering albedo, radius, and distance from Earth; and the semi-major axis distribution of EGPs. Unless stated otherwise, we now summarize our results assuming observations of Jupiterlike planets 4 , using an optical coronagraphic instrument with IWA = 0.2 and C min = 10 −9 , which are the baseline design parameters for WFIRST/AFTA.</p><p>Low-inclination orbits are highly favorable for directimaging observations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figures 4 and 7)</ref>. However, planets with i 50 • and ω p ∼ 270 • <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figures 5 and 7</ref>) are generally observable out to larger semi-major axes than planets in other configurations. At a distance of 10 pc from Earth, only (low-to modest-eccentricity) EGPs with semi-major axes in the range a ∼ 2−10 AU will have f obs &gt; 1%. If C min ∼ 10 −10 can be achieved, this range extends out to a ∼ 35 AU, with a much larger fraction of orbital parameter space yielding f obs ∼ 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 7)</ref>. Inspection of the bottom row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> suggests that the mean direct detectability of EGPs is relatively insensitive to their eccentricity distribution.</p><p>The mean observability fraction, f obs , of EGPs is a strong function of their atmospheric scattering properties. For a given geometric albedo, Rayleigh scattering atmospheres predict f obs values that are generally ∼20% below the predictions of isotropic and Lambert scattering atmospheres (left panel, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>). If instead one assumes a single-scattering albedo and selfconsistently calculates the phase function for a given scattering mechanism, the often-assumed Lambertian phase function can overestimate the detectability of EGPs by as much as a factor of ∼4 with respect to the more physically motivated Rayleigh phase function (right panel, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>Within the range of expected radii for gas giants (0.8 R Jup R p 1.2 R Jup ), an increase in radius by a factor of ∼1.5 leads to an increase in f obs by a factor of ∼1.8 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>). We find that smaller IWAs are less sensitive to variations in planet radius. This effect likely arises from the d −2 dependence of the planet/star flux ratio, which-because of the increasing number of planets at smaller separations that are accessible to smaller IWAs-reduces the weight carried by the R 2 p dependence of the flux ratio.</p><p>An EGP located 10 pc from Earth will spend on average ∼10% of its time in observable configurations, whereas the same planet located 30 pc from Earth will spend on average ∼0.1% of its time in observable configurations. If a minimum contrast of 10 −10 can be achieved, then these fractions become ∼30% and ∼16%, respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10)</ref>. Assuming a uniform distribution of stars, EGPs orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 pc from Earth have volume-averaged observability fractions of ∼12%, 3%, and 0.5% for C min ∼ 10 −9 and ∼28%, 20%, and 13% for C min ∼ 10 −10 . Thus, the scientific return from a future optical direct-imaging survey will depend critically upon its minimum achievable contrast, as well as the number of wide-separation EGPs that exist within a few tens of parsecs from Earth.</p><p>In §5.1.4 we explored the dependence of f obs upon the semi-major axis distribution of EGPs by varying each of its components: the minimum semi-major axis (a min ), the maximum semi-major axis (a max ), and the powerlaw index of the distribution (β). Given constraints from radial-velocity planets and infrared direct-imaging surveys, the uncertainty in f obs is dominated by the uncertainty in a max . For a max in the range 30 − 100 AU, which is the model-dependent limit set by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brandt et al. (2014)</ref>, f obs varies by a factor of ∼1.6 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12)</ref>.</p><p>The albedo spectrum of a giant planet is expected to be a non-monotonic function of both distance and wavelength <ref type="bibr">(Figure 15 and Sudarsky et al. 2005</ref>). Using two simple models for the distance-and wavelengthdependence of the geometric albedo, we find that bluer wavelengths result in larger f obs values, which is to be expected given that we are interested in reflectedlight observations. We caution that, as revealed by their reddish hues, the observed reflected fluxes shortward of ∼0.6 µm from Jupiter and Saturn are less than what our models would predict.</p><p>As described in §5.2, the mean observability fraction for a population of planets is proportional to the probability (p) that a blind search for such planets will yield a detection: p = f p · ·f obs , where f p is the planet occurrence rate. The scaling of p with parameters such as IWA, C min , planet radius, distance from Earth, and atmospheric scattering properties can be inferred from the figures presented in this paper. In all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for detection in a blind search carried out with WFIRST/AFTA's baseline coronagraphic capabilities is low (&lt; 5%).</p><p>Finally, we note that thermal emission from young EGPs can provide a non-negligible contribution to optical planet/star flux ratios. Assuming the evolutionary calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref>, the thermal emission from a 7 Jupiter-mass planet orbiting a Sun-like star briefly dominates the flux ratio at wavelengths 0.5 µm when the planet is a few tens of millions of years old, becoming completely negligible after ∼80 Myr. The result is a planet that transitions from red to blue with increasing age and decreasing effective temperature ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>). The age range over which the thermal emission contribution to the optical flux ratio is significant will be larger (smaller) for giant planets more (less) massive than the representative 7 Jupiter-mass planet <ref type="bibr">we</ref>  where i is the orbital inclination, ω p is the argument of periastron, and Ω is the longitude of the ascending node. The second equality in Equation (A.1) comes from the assumption that Ω = 90 • . For the orbit orientation, we use the convention α = θ = 0 • when ω p = i = 90 • . The range of observable phase angles depends only on the inclination of the orbit: 90 • − i &lt; α &lt; 90 • + i. For eccentric orbits, the light curve will vary even when i = 0 • . This is due to changes in the orbital distance (d) along the orbit, which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d = a(1 − e 2 ) 1 + e cos θ . (A.2)</formula><p>The Keplerian elements are connected to time (t) through the mean anomaly (M = 2π(t − t p )/P , where t p is the time of periastron passage), which is related to the eccentric anomaly (E) by Kepler's equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">M = E − e sin E. (A.3)</formula><p>E can be expressed in terms of the true anomaly as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">sin E = sin θ √ 1 − e 2 1 + e cos θ .

Results from directimaging surveys have been used to set model-dependent limits on the maximum semi-major axis (a max ) to which the radial-velocity distribution can be extrapolated.

Brandt et al. (2014) performed a statistical analysis of direct-imaging data from a sample of nearly 250 stars, finding a max ∼ 30 − 100 AU, which again depends on the adopted cooling model. With these studies as our motivation, our fiducial calculations assume the semi-major axis distribution is given by a power-law with a minimum a min = 0.03 AU and a maximum a max = 65 AU.
