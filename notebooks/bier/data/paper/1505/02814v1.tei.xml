			<abstract>
				<p>Solar system planets move on almost circular orbits. In strong contrast, many massive gas giant exoplanets travel on highly elliptical orbits, whereas the shape of the orbits of smaller, more terrestrial, exoplanets remained largely elusive. Knowing the eccentricity distribution in systems of small planets would be important as it holds information about the planet&apos;s formation and evolution, and influences its habitability. We make these measurements using photometry from the Kepler satellite and utilizing a method relying on Kepler&apos;s second law, which relates the duration of a planetary transit to its orbital eccentricity, if the stellar density is known. Our sample consists of 28 bright stars with precise asteroseismic density measurements. These stars host 74 planets with an average radius of 2.6 R ⊕. We find that the eccentricity of planets in Kepler multi-planet systems is low and can be described by a Rayleigh distribution with σ = 0.049 ± 0.013. This is in full agreement with solar system eccentricities, but in contrast to the eccentricity distributions previously derived for exoplanets from radial velocity studies. Our findings are helpful in identifying which planets are habitable because the location of the habitable zone depends on eccentricity, and to determine occurrence rates inferred for these planets because planets on circular orbits are less likely to transit. For measuring eccentricity it is crucial to detect and remove Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), and we present some previously unreported TTVs. Finally transit durations help distinguish between false positives and true planets and we use our measurements to confirm six new exoplanets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the solar system, the orbit of Mercury has the highest ellipticity with an eccentricity (e) of 0.21, where an eccentricity of 0 indicates a circular orbit, whereas the mean orbital eccentricity of the other seven planets is 0.04. In contrast, Radial Velocity (RV) measurements revealed a wide range of eccentricities for gas giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Butler et al. 2006</ref>), where HD 80606b is the current record holder with an eccentricity of 0.927 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naef et al. 2001)</ref>. RV surveys also found evidence that orbital eccentricities for sub-Jovian planets reach up to 0.45 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wright et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). For Earth-sized planets and Super-Earths, RV detections of eccentricities are typically not feasible, even with modern instruments, because of the small orbital RV signal amplitude K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marcy et al. 2014</ref>), and the fact that the amplitude of the eccentricity scales with e × K (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lucy 2005</ref>). One alternative way to measure orbital eccentricities relies on the timing of secondary transits (eclipses), but this method is limited to the hottest and closestin exoplanets. In some systems with multiple transiting planets Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) can be used to infer planetary mass ratios and orbital eccentricities. While these two parameters are often correlated, sometimes eccentricity information can nevertheless be inferred using statistical arguments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lithwick et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref>, or from the "chopping" effect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deck &amp; Agol 2015)</ref>. Loweccentricity as well as some higher eccentricity systems have been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2014</ref>). Unfortunately, TTVs</p><p>Electronic address: vincent@phys.au.dk are only detected in a subset of all transiting multiple systems, and the interpretations of the results is complex as systems with TTVs are typically found near resonances, and it's unclear if such systems have undergone the same evolution as systems without such resonances.</p><p>Here we determine orbital eccentricities of planets making use of Kepler's second law, which states that eccentric planets vary their velocity throughout their orbit. This results in a different duration for their transits relative to the circular case: transits can last longer or shorter depending on the orientation of the orbit in its own plane, the argument of periastron (ω). This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Transit durations for circular orbits are governed by the mean stellar density <ref type="bibr">(Sea- ger &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003)</ref>. Therefore if the stellar density is known from an independent source then a comparison between these two values constrains the orbital eccentricity of a transiting planet independently of its mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tingley et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Using this technique, individual measurements of eccentric orbits were made successfully, making use of high-quality Kepler transit observations. For highly eccentric Jupiters, the technique is powerful even when only loose constraints on the 'true' stellar density are available, as shown for <ref type="bibr">Kepler- 419 (Dawson &amp; Johnson 2012)</ref> and later confirmed by radial velocity observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dawson et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kipping et al. (2012)</ref> suggested that multiple planets in the same system can be compared to constrain the sum of eccentricities in cases where the stellar density is not known. For close-in hot Jupiters where the orbits are assumed to be circular due  <ref type="bibr">Panel (b)</ref> shows the same orbit, now with ω = 300 • . The pies outlined with blue and red lines in the two panels encompass the same surface areas and the corresponding arcs are traveled by the planet during 1/36 of their orbital period. These times are centered around the time of planetary transit. The gray filled pies correspond to the surface areas covered by a planet traveling on a circular orbit with the same apparent a/R ratio. According to Kepler's second law the transit in the eccentric system in panel (a) lasts longer than in the system with the circular orbit. The reverse is true for panel (b). Corresponding schematic light curves are shown in panels (c) and <ref type="bibr">(d).</ref> to tidal forces, the technique provides stellar densities which rival the accuracy provided by other methods such as asteroseismology, and good agreement is typically found (e.g. HAT-P-7b, Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Eylen et al. 2013</ref>). For Kepler-410b, a Super-Earth, a small but significantly non-zero eccentricity (0.17 +0.07 −0.06 ) was measured, thanks to an accurately determined stellar density from asteroseismology and the brightness of the star (Kepler magnitude 9.4, Van ). The orbits of both Kepler-10b (1.4 R ⊕ ) and Kepler-10c (2.4 R ⊕ ) were found to be consistent with circularity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fogtmann-Schulz et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>An ensemble study, based on early Kepler catalog data and averaging over impact parameters, found the eccentricity distribution of large planet candidates (≥ 8 R ⊕ ) to be consistent with the RV eccentricity distribution, with some evidence that sub-Neptune planets had lower average eccentricities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kane et al. 2012</ref>). However, subsequent ensemble studies have revealed a range of complications, such as a correlation with the transit impact parameter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013</ref>), the influence of planetary false positives <ref type="bibr">(Sliski &amp; Kipping 2014</ref>) and uncertainties or biases in stellar parameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Plavchan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Price et al. (2015)</ref> recently investigated the feasibility of such studies for the smallest planets. 1 Kipping (2014b) identified a number of other mechanisms that influence transit durations, e.g. TTVs. We approach these complications in two ways.</p><p>Firstly, we design a data analysis pipeline that allows us to identify and remove TTVs, measure transit parameters and their correlations, and insert and recover artificial transits to test our methods. Secondly, we focus on a sample of 28 bright stars observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010</ref>): the brightest host star has a Kepler magnitude 8.7 and all but one are brighter than magnitude 13. They have all been observed in short-cadence mode with a one-minute integration time. Their mean stellar density is constrained through asteroseismology. The 17 brightest of these stars were analyzed in Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Aguirre et al. (2015)</ref> and the average accuracy of their mean density measurements is 1.7%. The other 11 stars were previously modeled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. (2013)</ref> and the average uncertainty on the mean stellar density of these objects is 6.7%. All 28 stars also have separate mass and radius measurements, while the detailed modeling of individual frequencies by Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Aguirre et al. (2015)</ref> also provides stellar ages with a median uncertainty of 14%. They all contain multiple planets (74 in total) and all but three contain confirmed planets. The planets are small with an average radius of 2.8 R ⊕ and have orbital periods ranging from 0.8 to 180 days.</p><p>In Section 2 we describe our analysis methods. We present the pipeline developed to model the planetary transits and discuss several important parameter correlations. Our main results are presented in Section 3. We present the eccentricity distribution of our sample of planets, as well as homogeneous planetary parameters and several previously unreported transit timing variations. We also validate several previously unconfirmed exoplanets. In Section 4 we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of planetary habitability and planetary occurrence rates. Our conclusions are presented in Section 5 In Appendix A we present the eccentricities of individual exoplanet systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>We built a customary data reduction and analysis pipeline to measure all transit parameters and their correlations. This also allows us to do transit insertion and recovery tests. In Section 2.1 we describe the pipeline and how we extract the relevant parameters. In Section 2.2 we discuss parameter correlations. In Section 2.3, we present the results of modeling artificial transits that we inserted in the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Pipeline</head><p>The pipeline performed the following main steps:</p><p>1. Kepler data reduction and normalisation 2. Period determination and Transit Timing Variation (TTV) assessment; data folding 3. MCMC transit fit module</p><p>We now describe each step in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Data reduction</head><p>The first part of our pipeline is responsible for reducing and normalising Kepler light curves. For a given Kepler object of interest (KOI), the pipeline searches for observations in any quarter (Q), between Q0-Q17. Only the quarters which contain short cadence observations are downloaded (in fits-file format), because the one minute sampling is required to resolve the planetary ingress and egress (see Section 2.2.2). Our analysis starts with the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) version of the data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Smith et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In the following, we only focus on data directly before, during or after the transits (typically encompassing about 5-10 hours before and 5-10 hours after a given transit). An initial estimate of the transit times is calculated with the ephemeris available at the Kepler database 2 . From the same source a value for the transit duration is obtained and used to determine the in-transit data points. By default the transit duration is increased by three hours to make sure no in-transit data points are erroneously used for the data normalisation. In case of (previously known or subsequently detected) TTVs, the transit duration is further increased to catch all in-transit data points. The data before and after the transits are then fitted by a second order polynomial which is used to normalise the data.</p><p>In a final step, all transits are visually inspected. In some cases, (instrumental or astrophysical) data jumps or gaps can cause the transit fits to fail or the true transit to be poorly determined. These transits are manually removed. Similarly, when multiple transits happen simultaneously, these data points are removed to avoid biasing the transit measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Period and TTV determination</head><p>This part of the pipeline measures times of individual transits and uses them to find the orbital period, as well as detect any TTVs. The measurement of an individual transit time is done by fitting the best transit model to the individual transits, keeping all transit parameters fixed except for the transit mid-time. During the first iteration, the model is based on the parameters extracted from the Kepler database, afterwards the best model from the MCMC analysis in Step 3 (transit fit module) is used, a procedure which is repeated until convergence is reached. The uncertainty of each transit-mid time is calculated by first subtracting the best fitting transit model from the original light curve, bootstrapping the residuals with replacement, injecting the best fitting transit model and fitting this new light curve. The steps after and including the permutation of the residuals are repeated 200 times for each transit, to calculate the mid-time uncertainty from the spread in these fits.</p><p>Now the planetary period is obtained by (weighted) fitting for a linear ephemeris to the individual transit times. From this we calculate the observed minus calculated (O-C) transit times. Next we refit, this time ignoring 3−σ outliers (as determined by the standard deviation around the linear ephemeris), and repeat until convergence is reached (no more outliers are removed).</p><p>Once the linear ephemeris has been determined we perform a search for TTVs as these might cause biases in the eccentricity calculations, as explained below. For this a sinusoidal model is fitted to the O-C diagram. A list of the systems where TTVs were included is given in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The transits are subsequently folded based on their period and TTVs if present. The folded transit curve is binned to contain a maximum of 6000 data points, which even for the longest transits implies more than 10 data points per minute, which is an oversampling compared to the original one minute Kepler sampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Transit fit module</head><p>This part of the pipeline consists of a transit fitting module, which makes use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We choose to employ an Affine-Invariant Ensemble Sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Goodman &amp; Weare 2010)</ref> as implemented in the Python module emcee (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). Planetary transits are modeled analytically <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> .</p><p>For each planet in the system, we sample five parameters: the impact parameter b, relative planetary radius R p /R , √ e cos ω, √ e sin ω, mid-transit time T 0 and flux offset F. In addition, two stellar limb darkening parameters are adjusted. These are common for all planets in one system, leading to 6n+2 parameters per planetary system, where n is the amount of planets in the system. The MCMC chains were run using 200 walkers, each producing a chain of 500 000 steps, after a burn-in phase of 150 000 steps was completed.</p><p>We sample uniformly in R p /R and place a uniform prior on T 0 and b, where the latter is sampled between −2 and 2 to allow grazing orbits and avoid border effects around 0. We do not sample directly in e and ω, as this biases the eccentricity results for nearly circular orbits due to the boundary at zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lucy &amp; Sweeney 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eastman et al. 2013</ref>). Instead we sample uniformly in √ e cos ω and √ e sin ω (both between −1 and 1), which corresponds to a uniform sampling in e ∈ [0, 1] and ω ∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">360]</ref> • after conversion and rejection of values corresponding to e &gt; 1.

In general, when ρ is known (e.g. from asteroseismology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silva Aguirre et al. 2015)</ref>), R /a constrains the combination of e and ω given by the right-hand side of Equation 1.

A range of statistics, such as the mean, median, mode and confidence intervals are calculated for each parameter.</p><p>The results for our combined sample are presented in terms of the stellar density ratio in Section 3.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Parameter correlations</head><p>There are several correlations between eccentricity and other parameters which are addressed here. The most important correlation occurs between eccentricity and angle of periastron ω and was already reported above (Equation 1). We explain how this complication can be overcome for a sample of systems, by directly using the relative density instead, as well as its influence on eccentricity estimates for individual systems. Another important correlation occurs with impact parameter b. The influence of TTVs is also discussed. The effect of ω, b and TTVs on the eccentricity is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. We briefly discuss other commonly anticipated complications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Correlation with angle of periastron</head><p>When measuring transits, a combination of eccentricity and angle of periastron is constrained, as given by Equation 1. The combined influence of e and ω is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. For ω ∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">180]</ref> • , eccentric orbits lead to shorter transits, while for ω ∈ <ref type="bibr">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr">360]</ref> • , eccentricity increases the transit duration (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The left-hand side of the equation (the relative density ρ circ. /ρ transit ) is the observable property, i.e. it is used to fit transits. Each relative density corresponds to a given eccentricity but also depends on the angle ω, which is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. When looking at an ensemble of systems, this complication can be avoided by reporting the measured relative densities, which is what we do in Section 3.1. This is the true observable (i.e. it influences the transit model), and it holds information on both e and ω in a way that is defined by Equation 1. For an ensemble of systems, ω is expected to be randomly distributed 4 so that the distribution of relative densities can be directly compared to any anticipated eccentricity distributions.</p><p>Note that for individual systems information on e and ω can still be separately extracted, although the incomplete knowledge of ω increases the uncertainty of e. We discuss individual systems in Appendix A and report eccentricity modal values and highest probability density intervals which represent 68% confidence in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We also show full posterior distributions of eccentricity (see Appendix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Correlation with impact parameter</head><p>Eccentricity can be correlated with the transit impact parameter b. This can be understood by looking at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, in which the effect of changing impact parameters and eccentricities is plotted for two analytically generated transit curves. While eccentric orbits change transit durations (increasing or decreasing it depending on the angle of periastron), increasing the impact parameters also shortens transits since a smaller part of the stellar disk is being crossed. Fortunately, changing the impact parameter also has the effect of deforming the planetary transit. This is caused by the ingress and egress taking up more of the total transit time and leads to the typical V-shaped transits for high impact parameters. However, for smaller planets, ingress/egress times are intrinsically very short and the deformation of the transit shape is therefore far more limited, causing b and e to be more degenerate for smaller planets than for larger planets (see also <ref type="bibr">Ford et al. 2008, and Figure 5 therein)</ref>. This is why the availability of short cadence observations with a one minute sampling is crucial. Long cadence data, with an integration time of 30 minutes, smears out the ingress and egress of the planet. Therefore measuring eccentricities for small planets is more complicated for two reasons: transits of smaller planets require higher accuracy light curves to obtain the same signalto-noise ratio in the light curve than needed for larger planets, and for small planets eccentricity and impact parameter are more degenerate. The effect of b and e on the transit duration is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Therefore apart from reporting eccentricity confidence intervals we also present twodimensional histograms which show the posterior distribution in the e − b plane (see Appendix A). In a few cases (see Table 1) the correlation between b and e caused the eccentricity range to be uninformative (here defined as an 1 − σ interval larger than 0.4).

Contrary to what one might expect, the major issue with TTVs is not that they cause the total transit duration to be mismeasured, but rather that TTVs can cause the impact parameter to be measured wrongly <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kipping 2014b</ref>). When combining multiple transits which are not correctly aligned, the best-fit model transit will be more V-shaped (higher impact parameter) than the original transit. As high impact parameters typically have shorter transit durations, this bias in b can then be 'compensated' by a higher eccentricity (and an angle of periastron within <ref type="bibr">[180,</ref><ref type="bibr">360]</ref> • ). Consequently, when TTVs are not properly taken into account, a bias occurs towards the top right on the illustration in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. This bias due to TTVs can be quite large. For example, we inserted an artificial planet on a circular orbit into the Kepler observations and added a sinusoidal TTV signal with an amplitude of 20 minutes and a period of 250 days. An eccentricity of 0.7 was recovered (with small formal uncertainty), while for the same case without TTVs the correct circular orbit was recovered. However, these clear cases of TTVs can easily be measured and removed, which we do in our pipeline. Smaller TTV signals can be more difficult to detect and adequately remove. With smaller planetary radii (smaller transit depths), the ability to measure individual transit times decreases and therefore also our ability to detect a TTV signal. On the other hand, for the smallest planets, the impact parameter is typically poorly constrained, making (small) TTVs less important relative to other sources of uncertainties (see Section 2.3). It is not always straightforward to determine whether TTVs should be included in the modeling. We found that classic tests such as the likelihood ratio tests or the Bayesian Information Criterium sometimes favor the inclusion of a TTV signal for the smallest planets, on artificial transits inserted without TTVs into real Kepler observations. This could be caused by an underestimate of the errors on the transit times for very small planets, or the influence of light curve inperfections (instrumental or astrophysical, e.g. star spots).</p><p>In our final analysis we include only clearly detectable sinusoidal TTV signals, after confirming that in cases where there was doubt, the decision to include TTVs or not did not influence the eccentricity measurement (see also Section 2.3). A list of systems with included TTVs is given in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-103, Kepler-126, Kepler-130 and Kepler-278</ref>, these TTVs have not been previously reported. Four systems were excluded from our initial sample because their TTVs could not be adequately removed using a sinusoidal model; they are discussed in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Other potential complications</head><p>We briefly discuss several other issues that have been previously identified as potential sources of error for measurements of eccentricities from transit photometry.</p><p>False positives can complicate eccentricity measurements. When a planetary transit's host star is misidentified, the true stellar density can differ significantly from the one used to calculate the eccentricity <ref type="bibr">(Sliski &amp; Kipping 2014</ref>). In our sample, all but three systems <ref type="bibr">(KOI-5, KOI-270 and KOI-279)</ref> contain planets which were previously confirmed or validated as true exoplanets. Kepler-92 contains two confirmed planets and one additional candidate. We discuss the planetary nature of these planet candidates in Section 3.3. Therefore our sample is not biased due to false positives.</p><p>Similar to planetary false positives is the issue of light curve dilution. Here, the planet orbits around its host star, but third light dilutes the light curve, causing the transit depth to be reduced. This results not only in a biased planet radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ciardi et al. 2015</ref>), but also in a biased impact parameter, which in turn can cause the eccentricity to be wrongly measured. However, most of the targets from our selected sample of bright stars have been followed up with adaptive optics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2012</ref>) and Speckle images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Howell et al. 2011)</ref>. No significant sources of dilution have been found for any of our confirmed planets. The reported light curve contamination for KOI-5, KOI-270 and KOI-279 is taken into account prior to the modeling. Quarter to quarter variations in the light curve owing to pixel sensitivity are of the percentage order (Van Eylen et al. 2013) and do not affect our eccentricity measurement.</p><p>Stellar limb darkening is another potential source of complication. Visual inspection yields no evidence of a correlation with eccentricity (see also ). We use a prior on the limb darkening based on stellar atmosphere models <ref type="bibr">(Claret &amp; Bloemen 2011</ref>) to speed up MCMC convergeance, but nevertheless allow the limb darkening parameters to vary to avoid this source of complications.</p><p>Another potential influence on eccentricity measurements would be a bias in the stellar densities determined from asteroseismology. Part of the values from our sample are taken from Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Aguirre et al. (2015)</ref>, and are based on individual frequency modeling using several different stellar evolution codes. The remaining densities are taken from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013</ref>) and are based on scaling relations. Such relations have been proven accurate and unbiased for dwarfs and subdwarfs, such as the stars considered in this study ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Huber et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Silva Aguirre et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, 2015</ref>.</p><p>Finally we note that the uncertainty in the folded light curve could be of potential concern. Ideally, all individual transits would be normalised and modeled simultaneously, while also fitting for the period and any potential TTVs and modeling the correlated noise. However, such an approach is computationally unfeasible. Consequentially, these errors are not fully propogated and the resulting uncertainties could be underestimated. In most cases many transits are available, causing the period to be very well determined. Of bigger concern are TTVs, but tests with artificial planetary transits (see Section 2.3) show no evidence of any bias or underestimated error bars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Transit insertion tests</head><p>We have inserted artificial transits into the data to test the performance of our pipeline. The procedure we used is as follows. First, an artificial planetary transit was generated, and inserted into the light curve that has been observed for one of the stars analyzed in our sample. The lightcurves in which we inserted artificial transits were chosen randomly from our sample of stars with two or three transiting planets (stars with more planets were not chosen to avoid 'crowding' due to the pre-existing planets). Subsequently the procedure described in Section 2.1.2 was followed to find the orbital period and potential TTVs and fold the data. The period and ephemeris information of the (genuine) planets already present in the light curve was used to remove overlapping transits, as is done for genuine planets. Finally the folded light curve is modeled as described in Section 2.1.3.</p><p>The aim of these tests is not to be complete in covering the full parameter space, which is indeed challenging as it spans different stellar and planetary parameters, periods and eccentricities, as well as amplitudes and periods of TTVs, while transit insertion tests are computationally expensive. Rather, the purpose is to evaluate representative cases to understand the performance of our pipeline and judge any potential limitations. A total of 141 artificial transits have been generated, inserted in real Kepler data, and modeled. We now describe a few cases in more detail.</p><p>In a first number of tests, we generated planets with radii and periods representative for our sample, and assigned a random eccentricity, uniform between 0 and 1, and a random angle of periastron ω. We were able to recover the correct eccentricities within the uncertainties. In another set of tests, we attempted to reproduce our sample of planets more closely. The light curves in which the transits were inserted were drawn randomly from the light curves in our sample. The periods and planetary radii were drawn randomly from our sample of planets <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). The impact parameters were chosen uniformly between 0 and 1 for outer planets, and uniformly within a 1.6 • spread for inner planets ). The eccentricities were typically recovered within the uncertainties.</p><p>We have also tested the influence of TTVs by adding sinusoidal TTV signals to the inserted transits. The influence of TTVs depends not only on the TTV amplitude, but also on the size of the planet. For example, for a 3.5 R ⊕ planet on a 15 day orbit, a 20 minute TTV signal can have a large influence on the derived eccentricity (see Section 2.2.3), but the TTV signal is easily recovered and after removal, the correct eccentricity is determined within the uncertainty (and without bias). For smaller planets, it can be difficult to adequately remove the TTV signal, and it can escape detection entirely. However, we find that in these cases, the influence of TTVs on the eccentricity determination is small because other uncertainties dominate. For example, when inserting a TTV signal with an amplitude of 15 minutes, for a planet of 1.5 R ⊕ with an orbital period of 8 days, we did not recover the TTV signal but were nevertheless able to retrieve the correct eccentricities. Other, similar TTV tests revealed similar results, and we also obtained a similar result when modeling genuine planets: when there was significant doubt about the TTV signal, the decision to include it or not did not influence the outcome of our eccentricity measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>Here we present the results of our analysis. In Section 3.1 we report the distribution of eccentricities for the planets in our sample (eccentricities for individual planets are discussed in Appendix A). In Section 3.2 we present the other parameters that result from our analysis, such as homegeneous planetary parameters, a distribution in impact parameters and new and updated TTVs. The stellar density encompasses the combined influence of the orbital eccentricity and angle of periastron on the transit duration as described in Section 2.2. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> we show a histogram of the ratio of the densities derived from asteroseismology to the densities derived from the transit fits. In this figure large eccentricities would be revealed as very large or small density ratios, depending on the argument of periastron. The absence of such ratios already indicates that low eccentricities are common.</p><p>To quantitatively constrain the eccentricity distribution we now assume a Rayleigh distribution for the eccentricities, which provides a best fit to the data for σ = 0.049 ± 0.013. The resulting distribution of density ratios is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 5</ref>. The Rayleigh distribution has the additional advantage that it can be directly compared to some other eccentricity determinations, such as σ = 0.018 found for some TTV systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kipping (2013)</ref> suggests the use of a Beta distribution, which has the advantage of being convenient to use as a prior for transit fits. Using this distribution to model our results we find a good fit to our data with Beta parameters α = 1.03 ± 0.15 and β = 13.6 ± 2.1. The best-fit values are calculated by drawing random eccentricity values from the chosen distribution (Rayleigh distribution or Beta distribution) and assigning a random angle of periastron to calculate the corresponding density ratio. The distribution of density ratios is then compared to the observed density ratio distribution, by minimizing the χ 2 when comparing the cumulative density functions, to avoid a dependency of the fit on binning of the data (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kipping 2013</ref>). The uncertainty on the parameters is calculating by bootstrapping the observed density ratios (with replacement) and repeating the procedure, and calculating the scatter in the best-fit parameters. Individual systems are discussed in Appendix A.</p><p>The distribution is similar to that of the Solar System which is plotted in the same figure for comparison (integrated over different angles). In contrast we also plot the relative densities that would have been observed if our sample had the same eccentricity distribution as measured for RV planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Shen &amp; Turner 2008</ref>) in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> compares the eccentricities in our sample with the solar system planets and the exoplanets with RV observations. The RV observations were taken from exoplanets.org <ref type="bibr">(27 April 2015)</ref> and include all data points where the eccentricity was measured (not fixed to zero), and the RV amplitude ('K') divided by its uncertainty ('UK') is greater than ten. The masses for the planets in our sample were estimated based on the radius, using <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Weiss et al. (2013)</ref> for planets with R ≥ 4 R ⊕ and following <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref> for planets where R ≤ 4 R ⊕ .</p><p>Our sample differs in two important ways from the RV sample: planetary size and planetary multiplicity. These properties are not independent since smaller planets are frequently found in multiple planet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Latham et al. 2011</ref>). A hint towards smaller eccentricities for smaller/less massive planets and higher multiplicity has already been observed in RV systems. In systems with sub-Jovian mass planets and systems with multiple planets, eccentricities are limited to 0-0.45 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wright et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). Even so the eccentricities observed in our sample have a much narrower range, possibly because the average size of the planets is much smaller even when compared to the sub-Jovian RV sample (most planets in our sample cannot be detected with RV measurements, and even when RV mass measurements are possible eccentricity determinations are not feasible, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marcy et al. 2014</ref>  about twice as large as those larger than this limit, although they caution a TTV detection bias may influence this result. We have compared our eccentricity measurements with the planetary radii in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> (see also Section 3.2) and found no evidence for a correlation. However, the difference between the rms eccentricity for planets smaller and larger than 2.5 R ⊕ is only 0.009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2014)</ref>, which would likely not be detectable in our sample.</p><p>Planet-planet interactions have been brought forward as a mechanism to explain the observed eccentricities in massive planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chatterjee et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Nagasawa et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>. In this picture gravitational interactions lead to high eccentricities and planetary migration. However, despite finding a small anti-correlation between mass and eccentricity for massive planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chatterjee et al. (2008)</ref> suggested that damping from residual gas or planetesimals could more effectively reduce the eccentricities of low-mass planets after scattering. Furthermore, it has been suggested that there may exist a dependence of eccentricity on the orbital semi-major axis, because the mean eccentricity depends on the velocity dispersion scaled by the Keplerian velocity (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ida et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Petrovich et al. 2014</ref>). Consequentially the eccentricity may be proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ida et al. 2013</ref>). The majority of the planets in our sample have orbital distances that are unlikely to be affected by tidal circularisation, but it was suggested very recently that tidal effects in compact multi-planet systems may propagate further than for single planet systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hansen &amp; Murray 2015)</ref> The observed low eccentricities could be related to the planet multiplicity, which was also observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Limbach &amp; Turner (2014)</ref>. Highly eccentric planets in multi-planet systems are also less likely to be stable over longer timescales, which could lead to lower observed eccentricities in compact systems because systems with more eccentric systems would not survive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pu &amp; Wu (2015)</ref> found that planets with circular orbits can be more tightly packed than systems with eccentric planets. The systems in our sample have between 2 and 5 transiting planets but the true multiplicity could be underestimated if additional non-transiting planet are present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Homogeneous stellar and planetary parameters and new</head><p>TTVs Next to orbital eccentricities our analysis also yields a homegeneous set of planetary parameters. They are not only derived from homegeneous transit modeling but also from a homegemeous set of stellar parameters, which were all derived from asteroseismology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silva Aguirre et al. 2015</ref>). We report the eccentricities and the planetary radii, as well as the stellar masses and radii upon which they were based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silva Aguirre et al. 2015</ref>) in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

The full posterior distributions, including the correlations between parameters, are available upon request.</p><p>We checked the distribution of transit impact parameters and show a histogram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>. Because we are dealing with multi-transiting systems a bias towards lower impact parameters is expected since such systems are more likely to have multiple planets transiting. When we plot the impact parameter of all planets, low impact parameter values indeed appear favored and the distribution is inconsistent with a homegeneous one between 0 and 1 (KS-test with p-value of 0.003). If we only plot the impact parameters of the outer planet (the longest period) in each system, a distribution which appears uniform in impact parameter is observed (KS-test with p-value of 0.86, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>). That planets on shorter orbital periods have lower impact parameter than the outer planets in the same system shows that most systems in our sample have very low mutual inclinations, consistent with earlier work ).</p><p>We furthermore compared the eccentricity to other parameters and found no correlation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8)</ref>. We plot the eccentricity versus the orbital period and planetary radius. We also compare the eccentricity to stellar temperature and stellar age, two parameters which might influence tidal circularisation. We note that ages are only available for part of our  sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Silva Aguirre et al. 2015</ref>). We see no correlations. We have determined transit times and (re)derived orbital periods in a way that is robust to outliers (see Section 2). In several cases, we found clear evidence of TTVs. The TTV periods and amplitudes that were included in our analysis are listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="bibr">For Kepler-103, Kepler-126, Kepler-130 and Kepler-278</ref>, these TTVs have not been previously reported.

However, this is no longer generally true if the light curve consists of two or more blended stars of different magnitudes, because it can be difficult to tell at which object the transits occur (e.g. Van ).</p><p>Transit durations can be used to confirm the planetary nature of transiting candidates when the stellar density of the suspected host star is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tingley &amp; Sackett 2005)</ref>. However, because eccentricity also influences the transit duration, in general it is difficult to distinguish between eccentric planets and false positives <ref type="bibr">(Sliski &amp; Kipping 2014</ref>). Because we find that eccentricities are very small for multi-planet systems, this complication does not arise for these systems and transit durations can be readily used to assess the validity of transit signals in these systems. The transit duration provides a direct estimate of the stellar density, which can be compared to an independent measurement of the stellar density of the  stars to determine which of the stars in the aperture hosts the transiting planet(s).</p><p>Here we compare the stellar density estimates from the planetary candidates with the asteroseismic density of the brightest star in the system. Any mismatch would be a strong indication that the star is not the true host. A clear agreement is strong evidence the star is the true host, especially if the other star in the system has a very different density. In KOI-5, we cannot draw a clear conclusion because only one of the planets provides meaningful constraints. For KOI-270, we confirm that the transits are caused by true planets which could orbit either KOI-270A or KOI-270B, two stars which are very similar. We confirm that the three planet candidates for KOI-279 are genuine planets orbiting KOI-279A, and finally we also confirm a third planet orbiting Kepler-92 (two other planets were previously confirmed). We discuss these systems in more detail below.</p><p>3.3.1. KOI-5 KOI-5 contains two transiting planet candidates which have not been validated or confirmed as true planets. The inner planet candidate has an orbital period of 4.8 days and a 7.9 R ⊕ radius, while the second planet candidate orbits in 7 days and is much smaller (0.6 R ⊕ ). The reason the candidates have not been validated is the presence of a second, fainter companion star which is physically associated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kolbl et al. 2015</ref>). We refer to it here as KOI-5B.</p><p>We take a 6% flux dilution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kolbl et al. 2015</ref>) caused by KOI-5B into account before modeling the planet candidates assuming they orbit the bright star (KOI-5A). The posterior distribution for the inner planet is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>.1 and its eccentricity is tightly constrained ([0.05, 0.27] within 1 − σ). Even within 2 − σ, the lower eccentricity bound is 0.04. An alternative way to present this is the relative density, for which a 95% confidence interval is <ref type="bibr">[0.72, 0.88]</ref>. This implies that if this candidate was a true planet orbiting KOI-5A, it would have a non-zero eccentricity. This is suspicious, in particular given the short orbital period of the candidate, and a possible explanation is that the candidate does not transit KOI-5A but rather KOI-5B instead. Because KOI-5B is much fainter, the candidate would consequentially be larger and might not be planetary in nature.</p><p>The second candidate's posterior distribution is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>.2 and is consistent with a circular orbit around KOI-5A (e ∈ [0, 0.4], relative density ∈ [0.45, <ref type="bibr">1.11]</ref>). This could imply that this is a genuine planet orbiting KOI-5A. However, due to the large error bar caused by the small size of the planet, it is difficult to exclude KOI-5B as a host for this candidate without knowing more about this companion star.</p></div>

Therefore KOI-270 appears to consist of two very similar stars and we dilute the light curve by a factor two to account for this. We find no evidence for TTVs but note that only limited short-cadence data is available. For the outer planet, a long period TTV signal was clearly measured (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref>) and included, while for the inner two planets no sinusoidal TTVs were included although an increased scatter in the transit times of the middle planet was seen.</p><p>The reason for the lack of confirmation for this system is the presence of a second star (at 0.9 arcsec) to which we refer as KOI-279B which is significantly fainter and contributes 6% flux <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .

Our results allow one of the first looks at the orbital eccentricities of small and potentially rocky planets and indicate that low eccentricities are the rule. In fact we can not find a clear candidate for a planet on an elliptic orbit among the 74 planets in our sample. The few planets with densities away from unity <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> also have the largest uncertainties (See Appendix A for a discussion of individual systems and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for an overview).</p><p>If this extends to planets on longer orbital periods or to planets orbiting lower mass stars (the planets in our sample are all outside the habitable zone) then this influences habitability in two ways. Planets on circular orbits have more stable climates than planets on eccentric orbits which can have large seasonal variations, even though large oceans might temper the climate impact of moderate eccentricities <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Williams &amp; Pollard 2002)</ref>. Secondly the location of the habitable zone itself depends on the orbital eccentricity. For moderately eccentric orbits the outer edge of the habitable zone is increased ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Spiegel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dressing et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koppa- rapu et al. 2013</ref>), i.e. moderately eccentric planets could be habitable further away from the host star than planets on circular planets.

Planets on orbits with e = 0.5 are 33% more likely to transit, and in the extreme case of HD 80606b (e = 0.92) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naef et al. 2001</ref>) the transit probability increased by 640%. A recent estimate based on the eccentricity distribution derived from RV observations shows that the overall transit probability changes by 10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kipping 2014a</ref>). This can significantly change the planet occurrence estimate, e.g. the number of planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ around cool stars is estimated to 3% precision before the effect of eccentricity is taken into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013)</ref>. Our analysis shows that neglecting eccentricity is a valid assumption when considering transiting multiple planet systems.</p><p>Beyond the influence on the global occurrence rate the eccentricity distribution also influences the relative occurrence between different types of planets. Because single more massive planets show a wider range of eccentricities than multiplanet systems with smaller planets, the occurrence of larger planets is overestimated compared to smaller planets. These effects are important when comparing occurrence rates of different types of planets but have so far not been taken into account ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have measured the eccentricity distribution of 74 planets orbiting 28 stars, making use of photometry alone. For this we made use of the influence of eccentricity on the duration of planetary transits. Several complications are avoided by carefully selecting this sample. Planetary false positives and third light blending are sidestepped in our selection of (primarily) confirmed multi-transiting planet systems around bright host stars. Issues due to inaccurate stellar parameters are overcome owing to the power of asteroseismology to determine stellar densities and other stellar parameters. The use of short cadence data, newly derived orbital periods and a careful analysis of possible TTVs prevent a bias towards high impact parameters.</p><p>We find that most of the systems we considered are likely to reside on orbits which are close to circular. The eccentricity is well-described by a Rayleigh distribution with σ = 0.049 ± 0.013. This is distinctly different from RV measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wright et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>), possibly due to the smaller planets in our sample. It is similar to low eccentricities reported for TTV systems <ref type="bibr">(Had- den &amp; Lithwick 2014</ref>) and to the eccentricities found in the solar system.</p><p>Our findings have important consequences:</p><p>• Constraining orbital eccentricities is an important step towards understanding planetary formation. Several mechanisms for eccentricity excitation and damping have previously been suggested based on evidence of eccentric orbits from RV observations. If planet-planet scattering ) is important, it appears to result in low eccentricity in systems with multiple planets, at least for those systems with low mutual inclinations. This could be related to the small planet size, the planetary multiplicity or the orbital distance, or a combination of these.</p><p>• While no Earth twins are present in our sample, our findings cover planets with small radii and a wide range of orbital periods. It seems plausible that low eccentricity orbits would also be common in solar system analogues, influencing habitability and the location of the habitable zone.</p><p>• Orbital eccentricities influence planet occurrence rates derived from transit surveys because eccentric planets are more likely to transit. Our findings indicate that the transit probability of multi-planet systems is different from that of systems with single, massive planets.</p><p>• We have compared the individual eccentricity estimates with accurately determined stellar parameters, such as the stellar temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silva Aguirre et al. 2015</ref>) and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Silva Aguirre et al. 2015</ref>), and found no trend. It would be interesting to compare the eccentricity measurements with measurements of stellar inclination, which might be possible using asteroseismology (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaplin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Van Eylen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. 2014</ref>) for some stars in our sample.</p><p>• With circular orbits common in systems with multiple transiting planets, the stellar density can be reliably estimated from transit observations of such systems. This can be used to characterize the host stars of such systems and to rule out planetary false positives. We use this to validate planets in two systems with planetary candidates <ref type="bibr">(KOI-270, now Kepler-449, and KOI-279, now Kepler-450)</ref>, as well as one planet in a system with previously known planets <ref type="bibr">(KOI-285.03, now Kepler- 92d</ref>).</p><p>• We anticipate that the methods used here will be useful in the context of the future photometry missions TESS ( <ref type="bibr">Ricker et al. 2014</ref>) and PLATO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>), both of which will allow for asteroseismic studies of a large number of targets. Transit durations will be useful to confirm the validity of transit signals in compact multi-planet systems, in particular for the smallest and most interesting candidates that are hardest to confirm using other methods. For systems where independent stellar density measurements exist the method will also provide further information on orbital eccentricities.</p><p>We are grateful to Victor Silva Aguirre for making available an early version of the asteroseismic parameters to us.

All five planets are small with radii between 0.38 and 0.68 R ⊕ .</p><p>We find no evidence of TTVs and find a clear degeneracy between b and e due to the small transit depths. The four inner planets all have 68% confidence intervals consistent with zero eccentricity: <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>.65). The outer planet has a modal value of 0.58, however, we caution against overinterpreting this due to the large degeneracy with the impact parameter and the large error bar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SYSTEMS WHICH WERE EXCLUDED</head><p>Several systems were part of our initial sample but were excluded from the final sample because the eccentricities could not reliably be modeled. They are presented here. In all cases, the presence of TTVs which could not be adequately removed using a sinusoidal model is the cause of their exclusion. <ref type="bibr">Kepler-36 (KOI-277)</ref> consists of two planets in very close orbits with periods of 13.8 and 16.2 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carter et al. 2012</ref>). Their densities are very different, with the inner planet rocky while the outer planet has a lower density <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carter et al. 2012</ref>). With more data available we reanalyze the transit times and their large TTV signal and find amplitudes of around three and two hours respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9)</ref>. After removing the TTVs, significant residuals in the timing variations remain present, particularly for Kepler-36c. They indicate that a sinusoidal model may not be adequate to fully remove the large TTV signal, which is perhaps unsurprising given the close proximity of the two planets. An alternative to the sinusoidal model is to directly use the measured times of individual transits; however, we find that this typically leads to 'overfitting', smearing out the folded transits by including noise on individual timing measurements.</p><p>It is possible the eccentricity can be determined from the transits if a full dynamical model is employed, predicting the times of transits. This is outside the scope of this work.</p><p>Kepler-50 (KOI-262) is a two-planet system with neighbouring orbits on a near 6:5 resonance (7.8 and 9.3 day periods). It was validated owing to the planets' mutual TTV signal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Steffen et al. 2013</ref>). The system was later analyzed and the host star was found to be well-aligned with the orbital plane of the planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaplin et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The TTV signal is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref> but shows significant residuals, indicating a sinusoidal model might not be adequate. We note that this case is similar to Kepler-36 with two planets in high order resonance orbits. A full dynamical model seems to be required to adequately model the TTVs and the eccentricity, but this is outside the scope of this work and we further exclude Kepler-50 from our sample.</p><p>Kepler-56 (KOI-1241) contains two transiting planets with mutual TTVs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Steffen et al. 2013</ref>). The planet's host star was found to be misaligned compared to the planetary orbital plane ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2013</ref>), which triggered further analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Li et al. 2014</ref>). The limited amount of data, the data quality and the small size of the planets make it difficult to measure the TTV signal and we do not include this planet in our further analysis. <ref type="bibr">Kepler-128 (KOI-274)</ref> consists of two small planets which orbit close to a 2:3 resonance (periods of 15 and 22 days). A TTV signal was previously detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Xie 2014</ref>) and we show our best sinusoidal fit in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref>. Due to the small size of the planets their individual times are measured poorly, and it is difficult to measure the TTV signal correctly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-The left top panel (a) pictures an orbit with e = 0.6 and an argument of periastron of 120 • .
