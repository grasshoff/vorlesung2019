				<p>The present study derives the distribution of secondary masses M2 for the 67 exoplanets and very low-mass brown-dwarf companions of solar-type stars, known as of April 4, 2001. This distribution is related to the distribution of M2 sin i through an integral equation of Abel&apos;s type. Although a formal solution exists for this equation, it is known to be ill-behaved, and thus very sensitive to the statistical noise present in the input M2 sin i distribution. To overcome that difficulty, we present two robust, independent approaches: (i) the formal solution of the integral equation is numerically computed after performing an optimal smoothing of the input distribution, (ii) the Lucy-Richardson algorithm is used to invert the integral equation. Both approaches give consistent results. The resulting statistical distribution of exoplanet true masses reveals that there is no reason to ascribe the transition between giant planets and brown dwarfs to the threshold mass for Deuterium ignition (about 13.6 MJ). The M2 distribution shows instead that most of the objects have M2 ≤ 10 MJ, but there is a small tail with a few heavier candidates around 15 MJ.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> <p>suggested that most of the exoplanet candidates discovered so far have masses well above the lower limit defined by sin i = 1 (where i is the inclination of the orbital plane on the sky) and should therefore be considered as brown dwarfs or even stars rather than planets. The present paper shows that this claim is not consistent with the distribution of masses extracted from the observed M 2 sin i distribution (where M 2 is the mass of the companion) under the reasonable assumption that the orbits are oriented at random in space. Although the distributions of M 2 and M 2 sin i are related through an integral equation of Abel's kind <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandrasekhar &amp; Münch 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lucy 1974)</ref>, its numerical solution is ill-behaved. Two different methods are used here to overcome that difficulty. In the first method (Sect. 2), the formal solution of Abel's equation is implemented numerically on an input M 2 sin i distribution that has been optimally smoothed with an adaptive kernel procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Silverman 1986</ref>) to remove the high-frequency fluctuations caused by smallnumber statistics. The other method (Sect. 3) is based on the Lucy-Richardson inversion algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Richardson 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lucy 1974</ref> The basic reason why the M 2 distribution obtained in Sect. 4 differs from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> is because these authors concluded that most of the systems containing exoplanet candidates are seen nearly pole-on. This conclusion, based on the analysis of the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD), has however been shown to be incorrect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Halbwachs et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pourbaix 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pourbaix &amp; Arenou 2001)</ref>, as summarized in Sect. 5.</p><p>While this paper was being referred, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zucker &amp; Mazeh (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tabachnik &amp; Tremaine (2001)</ref> proposed other interesting approaches to derive the exoplanet mass distribution. Zucker &amp; Mazeh derive the binned true mass distribution by using a maximum likelihood approach to retrieve the average values of the mass distribution over the selected bins. Their results are in very good agreement with ours. Tabachnik &amp; Tremaine suppose that the period and mass distributions follow power laws, and derive the corresponding power-law indices from a maximum likelihood method. On the contrary, the methods used in the present paper <ref type="bibr">(and in Zucker &amp; Mazeh's)</ref> are nonparametric in nature, since they do not require to make any a priori assumptions on the functional form of the mass distribution. This is especially important since the comparison of the shapes of the mass distributions for exoplanets and low-mass stellar companions may provide clues to identify the process by which they formed. By imposing a power-law function like that observed for lowmass stellar companions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tabachnik &amp; Tremaine (2001)</ref> somehow implicitly assume that these processes must be similar.</p><p>2. The integral equation of Abel's kind relating the distributions of M 2 sin i and M 2</p><p>The M 2 sin i values for low-mass companions of main sequence stars may be extracted from the spectroscopic mass function and from the primary mass as derived through e.g., isochrone fitting. Let Φ(Y ) be the observed distribution of Y ≡ M 2 sin i which is easily derived from the observed spectroscopic mass functions provided that M 2 &lt;&lt; M 1 as it is expected to be the case for the systems under consideration. Then, the seeked distribution Ψ(M 2 ) obeys the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Φ(Y ) = ∞ 0 Ψ(M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) dM 2 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The kernel Π(Y |M 2 ) corresponds to the conditional probability of observing the value Y given M 2 . Under the assumption that the orbits are oriented at random in space, the inclination angle i distributes as sin i, and the following expression is obtained for the kernel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Π(Y |M 2 ) = sin i 0 M 2 cos i 0 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where i 0 satisfies the relations M 2 sin i 0 − Y = 0 and 0 ≤ i 0 ≤ 90.

It can be reduced to Abel's integral equation by the substitutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandrasekhar &amp; Münch 1950</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y 2 = 1/η and M 2 2 = 1/t.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>With these substitutions, Eq.(4) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">φ(η) = η 0 ψ(t) (η − t) 1/2 dt,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ(η) ≡ Φ( 1 √ η ) and ψ(t) ≡ 1 2 √ t Ψ( 1 √ t ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>It is well known that the solution of Abel's equation (Eq. 6) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ψ(t) = 1 π t 0 ∂φ ∂η 1 (t − η) 1/2 dη + 1 π φ(0) √ t ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">φ(0) = lim Y →∞ Φ(Y ) = 0.</formula><p>While Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(8)</ref> represents the formal solution of the problem, it is difficult to implement numerically, since it requires the differentiation of the observed frequency distribution Φ(Y ). Unless the observations are of high precision, it is well known that this process can lead to misleading results. To overcome that difficulty, the observed frequency distribution has been smoothed in an optimal way (see Appendix) before being used in Eq. (8). The solution Ψ(t) is then computed numerically using standard differentiation and integration schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Lucy-Richardson inversion algorithm applied to Abel's integral equation</head><p>The Lucy-Richardson algorithm provides another robust way to invert Eq. (4) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cerf &amp; Boffin 1994)</ref>. The method starts from the Bayes theorem on conditional probability in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ψ(M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) = Φ(Y ) R(M 2 |Y ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where R(M 2 |Y ) is the reciprocal kernel corresponding to the integral equation inverse to the one that needs to be solved (Eq. 1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ψ(M 2 ) = M2 0 Φ(Y ) R(M 2 |Y ) dY.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The reciprocal kernel represents the conditional probability that the binary system has a companion mass M 2 when the observed M 2 sin i value amounts to Y . Thus, one has:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R(M 2 |Y ) = Ψ(M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) Φ(Y ) (11) = Ψ(M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) ∞ 0 Ψ(M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) dM 2 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>which obviously satisfies the normalization condition ∞ 0 R(M 2 |Y ) dM 2 = 1. The problem in solving Eq. (10) arises because R(M 2 |Y ) also depends on Ψ(M 2 ), so that an iterative procedure must be used. If Ψ r (M 2 ) is the rth estimate of Ψ(M 2 ), it can be used to obtain the (r + 1)th estimate in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Ψ r+1 (M 2 ) = M2 0 Φ(Y ) R r (M 2 |Y ) dY<label>(13)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R r (M 2 |Y ) = Ψ r (M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) Φ r (Y )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Φ r (Y ) = ∞ 0 Ψ r (M 2 ) Π(Y |M 2 ) dM 2 .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Thus, Φ r (Y ) represents the corresponding rth estimate of the observed distribution Φ(Y ). Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> together yield the recurrence relation for the Ψ r 's,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Ψ r+1 (M 2 ) = Ψ r (M 2 ) M2 0 Φ(Y ) Φ r (Y ) Π(Y |M 2 ) dY,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with Π(Y |M 2 ) given by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> for the problem under consideration. The conditions for convergence of this recurrence relation are discussed by <ref type="bibr">Lucy (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cerf &amp; Boffin (1994)</ref>. It needs only be remarked here that (i) the iterative scheme converges if Φ r (Y ) tends to Φ(Y ), given the normalization of the probability Π(Y |M 2 )dY , and (ii) the full convergence of the method is not necessarily desirable, as the successive estimates Φ r (Y ) will tend to match Φ(Y ) on increasingly smaller scales, but the small-scale structure in Φ(Y ) is likely to be dominated by the noise in the input data. This is well illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> below. When the number of data points is small (typically N &lt; 100; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cerf &amp; Boffin 1994)</ref>, it is advantageous to express Φ(Y ) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Φ(Y ) = 1 N N n=1 δ(Y − y n ) (17)</formula><p>where the y n (n = 1, . . . N ) are the N individual measured M 2 sin i values and δ(x) is the Dirac 'function' such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">x 0 = δ(x − x 0 ) dx. Substitution in Eq. (13) then yields Ψ r+1 (M 2 ) = 1 N N n=1 R r (M 2 |y n )<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where R r (M 2 |y n ) is defined as in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>. The sample size should nevertheless be large enough for the functions R r (M 2 |y n ) to have sufficient overlaps so as to produce a smooth Ψ r+1 (M 2 ) function.</p><p>In the application of the method described in Sect. 4, the initial mass distribution Ψ 0 (M 2 ) was taken as a uniform distribution, but it has been checked that this choice has no influence on the final solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The frequency distribution Ψ(M 2 )</head><p>The cumulative frequency distribution of the M 2 sin i values smaller than 17 M J , where M J is the mass of Jupiter (= M ⊙ /1047.35), available in the literature (as of <ref type="bibr">April 4, 2001</ref>) is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. It appears to be sufficiently well sampled to attempt the inversion procedure. The corresponding frequency distributions smoothed with two different smoothing lengths, locally self-adapting around h opt = 1 M J and 2h opt (see Appendix) are presented as well for comparison.</p><p>The sample includes 60 main-sequence stars hosting 67 companions with M 2 sin i &lt; 17 M J . Among those, 6 stars are orbited by more than one companion, namely HD 74156 and HD 82943 (M 2 sin i = 1.50, 7.40 M J , and   4.1. Non-coplanar orbits <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> compares the solutions Ψ(M 2 ) obtained from the Lucy-Richardson algorithm (after 2 and 20 iterations, denoted Ψ 2 and Ψ 20 , respectively) and from the formal solution of Abel's integral equation with smoothing lengths h opt and 2 h opt on Φ(Y ) (the corresponding solutions are denoted Ψ hopt and Ψ 2hopt ). The solutions from the two methods basically agree with each other, although solutions with different degrees of smoothness may be obtained with each method. On the one hand, Ψ 20 and Ψ hopt exhibit high-frequency fluctuations that may be traced back to the statistical fluctuations in the input data. This can be seen by noting that the peaks present in Ψ hopt correspond in fact to the high-frequency fluctuations already present in Φ hopt <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>. These fluctuations should thus not be given much credit. The same explanation holds true for Ψ 20 , since it was argued in Sect. 3 that the solutions Ψ r resulting from a large number of iterations tend to match Φ at increasingly small scales (i.e., higher frequencies) where statistical fluctuations become dominant. On the other hand, Ψ 2 and Ψ 2hopt are much smoother, and are probably better matches to the actual distribution. The local maximum around M 2 ∼ 1 M J is very likely however an artifact of the strong detection bias against low-mass companions.</p><p>The most striking feature of the Ψ(M 2 ) distribution displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> is its decreasing character, reaching zero for the first time around M 2 = 10 M J , and in any case well before 13.6 M J . The latter value, corresponding to the minimum stellar mass for igniting Deuterium, does not in any way mark the transition between giant planets and brown dwarfs, as sometimes proposed. That transition, which is thus likely to occur at smaller masses, must rely instead on the different mechanisms governing the formation of planets and brown dwarfs. Another argument favouring a giant-planet/brown-dwarf transition mass smaller than 13.6 M J is provided e.g., by the observation of free-floating (and thus most likely stellar) objects with masses probably smaller than 10 M J in the σ Orionis star cluster (Zapatero <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Osorio et al. 2000</ref>). The Ψ(M 2 ) distribution nevertheless clearly exhibits a tail of objects clustering around M 2 ∼ 15 M J , due to HD 114762 (M 2 sin i = 11.5 M J ), HD 162020 (14.3 M J ), HD 202206 (15.0 M J ) and HD 168443 c (16.2 M J ). It would be interesting to investigate whether these systems differ from those with smaller masses in some identifiable way (periods, eccentricities, metallicities,...), so as to assess whether or not they form a distinct class (Udry et al., in preparation).</p><p>The jackknife method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lupton 1993)</ref> has been used to estimate the uncertainty on the Ψ 2hopt solution. In a first step, 67 input Φ 2hopt distributions are computed, corresponding to all 67 possible sets with one data point removed from the original set. Eq. 8 is then applied to these 67 different input distributions. The resulting distributions are displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, which shows that the threshold observed at 10 M J is a robust result not affected by the uncertainty on the solution. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Coplanar orbits in multi-planets systems</head><p>All the results discussed so far are obtained under the assumption that orbits of planets belonging to a planetary system are not coplanar. To evaluate the impact of this hypothesis, the following procedure has been applied. In a first step, the Lucy-Richardson algorithm is applied on the data set excluding the 13 planets belonging to planetary systems. That mass distribution obtained after 2 iterations is then completed by mass estimates for the remaining 13 planets. For each of the 6 different systems, an inclination i is drawn from a sin i distribution. This is done through the expression i = acos x, where x is a random number with uniform deviate. The same value of i is then applied to all planets in a given system to extract M 2 from the observed M 2 sin i value. The distributions of exoplanet masses obtained with and without the hypothesis of coplanarity are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, and it is seen that planetary systems are not yet numerous enough for the coplanarity hypothesis to alter significantly the resulting Ψ(M 2 ) distribution.</p><p>In any case, the main result of the present paper is that the statistical properties of the observed M 2 sin i distribution coupled with the hypothesis of randomly oriented <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Comparison of the input Φ 2hopt distribution (thick dashed line) and the 67 Ψ 2hopt distributions (thin dotted lines) resulting from the application of the jackknife method (see text), which illustrates the uncertainty on the solution Ψ 2hopt (thick solid line). To guide the eye, a power-law of index −1.6 has been plotted as well (dotdashed line) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. Evaluation of the impact of the coplanarity hypothesis on the resulting Ψ(M 2 ) distribution. The dashed histogram corresponds to the mass distribution obtained assuming coplanar orbits in planetary systems (see text), as compared to the Ψ 2 (solid histogram) and Ψ 2hopt solutions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>) orbital planes confine the vast majority of planetary companion masses below about 10 M J . <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zucker &amp; Mazeh (2001)</ref> reach the same conclusion.</p><p>It should be remarked that the above conclusion cannot be due to detection biases, since the high-mass tail of the M 2 distribution is not affected by the difficulty of finding low-amplitude, long-period orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Although the assumption of random orbital inclinations seems reasonable, it is at variance with the conclusion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> that most of the systems containing exoplanet candidates are seen nearly pole-on. These authors reached this conclusion by trying to extract the astrometric orbit, hence the orbital inclination, from the Hipparcos IAD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Halbwachs et al. (2000)</ref> had already cautioned that this approach is doomed to fail for systems with apparent separations on the sky that are below the Hipparcos sensitivity (i.e. &lt; ∼ 1 mas). In those cases, the solution retrieved from the fit of the IAD residuals is spurious, since the true angular semi-major axis a is simply too small to be seen by Hipparcos. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Halbwachs et al. (2000)</ref> have shown that a actually follows a Rayleigh probability distribution, the fit of the IAD residuals will yield a solution larger than the true value, in fact of the order of the residuals. But since a sin i is constrained by the spectroscopic orbital elements, the too-large astrometric a value will force i to be close to 0 to match the spectroscopic value of the product a sin i, as convincingly shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pourbaix (2001)</ref>. Hence, this approach gives the impression that all orbits are seen nearly face-on. As an illustrative example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pourbaix &amp; Arenou (2001)</ref> have shown that such an approach leads to a stellar mass for the companion of HD 209458 that, on another hand, has been proven to be a 0.69 M J planet by the photometric observation of the planet transit in front of the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charbonneau et al. 2000</ref>).</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> result is moreover statistically very unlikely if the orbital planes are oriented at random in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pourbaix &amp; Arenou 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> have tried to justify this unlikely statistical occurrence by invoking biases against high-amplitude orbits in the selection process of the radial-velocity-monitoring samples. To the contrary, the planet-search surveys were specifically devised to avoid such biases, as they aim at finding not only giant planets but also brown dwarfs so as to constrain the substellar secondary mass function of solartype stars. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al. (2001)</ref> argument is totally invalid in the case of volume-limited, statistically well-defined samples like that of the CORALIE planetsearch programme in the southern hemisphere ( <ref type="bibr">Udry et al. 2000a</ref>). This sample has been specifically designed to detect companions of solar-type stars all the way from q = M 2 /M 1 = 1 down to q ≤ 0.001. Appendix: Non-parametric treatment of the data To decrease the noise and allow a tractable use of the information present in small data samples, heavy smoothing techniques are often required. A common practice consists in converting a set of discrete positions into binned "counts". Binning is a crude sort of smoothing and many studies in statistical analysis have shown that, unless the smoothing is done in an optimum way, some, or even most, of the information content of the data could be lost. This is especially true when a large amount of smoothing is necessary, which then changes the "shape" of the resulting function. In statistical terms, the smoothing process not only decreases the noise (i.e., the function's variance), but at the same time introduces a bias in the estimate of the function.</p><p>The variance-bias trade off is unavoidable but, for a given level of variance, the bias increase can be minimized. The correct manner of achieving that task is provided by the so-called non-parametric density estimate methods for the determination of the "frequency" function of a given parameter or by the non-parametric regression methods for the determination of a smooth function g inferred from direct measurements of g itself. Moreover, adaptive nonparametric methods are designed to filter the data in some local, objective way minimizing the bias, in order to get the smooth desired function without constraining its form in any way. The theory and algorithms related to those methods, originally built to handle ill-conditioned problems (either under-determined or extremely sensitive to errors or incompleteness in the data), are widely discussed in the specialized literature and summarized in easy-toread textbooks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Silverman 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Härdle 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Scott 1992)</ref>.</p><p>The simplest of the available algorithms is provided by the kernel estimator leading to the following form of the normalized "frequency" function</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ˆ f K (x) = 1 N h N n=1 K x − X n h<label>(19)</label></formula><p>with the normalization</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">∞ −∞ K(u) du = 1,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where X n (n = 1, ...N ) are the n available data points.

In order to follow the "true" underlying function in the best possible way, the amount of smoothing should be small when f is large whereas more smoothing is needed where f takes lower values. A convenient method to do so consists in deriving first a pilot estimate˜festimate˜ estimate˜f of f , e.g. by using an histogram or a kernel with fixed bandwidth h opt , and then by defining the local bandwidths</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">h n = h(X n ) = h opt [ ˜ f (X n )/s] −α ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where log s = 1 N N n=1</p><p>log˜flog˜ log˜f (X n ).</p><p>It may be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramson 1982</ref>) that α = 1/2 leads to a bias of smaller order than for the fixed h estimate. The optimum kernel K may be taken as the one minimizing the integrated mean square error beween f andˆfandˆ andˆf (MISE), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">M ISE( ˆ f ) = E ˆ f (x) − f (x) 2 dx (23)</formula><p>is usually taken as an indicator of efficiency. In the above expression, E denotes the statistical expectation. This optimum kernel is the so-called Epanechnikov (K e ) or quadratic kernel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">K e (u) = 3 4 (1 − u 2 ), |u| &lt; 1.<label>(24)</label></formula><p>Other choices of K differ only slightly in their asymptotic efficiencies and could be more adapted to particular purposes as e.g., for bi-dimensional data.</p><p>The pilot smoothing length (h opt ) is the only subjective parameter required by the method. It relates to the quality of the sampling of the variable under consideration. There are several ways for automatically estimating an optimum value of h opt (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Silverman 1986</ref>, for an extensive review). A simple approach based on the data variance gives in our case h opt ≃ 1.0 M J . As the derivative of the frequency function rather than the function itself is actually used in Eq. (6), a larger pilot smoothing length (2h opt ) was also considered in order to remove spurious small-statistics fluctuations of the density estimate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>M 2 sin i = 0.84, 1.57 M J , respectively; Udry &amp; Mayor 2001) 1 , HD 83433 (0.16, 0.38 M J ; Mayor et al. 2000), HD 168443 (7.22, 16.2 M J ; Udry et al. 2000b), υ And (0.71, 2.20 and 4.45 M J ; Butler et al. 1999) and Gliese 876 (0.56, 1.88 M J ; Marcy et al. 2001).
