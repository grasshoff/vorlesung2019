<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PUBLIC NAMING OF PLANETS AND PLANETARY SATELLITES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>The Press Office was included from the start, as it was anticipated that any action by the IAU concerning or approving the public naming of Solar System objects and exoplanets would have a high visibility worldwide, and trigger many Press Releases and Announcements -as well as reactions from the press and the public.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Status of public naming of Solar System objects</head><p>As mentioned above, the IAU has a long tradition, not only of using name suggestions by individuals, but also of cooperating with public institutions like NASA.</p><p>First, the rules for naming astronomical objects by individuals, in particular Solar System objects like asteroids and minor planets, have been defined for a long time by the MPC, and can be found in a "theme" accessible from the IAU home page (http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/).</p><p>Second, the IAU also has a long tradition of collaboration with space agencies for naming celestial objects discovered by space missions. However, the public was generally not involved in the naming process until recently. A notable exception was the organization by NASA, long before the Internet era, of a public competition to name the cloud-covered surface features of Venus discovered in the course of the Magellan mission <ref type="bibr">(1989)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1990)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1992)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1993)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1994)</ref>: in agreement with the IAU, the proposed theme was "famous women", both mythical and real (the only exception being James Clerk Maxwell, nominated in reference to the radar carried by the probe)( †).</p><p>More recently, the IAU was involved in or sanctioned various naming campaigns for planetary satellites and surface features (typically name suggestions by the public followed by public votes to select the most popular names):</p><p>• The two latest Pluto satellites (originally known as P3 and P4) discovered by HST [4] (2013);</p><p>• The last craters discovered on Mercury at the end of the Messenger survey mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>[6] <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>;</p><p>• Pluto surface features, discovered by the New Horizons spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> (2015; still pending).</p><p>However, in all the examples mentioned above, while the IAU was setting the rules, other organizations (here NASA) actually took the initiative of directly involving the public in the naming campaigns, and organized the votes themselves. (For the record, ESA also approached the IAU in 2014 for the public naming of surface features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the course of the Rosetta/Philae mission, but the IAU declined because these features are not permanent.)</p><p>Since the field of exoplanet research was still "virgin" for naming but becoming scientifically mature (with hundreds of well-characterized, confirmed objects) and so appealing to the public's interest and imagination, any appropriate organization, private or public, could have started a comparable naming campaign for exoplanets. But on the other hand, with its in-house experience and scientific structure (Div.F, C53, WGPSN, WGSBN/MPC, etc.), the IAU could simply decide to organize such a naming contest itself with the best possible cards in its hands, and be the leader of a new project with a potentially high worldwide impact, the first since the International Year of Astronomy in 2009. This is how the NameExoWorlds project came to life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WORKING GROUP</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Organizing the public naming of exoplanets</head><p>Strongly inspired by the participation of the IAU in campaigns for naming Solar System objects, the EC-TG started to draw up a project for the public naming of exoplanets.</p><p>Several specific features were introduced:</p><p>• The naming process would be restricted to astronomy clubs and non-profit associations interested in astronomy (hereafter "clubs" for short). The definition of "associations" was to be understood in a broad way, and could include schools, historical or cultural associations, etc. Naming by individuals was not to be allowed: a two-week long pilot project opening of the IAU Secretariat iaupublic@iap.fr email address to exoplanet naming suggestions in September 2013 collected nearly 2 000 responses, but of low quality (self-nominations, pet names, lists of names obviously copied from dictionaries, etc.). It was thought that restricting the participation to clubs would spur discussions within the interested groups, be more international, and have a strong educational value.</p><p>• The clubs would have to first register in a dedicated, publicly accessible IAU Directory for World Astronomy. This Directory would be set up by the newly created Office of Astronomy Outreach (OAO) in Tokyo. This approach would have two main advantages:</p><p>• One could check the good standing of the clubs (in contrast to individuals, who could have more than one email address), monitor their membership, and assess their geographical distribution;</p><p>• The Directory would become the backbone of a permanent, worldwide IAU-led network that could be involved in future projects of the OAO and other IAU structures (such as the Office of Astronomy for Development: OAD, in Cape Town).</p><p>• The IAU itself would provide a sample of bona fide, well-characterized exoplanetary systems, with the agreement of the discoverers and the exoplanet community (represented by Division F Commission 53). This sample would satisfy the 2003 "Working Definition of a Planet" elaborated by Division III Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (which became Commission 53 in 2006) : "Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are 'planets' (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System."</p><p>• Their host stars would be also offered for public naming, unless they already had well-known, historic popular names (Arabic, Greek, Roman, etc.);</p><p>• This sample would be ranked by a vote organized by the OAO among the registered clubs, and the top N systems offered for naming proposals by these clubs (N being decided a posteriori by the TG as a function of the size of the exoplanet sample and the number of clubs having registered);</p><p>• Names would be proposed for an entire system at once (somehow in analogy with the Solar System), e.g., 4 names for a system of 1 "nameable" star and 3 exoplanets;</p><p>• Each club could propose only one set of names (host star and planets), for only one system;</p><p>• The worldwide public would be solicited to vote on the club proposals sent to the IAU;</p><p>• The names included in the top-voted proposals ("the winning names") would be officially sanctioned by the IAU, and recorded in professional databases like SIMBAD.</p><p>Implementing such a project required new expertise to be added to the EC-TG. First, a new Working Group was established, under Div.F, entitled Exoplanets for the Public (http://www.iau.org/science/scientific bodies/working groups/211/), and chaired by A. Lecavelier des Etangs (C53 President). This Working Group undertook the task of contacting the community and defining the sample of exoplanets available for public naming.</p><p>Then, after preparatory telecons and exchange of working documents over several months, a founding meeting, hosted by G. Valsecchi and chaired by T. Montmerle, took place on the INAF premises of Tor Vergata (Rome, Italy), on 9-10 April 2014, just before the EC94 Executive Committee Meeting in Canberra (Australia). In addition to the EC-TG members, this meeting included representatives of the newly created Div.F-WG (A. Lecavelier des Etangs), the WGPSN (R. Schulz), the WGSBN/MPC (G. Williams), the IAU Press Office (L. L. Christensen), the OAO (Sze-leung Cheung), and also P. Benvenuti (AGS) as an additional EC member. While R. Williams (in Baltimore) and Xiaowei Liu (in Beijing) could be available only separately, C. Lintott (from the Zooniverse organization) joined the meeting by telecon, with the perspective of a joint "citizen science" approach to the exoplanet naming project, still without a name.</p><p>The main decisions coming out of this meeting were as follows:</p><p>• From the WG Exoplanets for the Public, a sample of 305 bona fide, well-characterized exoplanets, discovered before 31 December 2008 (representing 260 systems of one to five exoplanets, studied for more than five years), was made available for public naming;</p><p>• The Task Group would be "upgraded" to an EC-Working Group by including the meeting participants listed above, and proposed for approval to the EC in Canberra (to this list would be added in 2015 a representative of the Division B Commission 5 WG on Designations, for the star names: D. Lubowich, as well as another member of the new WG: E. Mamajek). (More details on the composition of this EC-WG are given in Appendix 2);</p><p>• The project, as outlined above (and adding budget details), was agreed by the participants, and submitted to the EC for approval;</p><p>• A MoU was to be drafted by T. Montmerle (as GS) and agreed between the IAU and Zooniverse: the Directory for World Astronomy was to be developed by the OAO, while the adaptation of their registration and voting software to IAU/OAO requirements, as well as the final, worldwide voting, was to be implemented and organized by Zooniverse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">NameExoWorlds: from project to contest</head><p>The creation of the EC-WG (with the same name as the pathfinder EC-TG: Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites) was approved at the EC94 meeting in Canberra <ref type="bibr">(30 April-2 May 2014)</ref>, with the mission to organize the two projects leading to the first "public naming of exoplanets and their host stars": (i) the creation of the IAU Directory for World Astronomy (https://directory.iau. org/), designed by the OAO (which was to win the 2015 Best Science Website Award <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>), and (ii) the contest, now called NameExoWorlds, an "ExoWorld" being defined as an exoplanetary system and its host star.</p><p>The official "birth" of the contest was 9 July 2014, when the IAU issued a Press Release <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> announcing the opening of its web site, designed by Zooniverse under the supervision of the OAO (http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/), that included the sample of 305 exoplanets along with related properties and explanations, the steps and timeline 6 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WORKING GROUP of the process, the rules and guidelines for proposing names and for voting eligibility. The timeline was originally set so as to announce the "winning names" at a special ceremony being held during the Honolulu GA a year after.</p><p>The following steps were accomplished, in conformity with this timeline:</p><p>• Opening of registration in the Directory for World Astronomy: 3 October 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. The registration was originally planned to last three months, but was eventually kept open indefinitely, so that the membership could grow for future projects (the Directory now has nearly 700 member clubs);</p><p>• Vote by the registered clubs to rank the most interesting systems: 13 January 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. The Directory comprising ∼ 400 clubs at the time, the EC-WG chose to select the top 20 systems for naming, and fed them into the NameExoWorlds web page. The resulting list was surprisingly diverse in scientific interest, including in particular the first exoplanetary system, discovered in 1990 around the pulsar PSR 1257+12, the five-exoplanet system 55 Cnc, the exoplanet/circumstellar disk system Fomalhaut, etc. Obviously the clubs had been very careful in their choices, and the outcome demonstrated that engaging clubs, rather than individuals, into naming exoplanets was a very fruitful approach.</p><p>• Selection of the top 20 ExoWorlds, representing 32 exoplanets and 15 "nameable" stars, i.e., not already having a popular name. Here, the WG considered that the names for the host stars ǫ Tau (Ain), ι Dra (Edasich), γ Cep (Errai), α PsA (Fomalhaut), and β Gem (Pollux) were in sufficiently common usage in the astronomical and historical literature to be adopted as official, so that only their exoplanets would be open for naming via NameExoWorlds.</p><p>• Opening of submission of naming proposals by the registered clubs: 27 April 2015 <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. A period of about three months was left to the clubs so select their favorite ExoWorld (as mentioned above only one proposal was allowed per club), and the deadline for closing the submission was set to 15 June. A total of 237 proposals were eventually received from 45 countries, for a total of 551 distinct names.</p><p>Then the contest entered a crisis. Communication problems with Zooniverse, the sudden departure of their web developer in early June, etc., brought the project to a halt. The MoU was never signed, and it was discovered that the proposals received had not been properly stored in the Zooniverse system ! With the Honolulu GA only a few weeks away, the contest looked doomed. But swift action by Sze-leung Cheung and the OAO followed: a new contract was established with the software developers who had designed the Directory, and within a couple of weeks only the proposals were safely recovered from the proposers themselves, the contest put back on track and the worldwide voting process organized. However, it was clear that the vote could not be completed in time for the GA -so it was decided to open it at the GA, instead of announcing the results.</p><p>Eventually the voting was successfully opened on 12 August during a special public session of the GA, kindly chaired by Lisa Kaltenegger (Director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell) <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, with a closing deadline of 31 October, not far from the 20th anniversary of the publication of the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star by M. <ref type="bibr">Mayor and D. Queloz (51 Peg b: Nature 378, 355;</ref><ref type="bibr">23 Nov. 1995</ref>; of course part of the 20 ExoWorlds to be named).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and lessons to be learned</head><p>The results (the "winning names" and the "winning clubs") were announced on 15 December 2015 <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, i.e., six weeks after the counting of the votes had become available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PUBLIC NAMING OF PLANETS AND PLANETARY SATELLITES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7</head><p>(i) The first reason for such a relatively long period was the sheer amplitude of the worldwide vote. The raw number of votes was 631 418. An analysis of the votes received as a function of time however revealed anomalies that could be attributed to multiple vote fraud (only one vote per ExoWorld was allowed). The OAO made a careful analysis, which led to removing ∼ 10% of the votes (58 176). In the end, the number of valid votes has been 573 242, coming from 182 countries and territories (see http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/statistics).</p><p>(ii) The biggest stumbling block has been the fact that some of the winning names were already attributed to other celestial objects, in most cases asteroids or minor planets, which was undesirable. These duplicates had not been weeded out before the vote. Extended discussions took place within the EC-WG, sometimes including outside experts, to decide which names to adopt. In the majority of cases, and after negotiations on a case-by-case basis with the proposers respecting the spirit of their proposals, the duplicate names could be adapted before being officially accepted. This phase was most challenging, but very rich in exchanges about history and cultures.</p><p>(iii) Another difficulty arose from the fact that one of the winning names (for the τ Boö system) turned out to be that of a person not satisfying the IAU requirement of not being "principally known for political, military or religious activities". The vote was consequently removed from the contest, so in the end only 19 ExoWorlds were named.</p><p>Checking for astronomical duplicates and controversial names before launching the vote will obviously be the first prerequisite if another NameExoWorld contest is to be organized in the future.</p><p>In spite of these hiccups, the final list of approved names <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> is quite remarkable (see Appendix 3). It is composed of a wide variety of names taken from mythology, literature, or are even pure creations, but somewhat unexpectedly there were no proposal from science-fiction lore. In line with the IAU culture, the approved names represent all the continents, and there is no strong bias towards a particular country or world region. Four winning proposals were received from North America (USA, Canada), one from Latin America and the Caribbean (Mexico), two from the Middle East &amp; Africa (Morocco, Syria), six from Europe (France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland), and six from Asia-Pacific (Australia, Japan, Thailand). Also, winning proposals came not only from astronomy clubs, but from schools and universities as well.</p><p>In addition, from private sources we have significant evidence that the contest triggered local actions, or even lobbying, by clubs to promote astronomy towards a broader public.</p><p>A last -but not least -consideration was the press coverage during the contest: an OAO web survey showed that over 800 articles were published worldwide, from 54 countries, spread about equally between the pre-results and the post-results periods.</p><p>Altogether, we would conclude at this stage that the NameExoWorlds project has undeniably had a great public impact, in line with the long-standing successful tradition of IAU global initiatives in outreach and education.</p></div>
