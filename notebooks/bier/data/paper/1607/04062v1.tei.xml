				<p>In this work we investigate the impact of calculating non-equilibrium chemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the atmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical kinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the chemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite the fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical disequilib-rium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T profile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences for the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission spectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics calculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated observations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong interpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models violating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Despite the discovery of ever smaller and more Earth-like rocky exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Berta-Thompson et al. 2015</ref>), hot Jupiters remain one of the most important classes of exoplanet due to the availability of follow-up characterisation observations. This allows for important comparisons between the various observables (transmission spectra (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sing et al. 2016</ref>), emission spectra (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beaulieu et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans et al. 2015</ref>) and phase curves (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zellem et al. 2014)</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heng &amp; Showman (2015)</ref> for a review) with the many atmosphere models in use throughout the community to understand the physical and chemical processes occuring in these atmospheres.</p><p>There exists a hierarchy of atmosphere models which have so far been applied to the study of exoplanets with each class of model having its own practical use. The threedimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) are required to gain insights into the atmospheric dynamics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mayne et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Polichtchouk et al. 2014</ref>) whilst the onedimensional (1D) radiative-convective models solve for single column pressure-temperature (P -T ) profiles (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Iro et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barman et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fortney et al. 2010;</ref>. A further class of atmosphere model, the chemical kinetics models, determine precise chemical compositions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zahnle &amp; Marley 2014</ref>).</p><p>Early work using these chemical kinetics models focussed on the photochemical production and destruction processes of hydrocarbon hazes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Liang et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zahnle et al. 2009</ref>) and the production of atomic hydrogen through water photolysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liang et al. 2003</ref>). Later modelling efforts provided detailed chemical compositions of these atmospheres and considered the impact on the observable properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madhusud- han &amp; Seager 2011</ref>).</p><p>The non-equilibrium processes of vertical mixing and photochemistry have been shown to have notable consequences on the simulated spectra of some hot exoplanet atmospheres (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Moses 2014</ref>, for a review). Vertical mixing can result in transport-induced quenching which increases or decreases the abundances of chemical species compared with their chemical equilibrium profiles. In addition, at low pressures high-energy photons can dissociate molecules into highly reactive daughter products.</p><p>These non-equilibrium processes have the potential to influence the simulated spectrum of the atmosphere by changing the amount of absorption or emission from these molecules. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> found that increases in the abundances of methane and ammonia due to transport-induced quenching have important consequences for the emission spectrum of HD 189733b, decreasing the calculated eclipse depth over several wavelength regions.</p><p>One common feature amongst all of the chemical kinetics studies published so far is that none include a consistent approach to the model atmosphere. The background thermal structure of the atmosphere is treated as a fixed model input. Usually the supplied P -T profiles have been derived from 3D GCM results (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. 2012</ref>) or 1D radiative-convective models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agúndez et al. 2014b</ref>). The equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemical abundances are then calculated using this fixed P -T profile leading to an inconsistency between the chemical abundances and the thermal structure. As the chemistry is driven away from chemical equilibrium, the opacity in the model atmosphere changes which should impact on the P -T profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agúndez et al. (2014b)</ref> have attempted to take into account this effect by including one additional iteration in their radiative-convective model using the initial nonequilibrium chemical abundances they calculate for the hot Neptune GJ 436b. They found corrections to the temperature structure of &lt; 100 K. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Hubeny &amp; Burrows (2007)</ref> performed consistent non-equilibrium chemistry models of brown dwarf atmospheres using a timescale argument to quench the abundances of N 2 /NH 3 and CO/CH 4 , not using chemical kinetics, and found corrections to the P -T profile of 50-100 K.</p><p>In this study we use a 1D atmosphere code which solves for both hydrostatic and energy balance and includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme to solve for the nonequilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and photochemistry, consistently with the P -T profile. In Section 2 we describe our model setup. In Section 3 we present our results and, finally, in Section 4 we summarise and conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method and Model Description</head><p>We use the 1D atmosphere code ATMO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tremblin et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tremblin et al. , 2016</ref>) to generate models of two highly irradiated exoplanet atmospheres. The model has already been applied to the atmospheres of brown dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tremblin et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tremblin et al. , 2016</ref> and we use essentially the same model setup here except that external irradiation is now included. In this section we present details of the model and our method for calculating non-equilibrium chemical abundances consistently with the P -T profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Radiative-Convective Equilibrium</head><p>ATMO solves for the pressure-temperature structure of an atmosphere by finding energy flux balance in each model level, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∞ 0 F rad (ν) + F 0 star (ν)e τν /µstar dν + F conv = σT 4 int (1)</formula><p>where F rad (ν) and F conv are the spectral radiative flux and the convective flux, respectively, and τ ν is the vertical monochromatic optical depth. T int is the internal temperature of the object corresponding to the surface flux at which the object cools in the absence of irradiation; T int is equivalant to the effective temperature T eff in the absence of irradiation. F 0 star (ν) is the incoming irradiation flux from the star at the top of the atmosphere and µ star = cos θ where θ is the angle of incoming radiation off the vertical; µ star is negative. In addition, the pressure as a function of altitude is calculated using the equation of hydrostatic balance</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂P ∂z = −ρg (2)</formula><p>where P is pressure, z is altitude, ρ is density and g is gravity. An object's atmosphere is therefore completely determined by its internal temperature and gravity, often specified as (T int , log(g)), in the absence of irradiation. The convective flux is computed using the mixing length theory as presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Henyey et al. (1965)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F conv = 1 2 ρC p T v conv l H p Γ Γ + 1 ( T − − ad )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with v conv the convective velocity, Γ the efficiency parameter, T = ∂ log(T )/∂ log(P ), ad the adiabatic gradient, C p the specific heat at constant pressure, H p the pressure scale height, and l = αH p the mixing length. The details of the computation of v conv and Γ can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gustafsson et al. (2008)</ref> and we used the same standard parameters (temperature distribution in a convective element y = 0.076, energy dissipation by turbulent viscosity ν = 8, mixing length 1 α = 1.5). The non-linear problem given by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 is solved by a Newton-Raphson algorithm to obtain the converged P -T profile of the atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Radiative Transfer</head><p>The radiative transfer equation is solved in 1D planeparallel geometry including isotropic scattering. We include CH 4 , H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , TiO, VO, Na, K, Li, Cs and Rb and collision induced absorption due to H 2 -H 2 and H 2 -He as opacity sources in the atmosphere (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tremblin et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014</ref>, for details). ATMO can be used as a full line-by-line code at high spectral resolution (0.001 cm −1 , evenly spaced in wavenumber), e.g. to post process high-resolution emission and transmission spectra, though this is not used in this study.</p><p>Presently ATMO is used with the correlated-k approximation using the random overlap method to compute the total mixture opacity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lacis &amp; Oinas (1991)</ref> and Amundsen et al. in prep) for moderate resolution emission and transmission spectra with 500 or 5000 bands and, for a rapid computation of the radiative flux, with 32 bands in the Newton-Raphson iterations. The number of k-coefficients per band is not fixed but is instead computed based on a specified precision; the number of k-coefficients therefore varies depending on the band and the gas (this is explained in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014</ref>). The k-coefficients were derived for opacity tables as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. (2014)</ref>. The results obtained using the correlated-k approximation have been compared with the full line-by-line result, which agree very well.</p><p>The radiative transfer equation for the irradiation and thermal emission of the planet is split into a directlyirradiated part I star (ν) and a thermal plus diffuselyirradiated part I rad (ν)I therm (ν) + I diff (ν) (see Thomas &amp; Stammes 1999, chap. 6.2 for details). The direct part can be integrated straightforwardly to give</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F star (ν) = 2π 1 −1 I star (ν)µdµ = F 0 star (ν)e τν /µstar (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F 0 star (ν) is the top incoming flux defined as F 0 star (ν) = 4πH 0 star (ν)µ star R 2 star /R 2 orbit ; here H 0 star (ν)</formula><p>is the flux at the surface of the star, and R star and R orbit are the stellar and orbital radius respectively. The diffuse and thermal part are computed using the radiative transfer equation with isotropic scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Thomas &amp; Stammes 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hubeny &amp; Mihalas 2014</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ dI rad (ν) dτ ν = I rad (ν) − (1 − ν )J rad (ν)− (1 − ν )F star (ν)/4π − ν B(ν)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ν is the photon destruction probability given as a function of absorption and scattering opacity κ abs /(κ scat + κ abs ), B(ν) is the Planck function, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">J rad (ν) = 1 2 1 −1 I rad (ν)dµ F rad (ν) = 2π 1 −1 I rad (ν)µdµ<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The ray directions specified by µ are sampled with a discrete-ordinate method using Gauss-Legendre quadrature (we usually use 16 rays in total).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Chemistry: Gibbs Energy Minimisation</head><p>The Gibbs energy minimisation scheme is one of two chemistry schemes included in the model. Minimisation of the Gibbs energy is a popular method for obtaining chemical equilibrium abundances in atmosphere models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blecic et al. 2015</ref>). This technique does not rely on complicated chemical networks and is therefore much simpler to implement and compute than a chemical kinetics method.</p><p>We follow the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gordon &amp; McBride (1994)</ref>, using the same thermochemical data as <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> in the form of NASA polynomial coefficients ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McBride et al. 1993</ref>). The Gibbs mimimisation method allows for depletion of gas phase species due to condensation, however we do not consider condensation here and this is left for a future study.</p><p>At constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs energy of the system, G, which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">G = I i=1 µ i n i ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where µ i and n i are the chemical potential and number of moles of chemical species i, must be minimised subject to the constraint of elemental conservation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I i=1 a ij n i − b 0 j = 0,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where a ij is the number of atoms of element j per molecule i and b 0 j is the total number of moles of element j in the mixture. This minimisation is performed using the method of Lagrange multipliers.</p><p>We include ∼140 chemical species in total, with 105 of those species being the ones contained in the Venot et al. (2012) chemical network. In addition to those, we include Na, K, Li, Cs and Rb in monatomic form and their important molecular gas-phase species (e.g. NaCl, NaOH,...); which can deplete the abundance of the monatomic forms. Local chemical equilibrium abundances are acheived by minimising the Gibbs energy independently in each model level.</p><p>We benchmark the Gibbs minimisation scheme against the chemical equilibrium analytical formulae of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heng &amp; Tsai (2016)</ref> in Appendix A.2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Chemistry: Chemical Kinetics</head><p>We also include a chemical kinetics scheme which deals directly with chemical reactions. We solve for the chemical steady-state by integrating the continuity equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂n i ∂t = P i − n i L i − ∂Φ i ∂z ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>so that δni δt ∼ 0. Here, P i and L i are the chemical production and chemical loss terms, derived from the system of chemical reactions in the chemical network, and the ∂Φi ∂z term describes vertical mixing.</p><p>The vertical transport flux Φ i is split into two components due to molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion and is Article number, page 3 of 16 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. consistent_chemistry described by (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gladstone et al. 1996</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Φ i = −D i ∂n i ∂z + n i H i + n i (1 + α) T dT dz −K zz ∂n i ∂z + n i H a + n i T dT dz .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where D i and K zz are the molecular and eddy diffusion coefficients, respectively, and H i and H a are the scale heights of each individual species and of the bulk atmosphere, respectively, and α is the thermal diffusion parameter.

Therefore, molecular diffusion becomes important at low pressures (P &lt; 10 −5 bar) in the thermospheric regions of the atmosphere. At higher pressures, vertical transport is dominated by the eddy diffusion term for which the controlling coefficient K zz is far less well constrained, both observationally and theoretically. In previous studies, this term has been estimated using wind velocity fields derived from 3D general circulation models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011</ref>) or parameterised using the advection of passive tracers <ref type="bibr">(Par- mentier et al. 2013</ref>); however if the turbulent diffusion is caused by small scale processes linked to convection, overshooting of the convective region, gravity waves or fingering convection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tremblin et al. 2016</ref>), then care must be taken when deriving this parameter from 3D simulations in which the distinction should be made between the large scale vertical advection linked to the jet circulation and the small scale turbulent diffusion processes that are likely to be unresolved. Other studies treat the K zz parameter as a free model parameter and test a range of plausible values (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Miguel &amp; Kaltenegger 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we choose two plausible values for the K zz parameter and show models for both cases. Values of the K zz parameter for hot Jupiter atmospheres used in other works vary between ∼10 7 -10 12 cm 2 s −1 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Miguel &amp; Kaltenegger 2014</ref>). We take one case roughly in the middle of this range (K zz = 10 9 cm 2 s −1 ) and one towards the upper limit of this range (K zz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 ). We impose zero-flux limits on both the upperand lower-boundaries, assuming that no mass enters the atmosphere at the bottom or escapes the atmosphere at the top. In addition, we chose the value of K zz and maximum pressure level of our model such that the lower boundary will always remain in chemical equilibrium, meaning that our assumption of zero-flux at the lower boundary is valid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The chemical production and loss terms, P i and L i , are calculated from the system of chemical reactions contained within the chemical network employed. In this study, we adopt the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al.

(2012) with hydrocarbon species of up to two carbon atoms, rather than the more recent update which includes higher-order hydrocarbons C 0 -C 6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Venot et al. 2015</ref>). The overall aim of this work is to study the effect of nonequilibrium chemistry on the background atmosphere and it is therefore most important to obtain accurate abundances for the species contributing to the opacity. The inclusion of higher-order hydrocarbons was found not to affect the abundances of the main species (e.g. CH 4 , H 2 O) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Venot et al. 2015</ref>). Therefore we choose to use the smaller and less computationally expensive C 0 -C 2 network.</p><p>We use the LSODE solver 2 (Hindmarsh 1983) using the DLSODES option for stiff system of ordinary differential equations to solve the system of continuity equations simultaneously (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(10)</ref>) for each chemical species using the Backwards Differentiation Formulae method, until at least 10 12 s when the chemistry has reached a steady-state. There are two options to choose the timestep of the chemistry iterations: a customised version which starts with an initial timestep of dt = 10 −10 s which is progressively increased, by 10%, if the maximum relative variations of the molecular abundances do not exceed 10%, or we employ the timestep which is internally generated within the DLSODES routine. We have tested both methods, which give the same results for a given time. Since the timestep generated by DLSODES is typically larger than that using our custom method, we generally use the second option.</p><p>As well as vertical mixing, dissociations of molecules by energetic X-ray and UV (XUV) photons can drive the chemistry away from local chemical equilibrium at low pressures where the flux of these photons is high. The XUV photon flux is calculated as a function of pressure, using the same radiative transfer scheme as described in Section 2.2, accounting for scattering due to H 2 and He. We use the same molecule cross sections and quantum yields as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Fully-Consistent Modelling</head><p>Since the chemical kinetics scheme is consistently coupled with the radiative-convective scheme it allows the nonequilibrium chemical abundances to be solved consistently with the P -T profile. Previous chemical kinetics models of hot Jupiter atmospheres supply the P -T profile as a fixed model input, on which the chemical abundances are calculated (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Line et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kopparapu et al. 2012</ref>). Our approach allows changes in opacity, due to non-equilibrium chemistry, to feedback into the radiative-convective balance and hence maintain a consistent temperature structure.</p><p>Initially, we solve for the P -T profile assuming local chemical equilibrium. That is, we solve for radiativeconvective balance using the Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to re-calculate the abundances on every iteration of the Newton-Raphson solver. Once radiative-convective balance (1) is found, a 1D P -T profile and corresponding abundance profiles of all the chemical species is obtained. To find the P -T profile consistent with non-equilibrium chemistry the model is restarted, switching to the chemical kinetics scheme including vertical mixing and photochemistry. The chemical equilibrium abundances and corresponding P -T profile are used to initialise the model. Note that in the absence of vertical mixing and photochemistry the derived abundances from the Gibbs minimisation scheme and the chemical kinetics scheme agree very well; see <ref type="bibr">Appendix A.2.2 and Venot et al. (2012)</ref>. As the continuity equation (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(10)</ref>) is solved, as outlined above, we periodically solve for the new radiative-convective balance using the up-to-date chemical abundances which may have changed due to vertical mixing and/or photochemical processes. We re-converge to find radiative-convective balance every 10 timesteps of the DLSODES solver; this value was chosen as the chemical abundances do not vary by a large amount within 10 iterations.</p><p>For convergence of the consistent model we use the criteria that the error in the energy flux balance equation (1) is &lt; 10 −4 . For the kinetics calculations we ensure that the maximum relative error of all the chemical species (max(dn i /n i )) is &lt; 10 −4 and the model has reached an integration time of 10 12 s. Overall model convergence is deemed to be reached when both of these criteria are satisifed simultaneously. We tested using a higher tolerance and found that this is a good balance between accuracy and performance. The resulting P -T profile and non-equilibrium chemical abundance profiles are fully consistent with each other. In addition, we also perform a chemical kinetics calculation with the P -T profile held fixed.</p></div>

These atmospheres are well studied both observationally and theoretically. In this work we do not attempt to match the various observations of these atmospheres. Instead we focus on the theoretical implications of non-equilibrium chemistry on both the temperature structure and the emission spectrum.</p><p>We model the pressure range 10 3 to 10 −5 bar with 100 vertical levels; we have tested with both higher and lower vertical resolutions and found that this a good balance between model accuracy (most importantly accurately capturing the location of the quenching point) and computational efficiency.

For both planets we present a series of models with different approaches to the calculation of the chemical abundances. We show models which are consistent with local chemical equilibrium (EQ). We also include non-consistent non-equilibrium (NEQ) models, with chemical abundances derived from chemical kinetics calculations, including the processes of vertical mixing and photochemistry, where we hold the P -T profile fixed.

In chemical equilibrium, H 2 O is more abundant than CO in the deep atmosphere, with CO becoming more abundant than H 2 O at around 10 bar. This transition between the two molecules is removed with the inclusion of vertical mixing, as H 2 O and CO are quenched below the transition, increasing the abundance of H 2 O. The model with the smaller eddy diffusion coefficient shows a smaller increase in both CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and NH 3 as their quench points are both shifted to lower pressures, reducing the quenched abundance. The effect on H 2 O and CO is also much smaller in this model. The temperature change due to non-equilibrium chemistry has a feedback impact on the temperature-dependent chemical abundances. Comparing the chemical abundances between the consistent and non-consistent (CNEQ and NEQ) models we see that for the strong vertical mixing case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">(Fig. 4)</ref> the abundances of CO and CH 4 are essen-  tially reversed, due to an increase in CO and a decrease in CH 4 in the CNEQ model. Similarly, in the NEQ model we find that NH 3 should be the dominant nitrogen species throughout the atmosphere, whereas in the CNEQ model we find that N 2 is the dominant nitrogen species (below 100 bar). The temperature change induces different abundances via two processes. Firstly, the chemistry in the deep atmosphere remains in chemical equilibrium, and as the temperature increases the chemistry reaches a new chemical equilibrium with abundances which are consistent with the new temperature.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10 0 Mole Fraction 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´1<label>10´1 10</label></formula><p>The second effect is caused by a shifting of the quench point. The quench point occurs at the pressure level where the chemical timescale τ chem is equal to the mixing timescale τ mix . Since τ chem is dependent on temperature the quench point is shifted to a lower pressure level, in the case of a warmer atmosphere. This leads to a different quenched mole fraction effecting the quenched abundances for pressures below the quench point. This is complicated by the fact that the mole fractions of individual species have changed in the region of the quench point as they now exist in the new higher temperature chemical equilibrium, due to the first process explained.</p><p>This process also occurs in the model with weaker vertical mixing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5</ref>) but to a smaller degree since the departure from chemical equilibrium and the induced temperature change is less.</p><p>Tests with only photochemistry included (i.e. without vertical mixing) show that the photochemistry has a negligible impact on the P -T profile. Photodissociations become important for pressures below ∼10 −5 bar depending on the temperature and the UV flux. At these pressure levels the optical depth is small and changes in the chemical composition have negligible effect on the temperature structure. It is transport-induced quenching which is effective at higher pressures and higher optical depths which has the potential to alter temperature stucture. However, it may be that photochemical production of chemical species not included in our model, or not included as opacity sources in our model, could contribute to heating at low pressures; for example, ozone in the Earth atmosphere.</p><p>Overall, we find that for our model atmosphere of HD 189733b the process of transport-induced quenching  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Fig. 4</ref>. A comparison of the chemical abundances between the CNEQ model (solid) and the NEQ model (dashed) for the HD 189733b Kzz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 case.  causes temperature increases of up to 100 K between 10 −1 -10 2 bar. This temperature increase, in turn, effects the calculated mole fractions by 1) inducing a new chemical equilibrium consistent with the higher temperature in the deep atmosphere and 2) shifting the quench point (τ chem =τ mix ) to lower pressures and altering the quenched abundances at low pressures; these two processes act simultaneously. For the strong vertical mixing case presented here, this results in an atmosphere where CO is the dominant carbon species for P&lt;10 bar. This contrasts with the non-consistent calculation where CH 4 is expected to be the dominant carbon species throughout the whole atmosphere. A similar process occurs for the N 2 -NH 3 system leading to an N 2 dominated atmosphere in the CNEQ model but an NH 3 dominated atmosphere in the NEQ model.</p><note type="other">Article number, page 6 of 16 Drummond et al.: The Effects of Consistent Chemical Kinetics Calculations in Hot Jupiters</note><formula xml:id="formula_15">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10 0 Mole Fraction 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´1<label>10´1 10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10 0 Mole Fraction 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´1<label>10´1 10</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">HD 209458b</head><p>We now present a series of models for the atmosphere of HD 209458b, which is warmer than the atmosphere of HD 189733b due to its orbit around a warmer G-type star; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. There has been much debate about the presence of a thermal inversion in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, with early observations favouring the presence of an inversion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beaulieu et al. 2010</ref>). However, more recent re-analyses of these datasets suggest that this atmosphere does not contain a temperature inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans et al. 2015</ref>). In this study, we present both cases, as a way to explore a larger diversity of atmosphere types. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> shows the P -T profiles for the two different atmosphere types of HD 209458b. In each case we show P -T profiles for both the EQ and CNEQ chemistry models and with two different strenghs of vertical mixing; K zz = 10 11 and K zz = 10 9 cm 2 s −1 , as in the previous section. For the rest of this analysis, however, we discuss only the K zz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 case, where the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry is larger, and instead focus on the difference between the temperature inversion and non-temperature inversion cases.</p><p>For the case without a temperature inversion there are very small differences between the EQ and CNEQ P -T profiles. For pressures greater than ∼0.1 bar the CNEQ model is marginally warmer than the EQ model; in the isothermal plateau region (1 bar &lt; P &lt; 100 bar) the temperature is about &lt; 10 K warmer. On the other hand, the case with a temperature inversion shows a much greater discrepancy between the EQ and CNEQ models. The CNEQ P -T profile is &gt; 100 K hotter than the EQ P -T profile for pressures greater than 0.1 bar. At lower pressures the CNEQ P -T profile is cooler than the EQ case by a similar amount. Interestingly, the position of the thermal inversion is also shifted to lower pressures. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows the abundances of the major chemical species for the model without a temperature inversion. NH <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and CH 4 are quenched at around 10 and 1 bar respectively.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. The chemical abundances of the major chemical species for the HD 209458b model without a temperature inversion with abundances from the EQ calculation (dashed) and abundances from the CNEQ calculation including vertical mixing and photochemistry (solid); Kzz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 .  This has the effect of increasing their abundances with respect to chemical equilibrium by several orders of magnitude for pressures lower than the quench point. Despite this, their molar fractions do not exceed 1×10 −6 and N 2 and CO remain the dominant nitrogen and carbon species, which are unaffected by vertical mixing processes, and retain constant mixing ratios below 10 bar. The effects of photochemistry can be seen in the very upper regions of the model, particularly by the dissociation of NH 3 at 0.1 mbar and photochemical production of atomic H from 10 mbar. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 10</ref> shows the abundances for the model with a temperature inversion which shows a much greater departure from chemical equilibrium. Though this model contains a hotter upper atmosphere, at depth the atmosphere is actually considerably cooler than the model without a temperature inversion. TiO and VO absorb visible photons at low pressures forming the temperature inversion. However, this reduces the flux of high energy photons which penetrate to depth and heat the lower atmosphere. This reduction of heating at high pressures leads to a cooler deep atmosphere. Due to the temperature dependence of the chemical timescale the quench point is shifted to higher pressures in the temperature inversion model, leading to larger quenched abundances of both CH 4 and NH 3 . The quench points for CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and NH 3 now lie at 10 and 100 bar, respectively. At around 1 mbar, where the temperature begins to increase again, the chemical timescale begins to speed up once more, and the species begin to move back towards their chemical equilibrium state, as seen in previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. 2012</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10 0 Mole Fraction 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´1<label>10´1 10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10 0 Mole Fraction 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´1<label>10´1 10</label></formula><p>The chemical abundances in the CNEQ and NEQ models <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 12)</ref> show important differences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Energy Balance Considerations</head><p>In this section we further investigate the differences resulting from a consistent treatment of calculating nonequilibrium chemical compositions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs. 15 and 16</ref> show the thermal emission spectra of the atmosphere (not divided by F star ) for the HD 189733b models with K zz = 10 11 and 10 9 cm 2 s −1 , respectively. In both cases, the emission is lower at all wavelengths for the NEQ models, compared to both the EQ and CNEQ models. This discrepancy is larger for the model with stronger vertical mixing. By eye, one can already see that the total amount of energy emission of the atmosphere (i.e. the wavelengthintegrated flux) is less in the NEQ model, compared with the EQ and CNEQ models.</p><p>Indeed, this is the case, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Tables 2 and 3</ref> which present the integrated top of atmosphere flux (not including the reflected component) and corresponding blackbody temperatures for both K zz cases and for all chemistry models. In both K zz cases, the integrated flux for the EQ and CNEQ models agree well with each other, conserving the total amount of energy being emitted by the atmosphere. On the other hand, the NEQ models show strongly reduced integrated fluxes. The integrated flux in the NEQ models is ∼38% and ∼11% smaller than the EQ integrated flux for the K zz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 and K zz = 10 9 cm 2 s −1 models, respectively.</p><p>These calculations show that the NEQ models do not conserve energy and the model atmosphere is not in a state   of energy balance. The incoming energy (irradiation and internal heating) has not changed, only the chemical abundance profiles have changed, yet the atmosphere is emitting less energy. However, the CNEQ models do conserve the amount of energy being lost by the atmosphere, as the integrated flux is equivalent to that found for the EQ models.</p><p>To understand this further, we show the pressure level of peak emission (i.e. the photosphere) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figs. 17 and 18</ref> for the 3.6 µm and 8.0 µm Spitzer/IRAC channels, respectively. Here the pressure level of the photosphere is taken as the maximum of the contribution (or weighting) function (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Knutson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Griffith et al. 1998</ref>). In both cases, the pressure level of the photosphere is shifted to lower pres-   sures, and lower temperatures, in the NEQ model. This is a result of increased opacity due transport-induced quenching of CH 4 and NH 3 .</p><p>Since the emission flux is strongly dependent on temperature, the shifting of the photosphere to lower temperatures results in a decreased emission in this wavelength band. Indeed, this occurs not just in this wavelength band but also at other points where CH 4 /NH 3 absorb and is evident in the decreased integrated flux value previously shown for the NEQ models. For the CNEQ model, though the photosphere is shifted to lower pressures the temperature at this lower pressure is increased compared with the EQ/NEQ model. Here we see the P -T profile adapting to maintain radiative-convective equilibrium and energy balance in reaction to the changing chemical composition due to non-equilibrium chemistry.</p><p>The story is very similar for the models of HD 209458b. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figs. 19 and 20</ref> show the top of atmosphere emission spectrum for the HD 209458b models with and without a temperature inversion, respectively, in each case for the EQ, NEQ and CNEQ models. The model without a temperature inversion shows a negligible difference between all three cases. In the temperature inversion model, the NEQ case shows a greater flux at all wavelengths compared with the EQ case. In particular, there is a large increase in flux between 3 and 4 µm, which roughly corresponds to the wavelength of peak emission. Methane dominates the absorption around 3.6 µm, which is increased in abundance by transport-induced quenching. Again, by eye, it is possible to see that the NEQ models do not conserve the wavelength-integrated flux. Indeed, <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 4</ref> shows the integrated flux of the atmosphere and the corresponding blackbody temperature for the temperature inversion models, where the integrated flux for the NEQ calculation is ∼10% greater than the EQ model. On the other hand, the integrated flux for the CNEQ model is in excellent agreement with the EQ model. Likewise, Table 5 shows the same information for the HD 209458b model without a temperature inversion. In this case, the discrepancy between EQ and NEQ is smaller. The EQ and CNEQ models show consistent outgoing fluxes, however, the NEQ model shows a very small ∼1% reduction in integrated flux.</p><p>For the model without a temperature inversion, the NEQ model shows a decreased integrated flux, similar to what was found for HD 189733b. However, the model with a temperature inversion shows an increased integrated flux for the NEQ model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 21</ref> indicates the pressure level of the photosphere in the 3.6 µm Spitzer/IRAC band for the temperature inversion model. Similarly to the HD 189733b model, we see that transport-induced quenching pushes the photosphere to lower pressures by increasing the opacity. In this model   however, where temperature is increasing with decreasing pressure, the photosphere moves to a higher temperature. This explains why we see an increased integrated flux in the NEQ model. However, for the CNEQ model, though the pressure level of the photosphere is still shifted to lower pressures the P -T profile has adapted so that the temperature at this level is now cooler, conserving the integrated flux to that of the EQ model, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>For the model without a temperature inversion, a similar process occurs. However, because temperature decreases with altitude in this model, the new photosphere is both lower in pressure and lower in temperature resulting in a reduced emission flux. Therefore, to compensate, the P -T structure increases in temperature at this pressure level to increase the emission flux once again, and conserve energy balance.</p><p>This understanding allows us to explain why the simulated spectra from our CNEQ models are similar to the EQ model spectra, reducing the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry. Our results show that it is not primarily the changing abundances due to non-equilibrium chemistry which effect the emission spectrum. It is instead the secondary effect of the non-equilibrium abundances shifting the location of the photosphere, by changing the opacity, which effects the calculated spectral flux, as the flux is now originating from a part of the atmosphere with a lower/higher temperature. This non-consistent method does not conserve energy balance in the atmosphere.</p><p>On the other hand, in the self-consistent nonequilibrium chemistry models, though the non-equilibrium abundances do also change the pressure level of the photosphere, the P -T profile adapts, by either heating up or cooling down, to maintain energy balance. Therefore, the resulting spectral flux for the CNEQ model shows a smaller discrepancy with the EQ model. Previous studies using nonconsistent models may have overestimated the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry on the emission spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented results based on a fully-consistent chemical kinetics model applied to the atmospheres of HD 189733b and HD 209458b.</p><p>Our simulations show that in cases of strong disequilibrium chemistry transport-induced quenching of absorbing species can induce changes in the P -T profile of up to 100 K. These temperature shifts can, in turn, have impacts on both the chemical abundances themselves and on the corresponding emission spectra. The chemical abundances are affected via two related processes: firstly, temperature changes at high pressures, where the chemistry remains in chemical equilibrium, induce new chemical equilibrium abundances, and secondly, the change in temperature shifts the quenching point which alters the quenched abundances at lower pressures.</p><p>For instance, in our model of HD 189733b we would conclude that CH 4 is more abundant than CO for the K zz = 10 11 cm 2 s −1 case when not performing the calculation consistently. Instead, in the consistent approach, we find that CO is the most abundant carbon-bearing species. For the model of HD 209458b (with a temperature inversion) we find that the abundances of CH 4 and NH 3 are a factor of ∼5 and ∼3.5 lower in the consistent model compared with the non-consistent model, due to an increase in the temperature by more than 100 K in the deep atmosphere.</p><p>For both HD 189733b and HD 209458b models we find that consistent calculations of non-equilibrium chemistry reduce the overall impact of chemical disequilibrium on the emission spectrum. Our results show that in conventional chemical kinetics models, where the P -T profile is held fixed, the dominant mechanism for non-equilibrium chemistry to affect the emission spectrum is by changing the pressure level, and temperature, of the photosphere. The strong dependence of the emission flux on temperature will result in a very different simulated emission spectrum.</p><p>However, in our consistent model the P -T profile adapts to the new non-equilibrium chemical composition and to retain energy balance in the model atmosphere. The consequent temperature changes mitigate the effect of changing the location of the photosphere by either heating up or cooling down at the location of the new photosphere to preserve energy balance.</p><p>Based on these results, we urge caution when assessing the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry (transportinduced quenching and photochemistry) on the emission spectrum. Not including consistency between the chemical abundances and the temperature structure can lead to overestimates of the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry. This work has only consisdered 1D (vertical) effects of non-equilibrium chemistry. Horizontal advection is expected to be very important in the atmospheres of tidallylocked exoplanets which possess very strong zonal wind velocities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mayne et al. 2014</ref>). In addition, these atmospheres can possess very large day-night temperature contrasts leading to large contrasts in horizontal chemical equilibrium abundances( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kataria et al. 2016)</ref>. Disequilibrium chemistry has already been suggested as a possible explanation to explain the discrepencies between the observed and model emission phase curves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zellem et al. 2014</ref>). However, this work has shown that when performed consistently, transport-induced quenching has a smaller impact on the emission spectrum than previous studies suggest. It would therefore be very interesting and timely to study the process considered here including horizontal advection, by coupling a chemical kinetics scheme consistently to a 3D GCM.   abundances of CO, H 2 O, CH 4 , NH 3 , N 2 and HCN derived using the Gibbs energy minimisation scheme and the two analytical methods for T = 1000 K and 2000 K isothermal profiles, respectively; note that HCN is not included in the Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999) scheme. Our Gibbs minimisation scheme agrees very well with the analytical formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heng &amp; Tsai (2016)</ref> for both temperature profiles. The agreement with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref> formula is also very good. At low pressures in the T = 2000 K model the Gibbs minimisation abundances deviate at low pressures due to molecular hydrogen dissociation which is not included in the analytical formula.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">10´1010´10 10´910´9 10´810´8 10´710´7 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 nX/nH 2 10´610´6 10´510´5 10´410´4 10´310´3 10´210´2 10´110´1 10</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A.2.2: Chemical Kinetics Scheme</head><p>In this section we test the chemical kinetics scheme implemented in our model.  Firstly we test our chemical kinetics scheme in isolation (i.e. only calculation of the chemical rates) using a 0D (box) model by reproducing the chemical evolution plots of Venot et al. (2012) (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">figure 2)</ref> for H, OH, NNH and C 2 H 6 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Fig. A.4)</ref>. The evolution and final abundances of these species are, by eye, identical, validating the implementation of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> chemical network in our model. Secondly, we reproduce the 1D chemical abundances profiles for HD 209458b included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> using the same model inputs; pressure-temperature profile, chemical network, UV spectrum and eddy diffusion coefficient profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> used the same model inputs as <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. (2011)</ref>, and compared the two different chemical networks. This allows us to compare with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref>, whose chemical network we use here, testing only differences in the model implementation, and also with Moses et al. (2011), who use both a different model and a different chemical network. The primary difference between the ATMO scheme and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> is the calculation of the UV flux. We calculate the UV flux as a function of pressure using the radiative transfer scheme as decribed in Section 2.2, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> use the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Isaksen et al. (1977)</ref>, which has a more simple treatment of scattering. <ref type="figure">Fig. A</ref>.5 shows the chemical abundances calculated with ATMO, abundances calculated from the chemical kinetics scheme including vertical mixing and photochemistry. Overall, there is a very good agreement between our model and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref>. In the deep atmosphere we retain chemical equilibrium, due to the very fast chemical timescale due to high pressures and temperatures. The abundances also agree very well in the middle regions of the atmosphere, with accurate reproductions of the methane and ammonia quenching points.</p><p>There are, however, some disagreements for the abundances at low pressures. As noted previously, one of the most important differences between our model and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> is the calculation of the UV flux. In particular, we find a production of methane at low pressures, when photochemistry is included, which is not seen in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref>  radiative-transfer method (?), taking into account multiplescattering by H 2 and He. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> note that abundances at low pressures are sensitive to the treatment of Rayleigh scattering.</p><p>In summary, our Gibbs minimisation scheme and chemical kinetics scheme, using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> chemical network, agree very well for chemical equilibrium. Our chemical equilibrium results agree well with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. (2011)</ref>, and with the analytical formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref>. We also find a reasonably good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venot et al. (2012)</ref> when including vertical mixing and photochemistry, reproducing the quench points of the various species well. However, we find some discrepencies at low pressures where photochemistry is important, which we attribute to differences in the calculation of the UV flux. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3</head><label></label><figDesc>http://kurucz.harvard.edu/stars.html</figDesc></figure>

the solar spectrum, as in Venot et al. (2012), where the solar 
XUV spectrum is scaled to the temperature and radius of 
HD 209458 with a scaling factor of (R star /R o ) 2 (T star /T o ) 4

was used in range 115-230 nm, the solar UV flux for wave-
lengths below this range, and the solar flux divided by ten 
for longer wavelengths.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: Model Testing</head><p>In this appendix section we perform several comparisons with previously published works to benchmark both the radiative-convective and the chemistry modules of ATMO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A.1: Radiative-Convective Scheme</head><p>In this section we examine the radiative-convective equilibrium component of ATMO by reproducing the P -T profiles of <ref type="bibr">Iro et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barman et al. (2005)</ref> (hereafter I05 and B05) for HD 209458b <ref type="figure">(Fig. A.1</ref>). In both cases we match the planetary parameters (i.e. internal temperature, gravity etc.) as closely as possible to those used in the original studies. Remaining differences between our model and those of I05 and B05 stem from different opacity sources, the stellar irradiation spectrum, and the radiative-transfer and chemistry schemes.</p><p>I05 models an atmoshere with an internal temperature, T int , of 100 K and 300 K and a planet-wide heat redistrubtion parameter; i.e. with an incident flux reduction factor of α = 0.25 which accounts for emission from both the dayside and nightside of the planet.</p><p>Generally our P -T profile agrees very well with that of I05, though our model is ∼100K warmer throughout most of the modeled pressure range. This very likely stems from the different stellar irradiation used in the two models. I05 use a solar irradiation in their model, however we use the Kurucz simulated spectrum of HD 209458 which is several hundred Kelvin hotter than the Sun. Differences also likely stem from the treatment and source of opacities.</p><p>We also compare with the α = 0.25 model of B05. Note that we adjusted the internal temperature parameter until the profiles reached the same adiabat at depth since we do not know the exact value of T int used in the B05 model. We found that T int =380 K matched the B05 profile well. We find that the ATMO profile is consistently lower in temperature with a maximum discrepancy at ∼0.1 bar. Aside from the differences in opacity sources (we use more up-to-date sources with increased infrared opacity) between our model and the B05 model, the calculation of equilibrium chemistry is significantly different. B05 account for the 'rainout' process whereby condensation of species removes material from the gas-phase, depleting the elemental abundance of those species at lower pressures. We do not include this process in ATMO, potentially leading to differences in chemical composition and hence opacity.</p><p>The ATMO models of HD 209458b are bracketed by those of I05 and B05. There are significant differences in the opacity sources, irradiation, chemical and radiative schemes between all three models. Considering these significant differences, the three models generally agree on the qualitative temperature structure, with quantitative differences which should be expected due to the differences in model inputs and schemes.</p></div>
