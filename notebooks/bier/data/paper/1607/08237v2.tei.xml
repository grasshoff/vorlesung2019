				<p>The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of exoplanets and revolutionized our understanding of their population. This large, homogeneous catalog of discoveries has enabled rigorous studies of the occurrence rate of exoplanets and planetary systems as a function of their physical properties. However, transit surveys like Kepler are most sensitive to planets with orbital periods much shorter than the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn, the most massive planets in our Solar System. To address this deficiency, we perform a fully automated search for long-period exoplanets with only one or two transits in the archival Kepler light curves. When applied to the ∼ 40, 000 brightest Sun-like target stars, this search produces 16 long-period exoplanet candidates. Of these candidates, 6 are novel discoveries and 5 are in systems with inner short-period transiting planets. Since our method involves no human intervention, we empirically characterize the detection efficiency of our search. Based on these results, we measure the average occurrence rate of exoplanets smaller than Jupiter with orbital periods in the range 2-25 years to be 2.0 ± 0.7 planets per Sun-like star.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Data from the Kepler Mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>) have been used to discover thousands of transiting exoplanets. The systematic nature of these discoveries and careful quantification of survey selection effects, search completeness, and catalog reliability has enabled many diverse studies of the detailed frequency and distribution of exoplanets (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mulders et al. 2015</ref>). So far, these results have been limited to relatively short orbital periods because existing transit search methods impose the requirement of the detection of at least three transits within the baseline of the data. For Kepler, with a baseline of about four years, this sets an absolute upper limit of about two years on the range of detectable periods. In the Solar System, Jupiter -with a period of 12 years -dominates the planetary dynamics and, since it would only exhibit at most one transit in the Kepler data, an exo-Jupiter would be missed by most existing transit search procedures.</p><p>Before the launch of the Kepler Mission, it was predicted that the nominal mission would discover at least 10 exoplanets with only one or two observed transits <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yee &amp; Gaudi 2008</ref>), yet subsequent searches for these signals have already been more fruitful than expected ( <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Uehara et al. 2016)</ref>. However, the systematic study of the population of long-period exoplanets found in the Kepler data to date has been hampered due to the substantial technical challenge of implementing a search, as well as the subtleties involved in interpreting the results. For example, false alarms in the form of uncorrected systematics in the data and background eclipsing binaries can make single-transit detections ambiguous.</p><p>Any single transit events discovered in the Kepler light curves are interesting in their own right, but the development of a general and systematic method for the discovery of planets with orbital periods longer than the survey baseline is also crucial for the future of exoplanet research with the transit method. All future transit surveys have shorter observational baselines than the Kepler Mission (K2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howell et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">TESS, Ricker et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">PLATO, Rauer et al. 2014</ref>) and given suitable techniques, single transit events will be plentiful and easily discovered. The methodological framework presented in the following pages is a candidate for this task.</p><p>A study of the population of long-period transiting planets complements other planet detection and characterization techniques, such as radial velocity (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Knutson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryan et al. 2016</ref>), microlensing (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cassan et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Shvartzvald et al. 2016</ref>), direct imaging (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowler 2016)</ref>, and transmission spectroscopy (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dalba et al. 2015</ref>). The marriage of the radial velocity and transit techniques is particularly powerful as exoplanets with both mass and radius measurements can be used to study planetary compositions and the formation of planetary systems (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rogers 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wolfgang et al. 2016</ref>). Unfortunately the existing catalog of exoplanets with measured densities is sparsely populated at long orbital periods; this makes discoveries with the transit method at long orbital period compelling targets for follow-up observations. Furthermore, even at long orbital periods, the Kepler light curves should be sensitive to planets at the detection limits of the current state-of-the-art radial velocity surveys.</p><p>There are two main technical barriers to a systematic search for single transit events. The first is that the transit probability for long-period planets is very low; scaling as ∝ P −5/3 for orbital periods P longer than the baseline of contiguous observations. Therefore, even if long-period planets are intrinsically common, they will be underrepresented in a transiting sample. The second challenge is that there are many signals in the observed light curves caused by stochastic processes -both instrumental and astrophysical -that can masquerade as transits. Even when the most sophisticated methods for removing this variability are used, false signals far outnumber the true transit events in any traditional search.</p><p>At the heart of all periodic transit search procedures is a filtering step based on "box least squares" (BLS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref>. This step produces a list of candidate transit times that is then vetted to remove the substantial fraction of false signals using some combination of automated heuristics and expert curation. In practice, the fraction of false signals can be substantially reduced by requiring that at least three self-consistent transits be observed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rowe et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coughlin et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Relaxing the requirement of three transits requires a higher signal-to-noise threshold per transit for validating candidate planets that display only one to two transits. Higher signal-to-noise allows matching the candidate transit to the expected shape of a limbdarkened light curve, as well as ruling out various false alarms. This is analagous to microlensing surveys, for which a planet can only be detected once, thus requiring high signal-to-noise for a reliable detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gould et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Recent work has yielded discoveries of long-period transiting planets with only one or two high signal-to-noise transits identified in archival Kepler and K2 light curves by visual inspection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wang et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kipping et al. 2014b</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Osborn et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kipping et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Uehara et al. 2016</ref>). These discoveries have already yielded some tantalizing insight into the population of long-period transiting planets but, since these previous results rely on human interaction, it is prohibitively expensive to reliably measure the completeness of these catalogs. As a result, the existing catalogs of long-period transiting planets cannot be used to rigorously constrain the occurrence rate of long-period planets.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a systematic method for reliably discovering the transits of large, long-period companions in photometric time series without human intervention. The method is similar in character to the recently published fully automated method used to generate the official DR24 exoplanet candidate catalog from <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Mullally et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>). Since the search methodology is fully automated, we can robustly measure the search completeness -using injection and recovery tests -and use these products to place probabilistic constraints on the occurrence rate of long-period planets. We apply this method to a subset of the archival data from the Kepler Mission, present a catalog of exoplanet candidates, and estimate the occurrence rate of long-period exoplanets. We finish by discussing the potential effects of false positives, evaluating the prospects for follow-up, and comparing our results to other studies based on different planet discovery methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A FULLY AUTOMATED SEARCH METHOD</head><p>To find long-period exoplanets in the Kepler light curves, we search for individual, high signal-to-noise transit signals using a fully automated procedure that can be broken into three main steps:</p><p>1. an initial candidate search using a box-shaped matched filter, 2. light curve-level vetting (using automated model comparison) to remove signals that don't have a convincing transit shape, and</p><p>3. pixel-level vetting to remove some astrophysical false positives.</p><p>The following sections describe each of these steps in more detail. The model comparison step (step 2) is the key component of our method that enables robust automation but it is also computationally expensive because we must estimate the marginalized likelihoods of several different models describing a transit and other processes that "look" like transits but are actually caused by noise. This step is conservative: unless a signal is a very convincing transit, it won't pass the test. In practice, this means that all but the highest signal-to-noise events will be rejected at this step. Therefore, in the inexpensive first step -the initial candidate search -we can restrict the candidate list to high signal-to-noise events without a substantial loss in detection efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Step 1 -Initial candidate events</head><p>It is not computationally feasible to run a full model comparison at every conceivable transit time in the light curve so we must first find potentially interesting events. For our purposes, "interesting" means high signal-to-noise and previously unknown.</p><p>To generate this list, we use a method much like the standard "box least squares" (BLS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref> procedure with a single (non-periodic) box. After masking any known transits, we filter the PDC light curves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Stumpe et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Smith et al. 2012</ref>) using a running windowed median with a half-width of 2 days to remove stellar variability. We then compute the signal-to-noise of the depth of a 0.6 day-long top hat on a grid of times spanning the full baseline of observations.</p><p>In detail, at each proposal time t 0 , we hypothesize a box-shaped transit with duration τ</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m(t) =    µ − δ, if |t − t 0 | &lt; τ /2 µ, otherwise .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Assuming that the uncertainties on the observed fluxes f (t) are Gaussian with known variance σ f 2 , the likelihood function for the mean flux µ and transit depth δ can be analytically computed to be a two-dimensional Gaussian with mean and covariance given by linear least-squares. This likelihood function provides a natural scalar objective: the signal-to-noise of the measured depth computed as a function of time. In principle this scalar is also a function of duration but we only use a single transit duration because the following steps in this procedure are only sensitive to transits with very high signal-to-noise, and in practice, the final results are insensitive to the specific choice of duration.</p><p>To avoid edge effects, we apodize this detection scalar near any large gaps in the time series using a logistic function with width equal to one transit duration. Finally, we estimate the background noise level in the detection scalar time series using a robust running windowed variance estimate of the detection scalar. We accept peaks that are more than 25-times this background noise level as candidates.</p><p>For the Kepler light curves, this procedure yields at least one candidate event in about 1 percent of targets. For these targets, we investigate the three highest signal-to-noise events in the following step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Step 2 -Light curve vetting</head><p>In this step of the method, the goal is to discard any signals that are not sufficiently "transit-like" in shape. This step is similar to the method independently developed and recently published by the Kepler team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mullally et al. 2016</ref>). To quantify the quality of a candidate, we perform a model comparison between a physical transit model and a set of other parameterized models for systematics. In order for a candidate to pass this vetting step, the transit model must be "preferred" to any other model as measured using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The BIC is not the optimal choice for this model comparison, but it is more computationally tractable than the alternatives, such as computing thousands of precise marginalized likelihoods or expected utilities for each model. The BIC can be efficiently computed and it exhibits the desired behavior -decreasing with increasing likelihood but flexible models are penalized -and we find that it performs sufficiently well in practice.</p><p>For up to three candidate transit times per light curve, we select a contiguous chunk of PDC light curve approximately centered on the proposed transit with no more than 500 cadences (about 10 days) and compute the BIC of each model for this data set. The BIC for a model k in the set of K models is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BIC k = −2 ln L * + J ln N (2)</formula><p>where the likelihood function L is evaluated at its maximum, J is the number of free parameters in the model, and N is the number of data points in the data set. For each model, we describe the data using a Gaussian Process (GP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rasmussen &amp; Williams 2006</ref>) with a Matérn-3/2 covariance and mean given by the chosen model m k (t; θ) parameterized by the parameter vector θ.</p><p>We consider the following mean models (this list provides a qualitative justification for each model):</p><p>• transit -a limb-darkened, exposure-time integrated transit light curve,</p><p>• variability -a pure GP model to capture stellar variability,</p><p>• outlier -a single outlier to account for a bad data point,</p><p>• step -a step function to describe sudden pixel sensitivity dropouts (SPSDs; for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Christiansen et al. 2013</ref>), and</p><p>• box -a box to catch signals that are well fit by the search scalar but insufficiently transit-like to be convincing.</p><p>The functional forms of these models are given in Appendix A and the details of the technical methodology of GP fitting are described in Appendix B. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows representative events that fall into different classes and the corresponding maximum likelihood model. For each candidate event, the BIC of each of these models is computed and the event is only passed as a candidate if the transit model is preferred to all the other models. The box model is the most restrictive comparison, vetoing about half of the candidate events in the Kepler light curves, followed by the variability model. To further restrict to non-grazing transits, we also reject events where the maximum likelihood impact parameter is greater than 1 − R P /R . Since the search procedure described here was tuned to discover transit signals, we do not consider the distribution or potential astrophysical nature of any models besides the transit model. In the future, it would be interesting to relax this goal and investigate the other model classes; in particular, the box model is sensitive to astrophysical phenomena, notably occultations of white dwarfs. In a cursory investigation it is clear that the majority of signals labeled box in our analysis are noise; however, a subset are likely to be astrophysical in nature.</p><p>The reliability of this method of automated vetting is limited by the specific models selected in this step. We find that these are sufficient for the targets discussed below but different target lists or data sets might require additional models to be included for robust selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Step 3 -Pixel-level vetting</head><p>To minimize contamination from background eclipsing binary systems, we require candidate events to pass a centroid shift test similar to the one used in the official Kepler transit search pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>). To measure the centroid shift, we model the flux-weighted centroid traces independently in each coordinate as a multiple of the best-fit transit model and a GP noise model. By properly normalizing the transit model, we measure the in-transit centroid shift ∆ centroid in pixels. We reject any candidate event where the estimated transit location is more than half a pixel from the out-of-transit centroid</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆ centroid 1 δ − 1 &gt; 0.5 (3)</formula><p>where δ is the observed transit depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS: A CATALOG OF LONG-PERIOD TRANSITING EXOPLANET CANDIDATES</head><p>To limit the scope of this paper while still demonstrating the applicability of our method, we search the Kepler archival light curves of the brightest and quietest Sun-like stars for long-period transiting exoplanets. In this section, we describe the target selection process and the parameter estimation procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Target selection</head><p>We select the ∼ 40, 000 brightest and quietest G and K dwarfs from the Kepler catalog using the most recent catalog of stellar parameters 1 and the cuts used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al.

The final catalog contains 39,036 targets and the parameter distribution is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Since these data have already been searched for short-period planets, we assume that all high signal-to-noise candidates with three or more transits have been previously found ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Parameter estimation</head><p>For each transit candidate, we constrain the physical parameters of the system by fitting a section of light curve around each transit using an exposure-time integrated Keplerian orbit with a quadratic limb darkening law for the central body . It has previously been established that the orbital period of a transiting planet with only one transit can still be constrained given a measurement of the stellar density and an assumption about the orbital eccentricity (for example <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Osborn et al. 2016)</ref>. Qualitatively this works because the transit of a bound body cannot have an arbitrary period for a given duration. This is the same argument used to justify the "photoeccentric effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dawson &amp; Johnson 2012)</ref> and the method of "asterodensity profiling" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kipping et al. 2014a</ref>). In particular, this suggests that the periods of single transits in systems with multiple inner planets will be especially well constrained ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kipping et al. 2012)</ref>. In this paper, we do not take advantage of the extra constraints provided by the inner planets, instead treating each long-period transiting system in isolation, but this would be a good follow-up project.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we describe the components of the probabilistic model used to infer the planet candidates' properties. To perform parameter estimation under this model, we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package emcee 4 (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mackey et al. 2013</ref>) with an ensemble of 40 walkers. We run each chain until at least 750 independent samples -in most cases, we actually produce thousands of independent samples -are obtained <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and discard the first third of the chain as burn-in.

This difference cannot be accounted for by differences in completeness between targets with known planets and without because the average detection efficiency for both populations is consistent within sampling uncertainty.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EMPIRICAL SEARCH COMPLETENESS</head><p>To measure the completeness of the search procedure described in Section 2, we exploit the fact that transit signals are sparse and rare. Therefore, most light curves contain no transits and we can reliably measure the recovery rate of our method on synthetic transit signals -with known properties -injected into real light curves. This procedure is standard practice in the transit literature and it has been used to determine the completeness of the KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Christiansen et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Christiansen et al. , 2015</ref>) and other independent transit searches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>To reliably capture the full structure of the search completeness function, the simulations must sample the (high-dimensional) space of all properties that affect the probability of detecting a transit: the stellar properties (including variability amplitudes and time scales), the planet's physical properties and orbital elements, and any observational effects (noise, spacecraft pointing variations, etc.). For the modest goals of this paper, we only need a robust constraint on the transit detection efficiency integrated across the target sample but, even so, many simulations per star are required.</p><p>The procedure for measuring the recovery rate of simulated transits is as follows:</p><p>1. First, a star is randomly selected from the target list, and the PDC light curve and stellar properties for that star are loaded.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> with phase uniformly distributed across the baseline of observations. These properties are re-sampled until the transit is visible in at least one non-flagged cadence.</p><p>3. The transit signal induced by this planet is computed and multiplied into the PDC light curve.</p><p>4. The transit search method described in Section 2 -including de-trending and all automated vetting -is applied to this light curve with the injected transit signal.</p><p>5. This candidate is flagged as recovered if at least one transit within one transit duration passes all the cuts imposed by the automated vetting.</p><p>The fraction of recovered simulations as a function of the relevant parameters gives an estimate of the probability of detecting an exoplanet transit with a given set of parameters, conditioned on the fact that it transits the star during a time when the star was being observed by Kepler. We will call this function Q det,k (w) where w is the set of all parameters affecting the transit detectability and k is an index running over target stars. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the fraction of recovered simulations as a function of planet radius and orbital period based on 819,752 injected signals. This figure shows the transit detection efficiency falling with decreasing planet radius. This is the expected behavior because the depth (and signal strength) of a transit scales with the area ratio between the planet and the star. There is also a slight decrease in the completeness to larger planet radius. This trend is introduced in steps 2 and 3 of the search procedure where the tuning parameters were chosen to maximize the yield of convincing small transit discoveries. The decreasing completeness with orbital period is less intuitive because, on average, the signal strength should increase as the duration of the transit increases. In this case, this simplistic treatment misses two important factors. First, in step 1 of the search procedure (Section 2.1) only a single transit duration is used and second, longer transits are less easily distinguished from stellar variability and they will, therefore, be discarded in the conservative light curve vetting step (Section 2.2).  This detection efficiency must then be combined with the geometric transit probability function and the window function. For the star k, the geometric transit probability is given by (Winn 2010)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q geom,k (w) = R ,k + R a k 1 + e sin ω 1 − e 2<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">= 4 π 2 G M ,k 1/3 1 + e sin ω 1 − e 2 (R ,k + R) P −2/3<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where R is the planet radius, P is the orbital period, e is the orbital eccentricity, ω is the argument of periastron, R ,k is the radius of star k, and M ,k is the star's mass. All of these parameters are included in w.</p><p>In Equation (4), the term (R ,k + R) takes grazing transits into account. This might seem counter intuitive because, as part of the search procedure, we rejected candidates where the maximum likelihood model had a grazing transit. However, since the measurement of Q det,k included a cut on the measured impact parameter, the Q det,k term already takes this effect into account. In other words, Q det,k quantifies the probability that a transit of a given shape will be detected given that it transits at all and Q geom,k -the way it is written in Equation (4) -is the marginalized probability that the system will transit given its physical parameters.</p><p>Approximating the window function using a binomial probability of observing at least one transit, we find (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burke &amp; McCullough 2014</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q win,k (w) =    1 − (1 − f duty,k ) T k /P if P ≤ T k T k f duty,k /P otherwise (6)</formula><p>where f duty,k is the duty cycle and T k is the full observation baseline for target k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">THE OCCURRENCE RATE OF LONG-PERIOD EXOPLANETS</head><p>Using the catalog of exoplanet discoveries (Section 4) and the measurement of the search completeness (Section 5), we can now estimate the occurrence rate of long-period exoplanets. To simplify the analysis, we will make the strong assumption that none of the candidates are astrophysical false positives (the eclipse or occultation of a stellar mass companion, around either the target star or a faint background star). We revisit this assumption and discuss its validity in the following section. As a further simplification, we also neglect the measurement uncertainties on the planet  parameters (including orbital period). This assumption is justified because we are only making high-level measurements of the mean occurrence rate in bins larger than the uncertainties. Assuming a Poisson likelihood, the occurrence rate density in a volume V -defined as P min ≤ P &lt; P max and R min ≤ R &lt; R max -is (see, for example, the Appendix of Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Γ V ≡ d 2 N d ln P d ln R = C(P min , P max ; R min , R max ) Z(P min , P max ; R min , R max )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where N is the expected number of planets per G/K dwarf, C(· · · ) is the number of detected planets in the volume, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Z(P min , P max ; R min , R max ) = K k=1 p(w {P, R} ) Q k (w) 1[P, R ∈ V ] dw<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where p(w {P, R} ) is the prior distribution of all the parameters except the period and radius and 1 <ref type="bibr">[·]</ref> is 1 if the argument is satisfied and 0 otherwise. Using the J injections  sampled uniformly in period and radius and other parameters from p(w {P, R} ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Z(P min , P max ; R min , R max ) ≈ K V J J j=1 Q k j (w (j) )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where the sum is over all injections in the volume V . Using the injection results from Section 5 and the catalog of discoveries from Section 4, we compute the occurrence rate in the period range 2 to 25 years and in two radius bins between 0.1 and 1.0 R J . The calculated occurrence rates are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>. Integrating the two bin model in this range, we find an expected occurrence rate of N 0.1 R J −1 R J , 2 yr−25 yr = 2.00 ± 0.72 planets <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> per G/K dwarf with radii in the range 0.1 R J −1 R J and periods in the range 2 yr−25 yr. This result is qualitatively consistent with the Solar System where there is one planetJupiter -in this parameter range and Saturn is just outside the range with an orbital period of 29 years. In Section 8, we compare with similar occurrence rate estimates from the literature.</p><p>The occurrence rates given here should be interpreted with a few caveats in mind. First, when we inferred the periods of the planets with only one transit, we assumed that the period was long enough that no other transit occurred during the Kepler lifetime. This neglects the small but non-negligible posterior probability -less than one percent for the typical candidate -that a second transit might have occurred in a data gap. All of the candidates in our catalog are consistent with having periods this long but the geometric transit probability decreases quickly with orbital period. For the Foreman-Mackey, Morton, Hogg, et al.  The rate density is given by Equation (12) and the value in parentheses is computed assuming one candidate is a false positive (Equation 17). b The integrated rate is computed by integrating the rate density over the bin.</p><p>Note that the first two rows do not sum to the last row because each row is computed assuming that the rate density is uniform across the bin.</p><p>Note-These values are computed in the period range 2-25 years.</p><p>purposes of this paper, we neglect this effect because its rigorous treatment is subtle, but comment that this would only ever decrease the occurrence rate estimate. Second, we assume that each planet candidate transits the star that is characterized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huber et al. (2014)</ref>; we assert that each planet does not transit a fainter companion star or a background star. If the planet does transit a companion star, then the companion star must be fainter, and hence denser, causing the period to be underestimated. If the planet transits a background star, it is more likely to be a giant star due to Malmquist bias, hence the density of the star and period of the planet would be overestimated. Either of these scenarios has a small probability, so we expect that our population estimates will stand, while the parameter estimates for individual candidates should be taken as provisional until more detailed follow-up is carried out, including high-contrast imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and parallax measurements. Third, we assume that the <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huber et al. (2014)</ref> parameters are accurate for each star that is transited by a planet candidate, and that each transit is unaffected by blending. Malmquist bias, Eddington bias, and metallicity bias may affect the stellar parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaidos &amp; Mann 2012)</ref>, and so we again caution that the individual parameter estimates should be taken as provisional until more detailed follow-up is completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">ASTROPHYSICAL FALSE POSITIVES</head><p>Various configurations of eclipsing binary stars can mimic the signal of a transiting planet. However, the occurrence rate calculation presented in the preceding section assumes no astrophysical false positives among the candidates identified in this work. In this Section we explore the validity of this assumption.</p><p>While an eclipsing binary (EB) typically produces a photometric dip much deeper than a transiting planet, the depth of the signal may be comparable to that of a planet if the eclipse is grazing, or if the EB only comprises a small fraction of the total light in the photometric aperture -a so-called blended eclipsing binary (BEB). Additionally, if a binary star has an eccentric orbit, it may be oriented so as to present only a secondary occultation and not a primary eclipse, causing a shallow and potentially flat-bottomed photometric dip without an accompanying tell-tale deep primary signal.</p><p>To determine to what extent the catalog of detections presented in this work may contain such false positives, we simulate populations of detected signals to predict how many we should expect. To accomplish this, we use the Python package exosyspop , which we developed for this purpose and utilizes the isochrones, vespa, and batman packages (Morton 2015a,b; Kreidberg 2015) for simulations of stellar populations and their eclipses.</p><p>With exosyspop one can define the parameters of a population model and generate synthetic catalogs according to the model (and the parameters of a survey) very efficiently. For example, a population of EBs may be defined by a binary fraction, power-law distributions in mass ratio and period (within given bounds), and a beta distribution for eccentricity. This population, initialized with a catalog of target stars (each of which has a duty cycle and total span of observation), may then be "observed," returning a catalog of objects detectable via either primary or secondary eclipse (according to randomly oriented orbital geometries and accounting for observation duty cycle and data span). This synthetic catalog includes signal-to-noise estimates of both the primary and secondary eclipses, the number of detected primary and secondary eclipses, and the trapezoidal shape parameters of each detection (depth, duration, and ingress-to-duration ratio, as defined in Morton 2012).</p><p>In order to predict how many EBs or BEBs we might expect to detect in this particular search of Kepler data, we first need to choose reasonable parameters for the binary star population. To do this, we calibrate the population parameters using the catalog of detected Kepler eclipsing binaries. We find that a binary fraction of 25% between periods of 20 days and 25 years with a log-flat period distribution and eccentrities distributed according to β(0.8, 2.0) is able to reproduce well both the number and period distribution of observed Kepler EBs between 20 and 1000 days. We thus fix these binary star population parameters for our subsequent EB and BEB simulations.</p><p>To simulate synthetic populations of EB detections, we assign binary stars to the Kepler target list described in Section 3.1 according to the above EB population parameters. We consider an EB to be detected if it presents fewer than three eclipses (either primary or secondary, but not both), if the signal-to-noise ratio is &gt;15, and the duration of the detected eclipse is &lt;2.5 d. In 100 realizations of these synthetic observations, we see 7.2 ± 2.5 single-or double-eclipsing EB signals.</p><p>To simulate BEBs, we assume an exponentially varying background field star density across the Kepler field, from 0.005 arcsec −2 at a Galactic latitude b = 20 to 0.05 arcsec −2 at b = 5 (matching up well with the simulations of Morton &amp; Johnson (2011) at many different Galactic latitudes). Each Kepler target star is then assigned a number of background stars drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean given by the expected number of stars to be found within a circle of 4 arcsec radius, given the appropriate density at its Galactic lattitude. We draw the specific background stars from a TRILEGAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Girardi et al. 2005</ref>) field star simulation toward the center of the Kepler field. Binary companions are then assigned to these background stars according to the same stellar binary population distribution as the EB population above, and synthetic detected populations are "observed" according to the same rules (accounting appropriately for the diluted eclipse depths in the Kepler bandpass). In 100 synthetic observations, we see an average of only 0.41 detected BEBs.</p><p>These prediction results suggest that we should indeed expect to see some astrophysical false positives in our search. However, this does not mean that we should fear that ∼7 of the planet candidates might be EBs. In particular, we note that these simulations do not include the full vetting procedure described in Section 4, and it is likely that the three impact-parameter-rejected candidates are EBs and that the centroid-rejected candidate is a BEB. Thus, we might expect maybe two or three additional false positives among our planet candidates.</p><p>In order to more precisely quantify which of the candidates might indeed be false positives, we can inspect the synthetic observation simulations in more detail. In particular, we can analyze the shape distribution of the different scenarios and compare them with the observed shapes of the actual Kepler detections in order to quantify the probability that each of them may be a false positive. These distributions and the observed shape parameters are plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>Following the method of Morton (2012) used to compute false positive probabilities for the regular <ref type="bibr">Kepler KOI catalogs (Morton et al. 2016</ref>), we can calculate the posterior probability for each of our candidates to belong to each of the three scenarios we consider (EB, BEB, or planet) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Pr i = π i L i j π j L j ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where the π factors are the hypothesis priors, L are the hypothesis likelihoods, and the sum over j is over all the hypotheses. In this case, we determine the relative hypothesis priors from the synthetic observations, using the mean numbers of "observed" EBs (7.2) and BEBs (0.4), and choosing the expected number of planets to be 12. We calculate the hypothesis likelihoods using the depth/duration distributions of synthetic populations of each scenario and evaluating these distributions at the observed depths and durations of each candidate signal. To estimate the expected shape distribution of the planet scenario, we define a custom exosyspop population of planets according to the two-bin population model described by the median posterior values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> and generate a population of 1000 detected signals. We list the probability that each candidate is a planet in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We find that the two deepest signals in our candidate catalog (9306307 and 10602068) are very likely to be EBs, though we note that this result may be dominated by the fact that our planet population is fixed to have a maximum radius of 1 R J . Most of the rest of the candidates have false positive probabilities below 10%. We do note that as discussed in Section 4, 4754460 (for which we calculate a 5% false positive probability) does show a partial deep eclipse right at the end of the Kepler data that indicates that it is most likely an EB. Apart from this, the expected number of false positives among the candidates with R &lt; R J , according to these calculations, is about one.</p><p>In light of this result, we demonstrate the sensitivity of our measured occurrence rates on contamination by computing a second constraint on Γ V for each volume with one candidate removed. In this case, Equation (12) would be replaced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">˜ Γ V ≡ C(P min , P max ; R min , R max ) − 1 Z(P min , P max ; R min , R max ) .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>These updated rates are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>. In each case, the results are consistent within the uncertainties but the difference can be used to get a qualitative sense of the systematic uncertainty introduced by the false positive population. We note that in the above procedure we have not corrected our predictions for the fact that our search has explicitly excluded KOIs that host known Kepler EBs-if any of these excluded systems show fewer than three eclipses and do not present both primary and secondary eclipses, then they should also should perhaps count towards the number of EBs we should have expected to find in this survey. However, as the Kepler EB catalog does not provide information on whether both primary and secondary eclipses are detected, we neglect this correction. We note that this is a conservative decision, in the sense that accounting for the effect of excluded EBs on our predictions would only further decrease the FPP of the planetary signals, as they would be even less likely to be caused by EBs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">COMPARISON WITH THE LITERATURE</head><p>The population of long-period planets has been previously studied using radial velocity, microlensing, and direct imaging surveys. These methods all measure the occurrence rate as a function of planet mass instead of radius. Using the transit method, however, we do not directly measure the mass of the planet. Therefore, to compare our results with the literature, we must rely on a mass-radius (M-R) relationship constructed using exoplanets with both mass and radius measurements (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wolfgang et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen &amp; Kipping 2016)</ref> to predict the expected masses of the transiting planets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> lists gives constraints on the predicted masses of the exoplanet candidates using the probabilistic M-R relationship from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen &amp; Kipping (2016)</ref> and taking uncertainties in the planet radius and statistical uncertainties in the M-R parameters.

This effect would cause the masses of these cool planets to be systematically underestimated.</p><p>Using the same M-R relationship, we also compute the completeness of our transit search as a function of planet mass and orbital semi-major axis. This function is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> with the same color scheme as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. These injections and the predicted masses and measured semi-major axes of the candidates can then be used to estimate the occurrence rate in mass-semi-major axis units using the method from Section 6. One small change to Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> is necessary to account for the fact that the injections were not made uniformly in ln M and ln a. We numerically estimate the prior distribution in mass and semi-major axis from which the injections were drawñdrawñ p(ln a, ln M ) and Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Z(a min , a max ; M min , M max ) ≈ K V J J j=1 Q k (w (j) ) ˜ p(ln a (j) , ln M (j) ) .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Using this result, we find that the mean occurrence rate density in the range 0.01 M J ≤ M &lt; 20 M J and 1.5 au ≤ a &lt; 9 au is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">d 2 N d ln M d ln a = 0.068 ± 0.019 (19)</formula><p>where N is the expected number of planets per G/K dwarf. This result and the equivalent result as a function of planet mass and orbital period are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref>. The uncertainty in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref> does not take into account the uncertainties in the mass estimates or any systematic noise in the mass-radius relationship. Therefore, these specific results should be taken with the appropriate grain of salt but predictions in these parameter spaces ease comparison with occurrence rates measured computed using different methods.</p><p>Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2016) studied the occurrence rate of long-period giant planets orbiting M dwarfs by combining results from radial velocity, microlensing, and direct imaging surveys. In the period and mass range 10 3 − 10 4 days and 10 − 10 4 M ⊕ , they find a mean occurrence rate density of</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">d 2 N d ln M d ln P = 0.023 (20)</formula><p>per M dwarf with large uncertainty. This result is slightly lower than our estimated rate for a similar range of masses and periods but around G/K dwarfs. This difference is consistent with previous observational and theoretical results that cooler stars host fewer long-period giant planets (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Laughlin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2016)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryan et al. (2016)</ref> studied the frequency of long-period giant planets in systems with inner hot Jupiters based on long-baseline radial velocity monitoring of these systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>). In this sample, the computed occurrence rate of long-period giant planets was found to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">d 2 N d ln M d ln a = 0.125 ± 0.012 (21)</formula><p>in the range 1−20 M J and 5−20 au. This result is about a factor of two larger than our estimate (Equation 19) once again suggesting that cold Jupiters might preferentially occur in systems with inner planets -or that the presence of cold Jupiters encourages the formation of hot Jupiters. A recent review of the occurrence rate estimates based on direct imaging surveys (Bowler 2016) reports the upper limit on the occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting F/G/K dwarfs as &lt; 6.8% in the range 5 − 13 M J and 10 − 100 au. Converted to a rate density, this gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">d 2 N d ln M d ln a &lt; 0.03 . (22)</formula><p>This value is lower than the value computed using our sample in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref> but this is consistent with the fact that direct imaging is sensitive to the potentially less common large planets at wider separations than detections with the transit method.</p><p>As a final comparison, we repeated the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> and fit a double power-law occurrence rate to the short-period Kepler planet candidates 7 and extrapolated to the center of the two bins where we computed the occurrence rate. At a period of 7 years and a radius of 0.2 R J , the extrapolated occurrence rate density is 0.73 ± 0.28 and at a radius of 0.6 R J , the extrapolated rate density is 0.15 ± 0.05. These extrapolated values are qualitatively consistent with the rates listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> but we note that extrapolations and their statistical uncertainties should not be taken too seriously.  2 yr &lt; P &lt; 25 yr; 0.01 M J ≤ M &lt; 20 M J 0.046 ± 0.013 0.882 ± 0.245 1.5 au &lt; a &lt; 9 au; 0.01 M J ≤ M &lt; 20 M J 0.068 ± 0.019 0.925 ± 0.257 a The rate density is measured in natural logarithmic units; see Equation (19).</p><p>Note-These values are computed assuming that the occurrence rate is flat in the logarithmic parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">PROSPECTS FOR FOLLOW-UP</head><p>A real concern about the detection of exoplanets from a single transit is that followup and confirmation is difficult. Since the period of the orbit is poorly constrained and transits are sparse, any prediction of a subsequent transit time will be too uncertain to schedule targeted photometric follow-up ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beichman et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dalba &amp; Muirhead 2016)</ref>. Instead, follow-up using radial velocity and astrometry are more promising. For both radial velocity and astrometry, there is information about the orbiting planets in measurements made at all times -not just during transit. This allows observations to be scheduled without a well constrained orbital period. Furthermore, follow-up of any of these candidates using radial velocity or astrometry would provide a measurement of the density of a planet that would be valuable for the study of planetary compositions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> lists the posterior predictions for the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity signal produced by each candidate using the mass predictions from the previous section. Since the orbital periods are long, we also include a simple prediction for the slope of the radial velocity trend induced by this planet by taking the ratio of the semiamplitude and the orbital period. Any radial velocity follow-up of the candidates presented here would be an ambitious undertaking because the stars are relatively faint and, in most cases, the radial velocity trends are small. Some candidates should, however, be within the reach of current state-of-the-art facilities.</p><p>In principle the Gaia Mission will be very sensitive to the astrometric wobble produced by a long-period exoplanet <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Perryman et al. 2014</ref>). To leading order, the astrometric signal strength is proportional to the semi-major axis of the stellar (primary) reflex motion in angular units. That is, detectability is related to the angle α given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">α = a D M p M s ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where a is the semi-major axis, D is the distance from the observer to the primary, and M p /M s is the planet-to-star mass ratio. The single-visit precision of Gaia will vary with magnitude but is expected to be on the order of 40 µas at these magnitudes. In detail the confidence with which an exoplanet can be detected or measured in the final Gaia data depends on this precision, the number of crossings of the star through the Gaia field-of-view, and details of how the projected orbit is sampled by the time history of the focal-plane crossings. However, it is not expected that Gaia can detect or precisely measure exoplanet-induced astrometric wobbles that are much smaller in amplitude than the single-visit precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Perryman et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The primary stars in the Kepler Field are typically at distances of ∼ 500 pc, and typical mass ratios are in the 10 −4 range. We therefore expect astrometric amplitudes in the 0.3 to 3 µas range. These planets will not be detectable or measurable in the Gaia data under any circumstances, but it may be possible to identify which candidates are false-alarms caused by eclipsing binaries. However, similar planets around closer stars will be detectable with Gaia. This means that there will be a comparable exoplanet occurrence rate measurement from the Gaia data. It also means that many of the discoveries of the K2 and TESS missions could be followed up and precisely measured by the Gaia Mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">SUMMARY</head><p>We have developed a fully automated method to search for the transits of longperiod exoplanets with only one or two observable transits in the Kepler archival light curves. This method uses probabilistic model comparison to veto non-transit signals. Applying this method to the brightest 39,036 G/K dwarfs in the Kepler target list, we discover 16 systems with likely astrophysical transits and eclipses. We fit the light curve for each candidate with a physical generative model and informative priors on eccentricity and stellar density to estimate the planet's orbital period. The constraint on the period is also informed by the simplifying assumption that no other transit could occur during the baseline of Kepler observations of the target. Simulations of the false positive population -lone primary or secondary eclipses of binary systems or background eclipsing binaries -suggest that 13 of these candidates have high probability of being planetary in nature.</p><p>We measure the empirical detection efficiency function of our search procedure by injecting simulated transit signals into the target light curves and measuring the recovery rate. By combining the measured detection efficiency and the catalog of exoplanet candidates, we estimate the integrated occurrence rate of exoplanets with orbital periods in the range 2 − 25 years and radii in the range 0.1 − 1 R J to be 2.00 ± 0.72 planets per G/K dwarf. This result is qualitatively consistent with estimates of the occurrence rate of long-period giant planets based on data from radial velocity and direct imaging surveys. The occurrence rate measured here -for Sun-like hosts -is higher than microlensing results for generally lower mass stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gaudi 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, 2016</ref>) but this discrepancy is consistent with predictions from the core-accretion model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Laughlin et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Using a probabilistic mass-radius relationship, we predict the masses of our candidates and report predictions for the radial velocity semi-amplitudes. Unfortunately, since the target stars are faint and the amplitudes are small, these targets are unlikely to be accessible with even the current state-of-the-art high-precision instruments. We also discuss the potential for astrometric follow-up using the forthcoming data from the Gaia Mission with similarly discouraging results.</p><p>Any detailed analysis of individual systems detected with only a single transit requires follow-up observations to convincingly rule out false positive scenarios and to better characterize the stellar host parameters (with, for example, parallax measurements from Gaia). The conclusions of this work -and all other occurrence rate results based on Kepler data -are conditioned on the assumption that the stellar characterization of the target sample is systematic and un-biased. The main population-level results should be fairly insensitive systematic issues with the sample but a rigorous analysis of these effects will be required to come to more detailed conclusions about this population of long-period transiting planets.</p><p>Our method of transit discovery is especially relevant for future photometric surveys like K2, TESS, and PLATO where the survey baseline is shorter than Kepler. The transits of planets with orbital periods longer than the observation baselines will be plentiful in these forthcoming data sets and this method can, in principle, be trivially generalized to discover these planets, prioritize follow-up, and study their population. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. DETAILS OF THE LIGHT CURVE MODELS</head><p>In Section 2.2, the five light curve models were listed. In this section, we give the mathematical details of each model and list the parameters that are fit. Each model -except the transit model -can be easily differentiated with respect to its parameters. As discussed in the following section, this feature is crucial for efficient and robust likelihood maximization.</p><p>• The box model is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">m box (t) =        a, if t ≤ t min b, if t min &lt; t ≤ t max c, if t max &lt; t (A1)</formula><p>where a, b, and c are free parameters, and t min and t max are fixed. In practice, we include two different box models where t min and t max are set using different heuristics. The first box has the bounds set to match the ingress and egress of the best fit transit. The second box is chosen based on the largest change points in the light curve.</p><p>• The step model is given by where all of the parameters -including t 0 -are included in the fit. To ensure that the widths w 1 and w 2 remain positive, we fit for log w 1 and log w 2 .</p><p>• For the outlier model, we iterate through all cadences t n within 0.3 days of the candidate transit time and evaluate the model as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">m outlier (t) =    f (t 0 ), if t = t 0 median[f (t = t 0 )], if t = t 0 (A3)</formula><p>where f (t) is the observed time series. With this model, no non-linear optimization is required and the final value of t 0 is the one with the maximum likelihood in this grid search.</p><p>• The variability model only has one parameter, the flux m 0 and m variability (t) = m 0 at all times. The variability is captured by the Gaussian Process residual model.</p><p>• Finally, the transit model is an exposure time integrated, limb darkened light curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kipping 2010</ref>) parameterized by the radius ratio between the planet and star, the transit duration, the transit time, the impact parameter, and two quadratic limb darkening coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kipping 2013a</ref>). Analytically computing the gradient of a simple transit model is possible <ref type="bibr">(Pál 2008</ref>) but it becomes substantially more tedious as the model becomes more realistic. Therefore, we instead use a compile-time automatic differentiation library 8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al. 2016</ref>) to efficiently compute first derivatives of the full transit model with respect to the orbital and physical parameters to machine precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION</head><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a class of non-parametric, stochastic models that have been demonstrated to be good effective models for the variability in Kepler light curves. A simple GP model can be used to capture residual non-transit variability in light curves. In this paper, we use a GP model for two steps: light curve-level transit shape vetting and parameter estimation. A full discussion of GPs is beyond the scope of this paper, so we will only summarize the most relevant points here and direct an interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rasmussen &amp; Williams (2006)</ref> for more details.</p><p>A GP model is specified by the following likelihood function</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">L = ln p(y | θ, α) = − 1 2 r(θ) T K(α) −1 r(θ) − 1 2 log det K(α) − N 2 log 2 π (B4)</formula><p>where y is a list of measurements in a scalar time series -in this case, fluxes -measured at the times t, and r(θ) = y − m(t; θ)</p><p>is the vector of residuals away from the mean model m(t; θ). For the purposes of this paper, we model the covariance matrix K(α) using the Matérn-3/2 kernel. Under this model, the elements of K(α) are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">[K(α)] ij = σ 2 i δ ij + α 2 1 + |t i − t j | √ 3 τ exp − |t i − t j | √ 3 τ (B6)</formula><p>where σ i is the reported uncertainty on the i-th measurement in the time series and δ ij is the Kronecker delta. This covariance function (Equation B6) is specified by an amplitude α and a time scale τ and we will simultaneously fit for these hyperparameters α = (α, τ ) and the parameters of the mean model θ. To efficiently find the parameter set that maximizes Equation (B4) using a non-linear optimization routine 9 , it is useful to be able to compute the gradient of Equation (B4) with respect to the parameters θ and α. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
