			<abstract>
				<p>The spin of a planet or brown dwarf is related to the accretion process, and therefore studying spin can help promote our understanding of the formation of such objects. We present the projected rotational velocity of the young sub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b, along with its barycentric radial velocity. The directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but growing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement. The GQ Lupi system was observed at high spectral resolution (R ∼100 000), and in the analysis we made use of both spectral and spatial filtering to separate the signal of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both CO (S/N=11.6) and H 2 O (S/N=7.7) in the atmosphere of GQ Lupi b by cross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow rotator with a projected rotational velocity of 5.3 +0.9 −1.0 km s −1. The slow rotation is most likely due to its young age of &lt; 5 Myr, as it is still in the process of accreting material and angular momentum. We measure the barycentric radial velocity of GQ Lupi b to be 2.0 ± 0.4 km s −1 , and discuss the allowed orbital configurations and their implications for formation scenarios for GQ Lupi b.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Measurements of the spin and the orbit of giant extrasolar planets and brown dwarf companions may hold important clues to their origin and evolution. Generally, two formation processes are considered for giant planets: i) core accretion and ii) disk fragmentation. Jupiter and Saturn are commonly accepted to have formed through core accretion, a class of formation models where gas accretes onto solid planetary embryos of several to ten Earth masses which may have formed beyond the iceline by runaway accretion from kilometer-sized planetesimals <ref type="bibr">(Pol- lack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laughlin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hubickyj et al. 2005</ref>). The discovery of extrasolar giant planets led to the reinvigoration of the disk fragmentation hypothesis which states that giant (exo)planets may form as a disk gravitational instability that collapses on itself in the outer protoplanetary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boss 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boss , 2000</ref>). Disk fragmentation is also considered a potential formation scenario for the more massive brown dwarf companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chabrier et al. 2014</ref>), or alternatively brown dwarf companions can be the result of prestellar core fragmentation during the earliest stages of the cloud collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jumper &amp; Fisher 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Spin is predominantly a result of accretion of angular momentum during the formation, and if core accretion and gravitational instability result in differences in spin angular momentum, it is possible this will show up in studies of spin of substellar companions as function of mass. In the Solar System, the Email: schwarz@strw.leidenuniv.nl spin angular momenta of those planets not influenced by tidal effects or tidal energy dissipation by a massive satellite follow a clear relationship, spinning faster with increasing mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hughes 2003</ref>). In particular, gas giants far away from their central star are likely to have primordial spin angular momentum, making the directly imaged sub-stellar companions ideal candidates for exploring the connection between formation and spin.</p><p>The rotational velocity of an exoplanet was measured for the first time by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Snellen et al. (2014)</ref>, observing the directly imaged planet β Pictoris b with high-dispersion spectroscopy, measuring it to have a projected rotational velocity of v sin(i) = 25 km s −1 . Another young directly imaged planet, 2M1207 b, became the first exoplanet to directly have its rotational period measured (P rot = 10.7 hr), when <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhou et al. (2016)</ref> detected rotational modulations in HST/WFC3 photometric monitoring of the object. Both results are in accordance with an extrapolation of the spin-mass trend observed in the Solar System planets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.  8</ref>).</p><p>Apart from being related to the accretion process, the spin of an exoplanet is also a fundamental observable that affects in particular its atmospheric dynamics and climate as well as e.g. its magnetic fields. On Earth, the Coriolis effect generates largescale ocean currents which in turn promote cyclones. For fast rotators, including many brown dwarfs, the wind flows are rotation dominated <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Showman &amp; Kaspi 2013)</ref>. On the other hand, exoplanets orbiting close to their parent star are expected to be tidally locked. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Louden &amp; Wheatley (2015)</ref>  A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. <ref type="bibr">AA-2016-28908-preprint</ref> to detect a Doppler signature in the transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, consistent with synchronous rotation. Synchronous rotation is the cause of large temperature differences between the day-and night-side which in turn can cause fast winds flowing from the hot day-side to the cold night-side.</p><p>Another approach to understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of exoplanets is to study their orbits. In the case of directly imaged sub-stellar companions, it is often difficult to constrain the orbits, due to the long time-scales involved (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ginski et al. 2014a</ref>). However, using a high-dispersion slit spectrograph in combination with adaptive optics, it is possible to extract spatially resolved highdispersion spectra for the companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Snellen et al. 2014</ref>), and thereby measure even very small Doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the companion. Thus, even just one radial velocity measurement can in some cases prove to be a powerful orbital constraint ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Nielsen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lecavelier des Etangs &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we present both the spin measurement and the barycentric radial velocity of the widely-separated sub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b from high-dispersion spectroscopy. We introduce the GQ Lupi system in Section 2, and give the details of the observations in Section 3. The data analysis is detailed in Section 4 with special emphasis on how the spatially resolved spectrum of the companion is extracted and cleaned from telluric and stellar spectral lines. In Section 5 we explain the crosscorrelation analysis which is employed to measure the rotational broadening and doppler shifts of the molecular lines in the companion spectrum, and the results from the companion are presented in Section 6, along with the host star spin and systemic velocity. We discuss the implications of the spin measurement in Section 7.1 and the constraints on orbital elements in Section 7.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The GQ Lupi system</head><p>GQ Lupi A is a classical T Tauri star with spectral type K7 V ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kharchenko &amp; Roeser 2009)</ref>, located in the star forming cloud Lupus I ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tachihara et al. 1996</ref>) at an approximate distance of 140 ± 50 pc (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Neuhäuser &amp; Brandner 1998</ref>). The system is less than five million years old ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Neuhäuser et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seperu- elo Duarte et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Weise et al. 2010)</ref>, and there is strong observational evidence for a circumstellar warm dust disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hughes et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kessler-Silacci et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morales et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Do- nati et al. 2012</ref>), extending to between 25 and 75 au from the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dai et al. 2010</ref>). The inclination of the spin axis of GQ Lupi A is estimated to be 30 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Donati et al. 2012</ref>), which is roughly consistent with the inclination of the warm inner parts of the circumstellar disk determined by <ref type="bibr">Hügelmeyer et al. (2009)</ref> to be ∼22 • . Additional stellar parameters are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The star has a directly imaged sub-stellar companion, GQ Lupi b, with a highly uncertain and model dependent mass most likely in the range 10 M J to 36 M J , ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Marois et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Seifahrt et al. 2007</ref>), placing it somewhere on the border between a giant planet and a brown dwarf, although this boundary is becoming increasingly blurred ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chabrier et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hatzes &amp; Rauer 2015)</ref>. The exoplanet candidate was first discovered with HST by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Neuhäuser et al. (2005)</ref>, and it was recently imaged as part of the SEEDS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Uyama et al. 2016</ref>). It is located at a projected separation of 0.7 west (100 au at 140 pc) and an astrometric analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ginski et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observations</head><p>We observed the GQ Lupi system for 1 hour (including acquisition) on 29 May 2014 with the Cryogenic High-Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kaeufl et al. 2004</ref>), located at the Nasmyth A focus of VLT Antu of the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal in Chile. CRIRES is a long slit spectrograph with a slit length of 50 , and we chose a slit width of 0.2 to achieve the maximal spectral resolving power R ∼100 000. The slit was positioned in a near east to west orientation to both encompass the host star and the substellar companion located at position angle PA = −83.6 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhou et al. 2014</ref>), allowing a combination of high dispersion spectroscopy with high-contrast imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Snellen et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>We took 18 exposures of 120 s in a classical ABBA pattern, where the telescope was nodded sequentially 10 in the slit direction between postions A and B, then B and A to allow accurate background subtraction. At each postion an additional small random jitter offset was introduced to minimise issues from flatfielding and hot pixels.</p><p>The four CRIRES detectors are of type Aladdin III InSb, and each has a size of 1024 × 512 pixels with a gap of approximately 280 pixels in between. Unfortunately, the two outer detectors have severe odd-even column non-linearity effects 1 which were not possible to accurately calibrate in these data. These are therefore left out from the analysis. The observations were performed with the standard wavelength settings for order 24 (λ cen = 2.3252 µm), using the two central detectors to target the ro-vibrational (2, 0) R-branch of carbon monoxide. The wavelength range 2.302 µm-2.331 µm of the two central detectors covers more than 30 strong CO lines.</p><p>We used the Multi Application Curvature Adaptive Optics system (MACAO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arsenault et al. 2003</ref>) in 1.0 to 1.1 seeing conditions. To further maximize the performance of MACAO, the target system was observed at low airmasses between 1.056 and 1.121. This resulted in the starlight being suppressed by a factor ∼ 45 at the companion position. With a K-band contrast ratio of 3.3 × 10 −3 , the companion contributes with (F b /F A ) * 45 * 100 = 15 ± 3 % of the total flux at the companion position. The remaining 85% flux is from the host star. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Basic data reduction</head><p>The data was processed with the CRIRES pipeline version 2.3.2 and the corresponding version 3.10.2 of ESOREX. The pipeline performed the basic image processing, i.e. the images were dark subtracted, flatfielded and were corrected for known bad pixels and non-linearity effects. Furthermore, the pipeline combined the images in AB nodding pairs performing a background subtraction, and extracted a 1D spectrum from each of these combined images with the optimal extraction technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Horne 1986)</ref>.</p><p>We made use of the intermediate data products i.e. the combined images, as well as the optimally extracted 1D spectra of the host star as follows. From the 18 exposures, 9 combined image frames were produced for each detector. An example of such a frame for detector 2 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. We cut away everything but the central 51 rows that contain the stellar spectral trail, the hidden companion spectral trail (8 pixels above the center), and enough extra rows to properly determine the stellar point spread function along the slit. The bad pixel correction in the CRIRES pipeline is insufficient. Therefore remaining bad pixels (including cosmic rays) were visually identified with the program DS9, and they were corrected with cubic spline interpolation using the four nearest neighbours in the row on both sides.</p><p>The 9 optimally extracted 1D spectra of the host star were corrected for bad pixels in the same manner, and then median normalised. Subsequently they were averaged over time to a single reference spectrum, representing the average spectrum of the host star, GQ Lupi A, plus telluric absorption in the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>The wavelength calibration was performed using line matching between deep and isolated telluric lines in the reference spectrum and a synthetic transmission spectrum from ESO SkyCalc 2 . We used 15 to 20 lines per detector and fitted a second-order polynomial to the pairs of pixel and wavelength centroids, where the centroids were determined from Gaussian fits. The highest residuals to the second-order polynomial fits were at a level of 20% of a pixel. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Extraction of spectra for each slit position</head><p>From the clean combined image frames ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A)</ref>, we optimally extracted a spectrum for each slit position. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates the procedure, which was performed individually for each frame and each detector. Looking at the star trail in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, it can be seen that the y-position of the intensity peak shifts with wavelength, and it is an important step in the data analysis to correct for this tilt of the trail of the star. In detector 2, the pixel with the maximum intensity shifts by 4 pixels from one end of the detector to the other, and in detector 3 the shift is 2 pixels. The tilted trail introduces a curvature in the continuum for a given row, and therefore we normalised each row with a polynomial fit of the curvature, where the degree of the polynomium depended on the distance from the stellar spectral trail. The fitted curves also provide the spatial profiles of the star as a function of wavelength <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. We used the spatial profiles to optimally extract a spectrum for each of the 31 most central rows from the normalised arrays <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2C</ref>). We will refer to these collectively as the spatial spectra <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2D</ref>). The 9 AB frames of spatial spectra were combined to a single frame to increase the signal-to-noise ratio Article number, page 3 of 11 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. <ref type="bibr">AA-2016-28908-preprint</ref> of a given spectrum. Each pixel was normalised by the median of the pixel value through the 9 frames and then combined as a weighted average. The weights were determined according to the varying width of the spatial profile ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>) which is a seeing proxy. Pixels that deviated &gt; 4σ for the given pixel position were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Removal of telluric and stellar spectrum</head><p>The spatial spectra are dominated by the telluric absorption and the stellar spectrum which has prominent CO lines. In contrast, the additional component to the spectra from the companion is strongly localised on the detector at the slit position of the companion. The stellar and telluric components are quasi identical at all slit positions, although the spectral resolution changes slightly with slit position. This is due to variations in the spatial profile of the star along the slit. Furthermore a small offset of the position of the star with respect to the center of the slit can result in a small wavelength offset, and in addition there is a scaling factor. In order to remove both the telluric and stellar components, we made use of the reference spectrum we constructed in Section 4.1. The reference spectrum was adjusted to each slit position to correct for the above mentioned effects by convolving with an appropriate broadening function, which was determined with the singular value decomposition technique (Rucinski 1999). The telluric and stellar spectrum was then removed from the spatial spectra by dividing with the adjusted reference spectrum <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2E</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Companion position</head><p>The presence of CO lines in the spectrum of the host star is a complicating factor, because they potentially overlap with the CO lines of the companion. If the orbital motion of the companion has a significant radial component, the lines will be red-or blueshifted relative to the lines of the star, but because of the wide separation between host and companion in the GQ Lupi system, the upper limit on the absolute value of this shift is 2.5 to 3.5 km s −1 , depending on the exact semi-major axis and mass of GQ Lupi A. Furthermore, both the molecular lines of the companion and of the host star are rotationally broadened. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guenther et al. (2005)</ref> measured the projected rotational velocity of GQ Lupi A to be 6.8 ± 0.4 km s −1 , and more recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Donati et al. (2012)</ref> found a similar value of 5 ± 1 km s −1 . The concern is that the shape and strength of the companion lines may be affected by the process of removing the stellar lines, thereby compromising the v sin(i) and/or Doppler shift measurements.</p><p>The severity of this issue is greatly reduced by the angular separation between the host and the companion of 0.7 . As stated in section 3, we achieved a suppression of the starlight at the position of the companion to a few percent, which means that 15% of the total flux at this slit position originates from the companion and 85% originates from the host star. We therefore scaled the stellar lines in the reference spectrum down by 15% before proceeding as described in section 4.3 with removing the stellar and telluric spectrum from the spatial spectrum of the companion position.</p><p>In order to rescale the stellar reference spectrum, we isolated the stellar lines from the telluric parts of the reference spectrum. This was done as an iterative process, where a telluric model spectrum and a stellar model spectrum were fitted and removed separately from the reference spectrum. The steps were as follows:</p><p>• We used the same telluric model spectrum from ESO SkyCalc which was used to perform the wavelength calibration. The airmass and the precipitable water vapor (PWV) was set manually at airmass 1.1 and PWV 1.5 to best fit the observed reference spectrum. The stellar model is a PHOENIX spectrum from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Husser et al. (2013)</ref> with T eff = 4300 K and log g = 3.5. The telluric model was smoothed, and both the telluric and the stellar model were resampled to the observed wavelength solution.</p><p>• We convolved the telluric model with a broadening kernel to adjust the resolution to that of the reference spectrum. As in section 4.3 the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rucinski 1999</ref>) was employed to determine the appropriate kernel, but here it was done in log space to avoid the deepest telluric lines from dominating. The telluric spectrum was then removed from the reference spectrum by dividing through with the telluric fit.</p><p>• The stellar template was fitted to the telluric-removed reference spectrum by convolving with an SVD broadening kernel in log space. Following this, the stellar lines were removed from the original reference spectrum by dividing through with the stellar fit.</p><p>• The telluric SVD fit and removal was redone, adjusting the telluric model to the stellar-removed reference spectrum before dividing the original reference spectrum through with the fit, thus producing an improved telluric-removed reference spectrum.</p><p>• The continuum of the new telluric-removed reference spectrum was fitted with a second order polynomial and removed. Subsequently the stellar SVD fit was redone, fitting the stellar model to the flat telluric-removed reference spectrum. This stellar fit was then scaled to 15% of the line strength, and the original reference spectrum was divided through with this scaled down stellar model, resulting in a reference spectrum with the strength of the stellar lines reduced by 15%.</p><p>The effects of scaling down the stellar lines are minor. Details of how it affects the measured v sin(i) and RV are given in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Measuring the signal from the companion</head><p>After removing the telluric and stellar spectrum, the residual spatial spectra consist of residual noise, with the exception at the slit position of the companion which also has a contribution from the companion spectrum. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2E</ref> shows a short wavelength range of the residual spatial spectra. At the high spectral resolution of the CRIRES data, the molecular bands are resolved into individual lines, and the signal from all of the lines from a given molecule within the wavelength range can be combined through cross-correlation with a model spectrum. Molecules are identified in the spectrum of the companion as a peak in the crosscorrelation function (CCF). The CCF profile is sensitive to both the shape and the Doppler shift of the companion spectral lines. Lines that are broadened by rotation will result in broadened CCF profiles, and lines that are shifted will also shift the peak of the CCF. In this section we describe the model spectra and the cross-correlation analysis, as well as the procedure for measuring the rotation and radial velocity of the companion from the cross-correlation function. For illustration purposes the model was also fitted to the residual companion spectrum with a vertical offset and a scaling factor. The companion spectrum is dominated by noise, but the individual CO lines are discernible. </p></div>

We have assumed R = 100 000 for the instrumental profile, but we have measured the actual resolving power to be in the range 80 000 to 90 000. This causes a small overestimation of v sin(i) on the order of 60 m s −1 , which is included in the lower uncertainty bound of the final result.

For the purpose of measuring v sin(i) and RV we selected the model with the strongest cross-correlation signal. The CCFs from the two detectors were averaged to further maximise the signal-tonoise (S/N). We will refer to the average CCF from the companion position and the best model as the measured companion CCF.</p><p>We determined the best fit v sin(i) and RV of the measured companion CCF through X 2 minimisation with a suite of model CCFs, along with confidence intervals from rescaling the errors so ¯ X 2 = 1. The model CCFs were constructed by crosscorrelating the non-broadened best model with broadened and shifted versions of itself. Both the broadened and non-broadened models were convolved to the CRIRES spectral resolution prior to the cross-correlation. We tested projected rotational velocities in the range 0 to 10 km s −1 and Doppler-shifts in the range −5 to 5 km s −1 . For both parameters the stepsize was 0.1 km s −1 . Each of these model CCFs were then offset (y-direction) and scaled with a least square fit to best match the measured companion CCF, after which the X 2 minimisation routine was performed. The measured radial velocity was corrected to the barycentric radial velocity using the systemic velocity (v sys ) determined from from the host star spectrum as described in Section 5.4, and the heliocentric correction term for the time of observation. The results are presented in Section 6.2 and discussed in Sections 7.1 and 7.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Measuring the systemic velocity and the host star v sin(i)</head><p>We took the same approach to measuring v sin(i) and RV of the host star as we did for the companion. In this case, the measured host star CCF was the cross-correlation function of the flat telluric-removed reference spectrum from the final step of Section 4.3.1 and a synthetic PHOENIX spectrum from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Husser et al. (2013)</ref> with T eff = 4300 K and log g = 3.5. A suite of model CCFs were constructed from the PHOENIX model with a range of v sin(i)-and RV-values, and we performed the X 2 analysis for the host star, comparing the measured and modelled CCFs. The measured radial velocity was corrected to the barycentric radial velocity (i.e. the systemic velocity) using the heliocentric correction term for the time of observation. We carried out this analysis for PHOENIX models with T eff ±100 K and log g±0.5 to test the sensitivity to the stellar parameters, and found that this temperature difference can affect the radial velocity with up to 100 m s −1 and the v sin(i) with up to 200 m s −1 . The radial velocity is not sensitive to the choice of log g, but the v sin(i) can be affected by up to 200 m s −1 . The results are presented and discussed in Sections 6.3 and 7.3, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results</head><p>Although the residual spectrum at the companion position is noisy, the absorption lines from CO in the companion atmosphere are in some cases visible <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4)</ref>. To help guide the eye, we have overplotted the best CO model shifted to the best fit radial velocity. Although we can visually detect the individual CO lines, the companion spectrum is too noisy to allow the rotational broadening or the Doppler shift to be measured directly from the CO lines, and we therefore need to make use of the CCF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Detection of CO and H 2 O</head><p>We clearly detect the sub-stellar companion at the expected distance from the host star (0.7 ) in the CCF arrays (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). We detect CO with a S/N of 11.6 and H 2 O with a S/N of 7.7. The best model containing both CO and H 2 O is detected with a S/N of 12.3. These are average values from the two central CRIRES detectors, but both CO and H 2 O are detected separately in each detector. The S/N-values were obtained by dividing the crosscorrelation coefficients with the standard deviation of the array, excluding points in parameter space close to the companion signal. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows the S/N cross-correlation arrays for the best CO-only, H 2 O-only and CO+H 2 O models from the tested T/p and VMR grid. They are displayed here from −50 to 50 km s −1 , but we note that the S/N-values are based on the standard deviation of the full radial velocity range from −250 to 250 km s −1 . These best models are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> and share the same T/p profile with the temperature decreasing from 2150 K at 1 bar to 1100 K at 0.03 bar. The steep decrease in temperature relatively deep in the atmosphere gives rise to strong absorption lines. The VMR for both CO and H 2 O in these models are in all cases 10 −4 . We note that all the models in the grid described in Section 5.1 give rise to significant molecular detections, and for a given VMR the significance of a detection from the different T/p profiles agree to within 1σ.</p><p>The CO signal and the CO+H 2 O signal are detected with a stronger significance in detector 3 compared to detector 2. This is in line with expectations, because the third detector has a higher number of CO lines. In detector 3 there are stellar CO residuals in the row just above the star position, although at a lower level than the companion signal. The residuals are strong enough to also show up in the average cross-correlation arrays in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. It is unclear why the procedure for removing the stellar light has partly failed at this one slit position, and also why the issue only involves one of the detectors. The companion is a further 7 pixels away where the light from the star is decreased to only ∼ 2% of its peak intensity, so we expect this issue to have negligible effect on the v sin(i) and RV measurements.</p></div>

For the host star, we have measured a rotational broadening corresponding to v sin(i) = 6.8 ± 0.5 km s −1 .

They applied astrometry to 15 astrometric epochs from VLT/NACO and HST spanning a time frame of 18 years to determine the angular separation and relative position angle.

The details of the LSMC approach along with a comparison to the more widely used MCMC approach are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ginski et al. (2013)</ref>.

This strongly suggests that GQ Lupi b is a slow rotator when compared to the giant planets in the Solar System or the recent spin measurements of β Pictoris b and 2M1207 b (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>).</p><p>The v sin(i) measured for GQ Lupi b could have been influenced by the removal of the stellar lines.

The right-hand panels show the orbital solutions which are consistent with the radial velocity measurement from this work. the short-wavelength wing of the companion signal -making it more narrow. We compared the widths of the CO+H 2 O signal for the analyses with and without rescaling the stellar CO and found 5.3 +0.9 −1.0 km s −1 and 4.8 ± 1.0 km s −1 , respectively. This suggests that the influence in any case is only minor, and cannot have resulted in the companion's v sin(i) to be artificially small. The measured companion CCFs for the two cases are plotted together in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.</p><p>Micro-and macro-turbulence act as additional broadening of line profiles and can therefore cause an overestimation of the projected rotational velocity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wende et al. (2009)</ref> investigated the effective temperature and log g dependence of the velocity field for M-stars extending to temperatures as low as 2500 K, thereby just covering the estimated temperature of GQ Lupi b. Micro-and macro-turbulent velocities decrease with lower effective temperatures, and particularly micro-turbulence increases towards lower surface gravities. Assuming a surface gravity for GQ Lupi b in the range log g = 3.0 to 4.2, a realistic upper limit for the sum of the squares of the turbulent velocities is 1.5 km s −1 , corresponding to an overestimate of v sin(i) by 0.22 km s −1 . We have included this in the lower bound of the uncertainty estimate of the v sin(i) measurement.</p><p>If the orientation of the spin axis is edge-on, the measured spin velocity corresponds to a rotational period of 82 hr, assuming a companion radius of 3.5 +1.5 −1.03 R J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Seifahrt et al. 2007</ref>). Since the spin axis orientation is unknown, it could possibly be nearly pole on. Therefore the equatorial rotation velocity (v eq ) could be much higher than v sin(i). However, the inclination of the axis of rotation would have to be less than 15 • to make the spin of GQ Lupi b comparable to β Pic b or the Solar System giant planets. Assuming a random orientation, this has only a probability of 3.4%. If we make the assumption that orbital and spin axes are aligned, then based on <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> we can rule out inclinations below 28 • , corresponding to v eq faster than 11.3 km s −1 . This is still well below the v sin(i) of 25 km s −1 , which <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Snellen et al. (2014)</ref> measured for β Pic b. Therefore, it is unlikely that GQ Lupi b is a fast rotator.</p><p>The slow rotation of GQ Lupi b may be caused by a different formation path from β Pic b, 2M1207 b, and the giant planets in the solar system. GQ Lupi b at ∼100 au is significantly further away from its host star than the other mentioned planets. In addition it is likely more massive with a mass range 10 M J to 36 M J extending well into the brown dwarf regime. It could therefore have formed through either disk gravitational instability or even fragmentation of the collapsing proto-stellar core, rather than through core accretion, which is a possible common formation path for the (exo)planets showing the spin-mass trend, we see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allers et al. (2016)</ref> have recently measured the projected rotational velocity of PSO J318.5338-22.8603, which is a free-floating planetary mass member of the β Pictoris moving group with an estimated age of 23 ± 3 Myr. Their measured v sin(i) = 17.5 +2.3 −2.8 km s −1 is also consistent with the Solar System spin-mass trend. Such an object is most likely the result of gravitational instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chabrier et al. 2014</ref>; Stamatellos 2014), possibly followed by photo-erosion, but it could also have been dynamically kicked out of an orbit around a star, and core accretion can therefore not be ruled out. Low resolution spectra of GQ Lupi b are consistent with a spectral type of late M to early L ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Neuhäuser et al. 2005</ref>), and comparable brown dwarf binaries and field brown dwarfs from the literature show a wide variety of rotational velocities and no simple correlation with mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Konopacky et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zapatero Osorio et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Metchev et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Scholz et al. 2015</ref>). Most brown dwarfs are rapid rotators (v sin(i) &gt;10 km s −1 ), and their minimum rotation rates are a function of their spectral types, with the higher mass objects rotating more slowly than their lower mass counterparts, in contrast with the planetary trend. This is because magnetic breaking plays an increasing role in the more massive brown dwarfs. However, it is much too early to make any claims about relations between spin, mass and orbital distance based on the limited observations -in particular because there is another very probable explanation for the slow spin of GQ Lupi b.  <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref>. Note that the field brown dwarfs are much older than the substellar companions and PSO J318.5-22 with highly uncertain ages in the range 500 Myr to 10 Gyr.</p><p>We believe that the slow spin of GQ Lupi b is linked to its young age. All current estimates set the age of the GQ Lupi system to <ref type="bibr">&lt;5 Myr, and Neuhäuser et al. (2005)</ref> estimated the age to be only 1 ± 1 Myr. In fact, observational evidence exists of GQ Lupi b actively accreting, through the detection of Paβ emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Seifahrt et al. 2007)</ref>, as well as the detection of Hα in emission together with excess optical continuum emission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhou et al. 2014</ref>). This means that a significant amount of angular momentum could still be accreted in the future. Furthermore, its radius is now estimated at 3.5 +1.5 −1.03 R J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Seifahrt et al. 2007)</ref>, meaning that even without extra accretion it is expected to still significantly contract to ∼ 1R J radius and spin up to 10 − 25km s −1 . This would bring it much nearer the mass-spin relation of the other giant planets. In this context it is interesting that 2M1207 b with an age in between that of GQ Lupi b and β Pic b is also seen to have an intermediate spin.</p><p>The spin angular momenta of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars also evolve over time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouvier et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Irwin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Newton et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Scholz et al. 2015</ref>). Analogously to the spin evolution of giant planets, gravitational contraction causes the brown dwarfs to spin up, but after 10 Myr to 100 Myr magnetic breaking starts dominating the spin evolution. The angular momentum loss mechanisms are more inefficient for smaller and cooler objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Reiners &amp; Basri 2008)</ref>. This stands in contrast to planets, which are expected to retain their spin angular momenta, unless gravitationally disturbed by a third object.</p><p>Measurements of spin as a function of mass, orbital distance, and crucially, age, for numerous sub-stellar companions and free-floating low-mass objects, are necessary to determine the effects of formation pathways on spin-mass relationships. Yet at this early stage, every spin measurement of a sub-stellar companion is likely to lead to new insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">The orbital orientation of GQ Lupi b</head><p>We used the radial velocity measurement for GQ Lupi b of 2.0 ± 0.4 km s −1 in conjunction with previous astrometry from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ginski et al. (2014b)</ref> to constrain its orbital elements. This allows us to rule out both circular orbits and long-period orbits (a &gt; 185 au) with eccentricities below 0.8. We note that if we allow for a larger uncertainty in the astrometry, then circular orbits with inclinations 60 • &lt; i &lt; 78 • are still possible. The orbital solutions that are consistent with the RV measurement show a degeneracy between eccentricity and inclination. Orbits with a relatively low eccentricity (0.1 &lt; e &lt; 0.4) have high inclinations 48 • &lt; i &lt; 63 • , which are distinctly different from that of the circumstellar disk (∼22 • ). In the case of the more eccentric solutions 0.4 &lt; e &lt; 0.75 the inclinations are less well constrained, yet there is a tendency towards allowing for smaller inclinations towards higher eccentricities. This includes orbits with 0.65 &lt; e &lt; 0.7 that are near-aligned with the circumstellar disk. Finally we have a subset of orbital solutions with extremely wide orbits (a&gt;300 au) and high eccentricities e &gt; 0.8. This last subset seems less likely because it would imply that we observe the companion at a special moment near periastron. We note that all displayed solutions in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> fit both our new radial velocity measurement and the available astrometric data well, and that the density of solutions does not correspond directly to the likelihood of solutions.</p><p>As in the case of the measured v sin(i), also the RV measurement of the companion can have been influenced by the contribution of the stellar lines. If we have over-subtracted the shortwavelength wing of the companion CO lines when we removed the stellar spectrum, this could introduce an artificial redshift.</p><p>Article number, page 9 of 11 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. AA-2016-28908-preprint  Comparison of the RV measurement with and without the scaling of the stellar contribution ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 9)</ref> indicates that this effect is confined to 0.2 km s −1 . Assuming that we have performed the stellar removal to a precision of ∼ 10%, this should not add to the uncertainty in RV to a level of more than 0.1 km s −1 .</p><p>Our RV measurement improves the orbital constraints significantly. A large family of possible orbital solutions found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ginski et al. (2014b)</ref>, in particular with intermediate eccentricities and large semi-major axes, are now no longer in line with the observations. Further constraints from either astrometry or high-dispersion spectroscopy will take at least another decade such that GQ Lupi b has moved significantly enough in its orbit and/or changed its radial velocity.</p><p>The orbital solutions which are misaligned with the circumstellar disk are particularly intriguing. A companion in such an orbit must either have been scattered to that position, or it must have formed in situ, yet outside of the protoplanetary disk. The latter would indicate a formation scenario analogous to that of a binary star system, with the collapsing proto-stellar core fragmenting into smaller objects.</p><p>The orbit of GQ Lupi b is wide enough that disk instability is a possible formation mechanism. Fragmentation of the disk is allowed from approximately 50 au to 300 au <ref type="bibr">(Vorobyov &amp; Basu 2012)</ref>, and although only a small number of fragments are expected to survive to become orbiting planets or brown dwarfs, this is in line with the small number of observed systems that fit the description. HR 8799 and HIP 78530 are other examples. However, if GQ Lupi b formed in situ through disk instability, one would expect low eccentricity orbits within or near the plane of the circumstellar disk. This type of orbit is not supported by previous astrometric analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ginski et al. (2014b)</ref>, and our RV measurement strenthens this conclusion. Instead GQ Lupi b may have a high eccentricity orbit which could be an indication that the companion has been scattered to its current position.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary and conclusions</head><p>The young GQ Lupi system has a central Classical T Tauri star surrounded by a warm dust disk, and is orbited by a sub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b at ∼100 au, which is either a gas giant or a brown dwarf. We observed the parent star and the companion simultanously in the K-band by careful positioning of the slit of the high-dispersion spectrograph CRIRES, in combination with adaptive optics. We made use of both the spatial and spectral information to separate the spectrum of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both water and CO in the companion spectrum. The molecular lines are rotationally broadened and Doppler shifted due to the orbital motion of the companion. We have measured the projected rotation velocity to be v sin(i) = 5.3 +0.9 −1.0 km s −1 and the barycentric radial velocity to be RV=2.0 ± 0.4 km s −1 .</p><p>GQ Lupi b is a slow rotator compared to the giant planets in the Solar System, and to the recent spin measurements of the exoplanets β Pic b (v sin(i) =25 km s −1 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Snellen et al. (2014)</ref>) and 2M1207 b (v sin(i) =17 km s −1 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhou et al. (2016)</ref>). This is in spite of GQ Lupi b being likely more massive than either of these, and thus this new spin measurement does not agree with the spin-mass trend of the others. However, we argue that the slow spin is a manifestation of the young age of GQ Lupi, and that the discrepancy cannot be used to argue for fundamental differences in formation path at this time.</p><p>We have used the barycentric radial velocity measurement to place new constraints on orbital elements such as the semimajor axis, the eccentricity and the orbital inclination with respect to the observer. This shows the strength of high-dispersion spectroscopy, because it is possible to measure even small radial velocities.</p><p>The spin and RV measurements of GQ Lupi b demonstrate the potential of the combination of spatial and spectral filtering through the use of high dispersion spectrographs together with adaptive optics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

At such high tem- peratures the most abundant trace gas molecules in the K-band are expected to be CO and H 2 O. We have cross-correlated with models with CO or H 2 O as a single trace gas, as well as a suit of models containing both CO and H 2 O. The models were calcu- lated line by line, assuming H 2 -H 2 collision-induced absorption (Borysow et al. 2001; Borysow 2002). The CO and H 2 O data were taken from HITEMP 2010 (Rothman et al. 2010), and a Voigt line profile was employed. The models were constructed from a narrow grid of parame- terised temperature-pressure profiles. All the models are isother- mal with a temperature of T 0 = [1650 K, 1900 K, 2150 K] at pres- sures higher than p 0 = 1 bar. The temperature decreases with a constant lapse rate (i.e. the rate of temperature change with log pressure) until it reaches T 1 = [750 K, 1100 K, 1450 K, 1800 K] at pressure p 1 = [10 −1.5 bar, 10 −2.5 bar, 10 −3.5 bar, 10 −4.5 bar]. At higher altitudes or equivalently lower pressures the models are again isothermal. Both CO and H 2 O were tested with four differ- ent volume mixing ratios, VMR = [10 −5.5 , 10 −5.0 , 10 −4.5 , 10 −4.0 ]. Fig. 3 illustrates the CO-only, H 2 O-only and CO+H 2 O models with the best temperature-pressure profile (T/p) and volume mix- ing ratios from the grid.</figDesc></figure>

Spin as function of mass for extrasolar sub-stellar companions and Solar System planets, together with the free-floating planetary mass object PSO J318.5-22 and field brown dwarfs. The Solar System planets and 2M1207 b have equatorial rotation velocities and β Pictoris b and GQ Lupi b have projected rotation velocities, as does PSO J318.5-22. Mercury and Venus are not included in the plot because their proximity to the Sun has caused their spin to be dominated by tidal interactions with the Sun. For comparison, field brown dwarfs with estimated masses and either a rotational period measurement or v sin(i) measurement are shown as empty circles, with the typical uncertainty in mass indicated for a single object. Their masses and radii are from Filippazzo et al. (2015), rotational periods are from Metchev et al. (2015), and v sin(i)'s are from either Zapatero Osorio et al. (2006) or Blake et al. (2010). Note that the field brown dwarfs are much older than the substellar companions and PSO J318.5-22 with highly uncertain ages in the range 500 Myr to 10 Gyr.</figDesc></figure>
