			<abstract>
				<p>Super Earths and mini Neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric compositions, ranging from low-molecular mass atmospheres of H 2 to higher molecular atmospheres of water, CO 2 , N 2 , or other species. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the &quot;jet core&quot; region, where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level. The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to recent Kepler statistics, most of the population of known transiting planets (including planetary candidates) around GFKM stars is dominated by planets of size between one and four Earth radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Petigura et al. 2013</ref>). From small to large, those planets can be basically categorized into Earth-size planets, super Earths and mini Neptunes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). Many of them are expected to harbor atmospheres, several of which have been characterized, including GJ1214b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>), <ref type="bibr">GJ436b (Knutson et al. 2014a</ref>), HD 97658b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Knutson et al. 2014b</ref>), GJ 3470b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ehrenreich et al. 2014</ref>), and HAT-P-11b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fraine et al. 2014</ref>). When the planet is smaller than Jupiter and especially Neptune or Uranus, the atmosphere might no longer be solely dominated by hydrogen (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013</ref>). Compositional diversity of the atmospheres emerges, as seen on the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. However, identifying the compositions of those atmospheres is difficult because the transit spectroscopic measurements are influenced by hazes or clouds. In fact, four out of the above five planets show featureless transmission spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knutson et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Knutson et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ehrenreich et al. 2014</ref>), except HAT-P-11b that exhibits water absorption in a hydrogen environment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fraine et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Theoretically, the observable outer envelopes of the atmospheres of the sub-Jupiter-size planets could exhibit a variety of compositions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pierrehumbert 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu &amp; Seager 2014</ref>). The primordial constituents of the atmosphere are mostly determined by the metallicity of the protoplanetary disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marboeuf et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johnson et al. 2012</ref>), the details of gas accretion during planetary formation, location of the planetary formation, and subsequent migration tracks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>). The atmospheric bulk compositions will also be greatly influenced by many processes during evolution after planetary formation. Those processes include planetary and asteroid impacts, volcanism and outgassing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kite et al. 2009</ref>), plate tectonics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Elkins-Tanton &amp; Seager 2008)</ref>, atmospheresurface interaction, atmosphere-ocean exchange, atmospheric escape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hu et al. 2015</ref>), and possible biospheric processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Domagal- Goldman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Seager et al. 2013</ref>). Atmospheric dynamics and chemistry will also play significant roles in determining the observable atmospheric composition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Liang et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cooper &amp; Showman 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Segura et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zahnle et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kempton et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Par- mentier et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu &amp; Seager 2014)</ref>.</p><p>As a result, we expect to observe a large compositional diversity among sub-Jupiter-size exoplanets.</p><p>There could be hydrogen-dominated atmospheres as on Jupiter and hot Jupiters; more metal-rich (but still hydrogendominated) atmospheres like Uranus and Neptune; evaporated atmospheres dominated by helium (proposed for GJ436b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hu et al. 2015</ref>); or carbon dioxide atmosphere like those of Venus and Mars; water worlds (proposed for GJ1214b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rogers &amp; Seager 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller-Ricci &amp; Fort- ney 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nettelmann et al. 2011</ref>); nitrogen and oxy-gen atmosphere like Earth; nitrogen and methane atmosphere like Saturn's moon Titan; atmosphere of sulfur compounds like Jupiter's moon Io, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hu &amp; Seager 2014</ref>), or some metallic-based or silicon-based atmospheres if the planet is very close to the host star <ref type="bibr">(Schaefer &amp; Feg- ley 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Miguel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Schaefer et al. 2012</ref>). More quantitatively, given the metallicity and effective temperature, thermochemical and photochemical calculations have predicted a variety of possible bulk constituents for exo-planetary atmospheres (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu &amp; Seager 2014</ref>).</p><p>Most known exoplanets are close to their host stars and expected to be tidally locked with a synchronized rotation around the central star. Weather on those planets is intriguing. Previous studies mostly focused on the hydrogen atmospheres of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cooper &amp; Show- man 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Lin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Perna et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mayne et al. 2014</ref>), and Earth-like environments for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wordsworth 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lewis et al. (2010)</ref> has considered the effect of different atmospheric opacity sources on the general circulation for GJ436b, but the bulk composition of the atmosphere is still hydrogen. For another super Earth GJ1214b, whose bulk atmospheric composition is still under debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers &amp; Seager 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miller- Ricci &amp; Fortney 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nettelmann et al. 2011</ref>), Menou (2011) simulated the general circulation patterns and thermal phase curves for the hydrogen atmospheres of various metallicity, as well as for water-dominated atmospheres. He pointed out that the molecular weight and opacity have strong effects on the weather pattern. <ref type="bibr">Za- lucha et al. (2013)</ref> investigated the behavior this planet might exhibit if its atmosphere were water vapor. With a more realistic radiative transfer scheme, the dynamical simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kataria et al. (2014)</ref> further explored the effects of metallicity in hydrogen atmospheres as well as possible compositions including water, carbon dioxide and their mixtures on GJ1214b. They found that atmospheres with a lower mean-molecular weight have smaller day-night and equator-to-polar temperature contrast than higher mean-molecular weight atmospheres. They also showed that a water atmosphere exhibits an equatorial prograde jet, but a carbon-dioxide atmosphere is dominated by two high-latitude jets, suggesting significant bulk composition effects on the atmospheric dynamics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charnay et al. (2015a)</ref> investigated the impact of different metallicities in a hydrogen atmosphere on vertical mixing and circulation pattern on GJ1214b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charnay et al. (2015b)</ref> included the cloud tracers and its radiative feedbacks in the dynamical model but the atmosphere is still primarily dominated by hydrogen. To date, there has not been a systematic study on all possible bulk compositions, ranging from lighter molecules such as H 2 and He to heavier molecules such as N 2 and CO 2 , to investigate the underlying mechanism of their effects on the atmospheric dynamics and general circulation of tidally locked planets.</p><p>There are three important properties of an atmospheric species that could influence the atmospheric dynamics: opacity, molecular weight, and heat capacity. Opacity fundamentally controls the heating and cooling rates in the atmosphere, which drives the dynamics. Molecular weight greatly affects the scale height of an atmosphere, the buoyancy frequency, atmospheric wave properties such as gravity wave speed, and the deformation radius, which is a typical dynamical length scale in the atmosphere. Heat capacity also affects the radiative heating and cooling rates, buoyancy, wave speed and deformation radius, but in a different way from that of the molecular weight. Given the complicated roles the bulk composition could play, it is difficult to disentangle the underlying mechanisms if we consider all those effects together. Instead, here we use an idealized general circulation model (GCM) to study individual effects. Specifically, we investigate the effects of the molecular weight and heat capacity while holding fixed the day-night heating scheme. Note that gas opacity is commonly dominated by trace species that do not significantly affect the molecular mass, e.g., water and carbon dioxide in the case of Earth; water, carbon monoxide, and methane in the case of hot Jupiters. Jupiter itself has significant opacity contribution from the background hydrogen, but also from trace hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, and acetylene ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zhang et al. 2013</ref>). Therefore, we leave a thorough investigation of the opacity effect for the future.</p><p>This study has important implications for observations. We aim to build quantitative theories for the bulk composition effects using a series of analytical expressions and predict some observable signatures, including the spatial maps of wind and temperature, day-night temperature differences and thermal phase curves. It is expected that the atmospheric dynamics will have significant effects on these observables. For tidally locked planets, the day-night temperature difference and the shape of the thermal phase curve can be greatly influenced by the day-night heat redistribution efficiency and the presence of an equatorial prograde jet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Showman &amp; Guillot 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knutson et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cowan &amp; Agol 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman 2013;</ref>. The atmospheric wind speed might be directly measured through ultra-high resolution Doppler mapping techniques that have been applied to hot Jupiter HD209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>) and HD189733b <ref type="bibr">(Wyt- tenbach et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Louden &amp; Wheatley 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, measuring phase curves and winds might provide some hints on the properties of the bulk composition in the atmosphere. This may serve as an alternative way to overcome the current difficulties in determining the atmospheric composition of transiting super Earths/mini Neptunes that exhibit featureless spectra, such as GJ1214b.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will first provide some theoretical background on the effects of compositions on atmospheric dynamics. We will introduce the atmospheric circulation model and qualitatively summarize the main results from our simulations in Section 3. Then we will dig into the underlying physical mechanisms by which the temperature and wind patterns are affected by molecular weight (Section 4) and molar heat capacity (Section 5). We will also derive a series of analytical expressions to interpret the simulation results. This paper ends with a conclusion and implications for the observations in Section 6. The analytical treatment of temperature, wind and thermal phase shift are detailed in the Appendices. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Diversity of the Atmospheric Composition</head><p>Thermochemical and photochemical models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu &amp; Seager 2014</ref>) predict a variety of possible bulk constituents, depending on the metallically of the atmosphere, carbon to oxygen ratio, stellar flux, and atmospheric evolution. Plausible constituents exhibit a wide range of mean-molecular weight (µ) and molar heat capacity at constant pressure (c p ), summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Molecular weight can vary by a factor of ∼20, from 2 g mol −1 to 44 g mol −1 .The heat capacity, however, can only vary by a factor of ∼4, from 5R/2 for helium to about 11R for high-temperature methane, where R = 8.314 g mol −1 K −1 is the molar gas constant.</p><p>The molecular weight and molar heat capacity are independent properties of a gas molecule. The latter is solely controlled by the degrees of freedom of the molecule. The monatomic gas, helium, which could conceivably comprise the background atmospheric gas as a result of atmospheric escape processes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hu et al. 2015</ref>), has the lowest c p (5R/2). Diatomic gases, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and oxygen, have molar heat capacities ranging from 7R/2 at low temperature up to 9R/2 at high temperature for the vibrational modes to be fully excited. Multi-atomic molecules, such as a triatomic linear molecule carbon dioxide and more complex-structured molecules like water and methane, usually contain a larger number of degrees of freedom and therefore span a large range of c p . For example, the molar heat capacity of methane can reach more than 11R at 2000 K, although thermochemical equilibrium prefers forming carbon monoxide instead of methane at high temperature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013</ref>). From thermochemical calculations, CO and CH 4 will never dominate the bulk atmosphere, but their contribution to the mean molecular weight and molar heat capacity could be significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Effects on the Atmospheric Dynamics</head><p>Through what physical mechanisms could the molecular weight and molar heat capacity influence the atmospheric dynamics on a tidally locked planet, including observational signatures such as temperature and wind speed? For a tidally locked planet in the moderate temperature range, if the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effect can be ignored, the photospheric dynamics is approximately governed by the hydrostatic primitive equations. In pressure (p) coordinate, the equations are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D u Dt + f ˆ k × u + p Φ = F d (1a) ∂Φ ∂p = − 1 ρ (1b) p · u + ∂ω ∂p = 0 (1c) DT Dt − ωµ ρc p = qµ c p (1d) p = ρRT µ (1e)</formula><p>where ρ is density; µ is molecular weight; T is temperature; c p is molar heat capacity in units of J mol −1 K −1 ; ω = Dp/Dt is vertical velocity; Φ = gz is geopotential where g is gravitational acceleration and z is altitude; f = 2Ω sin φ is Coriolis parameter where Ω is the planetary rotation rate and φ is latitude; p is the horizontal gradient at constant pressure; u = (u, v) is the horizontal velocity at constant pressure where u is the zonal (east-west) velocity and v is the meridional (north-south) velocity; q is the radiative heating/cooling rate in units of J kg −1 s −1 . D/Dt = ∂/∂t + u · · p + ω∂/∂p is the material derivative; F d is a drag term representing missing physics such as sub-grid turbulent mixing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Li &amp; Goodman 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Youdin &amp; Mitchell 2010)</ref>. Here we have assumed that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic balance. This is generally a good assumption ( <ref type="bibr">Showman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Showman et al. 2008</ref>). For hot Jupiters, the non-hydrostatic models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mayne et al. (2014)</ref> exhibit qualitatively similar behavior (e.g., overall structure of the superrotating jet) to the hydrostatic models. Both the molecular weight and molar heat capacity appear in the thermodynamic equation (1d) and the molecular weight is also present the equation of state (1e). A change of the thermodynamic properties in the atmosphere (e.g., temperature) will directly feed back to the geopotential field and lead to a change of atmospheric motion. The major effects on the atmospheric dynamics can be categorized into radiative effects and dynamical effects.</p><p>The radiative heating and cooling is the primary driving force of the atmospheric dynamics on tidally locked planets. In principle, the three-dimensional profiles of heating and cooling (e.g., the strength and pressuredependence of the dayside heating and nightside cooling) are affected by opacities and therefore composition. As noted before, we do not investigate the opacity effect in this study. In order to isolate the effect of composition on the opacity from the other bulk composition effects, the simulations in this study share the same reference properties such as atmospheric opacity, planetary effective temperature, planetary mass, planetary radius, the same distance from the same host star and same cooling mechanism, but only differ in bulk compositions. The temperature change due to radiative heating and cooling also depends on the molecular weight and molar heat capacity (Eq. 1d). A higher molecular weight implies less molecules at a given pressure, resulting a greater temperature change rate, or equivalently a smaller radiative timescale. A higher molar heat capacity suggests that the atmosphere is more difficult to be heated and cooled, leading to a larger radiative timescale. For example, the radiative timescale in a hydrogen atmosphere is more than 15 times longer than the CO 2 atmosphere solely due to the effects of µ and c p .</p><p>The dynamical effect is also significant. A typical dynamical timescale in the atmosphere is the wave propagation timescale τ wave ∼ L/N H ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Showman et al. 2013</ref>), where L is a typical horizontal length scale (e.g., radius of the planet), N is the buoyancy frequency (BruntVäisälä frequency) of the atmosphere, and H = RT /µg is the pressure scale height. N H approximates the horizontal phase speed of long-vertical-wavelength gravity or Kelvin waves, which is greatly influenced by the molecular weight and molar heat capacity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N H = RT µ R c p − ∂lnT ∂lnp 1/2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The gravity wave speed N H inversely scales as µ 1/2 , implying that higher molecular-mass atmospheres have slower gravity/Kelvin wave speeds than lower-molecularmass atmospheres.</p><p>For an isothermal atmosphere (∂lnT /∂lnp = 0), N H inversely scales as c 1/2 p , implying that atmospheres whose molecules have more degrees of freedom likewise have slower gravity wave speeds. Nevertheless, because c p varies over a smaller range than µ for plausible compositions <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>), in practice, the effect of c p is generally secondary to the effect of µ on the wave speeds. An exception occurs if the temperature profile is close to an adiabat, because in that situation, R/c p is close to ∂lnT /∂lnp in Eq. <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. Small variations in c p can cause large fractional variations in the factor in square brackets, and therefore large fractional changes to the wave speeds and possibly the entire dynamic regime. We will see this effect in Section 5.</p><p>In an isothermal atmosphere, the wave propagation timescale τ wave can be estimated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">τ wave ∼ L/N H = L R µc p T 1/2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>showing that the typical dynamical timescale of the atmosphere increases with molecular weight and molar heat capacity. A useful atmospheric dynamic length scale is the Rossby deformation radius, within which the atmospheric flow is more significantly influenced by gravity and buoyancy effects instead of planetary rotation. In the equatorial region where the Coriolis parameter is small, the Rossby deformation radius (L e ) can be approximated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L e ∼ N H β 1/2 ∼ RT β 2 µ R c p − ∂lnT ∂lnp 1/4 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The meridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter β = ∂f /∂y = 2Ω cos φ/R p for planetary radius R p and latitude φ. For a given temperature-pressure profile, the deformation radius always decreases as µ and c p increase. A smaller Rossby deformation radius implies that the typical dynamical features in the system, such as the stable vortex size, are smaller.</p><p>The interaction between the radiative effect and dynamical effect is complicated and often leads to noticeable effects on atmospheric dynamics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Showman et al. (2013)</ref> showed that hot Jupiters should experience two distinct circulation regimes depending on the relative importance of wave propagation and radiative relaxation. If the radiative timescale is sufficiently short compared with wave propagation timescale, the waves will be damped and jet formation will be inhibited <ref type="bibr">(Show- man &amp; Polvani 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Showman et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsai et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Zhang &amp; Showman 2014)</ref>. Therefore the general circulation pattern in the atmosphere is dominated by a substellar-to-antistellar (day-to-night) divergent flow pattern instead of the equatorial zonal jet. In this situation, there is a large day-night temperature difference and small atmospheric hot spot shift in the thermal phase curve. On the other hand, if the radiative timescale is sufficiently long compared with wave propagation timescale, the atmospheric flow will self-organize to form a zonal jet pattern. If we assume the radiative timescale increases with pressure, as generally it does (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Iro et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Showman et al. 2008</ref>), the general circulation pattern in the atmosphere is expected to exhibit a "regime shift" from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated regime in the deeper atmosphere. Just such a transition in fact occurs in GCM simulations of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cooper &amp; Show- man 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Showman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heng et al. 2011</ref>). An intuitive measure of this transition is the ratio of radiative timescale versus the wave propagation timescale: τ rad /τ wave , and both the molecular weight and molar heat capacity play important roles in this ratio. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">NUMERICAL AND GENERAL RESULTS</head><p>To quantitatively understand the above effects on a tidally locked planet, we simulate the atmospheric circulation using a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model. Previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Thrastarson &amp; Cho 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Polichtchouk &amp; Cho 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Mayne et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Cho et al. 2015</ref>) demonstrated that the simulation results might be sensitive to the specifications such as forcing and dissipation setup, initial condition and numerical schemes used in different dynamical cores. In this study, we adopted the MITgcm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adcroft et al. 2004</ref>) dynamical core that solves the primitive equations using the finite volume method in a cubesphere grid. MITgcm has been extensively used in studying atmospheric dynamics on planets in and out of the solar system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adcroft et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lian &amp; Showman 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kataria et al. 2014</ref>). A detailed investigation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Liu &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> on tidally locked planets showed that, under their prescription for forcing and damping, the equilibrated state of the model does not exhibit significant sensitivity to initial conditions. The similar conclusion was also reached by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cho et al. (2015)</ref> when both Newtonian cooling and Rayleigh drag are presented in the lower region to dissipate the hot-Jupiter system.</p><p>For simplicity, we consider a planet with zero obliquity and in a circular orbit around its host star. We assume the radius, mass and rotation period of the idealized planet are 2.7 Earth radii, 6.5 Earth mass, and 1.365×10 5 s, respectively. Those properties are similar to GJ1214b. The horizontal resolution of our simulations is C32 in a cubesphere grid, corresponding to 128×64 in longitude and latitude, respectively. We use 40 levels from about 10 Pa to 10 8 Pa, evenly spaced in log pressure. We use a time step of 15 second. We apply a fourthorder Shapiro filter to the time derivatives of horizontal velocities and potential temperature with a damping time-scale of 25 second to ensure the numerical stability. The simulations were performed for at least 4000 Earth days in model time so that the statistical properties we will analyze and discuss in this study have reached the equilibrated state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Liu &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> has showed that for typical tidally locked exoplanet configurations, the C32 resolution runs exhibit almost the same results as C64 (256×128) and C128 (512×256). We tested several cases in this study in the C64 grid and 80 levels and the results are consistent with our lower-resolution runs. Finally, all the variables were averaged over the last 350 days in our analysis.</p><p>We adopt Newtonian cooling approximation as a simple radiative heating and cooling scheme. The heating term in Eq. (1d) is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">qµ c p = T eq − T (t) τ rad .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>If GJ1214b has a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, we estimated the radiative timescale τ rad,H2 on the order of 10 5 s based on a simple gray cooling scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">τ rad,H2 ∼ p τ =1 µg c p 4σT 3 (6)</formula><p>where p τ =1 is the pressure level at which the opacity of the atmosphere reaches unity. Motivated by earlier studies using Newtonian cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Liu &amp; Showman 2013</ref>, we assume that the vertical profile of radiative timescale increases as a power law of pressure, ranging from 10 4 s at 10 Pa to 10 7 s at 10 8 Pa ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ rad,H2 (p) =    10 4</formula><p>p &lt; 10 2 Pa 10 5/2 p 3/4 10 2 Pa &lt; p &lt; 10 6 Pa 10 7 p &gt; 10 6 Pa</p><p>As noted before, we assume the same opacity for all compositions, implying that p τ =1 is constant. Based on Eq. (6), the radiative timescale τ rad for other compositions can be scaled based on molecular weight and molar heat capacity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">τ rad (p) = τ rad,H2 (p) c p 7R/2 2 µ .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The spatial distribution of the radiative equilibrium temperature T eq is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T eq (λ, φ, p) = T n (p) + ∆T eq (p) cos λ cos φ dayside T n (p) nightside (9)</formula><p>where λ is longitude and we assume a homogeneous equilibrium temperature in the nightside T n (p) = T 0 (p) − ∆T eq (p)/2. The equilibrium temperature difference ∆T eq is 600 K at the top of the atmosphere and decreases towards zero at the bottom in a linear fashion with ln p. The mean temperature T 0 is calculated using a simplified radiative scheme from Guillot (2010) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The vertical temperature profile is designed to be stably stratified, meaning that its vertical gradient, ∂lnT eq /∂lnp, does not exceed R/c p for all compositions. We assume a linear drag scheme in the momentum equation (Eq. 1a), F d = u/τ drag . The drag coefficient (1/τ drag ) is assumed as 10 −7 s −1 at the bottom of the domain (10 8 Pa) and decreases linearly with decreasing pressure to zero at 10 6 Pa, above which the atmosphere is essentially drag-free. For simplicity, we assume in each simulation that the value of c p is a constant (using the value at 600 K, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Thus, we are neglecting the temperature dependence of the heat capacity. In most cases we expect this temperature dependence to be a secondary effect, so this should be a reasonable assumption <ref type="bibr">10</ref>   <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-Vertical profiles of the mean temperature (black) and a reference radiative timescale (blue) for hydrogen atmosphere (cp = 7R/2 and µ = 2 g mol −1 ).</p><p>for the present study. Our tests show that this assumption is actually sufficient to diagnose the role of c p on the atmospheric dynamics.</p><p>We specifically designed four sets of experiments to investigate the effects and mechanisms. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes our simulation experiments. The Experiment I includes the standard cases with five typical constituents: H 2 , He, H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 . In Experiment II, we keep c p fixed and vary µ to study the molecular weight effect at constant molar heat capacity. The Experiment III is very similar to II but we fix the radiative timescale τ rad to separate the radiative effect from dynamical effect of µ. The Experiment IV, in which we keep µ constant and vary c p in the simulations, is designed to investigate the molar heat capacity effect at constant molecular weight. The radiative timescale τ rad in I, II and IV is allowed to vary between simulations but it is fixed in III.</p><p>The standard simulations (Experiment I) exhibit important features and trends in the longitude-latitude temperature and wind maps and the zonal-mean zonal wind (u) distributions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3)</ref> 1 . The temperature and wind maps from Experiment II <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>) look very similar to that from Experiment I, implying that the molecular weight effect dominates over the molar heat capacity effect. In order to tie the simulation results to the observations and better understand the theoretical trends, we define several quantities: the day-night temperature contrast, phase offsets of flux peak before the time of secondary eclipse in the thermal phase curve, root-mean-square (RMS) of the wind speed U rms , averaged zonal-mean zonal wind speed in the equatorial region U z , and the pressure where the zonal-mean zonal jet speed reaches a maximum (hereafter the "jet core" region). The above quantities exhibit the same trends in Experiments I and II as a function molecular weight from H 2 to CO 2 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. In the following, we summarize the major trends and qualitatively describe the possible mechanisms.</p><p>1 As a notation, we use the overbar to denote a zonal average. A quantity A can be decomposed as A = A + A , where A is the zonal-mean value averaged over a latitude circle and A is the local departure from the zonal average or so-called "eddy" value.</p><p>(1) The temperature contrast at the same pressure level between the dayside and nightside increases with molecular weight <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. We adopted the normalized day-night temperature difference (A) on a global scale, similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> and :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A(p) = 3 2π π/3 −π/3 [T (λ, φ, p) − T (φ, p)] 2 [T eq (λ, φ, p) − T (φ, p)] 2 1/2 dφ.</formula><p>(10) A ∼ 0 represents homogenous longitudinal temperature distribution and A ∼ 1 represents a temperature distribution close to the radiative equilibrium temperature pattern. The normalized temperature difference varies from 0.2 in the H 2 case to about 1 in the CO 2 case <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. As the molecular weight increases, the radiative timescale decreases and the dynamical timescale (wave propagation timescale) increases, leading to a more efficient relaxation of the thermal field towards the radiative equilibrium state and increase of the day-night temperature contrast. A smaller wind speed in highermolecular-weight atmosphere ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>) also acts less efficiently to redistribute heat and smooth the thermal field by advection.</p><p>(2) The phase offset before the secondary eclipse, which corresponds to a hot spot in the atmosphere shifted east of the sub-stellar point <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>, left column), decreases with increasing molecular weight <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref>). As discussed in trend (1), the decrease of the radiative timescale and the zonal wind speed with molecular weight helps maintain the radiative equilibrium thermal field, weakening the ability of advection to distort the temperature field.</p><p>(3) The RMS wind speed U rms decreases with molecular weight <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref>). Here we calculated U rms based on horizontal wind speeds u and v weighted by area over a 120 degree latitude band at each pressure level:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U rms (p) = 1 √ 3 π/3 −π/3 u(λ, φ, p) 2 + v(λ, φ, p) 2 cos φdφ 1/2 .</formula><p>(11) However, this decreasing trend is less related to the changes of radiative and dynamical timescales. A smaller U rms in the CO 2 atmosphere than the H 2 atmosphere is more associated with that the atmospheric scale height is smaller in the CO 2 atmosphere than that in the H 2 atmosphere. An atmosphere composed of heavier molecules will have a smaller day-night pressure-gradient force, leading to a smaller wind field in general. A more rigorous discussion on the wind speed will be presented in Section 4.3.</p><p>(4) The latitudinal width of the equatorial jet decreases with increasing molecular weight <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> presents the e-folding width of the equatorial zonal jet as function of molecular weight. In the H 2 case, the zonal-mean zonal wind is dominated by a broad eastward equatorial jet, which, over at least certain ranges of pressure, extends nearly to the poles. The jet width shrinks with increasing molecular weight. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> shows that, for the case of H 2 O, the equatorial jet is sufficiently narrow to allow room for broad regions of westward flow at mid-to-high latitudes. For N 2 and CO 2 , the equatorial jet is even narrower, and and two new high-latitude eastward wind regions appear. The same trends emerge in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> when molecular mass is varied while holding molar heat capacity constant. This trend is related to the decrease of dynamical length scale with increasing molecular weight.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">−180° −120° −60° 0° 60° 120° 180° −90° −60° −30° 0° 30° 60° 90° −180° −120° −60° 0° 60° 120° 180° Longitude (Degree) −90° −60° −30° 0° 30° 60° 90° Latitude (Degree) −180° −120° −60° 0° 60° 120° 180° −</formula><p>(5) At the same pressure, the general circulation pattern gradually shifts from the zonal-jet-dominated regime to the day-to-night circulation regime as the molecular weight increases <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>, left column). Correspondingly, the jet core pressure occurs deeper in the atmosphere (right column of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4, Fig. 5</ref>). This is closely related to the interplay between the radiative timescale and wave propagation timescale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Showman et al. (2013)</ref> showed that when the radiative timescale is significantly less than the wave-propagation timescale, the atmosphere tends to be dominated by a day-night flow. Whereas strong zonal jets emerge when the radiative timescale is comparable to or longer than the wave propagation timescale. Because the ratio of the radiative timescale to the wave propagation timescale τ rad /τ wave decreases with increasing molecular weight, the transition between the day-to-night circulation regime and the jet-dominated regime moves deeper into the atmosphere.</p><p>(6) We defined the root-mean-square of the equatorial zonal-mean zonal wind speed U z and the eddy component U e over a 60 degree latitude band:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">U z (p) = π/6 −π/6 u(φ, λ, p) 2 cos φdφ 1/2 (12) U e (p) = π/6 −π/6 u (φ, λ, p) 2 cos φdφ 1/2<label>(13)</label></formula><p>If the zonal velocity u is much larger than the meridional velocity v, U rms in the equatorial domain (Eq. 11, but averaged in the equatorial region) can be related to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">U z and U e via U 2 rms ≈ U 2 z + U 2 e .</formula><p>The maximum zonalmean zonal wind U z in the atmosphere ("jet core speed") decreases with molecular weight. This might be associated with the trends (3) and (5).</p><p>The molar heat capacity has a secondary effect, which can be seen from the small deviation between the typical composition simulations and the cases with molar heat capacity fixed <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref>), for instance, the small departure between the He case and the case with the same molecular weight (4 g mol −1 ) but c p fixed (hereafter "mass-4"), and also the difference between the CO 2 case and the mass-44 case. More discussion will be presented in Section 5.</p><p>Next we will present analytical theories and quantitatively discuss each of those trends. In order to elaborate the dependence of these trends on the molecular weight more clearly, our discussion will mainly focus on the Experiment II. .-Summary of the major trends 1 to 6 as a function of molecular weight for Experiment I (blue) and II (black).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Trend 1: Day-night Temperature Contrast</head><p>The dayside-nightside temperature difference is a fundamental aspect of the overall circulation and moreover directly controls the amplitude of the phase variation in infrared phase curves-a major observable. Our simulations show that the day-night temperature difference increases with molecular weight <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3-4)</ref>. This results from the effect of the molecular weight on both the dynamics and on the radiative timescale via Eq. (5). To separate these effects, Experiment III shows how the day-night temperature difference varies with molecular mass when the radiative timescale is held fixed as the hydrogen case (Eq. 7). The longitude-latitude maps of temperature are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref>. The integrated dayside-nightside temperature difference A, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>, indicate that even when radiative time constant is held fixed, the day-night temperature difference increases with molecular mass-though more weakly than in the Experiment II.</p><p>Here, we discuss the physical reasons for all of these trends and compare them to theory. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez- Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> and  presented analytical theories for the day-night temperature difference on hot Jupiters; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> constructed their theory for a 1.5-layer shallow-water model, and  extended it to the three-dimensional primitive equations. Here, we show that the  theory explains our simulated trends well. We also present a modified form of the  theory that, while incorporating the same assumptions, is more analytically compact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> and  pointed out that the day-night temperature difference is controlled by several intrinsic timescales in the atmosphere, including the rotational timescale, radiative timescale, wave propagation timescale, horizontal and vertical advection timescale, and the frictional drag timescale (if drag is present). By combining the horizontal momentum equation and the thermodynamic energy equation under the "Weak Temperature Gradient" (WTG) approximation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sobel et al. 2001</ref>), we can obtain analytical expressions for a proxy of day-night temperature difference (A = ∆T /∆T eq ) and the RMS wind velocity U rms , on synchronously rotating planets. In the momentum equation, the day-night pressure gradient force, which results from the day-night temperature difference and is responsible for driving the circulation, is primarily balanced against the largest of the Coriolis, horizontal-advection, vertical-advection, and frictional-drag forces per mass, respectively. The four possible balances lead to four distinct expressions for A, along with conditions that determine which of these four regimes applies in any given portion of the parameter space . This separation into regimes is helpful for clarifying our understanding of the behavior in each regime. Nevertheless, it would be useful to obtain a single analytic expression for A that interpolates smoothly between the regimes. Here we united the above four regimes and achieved a single and close-form expression of A in Appendix A:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A = ∆T ∆T eq ∼ 1 − 2 α + α 2 + 4γ 2<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where the non-dimensional parameters α and γ are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">α = 1 + (Ω + 1 τ drag )τ 2 wave τ rad ∆ ln p (15) γ = τ 2 wave τ rad τ adv,eq ∆ ln p<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Here, τ drag is the frictional drag timescale. τ wave = L/N H is the timescale for horizontal wave propagation. The quantity τ adv,eq = L/U eq is a reference advective timescale due to the "equilibrium cyclostrophic wind" U eq = (R∆T eq ∆ ln p/2µ) 1/2 , which is a hypothetical, reference wind speed that would result from acceleration of the wind from day to night due to the day-night pressure gradient if the day-night temperature difference were in radiative equilibrium and if the Rossby number exceeds unity (compare to <ref type="bibr">Showman et al. 2010, Eq. 48</ref>). In the above, ∆ ln p is the difference in log pressure between some deep pressure where the day-night temperature difference is small (10 bars in the theory and simulations from  and some smaller pressure of interest in the observable atmosphere. See <ref type="bibr">Ko- macek &amp; Showman (2016)</ref> for more details about the motivations for and assumptions underlying the theory, and comparisons with a grid of GCM simulations for hot Jupiters covering a wide range of τ rad and τ drag .</p><p>This theory implies that the day-night temperature contrast is smaller if the radiative timescale is larger or the dynamical timescale is smaller. To view the dependence on molecular weight, we evaluate each term in α and γ. Assuming the dynamical length scale L is constant (representing a planetary radius associated with the day-night temperature contrast, for example), then τ wave ∝ µ 1/2 in an isothermal atmosphere (Eq. 3) and the advective timescale τ adv,eq is scaled as µ 1/2 . If τ rad is considered constant, then the second term in the expression for α (Eq. 15) is proportional to µ, and γ ∝ µ 1/2 (Eq. 16). Whereas if τ rad scales inversely with µ as expected from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(8)</ref>, then the second term in the expression for α is proportional to µ 2 and γ ∝ µ 3/2 . Therefore, Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref> predicts that the day-night temperature contrast should increase with the molecular weight, and this dependence should be weaker in the case where τ rad is constant than in the case where τ rad decreases with increasing molecular weight. Both predictions are qualitatively consistent with the trends in our simulations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>.</p><p>This theory implies that in the limit of very high molecular mass (µ → ∞), the atmospheric temperature structure tends toward radiative equilibrium. This can be seen from the fact that, in this limit, the denominator in the second term on the righthand side of Eq. (14) becomes infinite, which therefore implies that A → 1. The convergence toward radiative equilibrium as µ → ∞ is fastest if we allow τ rad to scale inversely with µ (Eq. 8) but occurs even if τ rad were taken to be independent of molecular weight.</p><p>What is the physical reason for the convergence toward   <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.-Normalized temperature difference between the dayside and nightside as a function of molecular weight from Experiment II (black for 700 Pa, red for 5700 Pa and green for 23100 Pa) and Experiment III (gray for 700 Pa, orange for 5700 Pa and blue for 23100 Pa). Dashed lines are the prediction from Eq. <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. radiative equilibrium at high molecular mass? <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez- Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> and  showed that the day-night temperature difference is regulated by a wave-adjustment mechanism: planetary-scale waves that propagate from the dayside to the nightside act to adjust isentropes up or down in an attempt to flatten them, which, acting in isolation, attempts to produce a state with minimal daynight temperature differences. This process operates efficiently when the waves can propagate from the dayside to the nightside faster than radiation or friction can act to damp them. On the other hand, if friction or radiation damps the waves before they propagate from the dayside to the nightside, then the wave-adjustment mechanism is suppressed, and the day-night temperature difference becomes large. In the limit of high molecular mass (µ → ∞), the wave speeds N H become slow, and therefore the day-night wave propagation timescale τ wave becomes long (Eq. 3)-which gives the atmosphere ample time to respond to radiation for any plausible, finite value of τ rad . In other words, the limit µ → ∞ corresponds to the limit where the wave-adjustment mechanism acts less and less efficiently, allowing it to be easily suppressed.</p><p>Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref> also quantitatively predicts the day-night temperature difference from first principles. In our study, drag is not important above the bottom frictional layer (inviscid limit) therefore τ drag can be neglected. We use the mean temperature profile T 0 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> to estimate τ wave . At 700 Pa, taking the horizontal length scale as L ∼ R p = 1.71 × 10 7 m, T 0 ∼ 550 K, ∆T eq ∼ 500 K, and radiative timescale based on Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(8)</ref>, we obtain the theoretical curve of A as function of molecular weight <ref type="figure">(Fig.  7)</ref>. The predictions agree fairly well with our simulation results. A comparison of the theory with the simulations at other pressure levels demonstrates good agreement as well <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>.</p><p>The theory also predicts that A should decrease with increasing pressure. Among the parameters in α and γ, τ rad increases by several orders of magnitude from the top to the bottom of the atmosphere, while the other parameters such as τ wave , τ adv,eq and ∆ ln p have much weaker pressure dependence. From Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref>, A should monotonically decrease with pressure. Since ∆T eq also decreases with increasing pressure, the day-night temperature contrast should be smaller in the deeper atmosphere, consistent with our simulation results.</p><p>We also investigated the significance of the radiation effect versus the dynamical effect. In Experiment III, we fixed the radiative timescale for all simulations regardless of molecular weight. The resulting day-night temperature difference is much lower than the simulations where τ rad changes with µ <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>, suggesting an important role of the radiative relaxation. For the analytical prediction, we use a constant radiative timescale τ rad ∼ 4.38 × 10 4 s but keep the same previous parameters, the theoretical prediction agrees reasonably well with the Experiment III simulations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Trend 2: Thermal Phase Curve and Phase Shift</head><p>Due to the strong equatorial prograde jet, the temperature maximum is advected eastward with respect with the sub-stellar point, causing the peak of thermal flux to become shifted before the secondary eclipse. This phase offset was first predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Showman &amp; Guillot (2002)</ref> and later confirmed by thermal phase curve observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knutson et al. 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref> systematically investigated the relationship between the horizontal advection and the thermal phase curve in a semi-analytic model.

Note that longitude is defined such that λ = 0 • is the substellar point and λ = 180 • is the anti-stellar point.</p><p>Then we removed the mean of the integrated flux and obtain a normalized "thermal phase curve" C(δ, p) at each pressure level (p) as a function of orbital phase (in degrees):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">C(δ, p) = F (δ, p) − −F (δ, p) F (δ, p)<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where F (δ, p) denotes the averaged flux over the full phase. Note that the "thermal phase curve" defined in this study is slightly different from the realistic observed light curves because we did not perform radiative transfer calculation that includes all pressure levels. Instead, our thermal phase curve defined at pressure level p should be understood as an approximation in which we assume that the weighting function of the outgoing thermal flux at certain wavelength has a sharp peak at pressure level p and therefore the contribution from other pressure levels is neglected.</p><p>The normalized thermal phase curves at 5700 Pa for the standard cases are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 8</ref>. For clarity, the primary and secondary eclipses are not shown here. There is a clear anti-correlation between the phase offset before the secondary eclipse (δ = 180 • ) and the amplitude of the phase curve. From hydrogen to CO 2 , the phase shift is less as the amplitude increases. The thermal phase curve of the CO 2 case is almost symmetric about the secondary eclipse, and the amplitude of the maximum flux is actually larger than twice of the mean emergent flux. Although the phase curve is an integrated effect of the temperature distribution, we found that the degree of thermal phase shift (δ s ) with respect to the secondary eclipses can be approximated by longitudinal offset of temperature maximum (λ m ) with respect to the substellar point in our simulations.</p><p>Our previous theory for day-night temperature difference (Eq. 14) only predicts a global-average quantity A but does not provide the longitudinal variation of the temperature, especially the offset of the temperature field. In order to quantitatively investigate the thermal phase shift, we construct in Appendix B a simple kinematic model to study how the longitudinal temperature distribution is influenced by a constant zonal wind. Our procedure is similar to that in Cowan &amp; Agol (2011) but different in the radiative relaxation schemes. To ensure consistency with our 3D simulations, we adopt the Newtonian cooling scheme where the relaxation rate is proportional to temperature, while in Cowan &amp; Agol (2011) the relaxation rate is proportional to T 3 . In Appendix B we show that the temperature distribution and therefore the thermal phase curve can be characterized by three parameters in the atmosphere: T n , ∆T eq , and ξ, where ξ = τ rad /τ adv is the ratio between the radiative timescale τ rad and the advection timescale τ adv . The advection timescale here should be defined as τ adv = L/u for a specified zonal-mean zonal wind u.

When λ m is small, λ m ≈ λ s = tan −1 ξ. Given our expectation that the longitudinal offset of the hot spot (λ m , as measured in degrees) is similar to the phase shift of the flux peak in the lightcurve (δ s , again expressed in degrees), Eq. (19) can thus be used to estimate the phase shift in the lightcurve for a particular model. Note that λ m only depends on ξ. It implies the thermal phase shift δ s might be mainly dominated by ξ as well (see Appendix B for more discussion). If we take τ adv ∼ R p /u where u is calculated from the simulations (Eq. 12, but averaged from latitude −60 • to 60 • ), the predicted phase shifts from Eq. (19) agree fairly well with the thermal phase shift in all simulation cases for several pressure levels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Fig. 9)</ref>. It suggests that our kinematic thermal model has captured the essential physics to explain the zonal distribution of thermodynamic quantities in 3D simulations.</p><p>Our simple theory reveals an essential relationship between the phase shift and two fundamental timescales in the system. If the radiative timescale is very short relative to the advective timescale, i.e., τ rad /τ adv ∼ 0, then δ s ∼ 0 • , meaning that there is no thermal phase shift. The atmosphere thermal structure is entirely controlled by the radiation and retains the equilibrium temperature distribution, T ∼ T eq . On the other hand, if the radiative timescale is very long compared with the advective timescale, then the phase offset shifts toward 90 degrees, and the predicted amplitude of the phase curve variation goes to zero. The increasing trend of thermal phase shift with τ rad /τ adv qualitatively agrees with the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Menou (2011)</ref>.</p><p>The trend of the horizontal temperature distribution is mainly due to the molecular weight effect, as evidenced by the similarities between Experiment I <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3)</ref> and Experiment II <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. The radiative timescale is inversely proportional to the molecular weight (Eq. 9). The advective timescale τ adv due to the zonal-mean zonal wind increases with molecular weight <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Therefore, the ratio τ rad /τ adv must decrease with increasing molecular weight, and correspondingly, the thermal phase shift decreases, as shown in Experiments I and II <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 10)</ref>. Since τ rad increases dramatically ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) with pressure and τ adv has a weaker dependence on pressure (suggested by u in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>, the theory implies that the phase shift is larger at greater depth in the atmosphere. Our simulations confirm that the phase shifts increase with pressure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig. 9)</ref>.

Again, this is essentially identical to the prediction from  except that it combines their distinct expressions from the multiple regimes (for possible balances in the momentum equation) into a single expression that smoothly varies between the regimes and is valid across the entire parameter space. Recall that the the hypothetical "equilibrium cyclostrophic wind" U eq = (R∆T eq ∆ ln p/2µ) 1/2 is inversely propositional to the square root of the molecular weight (Section 4.1). The ratio of the wind speed to U eq solely depends on a single parameter α/2γ.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">U U eq ∼ (α/2γ) 2 + 1 − α/2γ<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Our simulations show that the RMS wind speed decreases with increasing molecular weight <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 11</ref>). With the same parameters in Section 4.1 for 700 Pa, the predicted wind speeds are in a good agreement with the simulation results in high molecular weight cases but underestimate the low-molecular-weight simulation results (e.g., µ &lt; 10 g mol −1 ) by a factor of 2 to 3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 11)</ref>. The analytical expression of wind speed at a given pressure level generally shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of molecular weight in the low molecular weight regime, which is not consistent with the numerical simulations. At larger pressure levels, the predicted wind speeds are smaller than the simulations for all molecular weight cases. The agreement is worse in the lower molecular regime. It seems the predicted wind speeds decrease much faster towards deeper atmosphere than that in the numerical simulations. This factor of 2 to 3 discrepancy between model and theory have been seen in hydrogen atmosphere simulations (hot Jupiters) in <ref type="bibr">Ko- macek &amp; Showman (2016)</ref> with large drag timescale and radiation timescale, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Perez-Becker &amp; Show- man (2013)</ref>, suggesting some caveats in our analytical scaling theory. The cause has yet to be investigated.</p><p>It is worth considering more theoretical details in the limit of high molecular weight. We showed in Section 4.1 that, at high molecular weight limit (µ → ∞), the temperature converges toward the radiative-equilibrium temperature structure (A ∼ 1 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7)</ref>. This results from the fact that the wave speeds in the high molecular weight limit become slow, which means that the wave-adjustment mechanism that regulates the day-night temperature differences (Perez-Becker &amp; Showman 2013; Komacek &amp; Showman 2016) becomes easily suppressed. Thus, we can simply replace ∆T with ∆T eq in the momentum equation (A.1a in Appendix A). For a drag-free atmosphere, the momentum equation then becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">U 2 L + ΩU ∼ R∆T eq ∆ ln p 2µL<label>(23)</label></formula><p>This directly yields wind velocity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">U U eq ∼ Ro −2 eq + 1 − Ro −1 eq<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where Ro eq ≡ 2U eq /ΩL is the Rossby number associated with the "equilibrium cyclostrophic wind" U eq . The wind speed predicted by Eq. (24) agrees quantitatively well with the simulations for the high mass cases at 700 Pa <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 11)</ref>. Strictly speaking, Eq. (23) and (24) are only valid when ∆T = ∆T eq , which occurs in the limit where the molecular weight is sufficiently large, i.e., µ → ∞, so that U eq → 0 and Ro eq → 0, leading to U = U 2 eq /ΩL ∝ µ −1 in Eq. <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. In other words, in this limit, since the pressure-gradient force (right hand side of Eq. 23) is sufficiently weak, we expect the winds to be weak-the term quadratic in speed, U 2 /L, will become smaller than the linear term ΩU . Therefore the inverse dependence of pressure-gradient force on µ translates directly into an inverse dependence of U on µ.</p><p>However, in reality, the horizontal temperature difference ∆T in the cases with µ &gt; 10 g mol −1 at low pressures in Experiment II is already fairly close to the radiative-equilibrium temperature contrast ∆T eq <ref type="figure">(Fig.  7)</ref>. Therefore, Eq. (23) and (24) are also a good approximation for atmospheres with moderate molecular weight at those pressure levels. Based on Eq. (24), if the Rossby number Ro eq 1, U = U eq ∝ µ −1/2 ; if Ro eq 1, then U = U 2 eq /ΩL ∝ µ −1 . As the molecular weight increases, the pressure-gradient force deceases, leading to a smaller U eq and smaller Rossby number Ro eq . As a result, the dependence of RMS wind speed on molecular weight will gradually shift from the µ −1/2 regime to the µ −1 regime. In our simulations, the wind speed U decreases with µ in a trend between µ −1/2 and µ −1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 11)</ref>.</p><p>The physical reason that the wind speed decreases with increasing molecular mass in the high mass limit is straightforward. In a hydrostatically balanced atmosphere, the pressure-gradient force is essentially the result of a vertical integral over the day-night temperature difference. At high molecular mass, the scale height is small, and thus there is not much altitude difference between the photosphere pressure and the pressure of a given deep isobar where the day-night temperature difference is small. The larger the molecular mass, the smaller is the altitude range over which the day-night temperature difference acts. This leads to a smaller pressuregradient force, which manifests as the inverse µ dependence in the right hand side of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref>. As a result, the RMS wind speed, which is the solution of the Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref> and directly driven by the pressure-gradient force, should decrease with increasing molecular weight accordingly. Vertically, because the pressure-gradient force decreases towards deeper into the atmosphere, U rms decreases towards higher pressure for all cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 12)</ref>. Eq. (24) also shows that, in a drag-free atmosphere, the theoretical wind speeds in the high molecular weight regime are solely controlled by three parameters: the planetary rotation rate, equilibrium day-night temperature difference and molecular weight of the atmosphere. Importantly, this implies that the wind speeds become independent of molar heat capacity and the mean temperature of the atmosphere. The high-molecular-mass limit-which corresponds to the limit where the daynight temperature difference converges toward radiative equilibrium-only applies when the wave timescale is sufficiently long compared to the radiative timescale. Nevertheless, this condition readily becomes satisfied when the molecular mass is large, µ &gt; 10 g mol −1 at low pressures in our simulations, for example. Once that limit is reached, the wave and radiative timescales no longer directly influence the wind speeds. Our simulations seem to support this argument. The wind speeds exhibit the same trend in Experiments II and III in which the radiative timescale is fixed for all cases, implying that the radiation timescale does not control the wind speed. We also did an extra experiment (not shown here) based on the standard cases with mean temperature enhanced by a factor of 3 but keeping ∆T eq . The resulting U rms is roughly the same as that in Experiment I, implying that the mean thermal state has negligible effect on the wind speed. Finally, the agreement of Experiments I and II suggests that the molar heat capacity effect is not important <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p></div>

In this case, the atmosphere exhibits a day-to-night flow pattern. If the radiative timescale is longer than the wave propagation timescale (τ rad &gt; τ wave ), the atmosphere is dominated by an equatorial zonal jet. In our case, the radiative timescale is small in the upper atmosphere and increases with pressure (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), and therefore it is possible that the general circulation pattern shifts from a day-to-night divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the deeper atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Show- man et al. 2013</ref>).

In the regime of zonal jets deep in the atmosphere, the zonal wind has similar sign at many longitudes along a given latitude circle, and thus the zonal-mean zonal wind is strong. Our models suggest that at and below the photosphere level, the zonal-mean temperature is generally warmer at the equator than at high latitudes, and this implies through a generalized thermal-wind balance that, starting from some deep level of assumed weak winds, the zonal-mean zonal winds will increase with height in the jet-dominated regime. However, in the regime of day-to-night flow, there is a significant cancellation of the eastward-and westward-flowing branches along any given latitude circle, which causes the zonal-mean zonal wind to become weak, even if the local values of the day-night eddy winds themselves are large. Thus, in the divergent flow regime, one might expect the zonal-mean zonal winds to decrease with increasing altitude. The implication is a maximum of zonal-mean zonal wind with pressure near the transition between these regimes. Interestingly, at altitudes above this maximum, the decrease of zonal-mean zonal winds with altitude would necessarily imply a reversal of the zonal-mean meridional temperature gradient (with the poles being warmer than the equator in the zonal mean). Understanding the details of this phenomenon are beyond the scope of the present paper, although we note that the phenomenon is commonly associated with wave-driven circulations that are common in planetary stratospheres throughout the solar system. Still, our simulations are qualitatively consistent with both a regime transition from jet to divergent flow with increasing altitude and likewise generally exhibit a maximum zonal-mean zonal wind which occurs at approximately similar pressure to the transition (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 3-4)</ref>, suggesting validity to our overall argument.</p><p>We expect the jet speed maximum occurs at the pressure level where the radiative timescale is roughly equal to the wave propagation timescale.

The generation of equatorial prograde jets has been studied for decades but this problem has not been com- pletely solved yet. The equatorial jet formation on tidally locked exoplanets might be closely related to the standing Rossby wave pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Showman &amp; Polvani 2011</ref>) and the resonance of the Rossby waves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsai et al. 2014</ref>). Normally the zonal-mean jet speed is difficult to estimate without knowing the details of the wave-mean flow interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Vallis 2006)</ref>. No theory currently exists that can quantitatively predict the zonal-mean zonal wind speed on synchronously rotating planets. Nevertheless, the <ref type="bibr">Ko- macek &amp; Showman (2016)</ref> theory, and our alternate form of that theory presented in Section 4.3 and Appendix A, does provide a theoretical prediction for the characteristic horizontal wind speed U rms .

It shows that the zonal-mean equatorial jet speed decreases with increasing heat capacity, but the variation is within a factor of 2. The most significant impact is the jet core pressure. Cases in Experiment IV exhibit a dramatic change of the jet core pressure while the molar heat capacity only varies by a factor of 2 (from 7R/2 to 14R/2). The circulation pattern at 700 Pa <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 17)</ref> transits from the equatorial-jet-dominated regime in the 7R/2 case to a day-to-night flow regime in the 14R/2 case.</p><p>That the jet core pressure moves deeper into the atmosphere in the simulations contradicts our theory of jet core pressure (Eq. 26) in Section 4.5, which predicts that the jet core pressure p J should scale with c −2/3 p and thus be smaller for a higher c p atmosphere. As c p increases, the radiative timescale (τ rad ∝ c p , Eq. 8) increases more than the wave timescale (τ wave ∝ c 1/2 p , Eq. 3) in an isothermal atmosphere, implying a less radiative-control atmosphere and the zonal jet should form at a lower pressure level. Furthermore, p J ∝ c −2/3 p is a very weak dependence given the variation of c p within a factor of 2.

Using the local temperature and its gradient with pressure, we locally calculated N H at each (longitude, latitude) point over the globe. For each pressure level, the mean wave propagation timescales for each hemisphere is approximated by τ wave = R p /N H where N H is obtained by spatially averaging the N H values for each hemisphere. These averages include only points within 30 • latitude of the equator. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. (18)</ref> shows that τ wave decreases on both the dayside and the nightside as the molar heat capacity increases, but the change of τ wave is much more dramatic on the nightside (more than an order of magnitude) than on the dayside (less than 50%) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . This is because the nightside hemisphere is less vertically stratified than the dayside-the nightside atmosphere has a larger vertical temperature gradient (∂lnT /∂lnp) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Based on Eq. (2), the wave propagation speed is smaller in the nightside. The fractional change of N H due to c p increase could also be larger on the nightside. The quantity N H is more sensitive on the nightside than on the dayside to variations in c p , allowing c p to exert a greater influence on wave dynamics on the nightside than on the dayside. This sensitivity results simply from the fact that the thermal profile ∂ ln T /∂ ln p is closer to an adiabat on the nightside than on the dayside, especially in the c p = 14R/2 case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 18)</ref>.</p><p>Invoking our previous theory that the jet core pressure correlates with the pressure where the radiative timescale is roughly equal to a quarter of the wave propagation timescale in Section 4.2, we expect the jet core pressure to be given by the pressure where the vertical profiles of 4τ rad and τ wave intersect.

Here we took a preliminary step to study the influence of their bulk composition on the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation and the temperature distributions. Future transit measurements, possible direct imaging observations and Doppler imaging techniques will provide a vast amount of information on their atmospheres and may test the systematic behaviors predicted in this study.</p><p>We have mainly investigated the influences on atmospheric dynamics from two independent properties of the bulk composition: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller RMS wind speed, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve, and a narrower equatorial super-rotating jet that moves to deeper into the atmosphere. The zonal-mean zonal wind is smaller and more likely to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also found if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, the molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.</p><p>The underlying physical mechanisms have been discussed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The influences of molecular weight and molar heat capacity mainly originate from the interplay between the radiation and wave dynamics. The molecular weight also has a direct impact on the wind speed. We summarize our diagnosis as below:</p><p>(1) Most of the trends in our simulations of possible bulk compositions are due to the change of molecular weight, mainly because, for plausible compositions, molecular weight varies over a much wider range than the molar heat capacity.</p><p>(2) The temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside increases with the molecular weight. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere exhibits a temperature structure that becomes closer to radiative equilibrium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ko- macek &amp; Showman (2016)</ref> showed that the day-night temperature difference is controlled by a competition between the tendency of zonally propagating planetaryscale waves to mute the day-night temperature difference, and the tendency of the day-night radiative-heating contrast to increase it. The wave speeds decrease with increasing molecular weight, which lessens the ability of the waves to adjust the thermal structure. Therefore, this wave-adjustment mechanism becomes more easily suppressed-leading to larger day-night temperature differences-at high molecular weight.</p><p>(3) The wind speeds decrease with increasing molecular weight. This results from the fact that large molecular weight implies small scale height, which implies a smaller day-night difference in the geopotential (on isobars) than would occur in a low-molecular-mass atmosphere. This causes a weaker pressure-gradient force in the horizontal momentum equation, and therefore leads to weaker winds.</p><p>(4) The peak of thermal phase curve is shifted prior to the secondary eclipse due to a strong superrotating jet at equator. The phase shift is controlled by the ratio of atmospheric radiative timescale versus advection timescale of the zonal-mean zonal wind. The phase shift is smaller if the molecular weight is larger because the radiative timescale decreases and advection timescale increases with the molecular weight.</p><p>(5) The pressure level at which the zonal-mean jet speeds reach a maximum roughly coincides with the pressure level where the radiative timescale is equal to a quarter of the wave propagation timescale in our simulations, implying that the jet core pressure is strongly controlled by both radiative effects and dynamical effects. In the jet core region, the maximum zonal-mean jet speed U z (p J ) can be approximately by U rms (p J ), which decreases with molecular weight.</p><p>(6) As molecular weight increases, the equatorial jet width becomes narrower. More alternating wind patterns emerge in the higher latitude in the zonal-mean zonal wind distribution. The CO 2 atmosphere exhibits five alternating wind patterns in the zonal-mean zonal wind map. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Showman &amp; Polvani (2011)</ref> predicted that the half-width of the equatorial-jet scales with the equatorial deformation radius. We find that this theory explains the jet widths in our simulations; when the molecular mass is greater, the equatorial deformation radius is smaller, and the equatorial jet is narrower.</p><p>(7) Consistent with previous work ), the longitude-latitude wind pattern shifts from a day-to-night divergent flow pattern in the upper atmosphere to the jet-dominated pattern in the lower atmosphere. As molecular weight increases, the transition occurs deeper in the atmosphere.</p><p>(8) The effect of molar heat capacity is generally small except when the atmospheric temperature profile is close to adiabatic, which occurs most easily on the nightside.</p><p>The effect becomes important primarily when the molar heat capacity is large. In this situation, a slight increase of the molar heat capacity might greatly reduce wave speed in the atmosphere, particularly in the nightside atmosphere, and significantly influence the jet formation in the upper observable atmosphere. As a result, the pressure of the transition from a day-night divergent flow to a jet-dominated flow moves deeper into the atmosphere.</p><p>Several analytical theories have been presented in this study. We presented a modified form of the theory from  that yields predictions of the day-night temperature difference and rootmean-square wind speeds U rms as a function of radiative time constant, frictional drag time constant, rotation rate, and other parameters. This theory explains well the dependence of day-night temperature difference and wind speed with molecular weight. We presented an analytic estimate of the eastward offset of the dayside hot spot if the equatorial jet speed is known. We showed that the equatorial jet width is consistent with the equatorial deformation radius. We also estimated the pressure (p J ) at which the zonal-mean equatorial jet reaches a maximum. We furthermore showed that the analytic estimate of U rms provides a reasonable estimate to the dependence of the peak zonal-mean zonal wind U z (p J ) with molecular weight. This should provide constraints for future theories of what controls the equilibrated speed of the zonal-mean zonal wind, which have yet to be constructed. All of the above estimates are closely related to possible observables on tidally locked exoplanets.</p><p>In terms of observational implications, aside from the trends that were summarized above and might be tested in statistics with a large sample of data, we also emphasize two points here, related to the hazes and clouds which are recently identified on several super Earths.</p><p>First, we found a correlation between the atmospheric molecular weight and the jet speed and the width of alternating zonal-mean wind pattern in the atmosphere. That might shed light on a new way to infer the atmospheric composition from the wind pattern observations which might be achieved from a precise Doppler imaging measurement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>). This method might be typically useful for the planetary atmospheres covered by the hazes and clouds, which flatten the spectrum and make it difficult to infer broad spectral features diagnostic of the composition, as in the case of GJ1214b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). The general circulation simulations with more realistic radiative transfer scheme from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kataria et al. 2014</ref>) also show that the jet pattern is significantly distinct between the water atmosphere and the carbon dioxide atmosphere.</p><p>Second, if the atmospheric radiative equilibrium situation is close to adiabatic, as seen in some high molar heat capacity simulations, the nightside atmosphere has a large tendency to trigger convection above the zonal jet region once the temperature gradient drops so that the Richardson number Ri ≡ N 2 /(∂ 2 u/∂z 2 ) is under 0.25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chandrasekhar 1961)</ref>. In general, haze and cloud particles might be preferentially formed in the nightside of a colder environment. If the convection occurs in the nightside atmosphere, it will enhance the vertical mixing of those particles in the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Parmentier et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lee et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>). It might help to loft the haze/cloud particles to the upper atmosphere and stabilize the low-pressure haze layers observed on several super Earths/mini Neptunes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knutson et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Knutson et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ehrenreich et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that this work is highly idealized with a simple Newtonian cooling radiative scheme in order to highlight the underlying physical mechanisms. Our analytical theories are also based on the Newtonian cooling assumption. With a gray radiative transfer scheme, a recent work by  has shown that the theories of day-night temperature contrast and thermal phase shift presented here could also explain their simulations for hot Jupiters, implying that those theories might be applicable to more realistic situations. The opacity issue, although crucially important, is very complicated and beyond the scope of this paper. To the first order, different opacity corresponds to different pressure level where τ = 1 in Eq. (6) and implies different pressure dependence of the radiative timescale. The quantitative prediction related to the radiative timescale would thereby change accordingly. But the underlying mechanisms discussed in this study remain the same. We also did not explore the other parameters such as the situation of non-synchronized rotating planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Showman et al. 2015</ref>), eccentric orbits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lewis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lewis et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kataria et al. 2013</ref>), or planets with nonzero obliquities. In those situations, a whole range of atmospheric behaviors will emerge and the dynamics in a larger parameter space is far more rich than what we have discussed here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: A UNIFORM EXPRESSION FOR DAY-NIGHT TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE AND WIND SPEED ON TIDALLY LOCKED PLANETS</head><p>As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> in shallow water equations and  in the three-dimensional primitive equations, we can obtain analytical expressions for a proxy of day-night temperature difference (∆T /∆T eq ) and horizontal wind speed U , which should be considered as the RMS wind velocity U rms , on tidally locked planets. The horizontal pressure-gradient force associated with the horizontal day-night temperature difference drives the flow. This force will be balanced by the largest of the remaining forces, namely, frictional drag, Coriolis force, horizontal momentum advection, and vertical momentum advection . This leads to distinct expressions for the day-night temperature difference and wind speed in each regime. Here, we construct a modified version of this theory in which the four regimes are combined into a single expression that naturally transitions from one regime to another as appropriate.</p><p>We adopted the same assumptions as in  to simplify the primitive equations. We assume that the day-night temperature difference extends vertically over a log pressure range of ∆ ln p = ln(p bot /p) where p bot is the pressure level deep in the atmosphere at which the temperature is horizontally homogeneous. The magnitude of the horizontal acceleration term in the momentum equation (Eq. 1a) can be estimated as R∆T ∆ ln p/2µL . For the thermodynamical equation (Eq. 1d), following , we adopted the "Weak-Temperature Gradient" (WTG) approximation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sobel et al. 2001)</ref>, in which the horizontal advection of the temperature is neglected. Assume f ∼ Ω and the scaling equation set is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">U 2 L + ΩU ∼ R∆T ∆ ln p 2µL − U τ drag (A.1a) ∆T eq − ∆T 2τ rad ∼ wN 2 Hµ R (A.1b) U L ∼ w H (A.1c)</formula><p>See  for the derivation of Eq. (A. 1a) and Eq. (A. 1b). Here we retained a factor of 2 in both equations for a more quantitative theory-simulation comparison. For simplicity,  dropped a factor of 2 in their Eq. <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> when the geopotational height was integrated with pressure (see their Eq. 25).</p><p>Here we retain that factor in the right hand side of Eq. (A.1a). Based on the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref> of , we revised their Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> as ∆T eq − ∆T ∼ 2|T eq − T | global , leading to the factor of 2 in the left hand side of Eq. (A.1b).</p><p>We should emphasize that here we do not intend to solve the primitive equations (Eq. 1). The formulation of Eq. (A.1) is only for a purpose of combining the possible dominant terms: advection, rotation and drag, to achieve a uniform expression for the same theory that has been derived in . Hopefully the uniform expression is more general and might apply to the transitions between those four limiting regimes. Combine the above three equations yields the solutions for ∆T and U :</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">∆T ∆T eq ∼ 1 − 2 α + α 2 + 4γ 2 (A.2) U U eq ∼ 2γ α + α 2 + 4γ 2 (A.3)</formula><p>where U eq = (R∆T eq ∆ ln p/2µ) 1/2 can be considered as the cyclostrophic wind speed induced by an equilibrium day-night temperature difference. The non-dimensional parameters α and γ are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">α = 1 + (Ω + 1 τ drag )τ 2 wave τ rad ∆ ln p (A.4) γ = τ 2 wave τ rad τ adv,eq ∆ ln p (A.5)</formula><p>where τ wave ∼ L/N H is the timescale for wave propagation. τ adv,eq ∼ L/U eq is the advective timescale due to the "equilibrium cyclostrophic wind" U eq . Note that Eq. (A.3) can also be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">U U eq ∼ (α/2γ) 2 + 1 − α/2γ (A.6)</formula><p>Therefore, the ratio of the wind speed to the "equilibrium cyclostrophic wind" U eq solely depends on a single parameter α/2γ. The parameter α is related to the Coriolis term which is characterized by the timescale of Ω −1 , and the drag term which is characterized by the timescale of τ drag . γ is related to the advection term characterized by the timescale of τ adv,eq . By comparing the magnitudes of the three timescales, we can obtain the limits of Eq. (A.4) and (A.5).</p><p>(1) When drag dominates, τ drag is much smaller than Ω −1 and τ adv,eq , and the parameter α is reduced to α d :</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">α d = 1 + τ 2 wave τ drag τ rad ∆ ln p .

(A.8)<label>(</label></formula><p>3) In the advection-dominated regime, τ adv,eq is much smaller than Ω −1 and τ drag , which is equivalent to α ∼ 1.</p><p>In the above three regimes, the day-night temperature difference is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">∆T ∆T eq ∼              1 − 1 α d drag dominated 1 − 1 αi Coriolis dominated 1 − 2 1+ √ 1+4γ 2 advection dominated (A.9)</formula><p>Similarly, for the wind speed U , we have corresponding limits:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">U U eq ∼              γ α d drag dominated γ αi Coriolis dominated 2γ 1+ √ 1+4γ 2 advection dominated (A.10)</formula><p>One can show that the above expressions for day-night temperature difference are consistent with the ones derived in . We emphasize that the characteristic wind speed U we derived here should not be confused with the zonal-mean zonal wind u, and should instead be considered as the RMS wind velocity U rms , although in the jet core region, the two values might be close (Section 4.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B: A KINEMATIC MODEL OF TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION AND THERMAL PHASE SHIFT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. Temperature Distribution</head><p>We construct a simple kinematic model for the thermal phase shift in the presence of a specified zonal jet. For simplicity, we first consider an 1D solution. In the zonal direction, the thermodynamic equation can be reduced to a 1D equation with respect to longitude λ. We adopt the Newtonian cooling approximation for the radiative scheme by assuming a constant radiative timescale τ rad and a constant "advective" timescale τ adv ∼ L/u where u is the zonal-mean zonal wind. The kinematic equation is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">∂T ∂t + 1 τ adv ∂T ∂λ = T eq (λ) − T τ rad (B.1)</formula><p>where T eq is the equilibrium temperature, the distribution of which could be given by Eq. (9) for a tidally locked planet. Since we have decoupled the latitude and altitude with longitude in this 1D problem, we assume:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">T eq (λ) = T n + T 1 cos λ dayside T n nightside (B.2)</formula><p>where we assume the equilibrium temperature in the nightside is flat:  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig. 19</ref>.-Analytical temperature solutions from Eq. (B.5) for Tn = 300K, T 1 = 600K and different ratios between the radiative timescale and the advective timescale ξ = τ rad /τ adv . The red, orange, green, blue and black colors corresponds to ξ = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10, respectively. The vertical dashed lines indicate the longitudes of the temperature maximum, i.e., the"hot spot". The analytical temperature distribution is not a purely sinusoidal function <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Fig. 19)</ref>. The temperature peak ("hot spot") on the dayside shifts relative to the equilibrium temperature pattern. When the zonal wind is eastward, τ adv is positive, leading to an eastward shifted hot spot in the downwind direction. The shape of temperature curve is significantly controlled by ξ = τ rad /τ adv <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Fig. 19)</ref>. The longitudinal shift of the hot spot becomes larger as ξ increases. The day-night temperature difference is roughly reduced by a factor of cos −1 λ s or 1 + ξ 2 compared with the radiative equilibrium situation. As ξ increases, the dayside temperature decreases and nightside temperature increases, resulting a smaller day-night temperature difference. Although both this theory and the theory in Appendix A can be used to explain the temperature difference between the dayside and nightside, they are very different. The theory in Appendix A is a fully predictive theory from the first principle. But the theory we introduced here requires information of zonal-mean zonal wind u, the theory of which has not been developed yet.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">T n = T 0 − T 1 /2. T</formula><p>We can see two extreme cases where ξ approaches either of the two limits: in the strong radiation regime where ξ ∼ 0 or in the weak radiative regime where ξ → ∞. If the radiative timescale is very short relative to the advective timescale, i.e., ξ → 0, the temperature should be strongly controlled by the radiative relaxation. One can show that η → 0 and λ s → 0 and the solution retains the equilibrium temperature distribution T (λ) = T n + T 1 cos λ in the dayside and T (λ) = T n in the nightside. On the other hand, if the radiative timescale is very long compared with the advective timescale, i.e., ξ → ∞, the advection will efficiently distribute the heat across longitudes. One can show that η → 1/π and λ s → π/2. In this limit, the temperature becomes constant with longitude and T (λ) = T n + T 1 /π.</p><p>It is straightforward to generalize the solution for a 3D atmosphere with the 3D equilibrium temperature distribution in Eq. where η is given by Eq. (B.6). To compare with our 3D numerical results, we adopted T n , ∆T eq and τ rad the same as that in the Experiment I cases (Section 3). However, the advection timescale is assumed as τ adv ∼ R/u where R is the planetary radius and u is the zonal-mean zonal wind. Since a first-principle analytical theory of u has not yet been developed, we used the equatorial-mean u from the numerical results from Experiment I. With those parameters <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3)</ref>, the analytical temperature distribution agrees well with the GCM results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">(Fig. 20)</ref>. The analytical thermal phase curves can be derived based on analytical thermal phase curve based on the 2D temperature solution (Eq. B.7) and the procedure described in Section 4.2 (Eqs. 17 and 18). The analytical phase curves agree well with that derived from 3D simulations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">(Fig. 21)</ref>. The phase curve amplitudes from the analytical solution are slightly larger than the numerical results but the overall curve shapes, especially the phase shifts, match pretty well. Our theory explains the numerical results better when ξ is smaller, as in the CO 2 case. This physically based, analytical 2D temperature solution captures key features for calculating the thermal phase curves, which can be characterized by three parameters in the atmosphere: T n , ∆T eq , and the ratio ξ between τ rad and τ adv . Eq.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3.</ref> might be useful in atmospheric phase curve analysis for synchronously rotating exoplanets. The analytical solution of λ m cannot be shown in an explicit form, but it depends solely on ξ. As ξ increases, the hot spot shifts more to the east <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Fig. 19)</ref>. In an eastward flow, the hot spot location is eastward of the substellar point, but by a smaller amount than the value λ s = tan −1 ξ. In other words, the hot spot location is westward of λ s . When the hot spot shift is small (λ m is small), e λm/ξ is close to unity and λ m ≈ λ s = tan −1 ξ is generally a good approximation of the hot spot location. This situation occurs when the radiative timescale is smaller than the advective timescale (ξ small). When the advective timescale is smaller than the radiative timescale (ξ large), the hot spot location predicted from Eq. (B.7) could be 10 to 20 degrees west of the longitude λ s .   <ref type="figure">Fig. 22</ref>.-Longitudinal hot spot offset (black and red) in the temperature distribution and orbital phase shift (blue) in analytical thermal lightcurve as a function of the ratio of radiative timescale versus advection timescale. The degree of the orbital phase shift of the lightcurve was calculated based on Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(17)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(18)</ref>, and (B.7). For the degree of the hot spot offset, the black (λm) is computed from Eq. (B.8) and the red is from λs = tan −1 (τ rad /τ adv ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2. Hot Spot Offset and Thermal Phase Shift</head><p>The analytical thermal phase curves are derived based on the 2D temperature solution (Eq. B.7) and the procedure described in Section 4.2 (Eqs. 17 and 18). We found a relationship between the longitudinal hot spot offset λ m and the thermal phase shift (δ s ) before the secondary eclipse. When expressed in degrees, both λ m and δ s increase with ξ ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 22</ref>) in a similar trend. When the phase shift is less than about 55 degrees, λ m from Eq. (B. 8) agrees perfectly with the phase shift and it might under-predict δ s to up to 10 degrees when the phase shift is large. On the other hand, the simpler predictor λ s = tan −1 ξ generally over-predicts δ s when the phase shift is larger than 30 degrees. Although there are three parameters that shape the thermal lightcurve, we found that the thermal phase shift is almost totally controlled by ξ, whereas T n and ∆T eq have negligible influence in the parameter regime we explored in this study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.-Longitude-latitude temperature and wind maps at 700 Pa (left column) and the zonal-mean zonal wind (u) distributions (right column) as a function of pressure and latitude for the typical constituents (Experiment I).

The general solution is: T (λ) =    T n + T 1 cos λ s cos(λ − λ s ) + k 1 e −λ/ξ −π/2 ≤ λ ≤ π/2 T n + k 2 e −λ/ξ −π ≤ λ ≤ −π/2 T n + k 3 e −λ/ξ π/2 ≤ λ ≤ π (B.4) where λ s = tan −1 ξ. k 1 , k 2 and k 3 are determined by the continuity of solutions at terminators T (±π/2) and periodic boundary condition T (−π) = T (π). The final solution of Eq. (B.1) can be expressed as: T (λ) =    T n + T 1 cos λ s cos(λ − λ s ) + ηT 1 e −λ/ξ −π/2 ≤ λ ≤ π/2 T n + ηT 1 e −(π+λ)/ξ −π ≤ λ ≤ −π/2 T n + ηT 1 e (π−λ)/ξ π/2 ≤ λ ≤ π</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> From Eqs. (7) and (8), one can derive the constant K = 10 5/2 (4/7R).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Here we assume the wave speed is a vertically local quantity that is equal to N H. This is based on the assumption that that N H is constant with height. If N H varies with height (as in Fig. 18, nightside), then the appropriate wave speed would involve a an appropriate vertical integral of N with height over the range of heights associated with that wave mode. Therefore the extremely short wave speeds (and corresponding long wave timescales) at 10 3 −10 4 Pa in Fig. 18 (orange dashed curve) might not be realistic (although the wave speed could still be somewhat short), because the wave speed might be significantly influenced by adjacent layers that are more stratified.</note>
