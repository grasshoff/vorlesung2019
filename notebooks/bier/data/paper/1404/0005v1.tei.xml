				<p>The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres of nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as sulfides and salts condense in mid-late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs below T eff ∼450 K, water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. Currently over a dozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previous theoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or exoplanetary spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect of water cloud opacity. We find that they become optically thick in objects below T eff ∼350-375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials, water ice particles are significantly non-gray absorbers; they predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths through J band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which is at 2.8 µm. H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 4 , and H 2 CIA are dominant opacity sources; less abundant species such as may also be detectable, including the alkalis, H 2 S, and PH 3. PH 3 , which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3 µm in Y dwarfs around T eff =450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry increases the abundance of PH 3 , it may be detectable over a wider effective temperature range than models predict. We show results incorporating disequilibrium nitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity in planetary-mass objects. Lastly, we make predictions for the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with existing and future instruments including the James Webb Space Telescope and Gemini Planet Imager.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Brown dwarfs link planetary and stellar astrophysics, with compositions like stars but the temperatures of planets. They form the tail of the initial mass function and, too low in mass to have core temperatures high enough to fuse hydrogen, they cool over time through the brown dwarf spectral sequence. As they cool, different molecules and condensates form and carve their spectra.</p><p>With the discovery of very cool brown dwarfs we are able to investigate for the first time the physical and chemical processes that occur in atmospheres with effective temperature ranges that would be suitable for a warm beverage. While brown dwarfs are free-floating, they should share many of the same physical processes as the giant planets that will be uncovered by future surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Discovery and Characterization of Y Dwarfs</head><p>The proposed spectral class Y encompasses brown dwarfs that have cooled below T eff ∼500 K. About 17 objects have been classified as Y dwarfs to date. Many of those have now been found using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cushing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kirkpatrick et al. 2012</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Liu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tinney et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kirkpatrick et al. 2013</ref>). Additional objects have been discovered as wide-separation companions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liu et al. (2011)</ref> found a very cool (∼Y0) companion to a late T dwarf; <ref type="bibr">Luhman</ref>  near-infrared spectra, and sodium and potassium wane in importance in the optical as they condense into clouds. Recent follow-up studies have aimed to characterize the Y dwarf population. There has been a large effort to measure parallaxes of Y dwarfs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marsh et al. (2013)</ref> present results for 5 Y dwarfs and 3 late T dwarfs using a compilation of data from the ground and space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dupuy &amp; Kraus (2013)</ref> present results using only the Spitzer Space Telescope for 16 Y and T dwarfs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beichman et al. (2014)</ref> present results from a compilation of data from Keck II, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Hubble Space telescope for 15 Y and T dwarfs. Groups have also been collecting followup observations to better understand the spectral energy distributions of Y dwarfs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leggett et al. (2013)</ref> present followup nearinfrared photometry for six Y dwarfs and a far-red spectrum for WISEPC J205628.90+145953.3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lodieu et al. (2013)</ref> observed 7 Y dwarfs in the z band using the Gran Telescopio de Canarias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Previous Models of Y dwarfs</head><p>A number of available models for brown dwarfs include models cold enough to represent Y dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Saumon et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Morley et al. 2012</ref>), but do not yet treat the effects of water clouds. The first models to incorporate the effects of water clouds into a brown dwarf atmosphere are those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. (2003)</ref>. These models generally find that water clouds do not strongly affect the spectrum of Y dwarfs, but there have been few followup studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hubeny &amp; Burrows (2007)</ref> also includes simple water clouds with a fixed mode particle size of 100 µm. In Section 6.2 we will discuss how our results compare to these early models.</p><p>A number of studies have included water clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres;  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sudarsky et al. (2000)</ref> both modeled the effect of water clouds on the albedos of giant exoplanets; they find the formation of water clouds significantly increases the planetary albedos. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. (2004)</ref> also consider water clouds in exoplanets, using a similar approach as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Clouds in L and T dwarfs</head><p>Clouds have posed the greatest challenge for brown dwarf modeling since the first L dwarfs were discovered. As brown dwarfs cool along the L sequence from 2500 K to 1300 K, refractory materials like corundum, iron, and silicates condense to form thick dust layers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lunine et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fegley &amp; Lodders 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lodders &amp; Fegley 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lodders 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Lodders &amp; Fegley 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Helling &amp; Woitke 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Visscher et al. 2010</ref>) which thicken as the brown dwarf cools. These dust clouds shape the emergent spectra of L dwarfs (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsuji et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allard et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marley et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Helling et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cushing et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Witte et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>For field brown dwarfs these clouds clear over a very small range of effective temperature around 1200-1300 K and around the same temperature, methane features begin to appear in the near-infrared. The brown dwarf is then classified as a T dwarf and, for many years, mid to late T dwarfs were considered to be cloud-free. However, it has long been recognized that other somewhat less refractory materials such as sulfides and salts should condense in cooler T dwarfs <ref type="bibr">(Lodders 1999</ref>). As late T dwarfs (500-900 K) were discovered and characterized, a population of objects redder in the near-infrared (e.g. J − K, J − H colors) than the predictions of cloud-free models emerged. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Morley et al. (2012)</ref> included the clouds predicted to form by condensation of the sulfides and alkali salts and showed that by including thin layers of these clouds, the colors and spectra of these redder observed T dwarfs can be matched. As these T dwarfs are further characterized, variability has been observed in mid-late T dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Buenzli et al. 2012</ref>); the sulfide clouds may play a role in this variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Directly-imaged Exoplanets</head><p>Spectra of directly-imaged planets are also strongly influenced by the opacity of clouds. The first multi-planet directlyimaged system, HR 8799, has four planets, all of which have infrared colors that indicate cloudy atmospheres, much like L dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marois et al. 2008</ref>). Other planetary-mass objects also appear to have spectral properties similar to L dwarfs including β Pictoris b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bonnefoy et al. 2013</ref>) and 2M1207b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barman et al. 2011b</ref>). In fact, at similar effective temperatures planetary-mass objects appear to be even more cloudy than their brown dwarf counterparts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barman et al. 2011a</ref>), which has been used to suggest that the breakup of the iron and silicate clouds at the L/T transition may be gravity dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Marley et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Nonetheless the transition to a methane-dominated atmosphere and cloud-depleted near-infrared spectrum must happen at some effective temperature, with the resulting objects appearing as low-gravity 'T' and 'Y' dwarfs. The first such object discovered is GJ 504b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kuzuhara et al. 2013</ref>) which is currently the coldest directly-imaged planet (T eff ∼500 K) and has colors very similar to T dwarfs; followup observations probing the methane feature at 1.6 µm suggest that, as expected from thermochemical equilibrium calculations, methane is present in the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Janson et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Water clouds</head><p>In a cold solar composition atmosphere, water clouds will be a massive cloud and an important opacity source. Unlike the refractory clouds which have been extensively studied by a number of groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Helling &amp; Woitke 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allard et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsuji et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Helling et al. 2008)</ref>, the same attention has not been paid to volatile clouds in brown dwarfs. In this work, we aim to predict the effects that water clouds will have on brown dwarf atmospheres. We calculate pressuretemperature profiles, spectra, and colors for the coolest brown dwarfs. We study the signatures of the water clouds and their optical properties, estimate their likely particle sizes, and determine at which effective temperatures the cloud will become optically thick in the photosphere. We end by considering the observability of Y dwarfs with the four major instruments being built for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the detectability of cool giant planets with new and upcoming ground-based instruments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS 2.1. Atmosphere Model</head><p>We calculate 1D pressure-temperature profiles, which are self-consistent with both the chemistry and clouds, of atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium. The thermal radiative transfer is determined using the "source function technique" presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Toon et al. (1989)</ref>. The gas opacity is calculated using correlated-k coefficients to increase calculation speed; our opacity database incorporates published data from both laboratory experiments and firstprinciples quantum mechanics calculations and is described extensively in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Freedman et al. (2008)</ref>. The opacity database includes two significant updates since <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Freedman et al.

(2012)</ref>: a new molecular line list for ammonia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yurchenko et al. 2011</ref>) and an improved treatment of the pressure-induced opacity of H 2 collisions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Richard et al. 2012</ref>). The cloud opacity is included as Mie scattering of spherical cloud particles in each atmospheric layer. The atmosphere models are more extensively described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">McKay et al. (1989)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marley et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cloud Model</head><p>The cloud model calculates the vertical locations, heights, and mode particle sizes of clouds as they condense in the atmosphere. The calculation is coupled with the radiative transfer calculations, so a converged model will have a temperature structure that is self-consistent with the clouds.</p><p>The cloud code is a modification of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> cloud model. This model has successfully been used to model the effects of the iron, silicate, and corundum clouds on the spectra of L dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Stephens et al. 2009</ref>) as well as the sulfide and chloride clouds that likely form in the atmospheres of T dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morley et al. 2012</ref>). Here, we modify it to include the effects of water clouds. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> approach avoids treating the highly uncertain microphysical processes that create clouds in brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres. Instead, it aims to balance the advection and diffusion of each species' vapor and condensate at each layer of the atmosphere. It balances the upward transport of vapor and condensate by turbulent mixing in the atmosphere with the downward transport of condensate by sedimentation. This balance is achieved using the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">− K zz ∂q t ∂z − f sed w * q c = 0,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where K zz is the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient, q t is the mixing ratio of condensate and vapor, q c is the mixing ratio of condensate, w * is the convective velocity scale, and f sed is a parameter that describes the efficiency of sedimentation in the atmosphere. Solving this equation allows us to calculate the total amount of condensate in each layer of the atmosphere. We calculate the modal particle size using the sedimentation flux and by prescribing a lognormal size distribution of particles, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dn dr = N r √ 2π ln σ exp ln 2 (r/r g ) 2 ln 2 σ (2)</formula><p>where N is the total number concentration of particles, r g is the geometric mean radius, and σ is the geometric standard deviation. We fix σ at 2.0 for this study (see discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref>). We calculate the falling speeds of particles within this distribution assuming viscous flow around spheres (and using the Cunningham slip factor to account for gas kinetic effects). We calculate the other parameters in equation 1 (K zz and w * ) using mixing length theory and by prescribing a lower bound for K zz of 10 5 cm 2 /s, which represents the residual turbulence due to processes such as breaking gravity waves in the radiative regions of the atmosphere. This process allows us to calculate the mode particle size in each layer of the atmosphere using calculated or physically motivated values for all parameters except for the free parameter f sed . In general, we find larger particles (which have higher terminal velocities) in the bottom layers of a cloud and smaller particles (which have lower terminal velocities) in the upper layers.</p><p>A high sedimentation efficiency parameter f sed results in vertically thinner clouds with larger particle sizes, whereas a lower f sed results in more vertically extended clouds with smaller particles sizes. As a result, a higher f sed corresponds to optically thinner clouds and a lower f sed corresponds to optically thicker clouds.</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> cloud model code computes the available quantity of condensible gas above the cloud base by comparing the local gas abundance (accounting for upwards transport by mixing via K zz ) to the local condensate vapor pressure p vap . In cases where the formation of condensates does not proceed by homogeneous condensation we nevertheless compute an equivalent vapor pressure curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Challenges of water clouds</head><p>The condensation of water vapor into water ice clouds poses some unique problems for our self-consistent equilibrium approach. Water vapor is the most dominant source of opacity in a Y dwarf atmosphere. After it condenses, if the cloud opacity is somehow removed, there is very little gas opacity left in the atmosphere and the layers beneath can radiate efficiently. However, the cloud opacity cannot just be removed from the atmosphere; it must condense into a cloud, and because oxygen is one of the most abundant elements, the water cloud that forms is quite massive and optically thick. This means that the dominant vapor opacity source condenses into a dominant solid opacity source.</p><p>In practice, when aiming to calculate a solution in radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium that is selfconsistent with the water cloud, we find that we are not able to find a self-consistent solution for a range of model effective temperatures from ∼225-450 K. As the water cloud forms in the model, it significantly warms the atmosphere below it because it prevents flux from escaping. This warming causes the cloud to evaporate, removing the opacity source, and allowing flux to escape and cool the atmosphere again; a cloud forms again. An equilibrium solution is not found.</p><p>To solve this problem, we borrow phenomenological ideas from our own solar system. When water clouds are observed in the solar system on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, they never form in a globally homogeneous layer. Instead, they form into patchy clouds. For example, on Jupiter, there are 5 µm hot spots though which flux emerges from deep within the atmosphere; these are believed to be "holes" or thin areas of the deep Jovian water cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Westphal 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Westphal et al. 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Orton et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Carlson et al. 1994)</ref>. Saturn has similar mid-infrared heterogeneity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baines et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>Because water clouds never appear to form globally homogeneous, uniform clouds in the solar system planets, models that include clouds for these planets do not attempt to find a 1D steady-state equilibrium solution in a self-consistent way. Instead, for clouds in Earth's atmosphere, the evolution of clouds is either modeled over time using a timestepping model or the clouds are modeled in 2D or 3D. In fact a method sometimes used in 3D circulation models on Earth inspires our approach, described below. In these circulation models, clouds form on scales smaller than the grid scale; cloud opacity is implemented using a two-column subgrid approach. Other previous efforts for exoplanets and brown dwarfs either did not iterate or used a highly specified cloud parametrization for particle size and cloud height (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hubeny &amp; Burrows 2007)</ref>. Our approach here is not to include a specified cloud, but instead to iteratively solve for a cloud profile that is selfconsistent with the atmosphere structure. We rely on a model which successfully reproduces cloud particle sizes and distributions on Jupiter and Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001)</ref>. Perhaps fortuitously, the particular cloud model employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. (2003)</ref>, who also solve the problem selfconsistently, produced somewhat large particles with small infrared optical depth. More general cases in which some clouds have smaller particle sizes have a far greater optical depth and are more challenging to converge.</p><p>In this work, we make the assumption that patchy water clouds also form in brown dwarfs. Theoretical motivation for this patchiness has not yet been well-developed, but recent highly idealized models suggest that the rotation and internal heating of brown dwarfs could drive jet-like or vortex-like circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Zhang &amp; Showman 2014)</ref>. Such weather patterns in the atmosphere may create rising and sinking parcels of air and maintain inhomogeneous clouds.</p><p>Other evidence for cloud patchiness in the silicate cloud decks of warmer brown dwarfs has been seen in the variability observations by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Radigan et al. (2012)</ref> and the spa- tial mapping of the L/T transition brown dwarf Luhman 16B ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Crossfield et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In this model, even though the water cloud layer forms a thick opacity source, the flux can emerge from holes in the cloud deck. This assumption allows us to calculate a temperature structure in radiative-convective equilibrium that is self-consistent with the clouds because flux is able to emerge through the holes even when the clouds become optically thick. This means that the temperature structure can remain cool enough to have a condensed water cloud layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Implementing patchy clouds</head><p>We calculate patchy clouds following the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Marley et al. (2010)</ref>, who implemented patchy clouds in an attempt to understand a mechanism that could reproduce the L/T transition, in which clouds break up progressively and more flux emerges from holes in the clouds. Following this prescription, we calculate flux separately through both a cloudy column (with the cloud opacity included) and a clear column (with the cloud opacity not included) with the same pressure-temperature profile. This calculation is shown schematically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We can change the cloud-covering fraction by varying h, the fractional area of the atmosphere assumed to be covered in holes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F total = hF clear + (1 − h)F cloudy (3)</formula><p>Using this summed flux F total through each atmospheric layer, we iterate as usual until we find a solution in radiativeconvective equilibrium. Using h 0.4-0.5 greatly improves convergence. With a hole fraction of at least 40-50%, flux escapes from warm, deep layers through the cloud-free column and a consistent P − T profile with water clouds can be calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Cloud properties</head><p>To model clouds and their radiative effect in the atmosphere, we need three pieces of information about the material. The first is the optical properties-the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index-of the condensed solid or liquid. In Y dwarfs, water always condenses in the solid phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. 2003</ref>), so we use the optical properties of water ice <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Warren 1984)</ref>. The second property is the material's density; we use 0.93 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> for water ice. Lastly, we need the saturation vapor pressure of water ice, which tells us where the cloud will form and how much material is available to form it. We assume that all material in excess of the saturation vapor pressure condenses to form a cloud. We use the equation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Buck (1981)</ref> to describe the saturation vapor pressure of water ice:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p vap = a exp (b − T c /d)T c T c + c<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Model grid</head><p>Our grid of models encompasses the full range of Y dwarfs and extends the grid from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Morley et al. (2012)</ref> to lower temperatures. This grid includes models from 200-450 K in increments of 25-50 K.

We run all models on this main grid with f sed =5 and h=0.5.</p><p>Of course, it is likely that h and f sed vary, and could in fact be different for the underlying sulfide/salt clouds and the higher altitude water clouds. In fact, models at the L/T transition generally need to include non-uniformity in cloud properties across the transition to match its shape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Marley et al. 2010</ref>). We do not aim to fully model all parts of this parameter space here. However, we do explore some parts of this space; we run additional models in which we vary f sed from 3-7 at a single surface gravity (log g=4.0) and in which we vary h from 0.2 to 1.0 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). We assume solar metallicity composition for all models, using elemental abundances from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lodders (2003)</ref>.</p><p>The grid was deliberately chosen to be square, but includes some unphysical combinations of temperature and surface gravity, because higher mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled enough during the age of the universe to reach very low temperatures. For the coolest models in our grid, T eff =200 K, the maximum expected log g (that of a 10 Gyr brown dwarf) is ∼ 4.2. For 300 K, maximum log g is ∼ 4.5-4.6; for 450 K, ∼4.7-5.0 . The ranges come from using a cloudy or cloud-free atmospheric boundary condition for the evolution models, see <ref type="bibr">Figures 4 and 5 from Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Evolution models</head><p>Absolute fluxes and magnitudes are calculated from our model spectra by applying the evolutionary radii of . Those cooling sequences provide the radius of the brown dwarf as a function of T eff and log g. Here we have used the radii from the evolution sequences computed with cloudless atmospheres as the surface boundary condition. A fully self-consistent calculation of the evolution would use a surface boundary condition defined by the corresponding model atmospheres. This is becoming increasingly difficult for brown dwarfs as the evolution of clouds during the long cooling time of the very cool objects considered here is rather complex. The sequence of transitions from cloudy L dwarfs to mainly clear mid-T dwarfs, to late-T dwarfs veiled with sulfide clouds (MnS, Na 2 S, ZnS, Cr, KCl), which may also clear out in early Y dwarfs before water clouds appear, has yet to be understood properly, both empirically and theoretically. The use of a uniform, cloudless surface boundary condition has the virtue of simplicity. We can estimate the uncertainty in the radius thus obtained by comparing the surface boundary condition extracted from the present atmosphere models to those used by . We find that for our nominal f sed = 5, h = 0.5 partly cloudy sequence, the entropy at the bottom of the atmosphere (which gives the entropy of the matching interior model) is quite close to the cloudless case at T eff = 450 K. As the object cools the entropy decreases, and for T eff = 200 K the entropy is close to the entropy of cloudy atmospheres used in . This nicely corresponds to the transition of the partly cloudy models from optically thin to optically thick water clouds. Figures 4 and 5 of  show that for given T eff and log g, the radii between the cloudless and cloudy evolution sequences vary by at most 1-2% below 500 K. Thus, the inconsistency between the surface boundary condition used in the evolution sequences and the model atmospheres presented here causes at most a 4% error in the absolute fluxes.</p></div>

In general, Q abs rises from optical to infrared wavelengths and remains fairly high through the infrared. The persistence of these features over a large range in particle sizes suggests that water ice features may be observable for a relatively optically thick cloud even if it contains a range of particle sizes. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows both the absorption efficiency of water ice and the cross section of water vapor; the wavelength range at which water absorbs shifts as it condenses from vapor to solid phase.

Mode particle sizes in this high cloud layer are fairly small-around 1-5 µm. The feature in the column optical depth around 10 −2 bar is caused by the fact that the pressure-temperature profile becomes warmer than the water condensation curve at that pressure. In this model, the sulfide and chloride clouds become optically thick much deeper in the atmosphere, around 100 bar, which is below the photosphere.</p><p>For a brown dwarf that has cooled to T eff =200 K, the water cloud is very optically thick and forms within the photosphere. The bottom panel shows a T eff =200 K model; the base of the water cloud is at 2 bar and the column optical depth is ∼60. Mode particle sizes of water ice in the photosphere are 4-20 µm.

(1999) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. (2003)</ref>, we see that water clouds begin to form with small particle sizes high in the atmospheres of objects around 400 K. They become marginally optically thick for objects cooler than 350-375 K. For very cold objects, ∼200-250 K, the water cloud is a dominant opacity source through cloudy columns of the atmosphere.</p></div>

The water cloud forms high in the atmosphere (2 bar and 0.03 bar for the layers shown from the 200 and 275 K models, respectively) and the Na 2 S cloud forms deeper (200 and 60 bar, respectively). The sulfide cloud single scattering albedo is relatively uniform, rising from ∼0.6 in the optical to 0.9 at 10 µm. The water cloud single scattering albedo has many more features, which vary with particle size (the mode particle size is ∼20 µm for the 200 K model and ∼5 µm for the 275 K model; the single scattering albedo is calculated for the distribution of particle sizes calculated using the cloud code).

We show both the single scattering albedo for the sodium sulfide cloud, which is deep within the atmosphere at ∼ 100 bar, and the water ice cloud, which is in the photosphere around 0.1-1.0 bar. The single scattering albedo of the sulfide cloud is almost identical for each of these two model atmospheres; it rises from 0.6 in the optical to 0.95 at 12 µm, indicating that the cloud becomes less efficient at absorbing as the wavelength increases. In contrast, the single scattering albedo of the water ice cloud has strong absorption features throughout the near and mid-infrared. The two models have slightly different features because the particle sizes are different, and the scattering and absorption properties depend fairly strongly on particle size (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). For the 200 K object, the water ice mode particle size at 2 bar is about 20 µm. For the warmer 275 K model, the mode particle size at 0.03 bar is about a factor of four smaller, ∼5 µm.</p><p>However, the strongest features are evident for both models. The most obvious is the sharp decrease in single scattering albedo at 2.8 µm, indicating that the cloud becomes more strongly absorbing at that wavelength. The feature at 10 µm is very evident for the warmer model, and much more muted in the cooler model. The presence of features indicates that water ice is not a mostly gray absorber (like many of the more refractory clouds are) and, when present and optically thick, may cause spectral features, including ones that depend on particle size. .-Pressure-temperature profiles for three representative temperature and two gravities are shown. The thicker black line indicates the location of the 1-6 µm photosphere. The shaded salmon region shows where the atmosphere is convective. The dashed lines show condensation curves for each substance expected to condense in thermochemical equilibrium. The curve represents the pressure-temperature points at which the partial pressure of the gas is equal to the saturation vapor pressure; to the left of the curve, the partial pressure of each gas is higher than the saturation vapor pressure and the excess vapor will form a cloud. The kinks in the profile in the upper atmosphere are numerical and do not represent 'real' features in the atmospheres of Y dwarfs. Fortunately, the kinks lie above the regions of the atmosphere from which flux emerges and so they do not pose a problem for this work.</p></div>

This is because in a cloudy atmosphere, the overall opacity is slightly higher, so the temperature structure of a converged model with the same outgoing flux will be slightly warmer.</p><p>For a cloud-free model atmosphere, once the water has condensed out of the atmosphere, there are very few opacity sources left: mainly CH 4 , NH 3 , and collision-induced absorption from molecular hydrogen. This means that the brown dwarf is quite transparent in those layers and flux is able to emerge from deeper layers. In contrast, if we assume, as we do in our cloudy models, that water in excess of the saturation vapor pressure condenses to form a water ice cloud, that cloud provides a large opacity source, preventing the brown dwarf from efficiently emitting from layers underneath the cloud, and significantly warming the atmosphere.</p><p>For model atmospheres between 400 and 500 K, even though the cloud-free P-T profile may cross the water condensation curve, the converged cloudy models (including the effect of sulfide clouds) are somewhat warmer and do not cross the water condensation curve, so the model water cloud does not form.</p><p>For the warmest effective temperature brown dwarfs in which we find that water clouds form and can exist in radiative equilibrium, (400 K), the water clouds are at low pressures within the radiative upper atmosphere. They remain above the photosphere and optically thin. This means that the clouds affect the spectra very little, but the converged cloudy model's P-T profile is warmer by ∼20-50 K in the upper atmosphere than a corresponding cloud-free model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows the models of pressure-temperature profiles of brown dwarfs (log g=5.0, upper panel) and planet-mass objects (log g=3.5, lower panel), with effective temperatures of 200, 300, and 450 K. The photospheres, shown as thick black lines, show that the observable region of the atmospheres tends to be below the radiative upper atmospheres which are prone to numerical challenges in the models. The convective regions are also shown as colored shaded regions; higher gravity objects at these temperatures have multiple convection zones. This well-known result is because their P-T profiles cross regions of parameter space where the opacity of a solar composition equilibrium gas is low, and radiative energy transport becomes efficient. In lower pressure regions in the atmosphere, the opacity increases and radiative transport is once again inefficient and the model becomes unstable to convection (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marley et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Burrows et al. 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Note that the coolest models (T eff =200 K) also cross the NH 3 condensation curve, indicating that for very cold Y dwarfs we will also need to consider the effects of the ammonia cloud.

The strongest band of CO is the dominant opacity source at 4.5-5 µm, even assuming equilibrium chemistry, for a mid-T dwarf. CO 2 is also an important opacity source in the mid-infrared for warmer objects, especially if its mixing ratio is increased by vertical mixing. As an object cools, CO and CO 2 are strongly disfavored in equilibrium, but vertical mixing could increase their abundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude, so the strongest absorption bands may still prove to be important for late T and early Y dwarfs.

Phosphine is likely observable in the mid-infrared; the strongest PH 3 feature is at 4.3 µm and is the dominant opacity source at that wavelength in the photosphere of a T eff =450 K Y dwarf. While equilibrium models find little phosphine in the photospheres of T eff =200 K objects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Visscher et al. (2006)</ref> predict that phosphine will be in disequilibrium in giant planet and T dwarf atmospheres and could be orders of magnitude more abundant than equilibrium models predict. The effect of phosphine on Y dwarf spectra may therefore be underestimated in these models and even more pronounced in real Y dwarfs. H 2 S affects the spectra mostly in H band, where it acts largely as a continuum absorber, depressing the H band peak, and to a smaller degree the Y band peak.</p></div>

The models shown assume f sed =5 and h = 0.5, as described in Section 2.4, and include both the salt/sulfide clouds (Na 2 S, KCl, ZnS, MnS, Cr) and water ice clouds. As a brown dwarf cools over the Y dwarf sequence, the near-infrared flux dramatically declines. By the time the object has cooled to 200 K, almost all flux emerges in the mid-infrared, between strong molecular absorption features. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref> also shows the locations of the dominant absorption bands. For objects at these temperatures, absorption is dominated by water, methane, and ammonia, with contributions from PH 3 in the mid-infrared, including the feature at 4.3 µm for the 450 K model spectrum. Features from CO and CO 2 are not present here due to the low mixing ratios of these molecules at these temperatures in chemical equilibrium. Minor differences exist between models at the two shown gravities. We explore the gravity-dependence of features more in the discussion of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows how the changes in molecular abundances and absorption changes the shape of the near-infrared spectra over the T to Y sequence. The wide spectral windows in the water absorption, typical of warmer brown dwarfs, narrow as ammonia and methane increase in abundance in the near-infrared photosphere. As ammonia increases in abundance, the weaker ammonia feature between 1 and 1.1 µm begins to carve away the center of Y band. For the 300 K model shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the Y band is bifurcated into two peaks by this absorption band. The appearance of this split Y band will depend on the nitrogen chemistry; if ammonia is less abundant due to disequilibrium chemistry, this change may occur at a lower temperature. The decline of the alkali absorption with temperature (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> will also affect the underlying continuum absorption in Y band and therefore the appearance of this split.   <ref type="figure">7</ref>.-Opacities of the major constituents of Y and T dwarfs. We choose four representative P-T points in the photospheres of models at three different temperatures (all with log g=5.0): T eff =900 K (P=10 bar, T=1300 K), T eff =450 K (P=10 bar, T=800 K and P=0.3 bar, T=300 K), and T eff =200 K (P=1 bar, T=170 K). We multiply the molecular opacities (cm 2 /molecule) by the number density of that molecule in a solar metallicity atmosphere in thermochemical equilibrium to get a opacity per volume of atmosphere. In this temperature range, the abundances of CO and CO 2 drop by orders of magnitude. Water vapor remains an important opacity source in the top three panels, but drops significantly in the bottom panel because of water condensation. NH <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> gradually become more important as objects cool. PH 3 may also be an important absorber for the Y dwarfs in the mid-infrared.  -Model spectra at four effective temperature spanning mid-T to Y dwarfs (900, 600, 450, 300 K), log g=4.5, and cloud parameters f sed =5, h=0 (900, 600 K) and h=0.5 (450, 300 K). Spectra are rescaled such that the flux at the peak of J band is the same for all models. Note the change in the shape of the near-IR spectral windows. J and H bands narrow as ammonia and methane increase in abundance. Ammonia absorption in Y band causes the band shape to bifurcate for the coolest model. through each of those columns is not equal; since the opacity of the cloud increases the total opacity through the column, less flux always emerges through the cloudy column than through the clear column. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows models at the same effective temperatures, now showing the flux from the cloudy and clear columns. At effective temperatures above 400 K, the water cloud has not yet formed or is extremely thin, so the cloudy and cloud-free columns look quite similar; they differ only substantially in the Y and J bands, which is the region that the deep sulfide clouds affect. At effective temperatures between 300-375 K, the water cloud gradually becomes more optically thick. It first forms quite high in the atmosphere, and influences the mid-infrared from 2.8-5 µm where water ice particles absorb most efficiently (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). For cold Y dwarfs-between 200-300 K-the water cloud thickens as the object cools. At effective temperatures of 200 K, it has become quite optically thick: most regions of the near-and mid-infrared have significantly less flux emerging from the cloudy column. In fact, about 10 4 times less flux emerges at 4.5 µm from the cloudy column than the cloudfree column. This picture, where flux is emitted almost entirely through clearer columns of the atmosphere, is similar to Jupiter and Saturn's deep water clouds, which appear to have holes in the clouds (the so-called '5-micron hot spots' in Jupiter) through which most of the mid-infrared flux emerges.</p></div>

This has been shown using full kinetics models to be a good approximation in substellar atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Visscher &amp; Moses 2011)</ref>. Note that in the disequilibrium chemistry calculation we calculate K zz in the convective zone using mixing length theory and vary K zz in the radiative zone as a free parameter, between 10 2 -10 6 cm 2 /s. In contrast, in the cloud code, we calculate K zz using mixing length theory FIG. 11.-Spectra of models in which we vary the two free parameters of the patchy cloud model, h and f sed . All the models shown have T eff =200 K. In the upper panel, h is varied from 1.0 (cloud-free) to 0.2 (80% of the surface covered in clouds) and f sed =5. In the lower panel, f sed is varied from 3 to 7 and h=0.5. The flux is redistributed when an atmosphere is cloudy; all models have the same total amount of energy emerging. Most prominently, clouds decrease the flux in the major flux peak at 4-5 µm and redistribute that energy from the flux peak into other parts of the spectrum. For example, the cloudiest model is significantly brighter at the K band peak than the cloud-free model. with a minimum K zz of 10 5 cm 2 /s; the clouds and chemistry are thus not strictly self-consistent in the radiative region.</p><p>The results of these calculations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> for three test cases. For the 450 K model, the disequilibrium model is generally slightly brighter across the near-infrared than the equilibrium model. This is because in equilibrium, ammonia is strongly thermochemically favored; out of equilibrium, there is slightly more N 2 , which is not a strong absorber, and slightly less NH 3 , which absorbs strongly across the near-infrared (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). In the mid-infrared, the disequilibrium model is slightly brighter around 4 µm and slightly fainter around 4.6 µm. This is due to the increase in CO and decrease in CH 4 ; this shift increases absorption from the most prominent CO band at 4.5 to 4.9 µm and decreases absorption from both CH 4 and NH 3 between 3 and 4.4 µm. The increase in flux beyond 8 µm is because of the decrease in NH 3 which is the strongest absorber at those wavelengths.</p><p>For the 300 K and 200 K objects shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, disequilibrium chemistry of these particular gases becomes less important as the objects cool. The atmospheres of these colder objects favor CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and NH 3 strongly in equilibrium over a progressively wider proportion of their atmospheres. This means that even if deeper layers were mixed upwards to the photosphere, those layers would still be dominated by CH 4 and NH 3 .</p><p>The shape of the H band has been used as an indicator of the increased abundance in ammonia through the T sequence to the Y dwarfs as they cool (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cushing et al. (2011)</ref>). We show a modeler's version of the same sequence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> with the three sets of spectral indices used to classify T dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burgasser et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Delorme et al. 2008</ref>). The blue side of H band narrows as the object cools, due largely to increased ammonia absorption from 1.5 to 1.6 µm. In equilibrium, the shape changes from 900-450 K as the ammonia absorption increases. Disequilibrium chemistry changes the progression somewhat because the ammonia appears more gradually from 900-300 K. The shape of the disequilibrium H band at 450 K is very similar to the shape of the equilibrium H band at 600 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5.">Decline in the alkali absorption</head><p>Because of the high densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, sodium and potassium bands at optical wavelengths are extremely pressure-broadened in brown dwarf spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tsuji et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allard et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allard et al. , 2007</ref>. There are few other optical absorbers in brown dwarf atmospheres, so these strong pressure-broadened features shape the optical spectra of most brown dwarfs, but for Y dwarfs these atoms begin to wane in abundance. As is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, as sodium and potassium condense into Na 2 S and KCl solid condensates, the depths and widths of the alkali features decrease. Because the slope of the optical spectrum for warmer objects is largely controlled by the pressurebroadening of these features, as they decrease in strength, the overall slope of the optical also decreases, making Y dwarfs somewhat bluer in these colors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.6.">Gravity signatures</head><p>Of great interest to the community in the coming years is the detection of cold planetary mass objects, either orbiting stars or free-floating ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marois et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liu et al. 2013</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows potential gravity signatures for 450 K objects predicted by our models in the near-infrared (Y , J, H, K) and from 3-12 µm. For the near-infrared bands, the inset figure shows the shapes of the bands with the peak flux in the bands normalized to the same relative height. These broad gravity signatures are largely caused by the higher pressure photospheres of higher gravity objects. In Y and J bands, the wings of the alkali bands, especially potassium, extend into these bands. These broad wings are due to the extreme pressure-broadening of the alkali lines. The higher pressures probed in the higher gravity photosphere cause less flux to emerge in both Y and the blue side of J band.</p><p>As opacity sources change due to increased pressure, the temperature profile of the atmosphere adjusts; for Y dwarfs, this brightens H band, causing more flux to emerge from that window.</p><p>In K band, the collision-induced absorption of H 2 is a major opacity source. This feature is quite pressure-dependent, so much like the broadened alkali bands in Y and J bands, the higher gravity atmosphere with the higher pressure photosphere has more total opacity in K band. This decreases the amount of flux that emerges and broadens the K band shape.</p><p>The major gravity dependent feature at wavelengths longer than 3 µm is between 3.5 and 4.7 µm. At these wavelengths, the lower gravity objects have an additional absorber which changes the shape of that mid-infrared feature. This region of the spectrum is in a window between major methane and water absorption features and is the brightest peak in the nearmid-infrared spectra. PH 3 is a strong absorber from 4-4.6 µm and somewhat gravity dependent at those wavelengths, absorbing more strongly in the lower gravity models. Additionally at these wavelengths, due to the different P-T profile at high gravity, we probe somewhat deeper, hotter layers, allowing more flux to emerge from the higher gravity model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Model Photometry</head><p>In order to compare to observations of the Y dwarf population, we calculate model photometry. The radii used to calculate absolute magnitudes were interpolated using the cloudfree evolution models from .</p><p>Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the model photometry are shown for two different gravities (log g=5.0 and log g=4. The first panel (Y − J vs. M Y ) shows that Y dwarfs are significantly bluer in this color than the slightly warmer T dwarfs, with a 0.25 magnitude gap in color between the coolest T dwarfs and warmest Y dwarfs. This bluer Y − J color is expected and indeed predicted by the models, and is due to the condensation of the alkalis into Na 2 S and KCl clouds. As they condense out of the gas phase, the broadened alkali lines decrease in strength ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marley et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. 2003</ref>). Since those lines had been suppressing Y band flux more than J band flux, as they decrease the effect is to make Y − J appear bluer. However, three of the six Y dwarfs with measured Y and J photometry are appreciably bluer than even the bluest models predict, and cloudy models are significantly redder.</p><p>The second CMD shows J − H vs. M J . These colors are most sensitive to the sulfide and chloride clouds, which suppress the Y and J band flux. Since clouds tend to suppress the flux in J band, the clouds make these colors redder, matching the observations of the redder Y dwarfs. The sulfide/chloride clouds wane in importance as objects cool from 450 to 325 K. For objects cooler than 325 K, the water clouds become increasingly important. Counterintuitively, the water clouds tend to make J − H colors bluer; this is because of water ice is strongly scattering (and a poor absorber) in J band but becomes absorbing in H band (see single scattering albedo plot, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Around 325 K, the cloudy color and cloud-free colors are the same.</p><p>On the J − H CMD, a line showing the effect of disequilibrium chemistry is also shown. Interestingly, this also makes the J − H colors redder, mostly due to decreased absorption from NH 3 across the near-infrared. In reality, a combination of condensates and disequilibrium may be affecting Y dwarf spectra.</p><p>The third panel shows H − K vs. M K . Somewhat puzzlingly, all the Y dwarfs except one cluster around a color of 0.0 and M H of 20.5. This behavior is quite different from the late T dwarfs, which have a large spread in H − K colors. The location of this cluster is somewhat redder and brighter in H band than the models predict. This could be due to a number of factors; a major contributor is the incompleteness of the methane line list used in the current study. We expect from preliminary results that the new line list from <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Yurchenko &amp; Tennyson (2014)</ref> will redden these colors.</p><p>The last panel shows the Y dwarfs where they emit the most energy: the mid-infrared. Brown dwarfs get quickly redder in H −[4.5] color as they cool and the peak of the Planck function moves redward. Generally the colors of the objects seem to match the model colors relatively well, with the exception of the two reddest objects, which appear to be brighter than the models at 4.5 microns by up to 2 magnitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">OBSERVING Y DWARFS WITH JWST</head><p>Y dwarfs emit most of their flux in the mid-infrared. This will make their characterization from the ground extremely challenging, especially for the coldest objects. No Y dwarfs had yet been discovered during the Spitzer Space Telescope's cryogenic mission, which ended in 2009, so the coolest brown dwarf to have a mid-infrared IRS spectrum is spectral type T7.5 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Saumon et al. 2006</ref>).

However, we will be able to detect these objects at high SNR between 3.5 and 5.0 µm. The shape of this region is controlled by a variety of absorbers: ammonia and methane on the blue side, water on the red side, and possibly H 2 S, PH 3 (if phosphorous chemistry is in disequilibrium), and CO and CO 2 (if carbon chemistry is in disequilibrium). The prominent feature at 4.2 µm is an ammonia absorption feature and could be useful for determining the effective temperatures of cold brown dwarfs. This window region of the opacity will likely provide the most information about these otherwise very faint objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">MIRI</head><p>MIRI will be capable of low (R∼100) resolution spectroscopy from 5-14 µm and moderate resolution (R∼3000) <ref type="bibr">FIG. 18</ref>.-Model brown dwarf spectra with NIRSpec sensitivity limits.

It is the only JWST instrument that will observe wavelengths longer than 5 µm and will be 50 times more sensitive than the Spitzer Space Telescope. The MIRI moderate resolution spectrograph has four channels: channel 1 from 5.0-7.7 µm, channel 2 from 7.7-11.9 µm, channel 3 from 11.9-18.3 µm, and channel 4 from 18.3-28.3 µm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref> shows the sensitivity for each of these bands; like the NIRSpec sensitivity limits, these sensitivity lines represent the faintest continuum flux observable with an integration time per channel of 10 5 seconds (27.8 hours) and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10, and we show example spectra of the same brown dwarf models located 5 pc from Earth. The MIRI sensitivity at 6.4 µm is about 10 times less sensitive than the NIRSpec sensitivity at 5 µm. This is due to a combination of instrumental effects, including MIRI's higher dark current, higher intrinsic spectral resolution, finer spatial sampling, lower quantum efficiency, and additional optics. To obtain the full 5-28 µm spectrum without gaps, three separate observations (using three different settings of the MRS spectrograph) are needed, so the actual observing time to acquire these spectra is three times as long.</p><p>Many of the current suite of Y dwarfs discovered to date using the WISE data will be easily observable using this instrument.

The T eff =450 K model shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref> is well above the sensitivity limit for 5-18.3 µm. This will allow us to probe parts of the spectrum where the opacity is dominated by different molecules: water from 5-7.2 µm, methane from 7.2-8.5 µm, and ammonia from 8.5-18 µm. Channel 4 is much less sensitive so a 450 K object is only marginally detectable from 18-28.3 µm with a SNR of 10.</p><p>The coldest brown dwarfs will push the sensitivity limits for this instrument. No objects colder than 300 K have been discovered to date, but if we find such objects, they will be quite challenging to observe. The highest SNR spectra will be from channels 2 and 3, from 7.7-18.3 µm. This wavelength range is shaped by methane, ammonia, and H 2 CIA. Objects below 300 K will be only marginally detectable in channel 1 and not detectable in channel 4 at R∼1000. Binning the spectra to R∼300 would improve sensitivity by a factor of ∼3, improving the detection limit for T eff =250 K objects and still providing adequate resolution for identifying prominent molecular bands.</p></div>

These instruments are somewhat less well-suited to the spectral characterization of the coolest brown dwarfs. NIRISS is optimized for high contrast imaging, high resolution imaging of extended sources, and transiting exoplanet measurements; it also has a widefield R∼150 slitless spectroscopy mode designed for detecting high redshift emission lines. However, for the characterization of cool brown dwarfs, sensitivity is the most important feature.</p><p>NIRCam does have a grism mode that will be capable of 2.4-5 µm R∼2000 slitless spectroscopy. However, its sensitivity at those wavelengths will be somewhat lower than NIRSpec's sensitivity. The lower sensitivity is because NIRCam uses a slitless grism that is sensitive to sky background across a large field. This mode is more optimized for precision photometry and stability, making it a powerful instrument for, e.g., exoplanet transmission spectra and secondary eclipses. For the sensitivity-limited work needed to characterize Y dwarfs, NIRSpec will be a more suitable instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">OBSERVING COLD DIRECTLY-IMAGED PLANETS</head><p>Observing directly-imaged giant planets at the temperatures of Y dwarfs (200-450 K) will push the limits of current technology. Nonetheless, some current or soon forthcoming instruments specialized for high-contrast imaging will be capable of detecting such planets. If planets with masses between 1 and 10 M J are quite common, systems of a variety of ages will have planets with these temperatures. Depending on the mechanism of formation, a 10 M J planet will reach T eff =450 K at an age of 1-2 Gyr. A 5 M J planet will reach T eff =450 K in 300-600 Myr; a 1 M J planet in <ref type="bibr">20-30 Myr (Fortney et al. 2008)</ref>. The current and forthcoming instruments most capable of detecting such planets are the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE), and the Large Binocular Telescope Adaptive Optics System (LBTAO). <ref type="bibr">GPI (Macintosh et al. 2006</ref>) and SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beuzit et al. 2006</ref>) are instruments designed for 8-meter class telescopes and optimized for studying young hot giant planets around bright stars. Both will have advanced adaptive optics systems and hope to achieve planet-star flux contrasts between 10 −6 and 10 −8 . They will target young stars to find self-luminous planets and expect to find up to dozens of planets in their initial campaign surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">McBride et al. 2011</ref>).</p></div>

It is capable of 4.8×10 −6 contrast in L' band ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skemer et al. 2014</ref>) for a bright star and has six narrow band filters spanning 3.04 to 3.78 µm. This spectral region is particularly useful for two reasons: first, the planet-star flux ratio is much higher for cool planets in L and M bands. Second, this spectral region spans the most prominent methane feature at 3.3 µm, allowing for the characterization of a prominent atmospheric component. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Skemer et al.

Note that, because it operates in the midinfrared where the sky is bright, the LBTAO system is also background limited; it can only observe objects brighter than ∼18th magnitude in L ′ . This limit approximately corresponds to a 350 K object at 10 pc. More distant objects will therefore be background limited; closer objects will be contrast limited.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION 6.1. Outstanding Issues</head><p>Discrepancies between models and observations may indicate that the physics or ingredients in the model are either incorrect or incomplete. For example, there are many sources of uncertainty in the molecular opacity databases.</p><p>Alkali opacity uncertainties may affect the optical and nearinfrared. The handful of Y dwarfs that have observed Y − J color suggest that these objects are bluer in this color than the models. This spectral region is controlled in part by the decline of the strongly pressure-broadened alkali opacity, so this mismatch could be due to the treatment used for the alkali opacity. For these calculations, we use the line broadening treatment outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. (2000)</ref>, which is somewhat ad hoc and potentially creates some inaccuracies in the model flux in Y and J bands. A calculation of the molecular potentials for potassium and sodium in these high pressure environments, as is carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allard et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allard et al. ( , 2007</ref>, would improve the accuracy of these models. Subsolar metallicities also make Y − J colors bluer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mace et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 2006</ref>), so it is important to model the opacity correctly to interpret metallicity measurements using this spectral region.</p><p>Another known source of opacity uncertainty is in the methane line list; the list used in this study is known to be incomplete. The new line list from <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Yurchenko et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Yurchenko &amp; Tennyson (2014)</ref> has over nine billion lines and will vastly improve accuracy of the treatment of methane.</p><p>It is possible that we may be missing important physical processes in our models that occur in actual Y dwarfs. For example, an assumption we make when calculating the spectra is that the atmospheres are in radiative-convective equilibrium. It is inevitable that real brown dwarf atmospheres have higher levels of complexity than these simple assumptions. The upper atmospheres of brown dwarfs could be heated by a similar mechanism to that which creates Jupiter's thermosphere, in which energy is deposited high in the atmosphere by dissipation of gravity waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Young et al. 1997)</ref>. If indeed the upper atmosphere is hotter than radiative-convective equilibrium models, this would change the observed spectrum. Using mid-infrared spectra of L dwarfs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sorahana et al. (2014)</ref> show that several L dwarf spectra can be fit significantly better using a model that allows for this upper atmospheric heating. In fact, in our equilibrium models the [3.6]− <ref type="bibr">[4.5]</ref> color is redder by ∼1 magnitude at some T eff ; simple preliminary models in which we change the P-T profile of the upper atmosphere show that heating high in the atmosphere increases the flux within the methane band centered at 3.3 µm, which makes the [3.6]− <ref type="bibr">[4.5]</ref> color bluer, and closer to the observed colors.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that the models here include only solar abundances. We expect Y dwarfs and exoplanets to have a range of metallicities and potentially a range of other abundance ratios such as non-solar C/O ratios. Future work will be needed to analyze the effect of abundances on Y dwarf spectra and colors.</p><p>We consider disequilibrium chemistry of N 2 /NH 3 and CO/CH 4 , but other molecules such as PH <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and CO 2 may also be out of chemical equilibrium. Such unmodeled chemistry could change abundances of molecules we do include, or create additional molecules that we do not include in the calculations.</p><p>As 1D models, these calculations naturally do not include the effect of 3D dynamics on the cloud structure. The breakup of the iron and silicate clouds at the L/T transition is a source of continued study; due to dynamical processes, those clouds dissipate at higher temperatures than 1D cloud settling models predict. As the sulfide and salt clouds sink more deeply into the atmosphere as the brown dwarf cools, they may also break up and disappear from spectra at higher temperatures than our treatment predicts. Further study, including dynamical effects, will be necessary to understand this phenomenon across the brown dwarf spectral sequence.</p></div>

Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. (2003)</ref>, we predict the growing importance of methane and ammonia absorption over the T to Y sequence, the weakening of the alkali absorption, and a reversal in the blueward trend in near-IR colors of the T dwarfs around 400 K. Our spectra differ in details due largely to changes in the line lists over the past decade; we have continuously improved our opacity database over the last ten years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Freedman et al. 2008</ref>). Most relevant here, we are using updated treatments for both ammonia (which becomes very important for Y dwarfs) and H 2 collision-induced absorption.</p><p>One of the conclusions presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al.

The differences lie in our treatment of the cloud model for the water clouds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al.

Since our cloud particles are much smaller (∼1-20 µm), we have far more particles to create a cloud of the same mass. This means that when our water cloud forms, it is much more optically thick.

WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 (hereafter WISEP J1828+2650) is a particularly interesting object. Its nearinfrared colors are inconsistent with the models and with the other Y dwarfs. The peculiarities of the near-infrared colors and comparisons to models led <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cushing et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kirkpatrick et al. (2012)</ref> to classify it as a &gt;Y0 and &gt;Y2 respectively; comparisons to models gave Cushing et al. (2011) a temperature estimate of T eff ≤300 K. However, for a brown dwarf that cold to have the measured mid-infrared luminosity, it would need to have an unphysically large radius, leading <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leggett et al. (2013)</ref> to suggest that it is an unresolved binary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dupuy &amp; Kraus (2013)</ref> revised the parallax measurement and found that based on its luminosity, WISEP J1828+2650 likely has a temperature closer to the late T dwarfs, 500-600 K, and that even if it is a binary, those components must still be 400-500 K.</p><p>Using the models presented here, it is not possible to fit all of the near-infrared colors of WISEP J1828+2650 using a lower gravity model. For example, the models predict that a brighter J band flux and corresponding bluer J − H color at lower gravity, due to the decreased strength of the alkali absorption in a lower gravity photosphere, whereas for this object we observe an extremely red J − H color.</p><p>Additional spectroscopic data at near-and mid-infrared wavelengths will be required to determine whether WISEP J1828+2650 is indeed a prototypical T eff ≤300 K Y dwarf, or a peculiar version of the T8-Y0 spectral classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>As brown dwarfs approach the effective temperatures of the solar system's planets, volatile clouds will form in their atmospheres. The first and most massive type of volatile cloud that forms is water ice clouds. Water ice clouds form in objects cooler than effective temperatures of ∼400 K. In order to converge atmospheric temperature structures selfconsistently with both clouds and chemistry, we calculate models in which, like water clouds in the solar system planets, the clouds heterogeneously cover the surface ("patchy" clouds). Our model grid covers the Y dwarf spectral class as well as giant planets with the same effective temperatures, from T eff =200-450 K and log g=3.0-5.0.</p><p>Our main results include: 1. While water condenses high in the atmospheres of all objects below T eff ∼400 K, these clouds do not become optically thick until the object has cooled to 350-375 K. This result means that for the current set of Y dwarfs warmer than 400 K, water clouds will not strongly effect their spectra.</p><p>2. Water clouds, unlike other clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres, are very much non-gray absorbers. Using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> cloud model, water ice particle sizes range from ∼1-20 µm. For these particle sizes, the ice particles are strongly scattering in the optical through J band and do not change the spectra significantly at those wavelengths. The ice particles absorb strongly in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which is at 2.8 µm.</p><p>3. H 2 O, NH 3 , CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , and H 2 CIA are the dominant opacity sources in Y dwarf atmospheres. Less abundant species such as PH 3 may also be observable at 4-4.6 µm, as well as H 2 S in H and Y bands and the alkalis in the optical.</p><p>4. JWST's MIRI and NIRSpec instruments will be wellsuited to characterizing cool brown dwarfs. T eff =400-500 K objects will be observable across their near-and mid-infrared spectra, and even T eff =200 K objects will be observable in the spectral window region between 3.8 and 5.0 µm and at some wavelengths between 8 and 17 µm. Existing and upcoming ground-based instruments such as GPI, SPHERE, and LBTAO will be capable of directly-imaging T eff =400-500 K planets around nearby G dwarfs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.-Partly cloudy model atmospheres. This cartoon illustrates our approach to calculating pressure-temperature profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium for partly cloudy atmospheres. We calculate the flux separately through two columns: one that does not include cloud opacity and one that does. We then sum these fluxes to calculate the total flux, according to the fraction of the surface we assume to be covered by holes, h. h = 1 represents a fully clear atmosphere; h = 0 represents a fully cloudy atmosphere. For the models in the grid presented here, h = 0.5.</figDesc></figure>

The results of the Mie scattering calculation (Qscat and Q abs ) for water clouds of three particle sizes are shown. These results are for single particle sizes, not a distribution of sizes. All three show similar general properties, with low Q abs in the optical rising into the infrared and the strongest absorbing feature around 3 µm. Larger particles are more efficient at both absorbing and scattering for most wavelengths.</figDesc></figure>

For models with T eff =200 K and 275 K, the single scattering albedos of both the water and Na 2 S cloud are shown for a single atmospheric layer. The water cloud forms high in the atmosphere (2 bar and 0.03 bar for the layers shown from the 200 and 275 K models, respectively) and the Na 2 S cloud forms deeper (200 and 60 bar, respectively). The sulfide cloud single scattering albedo is relatively uniform, rising from ∼0.6 in the optical to 0.9 at 10 µm. The water cloud single scattering albedo has many more features, which vary with particle size (the mode particle size is ∼20 µm for the 200 K model and ∼5 µm for the 275 K model; the single scattering albedo is calculated for the distribution of particle sizes calculated using the cloud code). In the optical the single scattering albedo is 1.0, which means that the water clouds do not absorb efficiently at short wavelengths.</figDesc></figure>

The curve represents the pressure-temperature points at which the partial pressure of the gas is equal to the saturation vapor pressure; to the left of the curve, the partial pressure of each gas is higher than the saturation vapor pressure and the excess vapor will form a cloud. The kinks in the profile in the upper atmosphere are numerical and do not represent 'real' features in the atmospheres of Y dwarfs. Fortunately, the kinks lie above the regions of the atmosphere from which flux emerges and so they do not pose a problem for this work.</figDesc></figure>
