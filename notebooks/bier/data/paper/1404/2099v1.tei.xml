				<p>Context. Stellar properties and in particular stellar radii of exoplanet host-stars are essential for measuring properties of exoplanets. Therefore it is becoming increasingly important to be able to supply reliable stellar radii fast. Grid-modelling is an obvious choice to do this, but that only offers a low degree of transparency to the non-experts. Aims. Here we present a new method to obtain stellar properties for stars exhibiting solar-like oscillations in an easy, fast, and transparent way. The method, called Asteroseismology Made Easy (AME), can determine stellar masses, mean-densities, radii, and surface gravities, as well as estimate ages. In this writing we present AME as a visual and powerful tool which could be useful; in particular in the light of the large number of exoplanets being found. Methods. AME consists of a set of figures from which the stellar parameters are deduced. These figures are made from a grid of stellar evolutionary models that cover masses ranging from 0.7M to 1.6M in steps of 0.1M and metallicities in the interval −0.3 dex ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +0.3 dex in increments of 0.1 dex. The stellar evolutionary models are computed using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code with simple input physics. Results. We have compared the results from AME with results for three groups of stars; stars with radii determined from interferom-etry (and measured parallaxes), stars with radii determined from measurements of their parallaxes (and calculated angular diameters), and stars with results based on the modelling of their individual oscillation frequencies. We find that a comparison of the radii from interferometry to those from AME yield a weighted mean of the fractional differences of just 2%. This is also the level of deviation that we find when we compare the parallax-based radii to the radii determined from AME. Conclusions. The comparison between independently determined stellar parameters and those found using AME show that our method can provide reliable stellar masses, radii, and ages, with median uncertainties in the order of 4%, 2%, and 25% respectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head> <ref type="bibr">NASA's Kepler Mission (Koch et al. 2010</ref><p>) has provided photometric light curves of high precision which has enabled the detection of solar-like oscillations in more than 500 stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chaplin et al. 2011</ref>). Asteroseismic scaling relations are generally used to determine properties of such stars (for a recent review on those issues see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chaplin &amp; Miglio 2013)</ref>. If one considers stars in hydrostatic equilibrium, it follows from homology that since the dynamical time scale is proportional to ¯ ρ −1/2 (where ¯ ρ is the mean-density) the oscillation frequencies will be proportional to ¯ ρ 1/2 . In the asymptotic approximation (see e.g. page 218 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aerts et al. 2010</ref>) the frequency spectrum for a star can be written as a function of radial order (n) and angular degree () as ν n,, = ∆ν · (n + /2 + ε) − ( + 1) · D 0 .</p><p>(1)</p><p>Since the frequencies scale with the square root of the meandensity, the main regularity in the asymptotic relation (expression (1)), the large separation (∆ν), will therefore be proportional to √ ¯ ρ. The parameters D 0 and ε will depend on the detailed internal structure of a given star and can e.g. be used to estimate its age.</p><p>http://sac.au.dk/scientific-data/ame e-mail: lundkvist@phys.au.dk</p><p>The large separation can be found from the sound-speed integral:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆ν =           2 R 0 dr c(r)           −1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R is the stellar radius and c(r) the sound-speed in the stellar interior. We will in this study use this most fundamental asteroseismic parameter ∆ν to estimate the stellar mean-density. It has been common to also use the frequency at maximum oscillation power (ν max ) to measure the gravity of a given star since observationally it has been shown to be proportional to the acoustic cut-off frequency in the atmosphere (which scales with g/ √ T eff ). While the observational link to the acoustic cut-off frequency is established ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stello et al. 2009a</ref>) we still need to better understand the theoretical background for this relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Belkacem et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Belkacem et al. , 2013</ref>). An issue in relation to the use of ν max is that there is a tight relation between ν max and ∆ν (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stello et al. 2009a</ref>). This is the reason why we in the present study only consider ∆ν and not ν max .</p><p>Obtaining stellar parameters such as mass, radius, and age through detailed modelling (modelling based on individual oscillation frequencies) for just one star showing solar-like pulsations can be a very time-consuming task. As an alternative, one or more of the analysis pipelines described in for instance <ref type="bibr">Quirion et al. (2010) (SEEK)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mathur et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stello et al. (2009b)</ref> (RADIUS), <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Basu et al. (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gai et al. (2011)</ref> can be utilised. However, this grid-based modelling does not offer a very transparent procedure and inconsistencies can occur between the mean-density derived using the large separation ( ¯ ρ ∝ ∆ν 2 ) and the mean-density found using the grid-determined mass and radius ( ¯ ρ ∝ M/R 3 ). This is primarily an effect of mass and radius being determined individually ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Quirion et al. 2010)</ref> and the fact that grid-based modelling sometimes yield bimodal parameter distributions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">White et al. (2011a)</ref> discuss the potential of constraining stellar masses and ages for main-sequence (MS) and sub-giant solarlike oscillators using diagrams based on their pulsation properties, such as the Christensen-Dalsgaard and the ε diagrams. However, ε can be hard to constrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(White et al. 2011b</ref>), and the Christensen-Dalsgaard diagram requires the value of the small separation (δν) to be known and this is usually not available. The reason for this is that to find δν some modes with = 2 need to be discernible in the power spectrum, which is often not the case.</p><p>Therefore we have developed a method to obtain selfconsistent mean-densities along with other stellar parameters in an easy and fast way for MS and sub-giant stars showing solarlike oscillations. We consider this method to be transparent because it is easy to follow, from considering the figures, what effect a small change in one of the input parameters would have on the result. By scaling to the Sun we have made our method less sensitive to the stellar models and evolution code used. We call this method AME -Asteroseismology Made Easy. The aim of this paper is to present AME as a powerful and visual tool which does not need the frequency of maximum power to yield basic stellar properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The AME models</head><p>AME allows for the determination of stellar mean-density ( ¯ ρ), mass (M), and age (τ), and by inference surface gravity (g) and radius (R) of MS and sub-giant stars showing solar-like oscillations. The method is based on a grid of models spanning a range in metallicity and mass from which we have made plots that can be used to determine the aforementioned parameters. We wanted to make our determination of the stellar parameters as insensitive as possible to the choice of evolution code used. Therefore, we have scaled all results to the Sun and we have tested the effects on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (H-R diagram) of using different evolution codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The importance of the evolution code</head><p>We have tested the sensitivity of our method to the choice of stellar evolution code and solar chemical composition. We did this to make sure that the results that come out of AME are not affected to any significant degree by either of the two. In order to facilitate this test, we computed a series of evolution tracks and compared them qualitatively.</p><p>We calculated a series of four models using each of the three evolution codes MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paxton et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Paxton et al. , 2013</ref>, ASTEC (Aarhus STellar Evolution Code, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008)</ref>, and GARSTEC (Garching Stellar Evolution Code, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Weiss &amp; Schlattl 2008)</ref>. These four models consisted of two using the solar abundances by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grevesse &amp; Sauval (1998)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(hereafter GS98</ref>) and two using 4800 5000 5200 5400 5600 5800 6000 6200</p><p>T 1.0M , GS98, MESA 1.2M , GS98, MESA 1.0M , A09, MESA 1.2M , A09, MESA For each set of abundances we computed an evolution track for a 1.0M and for a 1.2M star.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1.0M , GS98, ASTEC 1.2M , GS98, ASTEC 1.0M , A09, ASTEC 1.2M , A09, ASTEC 1.0M , GS98, GARSTEC 1.2M , GS98, GARSTEC 1.0M , A09, GARSTEC 1.2M , A09, GARSTEC</formula><p>The tracks were calculated using as similar input physics as possible for the three evolution codes. The input microphysics that we used were the 2005 update of the OPAL EOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rogers et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rogers &amp; Nayfonov 2002)</ref>, the OPAL opacities (Iglesias &amp; Rogers 1996) supplemented by the <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ferguson et al. (2005)</ref> opacities at low temperatures, the NACRE nuclear reaction rates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angulo et al. 1999</ref>) with the updated 14 N(p, γ) 15 O reaction rate by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Formicola et al. (2004)</ref>, and no diffusion or settling.</p><p>For the macrophysics, we neglected convective overshoot and used an Eddington T − τ relation as the atmospheric boundary condition. We treated convection using the mixing-length theory of convection; in the case of GARSTEC in the formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kippenhahn et al. (2013)</ref>, and in the cases of ASTEC and MESA in the formulation of <ref type="bibr">Böhm-Vitense (1958)</ref>.</p><p>Before the tracks were made, each of the codes was calibrated to the Sun using each of the GS98 and A09 abundances. This calibration was performed by adjusting the mixing-length parameter (α ML ) and the initial helium (Y 0 ) and heavy-element (Z 0 ) mass-fractions until a model with the mass of the Sun had the solar radius and luminosity, and a surface value of Z/X in accordance with the abundances chosen, at the age of the Sun. The target values of Z/X were (for the present-day photosphere): (Z/X) GS98 = 0.0231 and (Z/X) A09 = 0.0181 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asplund et al. 2009</ref>). The twelve resulting tracks can be found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>There are two places where the evolution tracks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> differ slightly. This is at the bottom of the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and in the 1.2M case around the MS turn-off. The difference at the bottom of the RGB is not really relevant here since the stars in this region are not the prime focus of AME. The difference around the MS turn-off is to be expected since the change from a radiative core on the MS to a convective core happens at a mass just around 1.2M and as a consequence there is a high sensitivity to any small differences between the codes at this particular mass. This is why this mass was included in the test in the first place, and the codes do not differ drastically. The GARSTEC tracks show clear signs of convective cores for both solar compositions (GS98 and A09) and the ASTEC and MESA tracks al-so show convective cores in both cases, but these are very small when using the A09 abundances. The difference in the size of the convective core when using the GS98 and A09 abundances can be understood since the GS98 composition has a higher abundance of the CNO-elements than the A09 composition. This higher CNO-element abundance will cause the CNO cycle to be more important which will lead to a slightly higher temperature dependence in the core since the CNO cycle depends more strongly on the temperature than the pp-chain. Thereby, the temperature gradient in the core will be slightly larger and therefore a star with the GS98 abundances will be more prone to have a convective core (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Christensen-Dalsgaard &amp; Houdek 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the three codes give quite similar results. This is reassuring because it means that the decision to use MESA to make the stellar models for AME does not significantly affect the results. Also, we chose to use the A09 abundances to make the AME grid of models, and it is evident from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> that this choice does not have a great impact on the results either. However, it is not clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> how the ages of the different tracks compare. We have found that for the most evolved star that AME has been used on, the ages coming from the different tracks agree at the 5% level. This means that also the ages from AME are fairly insensitive to the choice of evolution code and set of abundances, at least to the uncertainty level of the ages from AME (see Sect. 6.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Grid of scaled models</head><p>We used stellar models obtained with MESA to generate a grid of models with masses spanning 0.7M − 1.6M in steps of 0.1M and metallicities in the range −0.3 dex ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +0.3 dex in increments of 0.1 dex.</p><p>We chose to keep the stellar models simple which meant that we used MESA with the input physics described in Sect. 2.1 with the exception that we used the MESA photospheric tables ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paxton et al. 2011</ref>) instead of an Eddington grey atmosphere. The value of the mixing length parameter was kept fixed at the value found by calibrating to the Sun; α ML = 1.71.</p><p>The hydrogen-(X), helium-(Y), and heavy-element massfractions (Z) obtained from the solar calibration assuming the A09 abundances were used to compute the stellar mass-fractions assuming</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[Fe/H] = [M/H] = log Z X * − log Z X ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the subscript * indicates the star, and the initial solar mixture is known from our solar calibration; X = 0.71247 and Z = 0.01605 (we use the modelled solar composition when the Sun arrived on the ZAMS in equation (3) since our models contain no diffusion or settling). We used a helium evolution of and heavy-element mass-fraction of Z BBN = 0. This, in combination with the well-known relation X + Y + Z = 1, allowed us to determine the stellar mass-fractions for a given metallicity.</p><p>All of the models in the grid were evolved until they reached a large separation of 20 µHz since this does not happen until far beyond the MS which is the prime focus of AME.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Implications of the chosen input physics</head><p>Since we have chosen to use simple input physics for our grid of models, we have made choices which may lead to significant systematic errors in our results (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonaca et al. 2012</ref>, for a discussion of the mixing length parameter). These choices include to neglect diffusion and overshoot and only consider one value of the mixing length parameter and the helium evolution.</p><p>In order to investigate the likely size and direction of any such systematics, we have tested the influence of changed input physics on our results. We did this by computing evolutionary tracks for five stellar masses (M = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 M ) where we changed one of our assumptions at a time (using just a single metallicity). We computed two sets of tracks that used a different mixing length parameter (one higher than our solar calibration and one lower; α ML = 1.51 and α ML = 1.91), one set of tracks that included overshoot (with a value f ov = 0.015), one set that incorporated element diffusion, and two sets that used a different helium evolution (again, one with a lower value and one with a higher value than the one we chose; ∆Y ∆Z = 1.00 and ∆Y ∆Z = 1.82). Subsequently, we compared the masses and radii derived for 20 artificial stars using the tracks with our chosen input physics to the results obtained when using each of the sets of tracks with an altered input physics. The median difference (in the sense changed physics -chosen physics) can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>As can be seen from the table, the systematic effects that may be caused by neglecting convective overshoot or diffusion are rather small for the selected mass range while they are significant when choosing only a single value for α ML and ∆Y</p><p>∆Z . Yet we have chosen to do this to keep the input physics and the method itself simple. As a consequence, these systematic effects should be borne in mind (and note that we solely quote internal uncertainties throughout this paper). <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Valle et al. (2014)</ref> has obtained similar values for the effect on mass and radius from changing the value of the mixing length parameter or the helium evolution. However, they consider a lower mass range (0.8 ≤ M/M ≤ 1.1). This may explain why they find diffusion to be more significant than we do since diffusion is known to play an important role in the Sun, but seem to be counteracted by processes like radiative levitation for Fstars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Turcotte et al. 1998)</ref>. This is also one of the reasons why we chose to neglect diffusion (radiative levitation is not included in MESA, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paxton et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The systematic uncertainties caused by the negligence of convective overshoot is not considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Valle et al. (2014)</ref>, but we find that for the masses we investigated, it does not significantly influence the mass or the radius. However, it can affect the age. Including overshoot will cause typical age differences which are vanishingly small compared to the age uncertainties in AME (see Sect. 6.3), but during the MS turn-off, the age differences can be on the order of 15% which is quite significant (see for instance Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Aguirre et al. 2011</ref>, who find a similar value). However this phase of evolution is very fast and the chance of catching a star during this evolutionary step is fairly low. Therefore we have assumed that convective overshoot can be disregarded.</p><p>It is worth noting that while the systematics are not negligible they are still smaller than the median uncertainties on mass, radius, and age returned by AME which are 4%, 2%, and 25% respectively (see Sect. 6.3). Also, we have found that our results are in excellent agreement with the stellar parameters found in the literature (see Sects. 5 and 6). The Sun </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The AME figures</head><p>The foundation of AME is the grid of models created using MESA, which we described in Sect. 2.2. We have used some of the output parameters from each model in the grid to create three types of plots. The idea of using plots to obtain stellar parameters came from the observation that evolutionary tracks in an H-R diagram look approximately similar for lines of neighbouring mass and metallicity. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> which shows ∆ν as a function of T eff for models of solar metallicity. Based on this, we expected to be able to more or less make lines of different masses and metallicities overlap if we adjusted the axes -both in a plot like <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> and when plotting other stellar properties against each other. The model outputs that we have used to make the AME plots are the large separation, the mass, the age, the temperature, the metallicity, and the mean-density. We scaled the found large separation by the ratio of the observed solar large separation to the modelled solar large separation (from the MESA solar calibration, calculated from the sound-speed integral in expression (2)); ∆ν ,obs ∆ν ,mod = 134.95 µHz 141.8768 µHz = 0.95118, where the observed value of the solar large separation is from <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Toutain &amp; Fröhlich (1992)</ref>. This was done in order to correct for the difference between the ∆ν found from (2) which does not take near-surface effects into account and the observed ∆ν found as ∆ν = ν n+1,0 − ν n,0 which is affected by this. We have checked that the ratio found for the Sun is consistent with the ratios of ∆ν found from model frequencies to ∆ν found from the sound-speed integral (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2)</ref>) for other stars to around 1% and that this is independent of mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. A similar discrepancy has been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chaplin et al. (2013a)</ref> between the ∆ν found from the oscillation frequencies and the one calculated from the scaling relation ∆ν ∝ √ ¯ ρ (see Sect. 1). In order to take the small difference into account and not to end up with an erroneously low error bar on the stellar parameters, we have set a lower limit on the uncertainty on ∆ν of 1%. Thus if a star has a lower uncertainty on the large separation than 1%, we inflate this uncertainty to be 1% before we use AME. This means that the plots (created using models) can (and should) be used with observed values of the large separation. By always scaling to the Sun it should also be possible to compensate for any systematic effect which is shared by all the models in the grid.</p><p>From the three types of plots, the mass, mean-density, and age can be determined based on only the large separation (∆ν), the effective temperature (T eff ), and the metallicity ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>) of the star, using linear interpolation between the lines in the plots. From the mean-density and the mass, the radius and surface gravity can be derived using equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> respectively:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R R = M M 1/3 ¯ ρ ¯ ρ −1/3 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">g g = M M 1/3 ¯ ρ ¯ ρ 2/3 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>There are several versions of each type of plot which each corresponds to a region of the (∆ν, T eff , [Fe/H]) parameter space with a small overlap. An example of each type of plot can be seen in Figs. 3 (mass), 4 (mean-density), and 5 (age) in Sect. 4. The full set of figures consisting of three mass plots, six meandensity plots and six age plots can be found in the appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The figure axes</head><p>The axes on the plots have been chosen to make the masses separate out in the type of plot used to determine stellar mass, and the mass and metallicity to have as little effect as possible when establishing the stellar mean-density and age. Thus the axes are the results of iterations based on physical expectations and the attempt to make the lines collapse. Below, we describe the axes of each plot-type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">The axes of the mass plots</head><p>For the type of plot used to determine the masses (an example can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>) we have used axes of the form T eff · 10 a · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and ∆ν · 10 −b · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> . The large separation decreases monotonically through the evolution of a solar-like oscillator whilst lines of constant density across evolution tracks in an H-R diagram have different temperatures. Therefore a temperature versus large separation plot should separate out the different masses. The small metallicity dependence given by the variables a and b is used to collapse the lines of differing metallicity, but identical mass. The coefficients vary from plot to plot, but in each case the values which were found empirically to best collapse the lines were chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">The axes of the mean-density plots</head><p>In the type of plot used to infer the mean-density, the main relation that we have used is the well-known asteroseismic scaling relation ∆ν ∝ √ ¯ ρ <ref type="bibr">(Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bedding &amp; Kjeld- sen 2010)</ref> which was also mentioned in Sect. 1. Following it, ¯ ρ/∆ν 2 is expected to be reasonably constant for all stars. Therefore, this is used on the x-axis since it results in a large precision on the mean-density. It is used in combination with a small metallicity dependence as in the mass plots, and a slight mass dependence. These serve the purpose of collapsing the lines to the largest extent possible.</p><p>On the other axis we have used a combination of the form ∆ν · M c · 10 −d · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> . Thereby, except for the small metallicity dependence which serves the same purpose as previously, the axis is a product of the large separation and the mass. The exponent of the mass (c) varies a little from plot to plot (again, depending on what is found to best collapse the lines), but it is in the order of one. Based on the approximate proportionality on the MS of radius and mass, the product of the mass to a power in the vicinity of unity and the large separation will be roughly similar for all stars on the MS, which explains why this is on the y-axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">The axes of the age plots</head><p>The x-axis of the age plots has the form ∆ν · M f · 10 g · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> where g can be both negative and positive, but is around zero and f is positive and around one. This is therefore much the same axis as was used on the y-axis of the mean-density plots.</p><p>The y-axis features the age of the star and the mass to an approximate exponent of four in addition to a now well-known term in metallicity to help collapse the lines. The use of the product τ · M 4 was based on the nuclear time scale which is given by t nuc ∝ ML −1 (equation (1.90) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hansen et al. 2004</ref>) and the luminosity-mass relation for low-mass stars L ∝ M 5.5 (page 29 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hansen et al. 2004</ref>). Combining these two and taking the nuclear time scale as an estimate of the total stellar age, it is found that the product of stellar age and mass to the power of ∼ 4.5 is expected to be more or less similar for all stars. This is why we used it on the y-axis of the age plots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The 3 steps in using AME; the case of α Cen A</head><p>AME has been used on a number of stars which either have radii determined from interferometry (and measured parallaxes), radii based on parallax measurements (and calculations of the stellar angular diameters), or parameters found from detailed modelling (in some cases in combination with other methods). One of these stars is the solar-like star α Cen A whose values of its spectroscopic parameters, large separation, and mass, radius, and age can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> along with the properties of the other stars with results from detailed modelling (listed in order of decreasing large separation). In order to illustrate the use of AME, we describe in Sects. 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 below how we used AME to obtain the stellar parameters for α Cen A. Furthermore, in Sect. 4.4 we explain how we determined the internal uncertainties on the stellar parameters.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[µHz] [Fe/H] = -0.3 [Fe/H] = -0.2 [Fe/H] = -0.1 [Fe/H] = 0 [Fe/H] = +0.1 [Fe/H] = +0.2 [Fe/H] = +0.3 α Cen A</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Step 1: Determining the stellar mass</head><p>The first step that we performed using AME on α Cen A was to find the mass. Depending primarily on the known values of the effective temperature and large separation, the appropriate version of the mass plot had to be used, and we chose the relevant one for α Cen A. The plot can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> with the location of α Cen A marked by a star. This plot was chosen firstly because it encompassed the parameters of α Cen A, and secondly because the star did not fall in the grey-shaded region of the plot. It can easily been seen from this figure that α Cen A lies almost on top of the 1.1M (the yellow) lines. By considering the metallicity of the star, we found the mass to be M = 1.10M using linear interpolation between the lines of different masses and metallicities. It should be noted that this value is in excellent agreement with the value listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> which is found using the binarity of the α Cen system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Step 2: Finding the mean stellar density</head><p>The second step was to find the mean-density of α Cen A. This could be done by using the suitable mean-density plot after we had determined the mass. The mean-density plot that we used can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref>. This particular plot was chosen because it covered the mass and metallicity of α Cen A.</p><p>From the expression on the y-axis, we calculated the y-axis location of α Cen A in the plot. This is marked by a horizontal, black, dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref>. The mean-density of α Cen A was now determined by first interpolating the crossing of the dashed line with the lines of surrounding masses (1.1M and 1.2M ) and metallicities (+0.2 dex and +0.3 dex) to find the position of the crossing between the horizontal, dashed line and a line with the metallicity and mass of α Cen A. This gave us the position on the x-axis of α Cen A and thereby the value of ¯ ρ/∆ν 2 · M 0.01 · 10 −0.015 · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> . Using the large separation and the metallicity from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> along with the mass found from the pre-  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2003)</ref>; <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>   vious plot, we then calculated the mean-density of α Cen A to be ¯ ρ = 0.6042 ¯ ρ .</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">[µHz(M )] [Fe/H] = +0.1 [Fe/H] = +0.2 [Fe/H] = +0.3 α Cen A</formula><p>From the mass and mean-density, the radius and surface gravity of α Cen A were computed using expressions (4) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> respectively. We found the radius to be R = 1.22R and a surface gravity of g = 0.738g . Using a solar surface gravity of for instance log g = 4.43789 dex <ref type="bibr">[cgs]</ref> 1 , this value can be converted into classical units; log g = 4.31 dex <ref type="bibr">[cgs]</ref>. It is noteworthy that the found radius agrees very well with the one from the literature (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Step 3: Obtaining the stellar age</head><p>The third and last step that we performed when using AME on α Cen A was to determine its age. This largely followed the same procedure as outlined above to find the mean-density. First, we established the x-axis position of α Cen A in the appropriate age plot. This age plot was, as before, chosen because it covered the mass and metallicity of α Cen A. The plot can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref> with the x-axis position of α Cen A shown as the vertical, black, dashed line.</p><p>Second, we found the crossing between the vertical, dashed line and the position of a hypothetical line with the mass and metallicity of α Cen A by interpolation. This gave us the location of α Cen A on the secondary axis and thereby the value of τ · M 3.71 · 10 −0.30 · <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> . Using, as before, the information from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> and the previously determined mass, we were able to determine the age to be τ = 6.0 Gyr. This is consistent with the value found in the literature (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">The uncertainties</head><p>The 1σ internal uncertainties on the stellar parameters found with AME have been estimated by considering the centre and the corners of the relevant error box. For the mass, we considered the (∆ν,  gravity) were found in a similar manner, but taking into account the correlation between mass and mean-density (recall that the mass was used to determine the mean-density). We describe below in some detail the determination of the mass uncertainty for α Cen A and the other uncertainties follow by extension.</p><p>The values of the large separation, effective temperature, and metallicity and their associated error bars for α Cen A can be found in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>) using the values of T eff and ∆ν from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. First without the 1σ uncertainties (the central value) and subsequently using T eff − σT eff and T eff + σT eff , as well as ∆ν − σ∆ν and ∆ν + σ∆ν. This gave us 6081 ± 52 K for the first expression and 102.9 ± 1.0 µHz for the second (see the first row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>). From the central value (6081 K, 102.9 µHz) we estimate the central mass (1.10M in this case) and from the possible combinations of the extreme values we do the same (6081 − 52 K and 102.9 − 1.0 µHz, 6081 − 52 K and 102.9 + 1.0 µHz, 6081 + 52 K and 102.9 − 1.0 µHz, and 6081 + 52 K and 102.9 + 1.0 µHz). To get the uncertainty on the central mass we then take half of the full difference between the maximum and the minimum mass estimates obtained. This gives us a mass of 1.10 ± 0.02M which can be seen in the right column in the first row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Hereafter, we recalculated the values using instead the +1σ and −1σ values of [Fe/H] in turn. The results can be seen in the last two rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. The mass estimates and the associated errors from the uncertainties in T eff and ∆ν are given in the right column.</p><p>In order to calculate the final 1σ uncertainty, we took half of the full difference between the upper value mass estimate and the lower value mass estimate given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. This we added in quadrature (we assume the measurements to be independent) to the maximal uncertainty on an individual mass estimate (to err on the side of caution); in the case of α Cen A they are the same; 0.2M . Thereby we obtained a final mass and uncertainty estimate of M M = 1.10 ± 1.12 − 1.08 2 2 + 0.02 2 = 1.10 ± 0.03 .</p><p>The result of carrying out this operation for the other parameters of α Cen A can be found in Sect. 5.</p><p>It should be noted that we have confirmed that the uncertainties scale linearly as could be expected. This means that using the 3σ error bars on the input parameters (∆ν, T eff , and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>) leads to an increase of a factor of ∼ 3 on the uncertainties of the stellar mass, mean-density, radius, surface gravity, and age.</p></div>

The results from AME for these three groups of stars will be presented in separate sections below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Stars with interferometry</head><p>We have used AME on seven stars with radii determined from interferometry and parallaxes.

A comparison of the AME results with those from interferometry allows us to assess the reliability of the radii from AME, since interferometric radii are among the most model-independent radii that can be obtained. The input parameters needed for AME for the seven stars are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> along with the known interferometric radii and the radii obtained with AME. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 6</ref> shows the fractional difference between the interferometric radius and the radius found from AME as a function of metallicity and effective temperature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Stars with parallaxes</head><p>AME has been used on a sample of 20 stars from Silva Aguirre et al. (2012). These stars have radii determined from measurements of their parallaxes and calculations of their angular diameters (for details see Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Aguirre et al. 2012</ref>). We wanted to use AME on these stars in order to facilitate a comparison between the reasonably model-independent radii from parallaxes and the ones from AME. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> gives the relevant parameters from Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Aguirre et al.

Note that four stars are in common between this sample and the interferometric sample (compare <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> to <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>). In the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7b</ref> we show the fractional difference between the parallax-based radius and   the AME radius (again the ratio of the difference and the AME radius) as a function of metallicity and effective temperature.</p><p>The agreement between the AME and the parallax-based radii is better than 2σ for all targets and no clear slope is seen in the figures neither as a function of effective temperature no as a function of metallicity. However, it is evident that the AME radii are generally smaller than the parallax ones, which can be seen as a positive offset in the plots. In order to look into this, we determined the radii for all the stars using the BaSTI grid of stellar models which uses the same input parameters as AME and thus not the ν max scaling mentioned in Sect. 1. The results of comparing these radii to the parallax-based and AME radii can be found in the top and bottom panels of Fractional difference in radius SA12 -AME 5200 5400 5600 5800 6000 6200 6400 6600 6800 The symbols give the fractional difference between the stellar radius determined from the parallax (SA12), the stellar radius determined from AME, and the one determined using the BaSTI grid in turn (we made the difference fractional by dividing it with the radius from AME).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Stars with detailed modelling</head><p>AME has been used on 16 solar-like stars for which results from detailed modelling were available. This, as in the other cases, allows for a comparison of the properties obtained from AME with those available in the literature albeit in this case with parameters which are more model-dependent than the radii we compared to in the previous sections. However, it should be noted that α Cen A and B have their masses determined from their binarity and their radii from interferometry. Also, for the 16 stars with detailed modelling results, we not only compare the radii, but also the masses and ages. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> lists the stellar parameters that were obtained with AME for the detailed modelling targets (the literature values can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>). In order to compare the output from AME with more than the parameters from detailed modelling which are based on more information and have assumptions that vary from star to star, we also ran all stars through the BaSTI grid of stellar models. We did this to get a set of consistent results for all the stars based on inputs similar to AME (for Perky and Dushera the BaSTI results were taken from Silva Aguirre et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2013)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 8</ref> shows a comparison between the mass, radius, and age results obtained with AME and those found in the literature <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>) and using the BaSTI grid.

This is very satisfactory because it indicates that AME can be reliably used to determine stellar properties. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 9 and 10</ref> show the fractional differences in mass and radius between two sets of results at a time (Lit-BaSTI, Lit-AME, and AME-BaSTI) as a function of metallicity and effective temperature. In order to make the differences fractional, they have all been scaled with the AME results.</p><p>Most of the stars fall at or below the 1σ level which means that the results from the different methods generally agree quite well within their individual uncertainties. No trend or offset is apparent in either of the plots and this is encouraging because it shows that AME can reproduce the BaSTI and detailed modelling results without any bias. Also, it is noteworthy that the groups of points Lit-BaSTI and Lit-AME show similar distributions. This implies that the AME and BaSTI results agree equally well with the literature. Furthermore, the AME and BaSTI set of results also agree well with each other. It is reassuring that AME can produce results which are similar to the BaSTI results since AME and BaSTI use similar amounts of information as input for their results. In summary, we find that the masses and radii from AME and BaSTI agree very well, signifying that our method is at the same level as a grid-based approach.</p><p>A few of results given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> deserve further comments. In the case of Procyon, this star was found to be placed in an area of the mass plot where lines of different masses cross (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>). The reason for this crossing is the MS turn-off. Since a star passes through this phase relatively fast compared to its MS and sub-giant-branch lifetimes (for our models, the evolution of a 1.4M star in the turn-off phase is more than twice as fast as in the MS phase and approximately 20% faster than in the sub-giant phase), we assumed that Procyon was not in the turnoff, and consequently we disregarded those lines (the light blues lines) when we determined its mass. As a consequence of this, for stars in some parts of the plots, systematic differences could occur due to the non-negligible possibility of being in a different evolutionary phase. A similar assumption as in the case Procyon was made for HAT-P-7. Here, we chose to use tracks that were in the same evolutionary state for the determination of the mass (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>). This meant that we used the pre-turn-off tracks in light blue and blue to establish the mass and thus ignored the black lines in this case. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">[µHz] [Fe/H] = -0.3 [Fe/H] = -0.2 [Fe/H] = -0.1 [Fe/H] = 0 [Fe/H] = +0.1 [Fe/H] = +0.2 [Fe/H] = +0.3</formula><p>HAT-P-7 Procyon We also had to ignore some of the lines when we determined the masses of two of the parallax stars from <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. These two stars are KIC-5371516 and KIC-9139151. In the case of the former, it was situated right on top of the light-blue MS turn-off tracks seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref> and we as a consequence chose to determine its mass via linear extrapolation based on the purple and black tracks which were in the same evolutionary state at the location of the star. In case of the latter star, the situation was a little different, since this star was not located near the MS turn-off, but instead in the bottom part of the mass plot for low-mass stars seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> before the beginning of the 1.3M tracks. Probably as an effect of the density of the grid, the mass of this star needed to be determined by extrapolation based on the 1.1M (yellow) and 1.2M (red) tracks. Had the grid been denser such that a track had been present for a 1.  had probably not been necessary (the mass of the star was found to be 1.23M ).</p><p>As can be seen when inspecting <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 2 and 4</ref>, a few of the metallicity values lie slightly beyond the AME grid. In these cases, we used linear extrapolation similarly to what was described above. Note though that great care was taken to make sure that the results were meaningful; they have been manually inspected and we did not attempt metallicities that were far from the grid.</p><p>It can happen that a star falls close to the limit of a plot. For instance the star Perky has a metallicity of −0.09 ± 0.1 dex which means that when the uncertainties were considered, two different plots had to be used to estimate the mean-density and its associated error bar (the same was true for the age). In this case, we simply used the relevant plot according to the corner of the error box under consideration.</p><p>It may also occur that a star falls exactly on the limit between two plots, which is the case for the star KIC-3733735 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Ta- ble 5</ref>) since it has a metallicity of −0.10±0.1 dex. In this case, we used both relevant plots to determine the mean-density and used the plot with the appropriate metallicity depending on the corner of the error box to find the uncertainty. The plots used to establish the mean-density returned identical results (again, the same was true for the age). If this had not been the case, we would have used the mean value as the result and added the difference between the plots in quadrature to the uncertainty estimates.  <ref type="formula">)</ref>) for the stars with results from detailed modelling. The different coloured points show the Lit-AME, Lit-BaSTI, and AME-BaSTI differences respectively. The differences have been made fractional by dividing the difference with the mass obtained with AME. The errors have been added in quadrature.</p></div>

Five of the seven stars have results that are within 1σ while two stars have radii that differ by more than 1σ (2.0σ and 2.2σ respectively). These two stars are KIC-6106415 and KIC-6225718 and they have the smallest angular diameters of the stars measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Huber et al. (2012)</ref>. Thus, their interferometric uncertainties are more difficult to determine than those for the stars with larger angular diameters. The weighted mean of the fractional differences between the interferometric and the AME radii is 1.7% as was mentioned earlier. Hence, the radii from AME are consistent with the interferometric radii over the range of metallicities, effective temperatures, and large separations represented by the interferometric targets. The consistency between the AME and the largely model-independent interferometric radii implies that the radii from AME are likely trustworthy and accurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Stars with parallaxes</head><p>The offset seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7</ref> points towards a systematic difference between the radii given in the literature for the parallax stars (SA12 radii) and the AME radii. In spite of the offset, the radii from AME are still within 5% of the SA12 radii which is the accuracy claimed by Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Aguirre et al. (2012)</ref>. In fact the weighted mean of the fractional differences is 2.3%. The weighted mean of the fractional differences when comparing the SA12 results to the BaSTI results is 2.1% which is similar to the SA12-AME value, while the AME-BaSTI weighted mean of the fractional differences is 1.4%. Thus SA12-AME radii and SA12-BaSTI radii show similar discrepancies while the AME-BaSTI radii agree slightly better. A similar offset to that seen between SA12 and AME, and SA12 and BaSTI in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7b</ref>, both in size and shape, is found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chaplin et al. (2013a)</ref> (see the top left panel of their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref>). They find that the "boomerang" shaped discrepancy arises from the difference between determining ∆ν from individual oscillation frequencies and from the ∆ν ∝ √ ¯ ρ scaling relation. We use a similar approach to find the large separation for the models in AME as the scaling relation approach (we use the sound-speed integral given in equation 2) and the approach for the stars in Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Aguirre et al. (2012)</ref> is to use calculated oscillations frequencies to obtain the large separation. As a consequence, a similar discrepancy can be expected -and found -for our comparison of the SA12 and the AME results (note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chaplin et al. (2013a)</ref> plot the fractional difference in the "scaling relation-individual" sense where we have done the opposite and that their temperature axis is reversed with respect to ours). BaSTI finds the large separation of its models using the scaling relation, and as a consequence the same boomerang is expected -and seen -also for the SA12 -BaSTI comparison (see the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7b)</ref>. However, the shape and size of the offset in the case of SA12-AME is not completely the same as the SA12-BaSTI one. This may be due to the fact that we, as mentioned before, do not use the exact same method to find the ∆ν's.  <ref type="formula">)</ref>) for Lit-AME, Lit-BaSTI, and AME-BaSTI. All the differences have been scaled with the AME radius thus making the differences fractional. The errors have been added in quadrature.</p><p>that using the sound-speed integral to find the large separation (and scaling it as we have done) introduces a smaller offset than using the scaling relation to obtain it (as BaSTI does). For the warmest stars, we see the deviation in shape between the SA12-AME and the SA12-BaSTI results. There is an indication that the AME radii are underestimated for these warmest stars. However, first of all these stars are F-stars and therefore notoriously challenging. And second, AME uses scaling to the Sun and these stars are the least sun-like in the sample so it makes sense why the AME results show a small discrepancy from the SA12 results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Stars with detailed modelling</head><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Fig. 8</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> it is seen that the AME ages generally have fairly large error bars. The age values that have been found for the stars with detailed modelling have a median uncertainty of 25% (with percentages ranging from 12% to 173%) while the median uncertainty on the mass of these stars is 4% and the median uncertainty on the radius for the full sample of stars is 2%. However, to be able to determine the age was not an initial goal of AME, and the reason for the sometimes quite large error bars on the AME age determinations is largely the strong dependence of the age on the mass (see the y-axis of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref>). Note that the median uncertainties quoted are internal uncertainties and as a consequence systematic errors arising from i.e. the input physics chosen are not taken into account. Furthermore, the ages are the plotted AME parameter in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Fig. 8</ref> that differ most from the literature and BaSTI properties. The weighted mean of the fractional differences between the literature and AME ages is 15% whilst it is 10% between the AME and the BaSTI ages. This is of course a large difference, but still the AME ages can be used as estimates, especially when one considers the uncertainties, since the ages from AME are most often within 1σ of the BaSTI and the literature values. The star α Cen B is a noticeable example of a star whose age differ by more than 1σ from the value given in the literature. The reason for this deviation and the large uncertainty is likely a combination of its early evolutionary state (which places it where the curve on the graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref> is steep) and the fact that the mass deviates by 1σ from the one given in the literature (the mass has a high exponent on the y-axis of the age plot). The mass that AME finds is larger than the literature one and thus the age will be underestimated.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Fig. 8</ref> the masses and radii from AME agree well with the values from the other sources. Since these parameters are more precisely determined than the age, both in AME and in the literature and the BaSTI results, we have taken a closer look at these parameters by plotting them as functions of metallicity and effective temperature in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 9 and 10</ref>.</p><p>There are a few outliers in the Lit-AME group which can be seen if we consider the middle panels of these figures. In the middle panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Fig. 9</ref>, four stars have masses that differ by more than 1σ. These are Kepler-10, Procyon, Kepler-7, and µ Arae. However, the weighted mean of the fractional differences of all the masses is just 4% and only Kepler-7 has a mass value that differ by more than 2σ. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 10a and 10b</ref> show the radius differences as a function of metallicity and effective temperature respectively. The weighted mean of the fractional differences between the literature and the AME results (the middle panels) is only 1.3%, but there are still four stars with a fractional difference in excess of 1σ. These are α Cen B and the three sub-giants β Hyi, Procyon, and η Boo. We already discussed α Cen B, so we focus on the sub-giants now. A possible explanation for the trend that the results for the sub-giants deviate by more than 1σ is that the temperature sensitivity of the AME results for the sub-giants is a lot higher than for stars on the MS (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> where it is clear that the evolution tracks of models with different masses lie a lot closer at low ∆ν compared to at high values of ∆ν). It is noteworthy that the BaSTI and AME results for Procyon agree very well (better than 1σ) and that the agreement between the BaSTI and AME results for β Hyi and η Boo is also good (the fractional difference is just above 1σ in both cases).</p><p>The bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 9 and 10</ref> show the fractional differences between the AME and BaSTI results. The agreement between the results is good. The weighted mean of fractional differences is 4% in mass and 1.6% in radius. Only a couple of stars have fractional differences in excess of 1σ and all of these deviate by less than 2σ. For the mass differences, the stars that deviate by more than 1σ are Kepler-10, Kepler-68, α Cen B, and µ Arae while the ones that differ by more than 1σ in radius are Kepler-68, α Cen B, and µ Arae as in the mass case and then the two sub-giants β Hyi and η Boo. Considering the low weighted mean of the fractional differences, the results are very promising since AME and the BaSTI grid obtain their stellar properties based on a similar amount of information. Thereby, all in all AME displays good agreement with both results from the BaSTI grid and values found in the literature. This further shows that AME can be reliably used to obtain basic stellar parameters for stars exhibiting solar-like oscillations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown that AME as a tool to determine basic stellar parameters works very well. It offers a transparent and easy way to find stellar properties for stars exhibiting solar-like oscillations at a level where the large separation can be detected.</p><p>The full set of AME figures which are the backbone of the method can be found in the appendix A. They cover a range in masses from 0.7M in steps of 0.1M to 1.6M , and in metallicity the span is −0.3 dex ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +0.3 dex in increments of 0.1 dex.</p><p>We have used AME on a total of 43 stars with stellar parameters determined in different ways. We have compared the results from AME to those found in the literature and in some cases to results obtained with the BaSTI grid. The overall agreement is good and the differences can be explained. AME was found to perform as well as the BaSTI grid in terms of agreement with the values quoted in the literature for the 16 stars with results from detailed modelling. Furthermore, the radii from AME was found to be consistent with both radii from interferometry (and measured parallaxes) and radii determined from parallaxes (and computed angular diameters).</p><p>In the future, the AME grid will be extended to cover a wider range of metallicities and masses and potentially made denser. We are currently working on a web interface to enable people to use AME without having to plot their stars in the diagrams themselves. </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">[µHz] [Fe/H] = -0.3 [Fe/H] = -0.2 [Fe/H] = -0.1 [Fe/H] = 0 [Fe/H] = +0.1 [Fe/H] = +0.2 [Fe/H] = +0.3</formula><p>The Sun      [Fe/H] = -0.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: H-R diagram comparing evolution tracks made with MESA, ASTEC, and GARSTEC for stars of mass 1.0M and 1.2M with two different chemical compositions; GS98 and A09.

Appendix A: All AME figures 

In this appendix we provide the full set of AME figures. Sec-
tion A.1 contains the three mass plots, the six mean-density plots 
are given in Sect. A.2, and Sect. A.3 holds the six age plots. 
Explanations of the figures are given in the main text, and 
the figure captions provide the necessary information to use the 
figures. An overview of which colour corresponds to which mass 
is provided in Table A.1 below. 

Appendix A.1: mass plots 

The Figs. A.1, A.2, and A.3 show the plots which can be used to 
determine the stellar mass.
