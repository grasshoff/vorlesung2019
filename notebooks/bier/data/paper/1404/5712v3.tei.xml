				<p>We propose the application of coronagraphic techniques to the spectroscopic direct detection of exoplanets via the Doppler shift of planetary molecular lines. Even for an unresolved close-in planetary system, we show that the combination of a visible nuller and an extreme adaptive optics system can reduce the photon noise of a main star and increase the total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the molecular absorption of the exoplanetary atmosphere: it works as a spectroscopic coronagraph. Assuming a 30 m telescope, we demonstrate the benefit of these high-contrast instruments for nearby close-in planets that mimic 55 Cnc b (0.6λ/D of the angular separation in the K band). We find that the tip-tilt error is the most crucial factor; however, low-order speckles also contribute to the noise. Assuming relatively conservative estimates for future wavefront control techniques, the spectroscopic coronagraph can increase the contrast to ∼ 50 − 130 times and enable us to obtain ∼ 3 − 6 times larger S/N for warm Jupiters and Neptunes at 10 pc those without it. If the tip-tilt error can be reduced to 0.3 mas (rms), it gains ∼ 10 − 30 times larger S/N and enables us to detect warm super-Earths with an extremely large telescope. This paper demonstrates the concept of spectroscopic coronagraphy for future spectroscopic direct detection. Further studies of the selection of coronagraphs and tip-tilt sensors will extend the range of application of the spectroscopic direct detection beyond the photon collecting area limit.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>To date, a small number of exoplanet atmospheres have been characterized via low-resolution spectroscopy from primary and secondary transits and direct imaging. Recently a novel technique to detect exoplanetary dayside atmosphere was successfully accomplished with high-dispersion spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rodler et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">de Kok et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rodler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Birkby et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lockwood et al. 2014</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Snellen et al. (2010)</ref> for transmission with a similar technique). In this technique, high-dispersion (R ∼ 100, 000) spectra of the exoplanet + star are analyzed to detect the planet signature. Computing the cross-correlation function between the spectra and a template of molecular lines as a function of the Doppler shifts, allows separation of the planet signature from the stellar absorption lines and the telluric lines. Hence, it detects the change in the radial component of the planet's orbital motion, i.e., planetary radial velocity (PRV). The technique provides precious information on atmospheric compositions. Thus far, the 3-5 σ detections of carbon monoxide and water of nearby hot Jupiters have been reported using this technique with CRIRES/VLT and NIRSPEC/Keck. de <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kok et al.

Furthermore, such precise measurements of the PRV will also provide complementary physics, for instance, planetary rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Kawahara 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The targets of the spectroscopic direct detection are currently limited to planets with low star-planet contrast, i.e., hot Jupiters with the equilibrium temperature T eff 1000 K. An open question is how to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectroscopic direct detection in order to apply this technique to other types of planets beyond hot Jupiters. To use larger telescopes is, of course, one of the solutions. ELTs can simply provide an S/N that is ∼ 3 times larger than that of current observations. Improvement in efficiency of high-dispersion instruments will also increase the S/N. Beyond the collecting power, if the photon noise from the host star can be reduced, the high-dispersion observations of the exoplanets will be of wider application. High-contrast instruments for direct imaging are designed exactly for the reduction of stellar flux. The aim of this paper is to consider the possibility of spectroscopic corongraphy, that is, an application of the high-contrast instruments to the spectroscopic direct detection technique. It is extremely difficult for the coronagraph to be capable of separating the star and the planet near 1 λ/D, corresponding to 0.1-0.2 AU at 10 pc for the ELTs. However, even if the coronagraph does not reduce the stellar halo at the planet location, but the full contrast difference even a slight reduction benefits this technique. In this paper, we show the visible nuller, as an example of coronagraphs, with the ELTs significantly reducing the relative noise of the planetary radial velocimetry of the dayside emission if the extreme adoptive optics (ExAO) works well.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. We first summarize the visible nuller and define the quantities that describe its benefit for this use in Section 2.1. We derive the analytical expressions of these quantities as a function of the finite effect of the stellar radius and the tip-tilt contamination in Sections 2.2-2.3. In Section 3, we perform numerical simulations assuming a 30 m telescope with a future ExAO system and consider the speckle noise. We discuss the feasibility of the spectroscopic coronagraph for nearby exoplanets. In Section 4, we also consider ways to further increase the S/N for future studies, as well as the limitations of our techniques. Finally we summarize our results in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECTROSCOPIC CORONAGRAPH FOR VISIBLE NULLER</head><p>In this section, we analytically estimate the gain of the spectroscopic coronagraph. The effects of the stellar angular radius and tip-tilt errors are included in the analytical expressions of the gain in the S/N.

Although we do not claim that the nuller is the best choice for the spectroscopic coronagraph, there are several reasons to use the visible nuller to demonstrate the concept: its simple analytical formulation, small inner working angle (IWA), and compatibility with segmented mirrors for ELTs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Visible Nuller</head><p>The visible nuller, or the visible nulling coronagraph, is the nulling interferometer for a single telescope (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mennesson et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Shao et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Murakami &amp; Baba 2010)</ref>, which divides a single aperture into two or more apertures, inserts π relative phase shifts, and combines the beams. These processes cancel out an on-axis source (i.e. a host star) by a destructive interference and leaves an off-axis source (a planet) unnulled. Here, we briefly summarize several important features of the nuller. Throughout this paper, we consider the simplest two-beam nuller. The detailed description of the visible two-beam nuller is given in the Appendix.</p><p>The intensity transmittance, T (θ), on the sky plane θ, for the two-beam nuller is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The x and y-axis are position angles normalized by the angular length of a fringe,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ n ≡ λ s ≈ 32 λ 2.3µm s 15m −1 (mas),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where s is the amount of shear. The transmittance varies from 0 % on axis to 100 % for θ x = θ n /2 along the x direction. Hence, θ n can be regarded as a characteristic angle of the two-beam nuller. We assume that a planet is on the x axis of the nuller. This assumption is the most optimistic case when the azimuth angle of the planet is unknown. In general, one needs to determine the roll angle with the strongest signal by observing several angles, or one can utilize the astrometric detection of the planet to determine the adequate roll angle. We define the normalized separation of the planet by where θ p is the angular separation of the host star and the planet. We also define the ratio of θ p to the stellar angular radius, θ s , which quantifies the easiness to suppress the finite effect of the stellar radius, by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η ≡ θ p /θ n ≈ 0.31 θ p 10mas λ 2.3µm −1 s 15m ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">α ≡ θ p /θ s ≈ 20 a 0.1AU R s R ⊙ −1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where R s is the stellar radius and a is a star-planet separation. We can relate the radiative equilibrium temperature of the planet to α as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T eff = 1 − A 4β m 1 4 R s a T s (4) ≈ (0.6 − 0.8) α −1/2 T s (5)</formula><p>where T s is the stellar effective temperature, A is the Bond albedo, and β m is the efficiency of the heat transport (usually 1/2 ≤ β m ≤ 1). Hot Jupiters with T eff = 1500 K correspond to α ∼ 10 for G-type stars and warm Jupiters with T eff = 1000 K have α ∼ 25 for G-type stars. The S/N for the shot noise limit is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(S/N) = n(S) n(N ) + n(S) ≈ n(S) n(N ) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where n(S) and n(N ) are the photo-electron counts of the signal and noise. For the dayside PRV, n(S) = n p × EW/∆λ and n(N ) = n s , where n s and n p are photoelectron counts from the star and the planet within ∆λ and EW is the equivalent width of the absorptions.</p><p>We denote the change of throughput for the star and the planet after adding the nuller by ρ s and ρ p (the nuller works as the stellar flux F s → ρ s F s and the planet flux F p → ρ p F p ). Then we can write ρ s and ρ p by the products of the transmittance function T and the instrumental throughput of the nuller δ(q),</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ s = δ(q)T s (7) ρ p = δ(q)T p ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where T s and T p are the intensity transmittance function at the positions of the host star and the planet, respectively. We assume that the total throughput of the nuller is equivalent to the deficit of aperture, corresponding to the ratio between the overlapped area of the beams and the effective area of the telescope (see Eq.</p><p>[A10] ). Hence, δ(q) depends on the ratio of the telescope diameter and the shear q ≡ s/D. We ignore other factors in the nuller system that may decrease the throughput, such as the throughput of the optical system. From Equation (6), the nuller increases (or decreases) the S/N of the PRV as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(S/N) → (ρ p / √ ρ s ) × (S/N) = M × (S/N),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where we quantify the benefit to use the nullers by the gain M in the S/N as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">M ≡ ψ δ(q) (10) ψ ≡ T p / T s ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ψ depends on the transmittance pattern of the system of the nuller, the configuration of the star and the planet on the sky plane, and the stellar radius.

Let us consider the case that the tip-tilt error dominates over the stellar angular radius. Taking the limit α → ∞, we simply obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ψ lim (θ p , θ t,x ) ≡ sin 2 (πη) sin (πτ ) = T (θ p ) T (θ t,x ) .<label>(23)</label></formula><p>We find that the difference between ψ and ψ lim is within ∼ 10 % if θ t,x &gt; θ s , equivalently τ &gt; η/α. One may intuitively understand this situation through the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. This panel shows the stellar angular radius (solid circle) for the nearby warm Jupiter system, 55 Cnc b, and our fiducial tip-tilt error 1 mas on the transmittance map. The left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> displays ψ as a function of the planet position, τ , and the tip-tilt error η including the effect of the stellar finite radius with α = 25, and roughly corresponding to the ratio of a G-type stellar radius to semi-major axis of warm Jupiters or Neptunes. Recalling that the gain in the S/N, M = δ(q)ψ and δ(q) 1, several to several tens of gain in the S/N is expected in the wide range of η and τ from the analytical estimates with the effects of the tip-tilt and the stellar radius. For instance, a typical set of for nearby warm Jupiters for θ t,x = 1 mas, η = 0.3, and τ = 0.03 yields ψ ∼ 7.</p><p>We also show ψ lim in the right panel, which disregards the effect of the stellar radius (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>). As shown in these panels, it makes little difference in the gain if the tip-tilt error is larger than the stellar angular radius (above the blue line in the left panel). However, the gain under the blue line in the left panel is significantly suppressed by the stellar radius. For the extreme case of the very small tip-tilt error, the stellar radius dominates the gain, though it might be premature to consider such a case. Hence, the theoretical maximum gain of the S/N for the extreme case is M ∼ 30 for the warm Jupiter, Neptune, and super-Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SIMULATIONS WITH WAVEFRONT ERRORS</head><p>In the previous section, we analytically estimated the gain in S/N considering the tip-tilt error and the stellar finite radius. However, we still have other possible effects. One important noise is the speckle due to the phase aberration. Moreover, we only consider the instant tip-tilt error in the previous section. In reality, the tip-tilt error and the speckle vary from time to time. There are also other minor effects of the finiteness of the sheared telescope, the secondary mirror, the spiders, and the extract region. Since these effects are difficult to be expressed analytically, we perform mock observations to examine and analyze these effects with the aid of the analytical expressions described in Section 2. The assumptions of the mock observations are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We assume a 30 m telescope with a next generation of ExAO for the wavefront errors after the ExAO. We use the K band because a low star-planet contrast is expected and there are a lot of strong molecular lines of carbon monoxide and methane in this band. The carbon monoxide and methane are the most dominant molecules for the thermal chemical equilibrium in gas giants. Mixing ratios of carbon monoxide and methane depend on the temperature and C/O ratio (Madhusudhan 2012). For the gas planets 1200 K, the methane molecular lines are the most promising lines for the spectroscopic detection. We use the band center of methane ∼ 2.3µm as the representative wavelength.</p><p>The simulated wavefront after the ExAO that we use was developed for the simulation of the ExAO, assuming the Thirty Meter Telescope (T. <ref type="bibr">Matsuo et al., in preparation)</ref>. The procedure for computing the wavefront is (1) adapting the weights and altitudes of the turbulence layers from MASS and Scidar measurements at the top of Maunakea ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tokovinin et al. 2005</ref>) to the atmospheric parameters, (2) including the Fresnel propagation through atmosphere, (3) setting an accurate model of an ideal 128×128 actuator system with linear and nonhysteresis effects as the correcting device, (4) applying a Pyramid wavefront sensor with the fixed position (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Verinaud et al. 2004</ref>) to the Wavefront measurement system with a 2 kHz sampling, (5) setting the wavefront sensing wavelength to 0.8 µm, and (6) observing an I=6 magnitude star with the adaptive optical system (similar to that of 55 Cnc, I=5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Monet et al. 2003</ref>). The simulated wavefront has a ∼ 1 mas rms tip-tilt vibration and 0.92 of the Strehl ratio. The tip-tilt errors in this simulation are created only by the phase aberration. In reality, the instrumental pointing errors also contribute to the gain, in principle. For the high contrast observations, it should be smaller than the rms of the atmospheric tip-tilt error and we ignore them in this simulation.</p><p>We compute the complex amplitude of the pupil by sampling 50 points within the stellar disk. The complex amplitude from the point θ is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A P,single (x, θ) = M t (x)V (θ)e 2πix·θ+iφ(x) ,<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where φ(x) is the wavefront error at the pupil (the left  panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>), V (θ) is the amplitude of sky plane at θ and x = X/λ (X is a physical coordinate on the pupil). M t (x) is the mask function of a telescope, which includes the boundary of the telescope, the shadow of a secondary mirror and spiders. The complex amplitude of the sheared pupil from θ is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">A P (x, θ) = M o (x) 1 n n k W k A P,single (x − s k , θ)<label>(25)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">= M o (x) |A 0 (θ)| n n k W k e 2πi(x−s k )·θ+iφ(x−s k ) ,<label>(26)</label></formula><p>The mask function M o (x) of the overlapped pupils is computed from M t (x) (see the Appendix). The shape of M o (x) for s = 15 m is shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. Then, the complex amplitudes of the star and the planet at the focal plane are expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">A F,⋆ = FT x |θ|≤θs dθA P (x, θ)<label>(27)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">A F,p = FT x [A P (x, θ p )] ,<label>(28)</label></formula><p>where FT x is the Fourier transform of x. As a target of the mock observation, we choose a nearby warm Jupiter, 55 Cnc b. A summary of the 55 Cnc b system parameters is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We picked 100 snapshots every 50 ms of the focal planes for the mock 55 Cnc and 55 Cnc b. Examples of snapshots are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. One snapshot has a 1 ms exposure. We analyze the star and planet lights within the ellipses in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> as the noise and signal, respectively.  <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> displays the simulated focal planes assuming 55 Cnc b integrated over 100 snapshots. Because the high-dispersion instruments need long exposures, we estimate the throughput and the gain in the S/N from this ensemble average of the snapshots. As shown in the right panel, even assuming the low star-planet contrast, 10 −4 , one cannot identify the planet separately from the star because the planet is within, or very close to, the PSF core. In this sense, this type of observation cannot be regarded as direct imaging. Nevertheless, the contrast increases 51 times larger than the original one (C eff /C sp = T p /T s = 51). The simulation for 55 Cnc b exhibits M = 2.75, i.e. ∼ 3 times larger S/N than that with no coronagraph. Thus, we expect that observations with the ExAO+nuller system on a 30 m telescope will give an order of magnitude (×10) larger S/N than that obtained by current observations with 10 m telescopes. We note that the planet intensity itself varies by ∼ 10 % due to the change of the transmission, however, it does not degrade the gain.</p><p>The gains with and without including the finiteness of the star in the simulation are M = 2.75 and M = 2.73, respectively. The finite stellar radius effect is negligible. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Examples of the simulated instant focal plane for the star and the planet mocking the 55 Cnc b system. Top panels: images of the star (left) and the planet (right) for the large instant tip-tilt errors θt,x ∼ 1 mas (M = 1.5, where M is the gain in the S/N defined by Eq. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>). The position of the star and the planet are indicated by the white and red crosses. The dominant leakage of star light is due to the tip-tilt. The middle and bottom panels display the images for θt,x ∼ 0.5 mas, but with M = 2.5 and 5.3, respectively. In these cases, the dominant leakage is likely to be the speckle noise from higher order contribution of the phase aberration than the tip-tilt because the signal from the star is not in the stellar center. We note that the symmetric patterns are artificial because of the lack of the intensity errors of the wavefront in this simulation. Intensity both for the star and the planet shown by color is normalized by its total flux.</p><p>To understand the dominant errors, we also compute M for each snapshot and measure the tip-tilt by a linear fitting of the wavefront on the pupil. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> presents M for each snapshot as a functions of the tip-tilt error for the x direction (red) and the total tip-tilt error (black points). For large θ t,x , M roughly distributes according to the analytical curve for the tip-tilt limit (Eqs. <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>). The top panel in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of the focal plane image for large θ t,x ∼ 1 mas. For smaller θ t,x , there are relatively large dispersions of M for the <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Simulated, integrated focal images for the 55 Cnc b system, corresponding to the star, the planet, and the star+planet system from left to right. The normalization of the left and middle panels are chosen to provide the same intensity when the flux is integrated over the planes. In the right panel, we multiply 10 −4 to the planet image to mock a planet with Csp = 10 −4 . Scales of intensity both for the star and the planet shown by color are normalized by its total flux and are averaged over 100 snapshots.</p><p>same θ t,x . The middle and bottom panels in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> show the images of the focal plane for similar θ t,x ∼ 0.5 mas. As shown in both panels, the dominant components of stellar leakage are not located at the stellar center. We interpret these components as speckles from the loworder wavefront errors, but higher than the tip-tilt. With the analytical expressions (Eqs. <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>), we obtain M = 22.3 and M = 5.5, considering the finite stellar radius effect only and the tip-tilt (adopting the rms value of the x direction of the tip-tilt 0.7 mas) + the stellar radius effect, respectively. Because M = 2.8 was derived by the full simulation, we conclude that the tip-tilt is the largest component in the stellar leakage, but, the speckles from higher order terms also have non-negligible contributions. The solid curve is the analytical model for tip-tilt error (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>) with both the stellar radius. Dashed curve is the tip-tilt limit approximation (M = ψ lim δ(q)). A dotted line corresponds to the stellar angular radius, θs.</p><p>Accurate feasibility for the PRV is difficult to compute because one must consider the complex telluric contaminations and systematic noises of the correlation method as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Martins et al.

Because the depth of the lines to the continuum should be shallower than the star-planet contrast, we denote the line contrast ratio by p C sp , where p is the line depth to the planetary emission (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Birkby et al. 2013</ref>). To avoid the confusion, we put p = 1 and interpret N CCF as the effective number of the saturated lines to the planetary emission.

Hence we use Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(29)</ref> to convert M to the expected S/N or the 5σ detection limit of the line contrast, C lim . We note that the typical intensity of the sky background emission is &lt; 10 −14 (s/10 3 mas 2 ) ergs/s/cm 2 /µm 6 , corresponding to m K ∼ 18. Because the effective decrease of stellar magnitude by the nuller is ∼ 6 for our fiducial assumptions of the tip-tilt error, we can safely ignore the sky background emission for the bright nearby stars with the stellar magnitude much smaller than m K = 12.</p><p>The star-planet contrast is estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">C sp,est (a) = Φ(β) R p R s 2 e hc/λkTs − 1 e hc/λkT eff − 1 ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where we assume that the planet emits black-body radiation with the radiative equilibrium temperature (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> with A = 0.3) and that the heat received from the star is instantly redistributed all over the planet, β m = 1, or <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Instrumentation Division CRIRES User Manual 6 http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/telescopes-andsites/observing-condition-constraints/ir-background-spectra is inefficiently redistributed, β m = 0.5.

Adopting β = π/2 (position where the angular separation corresponds to the semimajor axis), we simply assume that the contrast is between the two extreme cases: (1) Φ(π/2) = 1 for β m = 1 and (2) Φ(π/2) = 1/2 for β m = 0.5.</p><p>Adopting the parameters for 55 Cnc in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we obtain C sp,est = (3 − 6) × 10 −6 assuming that the planetary radius is the Jupiter radius, R p = R J , A = 0.3 and ǫ = 0.1. Though there are a lot of molecular lines of methane and carbon monoxide in the K band, the number of available lines, N CCF , depends on telluric absorptions of the telescope sight, the size of instruments, and so on. Here we conservatively choose N CCF = 100, which is larger than, but of the same order of the value in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref>.

We assume N CCF = 100, T exp = 20 hr and ǫ = 0.1 as the efficiency. The red, orange, and blue shaded regions are the contrast computed by Equation (29) for Jupiter, Neptune, and two times the Earth radii, respectively. As shown by the green curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, the spectroscopic coronagraph for our fiducial settings reduces the detection limit in three to six times lower than that with no coronagraph (dashed green line) for 0.1-0.25 AU and can detect the PRV of the Jupiter-sized and Neptune-sized planets within ∼ 0.2 and 0.1 AU, respectively.</p><p>To consider a more ambitious situation, we extrapolate the results to better wavefront control systems. As described above, the low-order wavefront errors also contribute the contrast as well as the tip-tilt error.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>As described above, the suppression of the tip-tilt error and the improvement of the low-order wavefront sensing are crucial for our technique. Though further discussion of improvement of the ExAO is beyond the scope of this paper, we briefly mention several factors that we did not consider in our simulation. One of reasons why our ExAO simulation does not achieve &lt; 1 mas of the tip-tilt error is the chromatic aberration -the use of different bands for sensing (I band) and science (K band). The wavefront sensing with a band that is close to the science band will improve the low-order aberration. The tip-tilt sensors with science lights under development will improve the situation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Guyon et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Singh et al. 2014</ref>). They proved that the sensor can reduce the tip-tilt within ∼ 0.1λ/D in the laboratory experiment and the theoretical limitation is ∼ 0.01λ/D ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Guyon et al. 2009</ref>). For instance, the stellar light rejected by the Lyot stop for the wavefront sensing can be used for the wavefront sensing with the science band.</p><p>In this paper, we have regarded the semimajor axis as the angular separation of the planets, i.e., we have assumed that the planet is located at the phase angle near β ∼ π/2. The planets with less efficient redistribution of heat at this location have less emissivity than those at the far side of the star (β ∼ π). This effect might reduce the benefit of the spectroscopic coronagraph. However, the PRV measurement for various phase angles is particularly important for the complementary applications of the PRV, such as the detection of the planetary spin or the zonal winds (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kawahara 2012</ref>).</p><p>Though we have assumed the warm/hot planets close to a host star, the spectroscopic coronagraph is also applicable to the self-luminous planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY</head><p>In this paper, we demonstrated the concept of the spectroscopic coronagraphy for future spectroscopic direct detection. We assumed the visible nuller as the spectroscopic coronagraph. As shown in the paper, the tiptilt error and low-order wavefront control is crucial for this technique. The visible nuller with the ExAO in the next generation ELTs gain an S/N that is three to six times larger for the PRV detection of the nearby planets at 0.1 − 0.2 AU. We showed that the spectra of warm Jupiters in 0.2 AU and warm Neptunes in 0.1 AU are detectable with a 30 m telescope and future ExAO. If we can utilize the more progressive ExAO with the tiptilt rms ∼ 0.3 mas, the improvement in the S/N is more than an order of magnitude and the spectrum of warm super-Earth-sized planets will be detectable. This paper demonstrates the importance of the tip-tilt and loworder wavefront control of ExAO on ELTs, and shows that doing so will expand the range of application of the planetary radial velocimetry.</p><p>We thank Masaru Kino for fruitful discussion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANALYTICAL FORMULATION OF THE VISIBLE NULLER</head><p>In this section, we review the analytical formulation of the visible nuller and derive the transmittance. We start from a general formula including the wavefront error φ(x) at the pupil, which is used in the simulations in Section 3. Given φ(x) at the coordinate on the pupil plane, x = X/λ (X is the physical coordinate on the pupil), the complex amplitude of the (single) pupil from the source at θ is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">A P,single (x, θ) = M t (x)V (θ)e 2πix·θ+iφ(x) ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>where V (θ) is the amplitude distribution on the sky plane. Quantities at pupil and focal planes are tagged by P and F , respectively. The shape of the pupil is characterized by the mask function, M t (x) = 1 for the area of mirror and = 0 for the shadows of the secondary mirror, the segment gap, the spider, and the outside area of the pupil. The combined complex amplitude of the n-beam nuller from θ at the pupil is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">A P (x, θ) = M o (x) 1 n n k W k A P,single (x − s k , θ) = M o (x) V (θ) n n k W k e 2πi(x−s k )·θ+iφ(x−s k ) (A2)</formula><p>where s k is the baseline vector from the center normalized by λ and W k is the phase shift of the k-beam.

Because M o ∈ M t (x − s k ), we remove the term M t from Equation (A2). The complex amplitude without the phase aberration at the focal plane is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">A F (Θ, θ) = FT x [A P (x, θ)] = |A 0 (θ)| n FT x [M o ] * dxe −2πix·Θ n k W k e 2πi(x−s k )·θ = |A 0 (θ)| n ˜ M o * [γ(θ)δ D (Θ − θ)] = |A 0 (θ)| n γ(θ) ˜ M o (Θ) * δ D (Θ − θ) = |A 0 (θ)| n γ(θ) ˜ M o (Θ − θ),<label>(A5)</label></formula><p>where γ(θ) is the amplitude transmittance,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">γ(θ) ≡ n k W k e −2πis k ·θ ,<label>(A6)</label></formula><p>The visible nullers choose the adequate phase shift for W k so that the central star is canceled, i.e. γ(θ → 0) → 0.</p><p>The visible nullers choose the adequate phase shift for W k so that the central star is suppressed, i.e. so that the intensity of the source is θ → 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">I f (θ) ∝ T (θ) → 0 for θ → 0 ,<label>(A7)</label></formula><p>where T (θ) = |γ(θ)| 2 is the intensity transmittance. The two beams nuller (the second-order nuller) has the set of n = 2,s 1 = (+s/2λ, 0), s 2 = (−s/2λ, 0) (s is the separation of the shear and λ is the wavelength ) and W 1 = 1, W 2 = −1, which provides γ(θ 1 ) = e −πiθ1/θn − e πiθ1/θn 2 = −i sin π θ 1 θ n ,</p><p>where θ 1 and θ 2 are the x and y directions of θ and we denote the angular length of a fringe by</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">θ n ≡ λ s ≈ 32 λ 2.3µm s 15m −1 (mas),<label>(A9)</label></formula><p>which should be regarded as a characteristic scale of the nuller.
