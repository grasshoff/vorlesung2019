			<abstract>
				<p>In contrast to radial velocity surveys, results from microlensing surveys indicate that giant planets with masses greater than the critical mass for core accretion (∼ 0.1 M Jup) are relatively common around low-mass stars. Using the methodology developed in the first paper, we predict the sensitivity of M-dwarf radial velocity (RV) surveys to analogs of the population of planets inferred by microlens-ing. We find that RV surveys should detect a handful of super-Jovian (&gt; M Jup) planets at the longest periods being probed. These planets are indeed found by RV surveys, implying that the demographic constraints inferred from these two methods are consistent. We show that if total RV measurement uncertainties can be reduced by a factor of a few, it is possible to detect the large reservoir of giant planets (0.1 − 1 M Jup) comprising the bulk of the population inferred by microlensing. We predict that these planets will likely be found around stars that are less metal-rich than the stars which host super-Jovian planets. Finally, we combine the results from both methods to estimate planet frequencies spanning wide regions of parameter space. We find that the frequency of Jupiters and super-Jupiters (1 m p sin i/M Jup 13) with periods 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 is f J = 0.029 +0.013 −0.015 , a median factor of 4.3 (1.5 − 14 at 95% confidence) smaller than the inferred frequency of such planets around FGK stars of 0.11 ± 0.02. However, we find the frequency of all giant planets with 30 m p sin i/M ⊕ 10 4 and 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 to be f G = 0.15 +0.06 −0.07 , only a median factor of 2.2 (0.73 − 5.9 at 95% confidence) smaller than the inferred frequency of such planets orbiting FGK stars of 0.31 ± 0.07. For a more conservative definition of giant planets (50 m p sin i/M ⊕ 10 4), we find f G ′ = 0.11 ± 0.05, a median factor of 2.2 (0.73 − 6.7 at 95% confidence) smaller than that inferred for FGK stars of 0.25 ± 0.05. Finally, we find the frequency of all planets with 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 4 and 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 to be f p = 1.9 ± 0.5.</p>

These studies have provided interesting results, but, individually, are constrained to limited regions of parameter space (i.e. some given intervals of planet mass and period). Synthesizing detection results from multiple methods to derive planet occurrences that cover larger regions of parameter space would provide much more powerful constraints on demographics of exoplanets than is provided by individual techniques. Such synthesized data sets will better inform clanton@astronomy.ohio-state.edu formation and migration models of exoplanets.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, M dwarf hosts are the best characterized sample in terms of exoplanet demographics. RV surveys are most sensitive to planets on orbits smaller than a few AU (ultimately depending on the duration and cadence of a given survey). At large separations, from ∼ 10 to 100 AU, direct imaging is currently the only technique with the capability to provide information, and then, only for young stars. The only method capable of deriving constraints on the demographics of exoplanets in the intermediate regime of separations from a few to ∼ 10 AU is microlensing. However, for a range of lens distances, dD l , the contribution to the rate of microlensing events scales as ∝ n (D l ) M</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1/2 l</head><p>, where n (D l ) is the number density of lenses and M l is the lens mass. Thus, the integrated microlensing event rate is explicitly dependent on the mass function of lenses. The slope of the mass function for M l M ⊙ is such that there are roughly equal numbers of lens stars per logarithmic interval in mass. Thus, lower mass objects are more numerous and more often act as lenses in a microlensing event. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> (hereafter GA10) report the typical mass in their sample of microlensing events to be ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ . This means that constraints on exoplanet demographics at "intermediate" separations (few to ∼ 10 AU) exist primarily for M dwarfs, as that is the popula-tion best probed by microlensing.</p><p>The low giant planet frequencies around M dwarfs inferred from RV surveys have been been heralded as a victory for the core accretion theory of planet formation, which makes the generic prediction that giant planets should be rare around such stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Laughlin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ida &amp; Lin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref>. However, microlensing has found an occurrence rate of giant planets, albeit planets that are somewhat less massive than those found by RV (but nevertheless still giant planets), that is more than an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from RV. On the other hand, microlensing is sensitive to larger separations than RV, typically detecting planets beyond the ice line. If the microlensing results are correct, they imply that giant planets do form relatively frequently around low mass stars, but do not migrate, perhaps posing a challenge to core accretion theory. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the constraints on giant planet occurrence rates around M dwarfs from the microlensing survey of GA10 and the RV surveys of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Johnson et al. (2010a)</ref> (hereafter JJ10) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bonfils et al. (2013)</ref> (hereafter BX13), including the planetary mass and orbital period intervals over which the frequency measurements are valid.</p><p>There are several potential reasons for this large difference in inferred giant planet frequency. The properties and demographics of the observed sample of host stars observed with microlensing could well be different from the targeted (local) M dwarfs monitored with RV. RV studies have shown a clear trend of planet occurrence with metallicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Johnson et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Montet et al. 2014</ref>) and the slope of the Galactic metallicity gradient (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cheng et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. 2013</ref>, and references therein) suggests that the metallicity distribution of local M dwarfs is systematically lower than that of the GA10 microlensing sample. Furthermore, some of the lenses in the GA10 microlensing sample could be K or G dwarfs, or even stellar remnants, although the fraction of events with such lenses to all events is expected to be relatively low (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gould 2000)</ref>. It could also be that the population of planets orbiting local M dwarfs differs from the population orbiting M dwarfs in other parts of the galaxy, and in particular, planets orbiting stars in the Galactic bulge.</p><p>However, perhaps the simplest potential explanation for the large discrepancy in the observed giant planet frequency around M dwarfs is the different ranges of orbital period and planet mass probed by the two discovery methods. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> suggest that the slope of the planetary mass function is sufficiently steep that even a small difference in the minimum detectable planet mass can lead to a large change in the inferred frequency of planetary companions.</p><p>Thus, motivated by the order-of-magnitude difference in the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and RV surveys, we have developed in a companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014</ref>) the methodology necessary to statistically compare the constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred independently from these two very different discovery methods. We also justify the need for a careful statistical comparison between these two datasets by showing an order of magnitude estimate of the velocity semi-amplitude, K, and the period, P , of the "typical" microlensing planet, which we define as one residing in the peak region of sensitivity for the GA10 microlensing sample. This typical planet has a host star mass of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ , a planet-tostar mass ratio of q ∼ 5 × 10 −4 , and a projected separation of r ⊥ ∼ 2.5 AU, corresponding to a planet mass of m p ∼ 0.26 M Jup ∼ M Sat . We find that for sin i ≈ 0.866 (the median value for randomly distributed orbits) and a circular orbit, the typical microlensing planet will have a period of about 7 years and produce a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 5 m s −1 . We further demonstrate that for a fiducial RV survey with N = 30 epochs, measurement uncertainties of σ = 4 m s −1 , and a time baseline of T = 10 years, the typical microlensing planet would then be marginally detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5. This suggests that there is at least some degree of overlap in the planet parameter space probed by RV and microlensing surveys.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, we then predict the joint probability distribution of RV observables for the whole planet population inferred from microlensing surveys. We find that the population has a median period of P med ≈ 9.4 yr with a 68% interval of 3.35 ≤ P/yr ≤ 23.7 and a median RV semi-amplitude of K med ≈ 0.24 m s −1 with a 68% interval of 0.0944 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 1.33. The California Planet Survey (CPS) includes a sample of 111 M dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Montet et al. 2014</ref>) (hereafter MB14) which have been monitored for a median time baseline of over 10 years. The RV survey of HARPS includes 102 M dwarfs (BX13) that have been monitored for longer than 4 years. Thus, at least in terms of orbital period, these surveys should be sensitive to a significant fraction of the planet population inferred from microlensing. However, the fact that a majority of these planets produce radial velocities K 1 m s −1 means that many will remain undetectable by current generation RV surveys; this is primarily due to the steeply declining planetary mass function inferred by microlensing, dN/d log q ∝ q −0.68±0.20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sumi et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> thus, qualitatively, indicate that the constraints on giant planet occurrence around M dwarfs inferred independently from microlensing and RV surveys are consistent. However, because the planetary mass function inferred by microlensing is so steep, the level of consistency is, quantitatively, very sensitive to the actual detection limits of a given RV survey. The primary aim of this paper is then to make an actual quantitative comparison of the planet detection results from microlensing and RVs. We start with a simulated population of microlensing-detected planets, the properties and occurrence rates of which are consistent with the actual population inferred from microlensing surveys for exoplanets (GA10; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sumi et al. 2010</ref>), and map these into a population of analogous planets orbiting host stars monitored with RV. We next use the detection limits reported by BX13 for the HARPS M dwarf sample to predict the number of planets they should detect and compare this with the number of detections they report. We perform the same comparison with the CPS sample (MB14), but because they have yet to fully characterize the detection limits for each of their stars, this comparison is not as robust. For both comparisons, we also predict the number and magnitude of long-term RV <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> Planet frequency around M dwarfs from microlensing and RV surveys. The mass and period intervals for the microlensing measurement were estimated using the typical lens mass of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ and the typical mass ratio q ∼ 5 × 10 −4 . The mass limit for the CPS sample assumes a 0.5 M ⊙ host at an orbital separation of 1 AU. See § 3 for details. trends that should be found and compare with the reported values. In doing so, we show that microlensing predicts that RV surveys should see a handful of giant planets around M dwarfs at the very longest periods to which they are sensitive. These planets have indeed been found. Because the detection results of these two discovery techniques are consistent, we are able to synthesize their independent constraints on the demographics of planets around M dwarfs to determine planet frequencies across a very wide region of parameter space, covering the mass interval 1 &lt; m p sin i/M ⊕ &lt; 10 4 and period interval 1 &lt; P/days &lt; 10 5 . We quote integrated planet frequencies over the period range 1 &lt; P/days &lt; 10 4 since our statistics are more robust in this interval.</p><p>Readers who are mainly interested in our results, but not necessarily the details, need only refer to figure 8 and read the summary and discussion in § 8. The full paper is organized as follows. We begin with a discussion of what exactly we mean by the term "giant planet" in § 2. In § 3 we describe the sample properties of the microlensing and RV surveys we compare. We summarize the methodology developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> to map the observable parameters of a planet detected by microlensing to the observable parameters of an analogous planet orbiting a star monitored with RV and describe the application of this methodology to this paper in § 4. We present our results, comparing our predicted numbers of detections and trends with the reported values of RV surveys in § 5. § 6 details sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We derive combined constraints on the planet frequency around M dwarfs from RV and microlensing surveys in § 7 and conclude with a discussion of our results in § 8. Finally, we examine the properties of the planets accessible by both techniques in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DEFINITION OF A "GIANT PLANET"</head><p>At this point, it is worth discussing what we mean by a "giant planet." This has not been precisely defined in the literature (to the best of our knowledge), but because microlensing surveys infer a steep planetary mass function, the precise definition is important. Giant planets, unlike terrestrial planets, should have significant hydrogen and helium atmospheres, and thus must form within the short timescales for gas dispersal in protoplanetary disks of ∼ 1 − 10 Myr (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zuckerman et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pascucci et al. 2006</ref>). Terrestrial planets and the cores of giant planets are believed to be formed via coagulation of planetesimals, initially tens of kilometers in size, growing through phases of both runaway and oligarchic growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Safronov 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wetherill 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hayashi et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stewart &amp; Wetherill 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wetherill &amp; Stewart 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kokubo &amp; Ida 1998)</ref>. Cores with masses of just ∼ 0.1 M ⊕ can attract gaseous envelopes, which are held up against gravity by pressure gradients maintained by the release of energy from planetesimals actively accreting onto the core. Further growth in core mass enables the attraction of still more nebular gas, such that the core accretion of planetesimals can no longer supply enough energy to support the increasingly massive envelope. The gaseous envelope contracts in response, increasing the rates of attraction of planetesimals and gas. Cores that reach a critical (or crossover) mass, such that the mass of the envelope is equal to the mass of the core (M env ∼ M core ), will accrete gas at a rate that increases exponentially with time, while the timescale for core accretion remains roughly constant. Various calculations have found that the critical mass should be somewhere in the range of 5 − 20 M ⊕ , and is a function of the grain opacity and the rate of core accretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mizuno 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ikoma et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rafikov 2006</ref>).</p><p>Thus, a nascent planet with a core that reaches this critical mass before depletion of the nebular gas will ultimately be primarily composed of hydrogen and helium -a giant planet. The final masses of giant planets then depends on the amount of gas they can accrete after this point, which is limited by available reservoir of gas that will eventually run out either because the planet opens a gap in the disk (assuming no gap-crossing accretion streams) or because the disk gas disperses before gap opening due to processes such as viscous dissipation, photoevaporation, and the like (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tanigawa &amp; Ikoma 2007)</ref>. The final masses of giant planets should then be upwards of some tens of Earth masses.</p><p>We define giant planets as having &gt; 50% hydrogen and helium by mass, which, in the core accretion paradigm, would imply that their cores must have reached the critical mass before the complete dispersal of disk gases. We choose to define a "minimum" giant planet mass of 0.1 M Jup ∼ 30 M ⊕ . We believe this to be a reasonable threshold because planets with m p 0.1 M Jup are likely composed of &gt; 50% hydrogen and helium by mass, unless their protoplanetary disk was very massive (and thus the isolation mass was large) or the heavy element content was ≫ 10% 1 . For perspective, Jupiter and Saturn (∼ 0.3 M Jup ) are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, while Neptune (∼ 0.05 M Jup ) and Uranus (∼ 0.05 M Jup ) contain roughly 5-15% hydrogen and helium, 25% rocks, and 60-70% ices, by mass, assuming the 1 We note that there may exist counterexamples. For example, HD 149026b, originally discovered by <ref type="bibr">Sato et al. (2005)</ref>, is believed to have a highly metal-enriched composition, probably &gt; 50% heavy elements by mass. HD 149026b has a mass of mp = 0.37 M Jup ∼ 118 M ⊕ , a radius of Rp = 0.8 R Jup , and an orbital period of P = 2.9 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carter et al. 2009</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carter et al. (2009)</ref> estimate this planet to have a core made up of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium with a mass in the range of 45 − 70 M ⊕ , depending on the assumed stellar age and core density.</p><p>ice-to-rock ratio is protosolar <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Podolak et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hubbard et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Guillot 2005</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Microlensing Sample</head><p>The microlensing sample of GA10 is an unbiased sample composed of 13 high-magnification events, fitting specific criteria that is described in detail in their paper. Unlike RV surveys, not much is known about the host (lens) stars in the microlensing sample. Nothing is known about the metallicity of the lens stars and there are estimates of, or upper limits on, the lens mass only for a subset of the sample. They report the lens stars (those with and without planets) to have a mass distribution centered around 0.5 M ⊙ and thus adopt a typical lens mass for the sample of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ . As for the planet/hoststar mass ratio and Einstein radius, they find typical values of q ∼ 5×10 −4 and R E = 3.5 AU(M ⋆ /M ⊙ ) 1/2 , respectively. Using this sample, GA10 found the observed frequency of ice and gas giant planets (in the mass-ratio interval −4.5 &lt; log q &lt; −2) around low-mass stars to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d 2 N pl d log q d log s = (0.36 ± 0.15) dex −2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>at the mean mass ratio q 0 = 5 × 10 −4 and sensitive to a wide range of projected separations,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s −1 max R E r ⊥ s max R E , where R E = 3.5 AU (M ⋆ /M ⊙ )</formula><p>1/2 and s max ∼ q/10 −4.3 1/3 , corresponding to deprojected separations of a few times larger than the position of the snow line in these systems. In order to better compare this frequency measurement with those from RV samples, we use the typical M l and q, along with the median value of sin i ≈ 0.866 and the median relation a ∼ r ⊥ /0.866 for randomly distributed orbits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>), to estimate the frequency in terms of RV parameters,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d 2 N d log (m p sin i)d log (a) = (0.36 ± 0.15) dex −2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>over the planetary mass interval 10 m p sin i/M ⊕ 3×10 3 and the period interval 6×10 2 P/days 6×10 3 . Additionally, GA10 report no significant deviation from a flat distribution in log s for the events included in their analysis. GA10 measure a normalization, but are unable to determine the slope of the planetary mass function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sumi et al.

MB14 further refine this sample by excluding stars with known, nearby stellar binary companions. The final sample, which we will refer to as the "CPS sample" throughout this paper, consists of 111 M dwarfs with a median time baseline of 11.8 yr, a median of 29 epochs per star, and typical Doppler precisions of a couple meters per second. They also estimate ∼ 3 − 6 m s −1 of stellar jitter for the majority of their stars. In this study, we will compare the numbers of detections and trends the CPS have discovered from this M dwarf sample (of which the sample of JJ10 is a subset) to the amount we predict they should find based on the microlensing measurements of planet frequency around low mass stars.</p></div>

We then used this procedure to show that a fiducial RV survey with a precision of σ = 4 m s −1 , an average number of epochs per star of N = 30, a duration of T = 10 years, and monitoring 100 stars uniformly (in log space) covering the mass interval 0.07 M ⊙ ≤ M ⋆ ≤ 1.0 M ⊙ , should on average detect 4.9 +4.6 −2.6 planets and identify 2.4 +2.4 −1.4 longterm RV trends resulting from planets at a SNR of at least 5, motivating a more rigorous comparison to actual RV surveys.</p><p>In this section, we first provide a brief account of the methods and results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, followed by a description of how we apply this methodology to directly compare planet detection results from the microlensing survey of GA10 to those from the HARPS (BX13) and CPS (MB14) RV surveys of M dwarfs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Mapping Analogs of Planets Found by Microlensing</head><p>into RV Observables The general procedure detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> is comprised of a two steps. The first step is the mapping (q, s) → (m p , r ⊥ ) using a Galactic model. Here, q and s are the planet-to-star mass ratio and the planet-star projected separation in units of the Einstein radius (θ E ), respectively, and are the quantities measured in a microlensing planet detection. The mapping between these measurements and the true planet mass, m p = qM l , and the projected separation in physical units, r ⊥ = sD l θ E , requires a Galactic model because the precise forms of the distributions of physical parameters of microlensing systems are unknown. In particular, we do not know the true distribution of lens masses, M l , or distances, D l , nor do we know with certainty whether the lens lies in the disk or the bulge in a given microlensing event. We account for this by drawing these parameters from basic priors and weighting by the corresponding microlensing event rate, Γ, assuming a Galactic model. The second step is the mapping (m p , r ⊥ ) → (K, P ), where K and P are the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period, respectively. This is accomplished by adopting priors on, and marginalizing over, the Keplerian orbital parameters (i.e. inclination, eccentricity, mean anomaly, and argument of periastron) of the microlensing-detected systems to get a distribution of semimajor axes, which then immediately gives the P distribution by way of Kepler's third law. Combining the period distribution with m p and the distribution of inclinations, we are able to derive the distribution of K. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the resultant joint distribution of K and P for a population of planets analogous to that inferred from microlensing, marginalized over all planet and host star properties inferred from microlensing, as well as all orbital parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014</ref>).</p><p>The median values we found are P med ≈ 9.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gaudi (2014)</ref>, we demonstrated how to compute the expected number of planets an RV survey should detect, as well as the number of long-term RV trends (due to planets) that should be seen, by parameterizing RV detection limits in terms of a SNR threshold.</p><p>We showed that the phase-averaged SNR, which we designate as Q, assuming uniform and continuous sampling of the RV curve, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q = N 2 1/2 K σ × 1 − 1 π 2 P T 2 sin 2 πT P 1/2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where N is the average number of epochs per star, σ is the average RV precision and T is the time baseline of the RV survey.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Application: Comparing with Real RV Surveys</head><p>The application of this methodology to compare microlensing detections to those reported by real RV surveys is a little more involved than our description above. In that simple estimate, we assumed each star had the same number of epochs, the same measurement uncertainties at each epoch, and that each star was observed over the same time baseline. The reality is that RV surveys have varying sensitivities for each of their monitored stars which need to be included in a direct comparison. We must also take care to construct a microlensing sample that is consistent with that of real RV surveys, i.e. one with the same distribution of host star masses. In this section, we describe how we do this in order to perform independent statistical comparisons of planet detection results from microlensing with each of the RV surveys of HARPS and CPS.</p><p>When comparing with the HARPS survey, we begin with an ensemble of microlensing events for a sample of planet-hosting stars in the mass interval 0.07 ≤ M l /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0 for which we have numerically determined the joint distributions of the RV observables K and P . In order to force the microlensing sample to be consistent with that of HARPS, we consider only microlensing detections around lenses with |M l − M ⋆ | ≤ σ M⋆ for each star in the RV sample, where M l is the lens mass for a given microlensing event, M ⋆ is the mass of the RV monitored star, and σ M⋆ is the uncertainty on the measurement of M ⋆ . This yields a set of distributions of K and P , each corresponding to a particular microlensing planet detection that has been mapped into these observables. We then sum up all the joint K and P distributions for each set of events with lens star masses within ±σ M⋆ of M ⋆ . The summation and weighting of these distributions is done in exactly same manner as described in § 4.1 (and in more detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>), except that now, rather than marginalizing over the entire mass interval 0.07 ≤ M l /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0, we have instead marginalized over all lens masses within ±σ M⋆ . We are left with a single distribution, d 2 N pl /(dKdP ), for each star in the RV sample. We note that by matching the host mass distribution of our simulated sample to that of HARPS, we are implicitly assuming that the microlensing planet distribution is independent of host mass, M ⋆ . This is unavoidable because the microlensing sample is not large enough to subdivide and determine the planet frequency dependence on host mass.</p><p>In order to compute the expected number of detections and trends for each star in the HARPS RV sample, we must first model the sensitivity of their survey for each star, in terms of K and P . For each star in their sample, BX13 graphically provide detection limit curves, i.e. the minimum m p sin i to which they are sensitive as a function of P . They generate these detection limits by systematically injecting known (fictitious) planetary signals into their data and determining the subset of these signals that are detectable (see § 6 of BX13 for a more detailed explanation). We approximately reproduce these detection limits by parameterizing in terms of a minimum SNR. We use the values of σ, M ⋆ , T , and N for each star provided by BX13, including Q min as a free parameter, to match (by eye) equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(9)</ref> to the detection limit curves for each star. We describe the RV measurement uncertainties we adopt in § 5.1.2. Many of these curves are quite noisy (see <ref type="figure">figure 18</ref> of BX13), so we match to the approximate mean of the noise in these curves by eye. This parameterization of their detection limits can be interpreted as computing the minimum SNR to which the survey can detect a planet or identify a long-term RV trend. The distribution of Q min we find for the HARPS sample is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 2</ref>. The fact that Q min varies from star to star is a reflection of the non-uniformity of the HARPS M dwarf sample, i.e. each star has a different number of epochs, and spans a different time baseline, resulting in differing detection limits within the sample. The four stars with Q min ≥ 50 shown in figure 2 are from stars with just four epochs that span relatively short time baselines.</p><p>These SNR values are used in conjunction with equation (8) to compute the number of detections and trends we expect the HARPS M dwarf survey to find in the same manner as described in § 4.1 and illustrated in figure 1. These expected numbers of detections and trends are then compared with the actual numbers reported by BX13. The results and comparison is presented in § 5.1.</p><p>We follow an identical procedure for computing the expected numbers of detections and trends for the CPS survey, except for the way in which we estimate their detection limits. The CPS team has not yet determined the individual detection sensitivities for their sample, so to roughly estimate their detection limits (in terms of Q min ) we assume the sensitivities of their stars are similar to those of stars with similar systematics in the HARPS sample. We compute values of σ i /N 1/2 for all stars in both RV samples, where σ i is the RV measurement precision (not including "external" noise sources, e.g. stellar jitter) and N is the number of epochs. Each star in the CPS sample is "matched" to the star in the HARPS sample with the nearest value of σ i /N 1/2 . We assume the matched pairs of stars have similar sensitivities, and assign the stars in the CPS sample the same sensitivities (i.e. the same minimum SNR, Q min ) as that of the star in the HARPS sample to which they are matched. Since the CPS team reports stellar jitter values of 3 − 6 m s −1 for all stars in their sample, we only "match" them to stars in the HARPS sample which have consistent "external" errors of σ e ≤ 6 m s −1 . The resultant distribution of Q min we obtain for the CPS sample is displayed against that of the BX13 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 2</ref>, and has a median value of 8.3. The expected number of planet detections and longterm RV trends is calculated in the same manner as those for the HARPS survey. Our results and comparison with the CPS sample is presented in § 5.2. Ideally, we would like to do this comparison more accurately once the CPS determines their detection limits for their sample.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, we derive the planetary mass-ratio and projected separation function</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d 2 N pl d log s d log q = (0.23 ± 0.10) dex −2 × q q 0 −0.68±0.20 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where q 0 = 5 × 10 −4 .

Integrating this distribution marginalizes over all planet and host star properties inferred from microlensing. Multiplying this distribution by selection functions of RV detectability and on the host star mass, as in equation (13), and integrating yields the number of RV detectable planets for a given host star mass.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Detailed Comparison</head><p>BX13 monitor a total of 102 stars. We discard the four stars with less than four epochs. We also eliminate Gl 803 from the sample. The mass they report for this star is 0.75 M ⊙ , which is derived from the empirical mass-luminosity relationship of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Delfosse et al. (2000)</ref> in conjunction with parallax information and K-band photometry. They note in a footnote below their <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> that Gl 803 (AU Mic) is a ∼ 20 Myr star with a circumstellar disk and so the calibration for determining its mass may not be valid given its age. To keep their mass estimations consistent, they chose not to adopt the mass found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kalas et al. (2004)</ref> for this star of 0.5 M ⊙ . We argue that Gl 803 should not be included in their sample on the grounds that it is not an M dwarf given the mass estimate they choose to adopt. We note that there are no known planets around this star, although it does show variation of a couple hundred meters per second. However, with only four epochs, we cannot say anything about the source of this variation. Thus, the refined HARPS M dwarf sample we consider includes 97 M dwarfs with four or more epochs.</p><p>We obtain data on each of these 97 stars in the HARPS sample from <ref type="table">Tables 3 and 4</ref> of their paper. We use the number of epochs per star, N , the overall uncertainties (σ tot ) for each, including both "internal" (σ i ) and "external" (σ e ) errors, σ tot ≡ σ 2 i + σ 2 e , and the mass of each star, M ⋆ (see BX13 for a discussion of their uncertainties). We also obtain the time baseline for observations, T , for each star from the plots in their <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>. Since they do not report uncertainties in the host star mass estimates, we turn to the original reference for the method they use to compute the masses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Delfosse et al. (2000)</ref> required that the stars they used to calibrate their massluminosity relationships have a mass accuracy of 10%, so we adopt uncertainties in the mass of the stars in the HARPS sample to be 10%. We use these data and the detection limits in <ref type="figure">figure 18</ref> of BX13 to estimate their sensitivities and compute the expected number of planet detections and long-term RV trends as described in § 4.2.</p><p>We find the total expected number of planet detections by BX13 to be N det = 1.4 ± 0.8 and a lower limit on the number of trends they should see to be N t = 2.1 +1.2 −1.4 , where the errors on these quantities are due to the uncertainties in the slope and normalization of our planetary mass function (see § 4.2). Our estimate of the number of trends is a lower limit because we are considering only populations of planets, whereas the RV survey could also be seeing trends due to distant stellar or brown dwarf companions. We bin the number of expected detections, trends, and total planets in decades of m p sin i and P , similar to <ref type="table">Table 11 in BX13, which we report in table 2</ref>. For comparison, we also include the values reported by BX13.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, we determined that a fiducial RV survey (with N = 30, σ = 4 m s −1 , T = 10 yr) should on average detect 0.049 +0.46 −0.26 planets per star at a SNR of 5 or higher. If the sensitivities of BX13 for each star were equal to those of the fiducial survey, and if their sample covered the mass interval 0.07 ≤ M ⋆ /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0 in a log-uniform fashion (as was the case for our fiducial RV survey), we would have predicted that BX13 should have detected 4.9 +4.6 −2.6 planets since their sample size is nearly N ⋆ ∼ 100 stars. This number is a factor ∼ 3.5 larger than our final, detailed estimate. The difference arises from the fact that Q min = 5 for our fiducial survey, whereas the median value for HARPS is Q min ∼ 10, meaning our fiducial survey is overall more sensitive than HARPS. Our order of magnitude estimates turn out to be good enough to yield the right answer to within a factor of a few, but highlights the importance of understanding the detailed detection sensitivities of an entire sample to obtain accurate statistics.</p><p>Detections: Before we directly compare our predicted detections with the values reported by BX13, we first examine their reported detections. In the bin corresponding to 10 2 ≤ m sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 3 and 10 3 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 , they report the detection of two planets, Gl 832b and Gl 849b. They describe their data on these two planets in their § 5.1. In the case of Gl 832b, they report that the HARPS data indicate a long-period RV variation at high confidence level, but with their data alone, they cannot uniquely determine the Keplerian orbit and thus are unable to confirm the planetary nature of Gl 832b. Only when they combine the HARPS data with the AAT data, are they able to refine the orbit of the planet and confirm its planetary nature. Thus, we argue that the HARPS survey sample should not include the detection of Gl 832b when determining planet frequencies from their survey. In the case of Gl 849b, the HARPS data confirms it as a Jupiter-mass companion. When they combine Keck RVs for this planet, they report that a single planet is not enough to explain the RV variation, but since they are able to identify the companion as a planet with HARPS data alone, this planet should be included in the sample. Therefore, the number of detections in this bin of <ref type="table">Table 11</ref> of BX13 should to be one, rather than two, and the planet frequency here should be f = 0.019 +0.043 −0.015 . However, since the HARPS data alone confirm long-term variation, we include Gl 832b as an identified trend by their survey.</p><p>In particular, we focus on comparing our predictions for planet detections and trends with the actual numbers reported by BX13 for orbital periods longer than ∼ 100 days. Microlensing surveys have little or no sensitivity to shorter orbital periods and thus we are unable to compare with in these regions where there is no overlap between microlensing and RV. We predict that BX13 should detect a total of N det = 1.4 ± 0.8 planets. The majority of these predicted planet detections for HARPS lie in four bins (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref> In summary, we predict that the HARPS survey should find about one planet with a period right at the edge of the survey duration and indeed BX13 report the detection of such a planet (Gl 849b). Thus, consistency <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Predicted detections and trends for the HARPS M dwarf survey (BX13), binned in mp sin i − P space. In each bin, N d is the number of predicted detections, Nt is the number of predicted trends and f is the derived planet frequency. The bold numbers are our results, while the unbolded values are those reported by BX13. There are no trend values for BX13 because it is not clear in which bins their reported trends lie (with the exception of Gl 832b, which we have included as a trend rather than a detection; see text). Uncertainties in our results are due to uncertainties in both the normalization and slope of the planetary mass function we adopt from the measurements by <ref type="bibr">GA10 and Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>, respectively.  between microlensing and radial velocity surveys in the region of planet parameter space in which they overlap implies that the giant planet frequencies inferred from the two types of surveys are in fact consistent. We conclude that RV surveys are detecting only the high-mass end of the population of giant planets inferred by microlensing, leading to their underestimate of the total giant planet frequency around M dwarfs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">mp sin i Orbital Period [day] [M ⊕ ] 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">f = (7.9 +4.8 −5.4 )E − 3, − N d = 0.0, 2 N d = (1.7 +1.7 −1.6 )E − 4, 0 N d = 0.28 +0.14 −0.16 , 0 N d = 0.31 ± 0.17, 0 N d = 0.0, − 10 − 10 2 Nt = 0.0, − Nt = 0.0, − Nt = 0.023 +0.013 −0.014 , − Nt = 0.45 ± 0.24, − Nt = (1.0 +1.3 −0.99 )E − 3, − f = −, 0.03 +0.04 −0.01 f = −, &lt; 0.02 f = 0.020 ± 0.009, &lt; 0.04 f = 0.16 +0.068 −0.072 , &lt; 0.12 f = 0.032 +0.012 −0.014 , − N d = 0.0, 5 N d = (2.9 +2.9 −2.8 )E − 5, 3 N d = 0.010 ± 0.007, 0 N d = (2.6 +2.0 −2.3 )E − 3, 0 N d = 0.0, − 1 − 10 Nt = 0.0, − Nt = 0.0, − Nt = (3.7 +1.9 −3.67 )E − 4, − Nt = (1.4 +1.2 −1.39 )E − 3, − Nt = 0.0, − f = −,</formula><p>Trends: In our approximation, we expect planets to be identified as long-term RV drifts when they have periods greater than the time baseline of observations of their host star, i.e. P &gt; T , and produce detectable signals, i.e. lying on or above the detection limit curve for their host star (as exemplified in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>). In the limit P ≫ T , the RV trends will be basic, linear accelerations, the slope of which depends on the phase covered by the actual observations. However, when P is just larger than T , by our approximation such a planet will also be considered as a trend, but will exhibit more complex variation than a linear trend. We compute the RV accelerations for our predicted trend-producing planets by multiplying the maximum possible slope, 2πK/P , by a factor cos φ, where φ is the phase angle at the time of observation, randomly and uniformly drawn between [0, 2π). We ignore the eccentricity in computing the slopes and make the approximation P ≫ T .</p><p>Under these assumptions, we predict that the HARPS M dwarf survey should find at least one or two trends (N t = 2.1 +1.2 −1.4 ), with a median RV acceleration and 68% confidence interval of 7.9 +19.</p><p>−5.8 m s −1 yr −1 , most likely in the bin with 10 3 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 and 10 2 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 3 (there is expected to be 1.5 +1.3 −0.6 RV trends due to planets in this bin as shown in table 2). As discussed above, Gl 832b falls in this bin with a reported acceleration of 5.198 m s −1 . Indeed, the RV time series for this star (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 3</ref> of BX13) does exhibit more complex variability than a simple linear trend. BX13 report additional long-term RV trends in their sample. The largest, statistically significant RV acceleration (i.e. with a false alarm probability (FAP) less than 0.01) reported by BX13 is −9.616 m s −1 yr −1 from the star Gl 849 (MB14 also detect RV acceleration of this star). They report a total of 15 stars to have RV slopes with FAP&lt; 0.01, with a median magnitude of 2.65 m s −1 yr −1 . Of these 15 stars, the report only five of them to have "smooth" RV drifts, namely LP 771-95A, Gl 367, Gl 618A, Gl 680, and Gl 880, while the rest exhibit more complex variability. The median magnitude of these "smooth" RV accelerations is 3.20 m s −1 yr −1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3</ref> shows the histograms and CDFs of all trends and the smooth trends reported by BX13, along with the distribution of drifts that we predict. We perform a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test between our predicted distribution of RV trends and that of all 15 significant trends from HARPS and find a D-statistic of 0.52 with probability P (D) = 2.8 × 10 −3 , demonstrating that the two distributions are inconsistent. We also perform a two-sample K-S test between our predicted distribution and that of just the 5 significant, smooth trends found in the HARPS sample, which yields D = 0.52 with probability P (D) = 0.084.</p><p>We can explain the RV accelerations BX13 detect from Gl 832b and Gl 849c as arising from planetary companions predicted by microlensing. In the next section, we discuss how MB14 are able to constrain the mass of Gl 849c to be m p sin i = 0.70 ± 0.31 M Jup and its orbital period to be 19.3 +17.1 −5.9 years by measuring the rate of change in RV acceleration, or the "jerk." This most likely places Gl 849c into the same bin of mass and period as Gl 832b, where we predict 1.5 +1.3 −0.6 . However, the remaining 13 RV drifts are inconsistent with the hypothesis that they are caused by planetary companions analogous to the population inferred from microlensing. MB14 suggest that at least two of the trends detected by BX13, those of Gl 250B and Gl 618B, can be attributed to long-period binary companions. It is unclear if the remainder of the RV trends are due to planets beyond the sensitivity of current microlensing surveys, stellar or brown dwarf binary companions, or even magnetic activity (e.g. Gray 1988; Gomes da <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Silva et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>We can assess the plausibility that the measured trends are due to planetary mass companions that are at peri- The bottom panel shows the cumulative distribution functions of these distributions. We perform K-S tests and find that our predicted distribution of trends is inconsistent with the distribution of all RV trends (yet not necessarily the subset of smooth trends), suggesting that a majority of the trends identified in the HARPS sample, if arising from companions, are due to more distant and more massive stellar or brown dwarf companions, or planets to which microlensing is not sensitive.</p><p>ods outside those for which microlensing is sensitive. If we let a t be the magnitude of a given trend measured by BX13, then setting 2πK cos φ/P = a t , substituting for K using the standard velocity semi-amplitude equation, and solving for m p sin i yields the minimum companion mass required to produce the observed trend as a function of orbital period</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">m p sin i = P 2π 4/3 G −1/3 M 2/3 ⋆ a t cos φ (21) = 0.44 M Jup a t 1 m s −1 yr −1 P 30 yr 4/3 × M ⋆ 0.5 M ⊙ 2/3 1 cos φ .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Using equation 22, we plot the minimum required companion mass to yield the measured RV accelerations reported by BX13 for the 13 unexplained trends in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">figure 4</ref>.

We plot these values assuming the companions are at orbital periods of 30, 50, and 100 years. As we have previously shown, a planet with an orbital period of about P ∼ 30 years, which corresponds to a projected separation of roughly 2.5 times the Einstein radius of the typical lens, is just beyond the sensitivity of microlensing surveys.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison with CPS Planet Detections</head><p>MB14 provide basic parameters for each of the 111 M dwarfs in their sample (which we describe in § 3.3), including the stellar mass, number of RV measurements, time baseline of observations, and average RV precision. Since the CPS team has not yet determined individual RV detection sensitivities for each of their stars, we make a very rough estimate of their sensitivity by matching CPS stars with those from the HARPS sample with similar systematics as described in § 4.2. We then determine the expected number of planet detections and long-term RV trends the CPS team should see in the same manner as we did for the HARPS sample.</p><p>Detections: We predict a total of N det = 4.7 +2.5 −2.8 detected planets with periods longer than 10 2 days from the CPS M dwarf sample, and indeed this sample has yielded 4 such planets. We expect 2.2 +1.4 −1.5 of our predicted planet detections to have a mass between 10 2 −10 3 M ⊕ and a period between 10 3 − 10 4 days. Two of the CPS detections, Gl 179b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Howard et al. 2010a</ref>) and Gl 849 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Butler et al. 2006</ref>), lie in this bin. The other two CPS detections, Gl 317b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Johnson et al. 2007</ref>) and Gl 649b <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson et al. 2010b</ref>), lie in the mass range 10 2 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 3 and the period range 10 2 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 3 . Of our predicted planets, we expect 0.46 +0.30 −0.34 to lie in this bin. If this number is indeed true number of planets in this bin, then the Poisson probability of detecting two planets is 0.19 +0.07 −0.08 , which we consider to be marginally significant. However, as we discuss in § 7, the sensitivity of microlensing falls off towards shorter periods in this bin, while the sensitivity of RV surveys decreases towards longer periods. We therefore expect the planet frequency in this bin to be larger than the value we predict from microlensing in this paper, so it is not surprising that we under-predict the number of planet detections in this period range. Of the remaining predicted planet detections, we expect 1. Trends: We predict that the CPS M dwarf sample should see a total of N t = 1.8 +1.1 −1.2 long-term RV drifts due to giant planets on long-period orbits. Of these, we predict 1.1 +0.69 −0.75 will be due to a giant planet with 0.31 m p sin i/M Jup 3.1 and 2.7 P/yr 27. There are four other bins that we predict to harbor a significant source of RV trends in the CPS sample: between 0.31 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 3.1 and 27 ≤ P/yr ≤ 270 we predict 0.30 +0.19 −0.22 trends, between 0.031 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 0.31 and 2.7 ≤ P/yr ≤ 27 we predict 0.28 ± 0.15 trends, between 3.1 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 31 and 2.7 ≤ P/yr ≤ 27 we predict 0.081 +0.065 −0.073 trends, and between 3.1 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 31 and 27 ≤ P/yr ≤ 270 we predict 0.042 +0.038 −0.040 trends. MB14 report a total of four measured RV accelerations. Of these, that of Gl 849 exhibits significant curvature (or "jerk"), allowing for constraints on the mass and period of the long-period companion. They find a median minimum mass of m p sin i = 0.70 ± 0.31 M Jup and a median period of 19.3 +17.1 −5.9 years. Although MB14 are able to place constraints on the companion properties for this measured trend (and imaging rules out stellar mass companions), in our simulation this planet would be counted as a trend. The mass and period most likely place it in the bin we predict the most trends to lie. The weak constraints on the orbital period could scatter this trend into the next higher period bin, which happens to be another bin for which we predict a significant number of trends.</p><p>The remaining three other stars for which MB14 measure significant RV accelerations are Gl 317 (2.51 ± 0.62 m s −1 yr −1 ), Gl 179 (−1.17 ± 0.29 m s −1 yr −1 ), and Hip 57050 (1.39±0.39 m s −1 yr −1 ). Imaging with NIRC2 (instrument PI: Keith Matthews) using the AO system at the W. M. Keck Observatory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wizinowich et al. 2000</ref>) in the K ′ or K s filters rule out most stellar-mass companions and some brown dwarfs as the source of these trends. The low inferred brown dwarf frequency around M dwarfs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dieterich et al. (2012)</ref> and similarly low frequency of brown dwarf companions to FGK stars from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand (2009)</ref> lead MB14 to conclude that these trends are probably due to giant planets. However, they do mention that their imaging of Hip 57050 is only complete at separations smaller than 1 arcsecond (r ⊥ ≈ 11 AU), leaving some parameter space for a low mass M dwarf companion to be the cause of the RV acceleration.</p><p>We predict a trend that is consistent with that caused by Gl 849, but overall our numbers seem to be marginally consistent with the four observed RV accelerations by MB14, if they are indeed due to planetary companions. The Poisson probability of detecting four trends when the true mean is N t = 1.8 +1.1 −1.2 is 0.036 +0.11 −0.033 . If MB14 have misclassified one of their detected trends, and turns out to be due to a brown dwarf companion rather than a planetary companion, then the Poisson probability of detecting 3 trends if the true mean is N t = 1.8 +1.1 −1.2 increases to 0.10 +0.11 −0.08 . As we did for the BX13 trends, we can compute the minimum companion mass required to produce the trends MB14 measure for Gl 317, Gl 179, and Hip 57050 using equation <ref type="bibr">22</ref>. At a period of 30 years, the minimum required companion mass for these stars is 1.0 M Jup , 0.47 M Jup , and 0.55 M Jup , respectively. At a period of 50 years, we calculate 2.0 M Jup , 0.92 M Jup , and 1.1 M Jup , respectively. At 100 years, we find 5.0 M Jup , 2.3 M Jup , and 2.8 M Jup , respectively. The companions responsible for producing these long-term trends MB14 measure could be giant planet planets and would be beyond the sensitivity of current microlensing surveys. We note that although our inferred frequency is consistent with that of MB14, it is nevertheless a median factor of 2.2 (0.22−8.8 at 95% confidence) times smaller, potentially due to the fact that microlensing is missing such a population of very long-period super-Jupiters, which is being inferred by MB14 by these trends that microlensing does not predict. In fact, if MB14 were to ignore these three trends, we expect they would infer a frequency nearly identical to ours.</p><p>One caveat with this comparison is that we do not have the actual detection limits for each star in the CPS sample so we are forced to estimate them by matching to stars in the HARPS M dwarf sample with similar systematics. Due to the steep planetary mass function inferred from microlensing, the numbers of predicted detections and trends are very sensitive to the detection limits. The right panel in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> showing the distribution of K marginalized over all P reflects this steep mass function. In order to make more robust predictions for the CPS M dwarf sample examined by MB14, we would need more accurate sensitivity estimates. In order to illustrate this point, we assume that the overall distribution of Q min remains the same, but multiply each by a constant SNR scale factor, C, to determine the detection limits for the CPS M dwarf sample. We then calculate the total predicted numbers of planet detections and trends. We plot N d and N t as a function of C in figure 5. Increasing Q min by a factor of 2 results in roughly 1.8 fewer detections and 0.9 fewer trends, while decreasing Q min by a factor of 2 results in roughly 3 more detections and 1.6 more trends. Detections Trends <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The numbers of predicted detections and trends as a function of the SNR scale factor, C. Since we do not have detailed detection sensitivities for each star in the CPS sample, we estimate their detection limits by assuming that stars in the CPS sample with similar systematics to stars in the HARPS sample have the same sensitivities (see § 4.2). This plot shows that our predicted number of detections and trends depends sensitively on the detection limits we assume due to the steeply declining mass function inferred from microlensing surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Additional Simulations and Results</head><p>We ran additional simulations where we altered the systematics of the HARPS and CPS surveys in order to see how the numbers of predicted detections and trends would change if the time baselines for each star were increased, or if they were able to reduce both internal and external noise sources. We ran three different tests where we 1) doubled the time baseline, T , of observations for each star, 2) fixed measurement errors at σ = σ 2 i + σ 2 e 1/2 = 1 m s −1 , and 3) both doubled T and fixed σ = 1 m s −1 . The results from each of these simulations for the HARPS survey are as follows: 1) N det = 2.0 ± 1.4, N t = 1.2 ± 0.9, 2) N det = 3.7 ± 2.7, N t = 6.3 ± 4.5, and 3) N det = 6.7 ± 4.8, N t = 4.5 ± 3.2. As expected, we find that increasing the duration of observations and reducing the uncertainties increases the numbers of predicted detections and trends. For the CPS sample, we find the results: 1) N det = 4.9 ± 3.5, N t = 0.60 ± 0.43, 2) N det = 11. ± 8, N t = 4.6 ± 3.3, and 3) N det = 14. ± 10, N t = 2.1 ± 1.5. Doubling observation times does not double the expected number of detections, as the median time baseline for the CPS sample is over 10 years, whereas the median period for planets found by microlensing surveys is about 9.4 years (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>At least in terms of orbital period, the CPS survey is sensitive to a majority of the population of planets inferred from microlensing surveys. In the case of both RV surveys, decreasing measurement uncertainties greatly increases the number of expected RV planet detections at a range of orbital periods, but peaking near the edge of their survey durations. Thus, if RV surveys hope to detect the entire population of giant planets inferred by microlensing, rather than just the high-mass end, the typical measurement uncertainties need to be reduced by a factor of a few to cut further into the steep planetary mass function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Properties of Planets Accessible to Microlensing</head><p>and RV In addition to computing the number of planet analogs to which RV surveys are sensitive, we are also interested in the properties of such planets. In the appendix, we examine the distributions of microlensing and orbital parameters for the planets we predict will show up as detections and long-term RV trends in the HARPS sample to determine if there is a subset of the planet population inferred from microlensing towards which RV surveys are particularly sensitive.</p><p>Not surprisingly, we find that the planets we predict HARPS will detect is sensitive to the distribution of projected separations, s, preferring small values of s, and preferring higher values of the planet to host star mass ratio, q. We also find that predicted detections have a slight bias against lens distances at and near the halfway point between the Earth and the source, where the Einstein radius is maximized. This is a reflection of the fact that the RV signal decreases with increasing orbital separation, as well as the fact that the median time baseline for stars in the HARPS sample is shorter than the median period of the entire population of microlensing planets by a factor of ∼ 2. Additionally, there is a preference for planet detections around more massive hosts, even at fixed q. However, we find that there is no significant preference for RV planet detections of analogs to the planets found around bulge or disk lenses by microlensing (assuming planets are equally common around all stars regardless of their location in the Galaxy).

See § 4. <ref type="bibr">2 and Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> for a description of how these uncertainties are propagated.</p><p>There is another source of uncertainty, which we mention here but do not explicitly include in our final results. This stems from our assumption that the distribution function of companions d 2 N pl /(d log q d log s) is invariant in mass ratio, q, rather than planet mass, m p . Microlensing surveys are currently unable to distringuish between these two assumptions. Therefore, the planet frequency we infer for planets of a given m p depends on the primary mass. We have adopted a typical primary mass for the microlensing sample of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ . On the other hand, the median stellar mass of the HARPS M dwarf sample (BX13) is 0.3 M ⊙ and that of the CPS M dwarf sample (MB14) is 0.41 M ⊙ . Therefore, our assumption of a fixed distribution function in q means that we are assigning a lower planet frequency at fixed planet mass for the BX13 and MB14 samples than for the microlensing sample. However, the mass distribution and typical mass of the microlensing sample is uncertain, and values as low as 0.3 M ⊙ are possible. Had we adopted lower values, our inferred frequencies for the HARPS and CPS sample would be higher. To estimate the level of this effect, we integrate our planetary mass-ratio function over the mass interval 1 ≤ m p /M Jup ≤ 13 assuming a host mass of M ⋆ = 0.5 M ⊙ and divide by the mean value of this same integral calculated for the host star masses of each of the stars in the HARPS sample. We then repeat this exercise for the CPS sample. We find frequencies that are factors of 1.4 and 1.2 times higher, respectively, indicating that the actual frequencies we infer could be up to ∼ 40% higher for the HARPS sample and up to ∼ 20% for the CPS sample. Given the fact that the uncertainties on our final results due to the slope and normalization of our planetary mass-ratio function are typically around the ∼ 50% level, there are some cases where this effect could be significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Galactic Model and Microlensing Parameter</head><p>Distribution There is also some degree of unquantified uncertainties due to our choice of priors on the planet and host star properties of our simulated sample (e.g. priors on lens masses and distances, planetary orbital parameters). However, we expect any such errors to be subdominant because we are mostly able to reproduce the observed distributions of host star parameters from the actual microlensing sample by appropriately weighting by the event rate, with the single possible exception of the distribution of lens distances. We describe in great detail the comparison of the distribution of such parameters between our simulated sample and the actual microlensing sample of GA10 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Contamination from FGK Stars and Remnants</head><p>There could be unquantified sources of error in our analysis related to differences between the microlensing and RV samples. For example, microlensing is only able to measure lens masses for a subset of all events. While each of the planet-hosting lenses in the GA10 sample have mass measurements (or at least mass upper limits), it could be the case that a fraction of the lenses included in the GA10 sample are not actually M dwarfs, but are instead stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes) or even K and G stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gould (2000)</ref> estimated that ∼ 20% of detected microlensing events are due to remnants that are completely unrecognizable from their timescale distribution. Consequently, we expect the resultant uncertainty to be small in comparison to the Poisson error on the number of planet detections included in the GA10 study and thus not a significant source of error in our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Differences in the Metallicity Distribution of RV and Microlensing Hosts</head><p>In general, any Galactic gradient of properties that affect planet frequency could affect our results. The most obvious of such properties is the Galactic metallicity gradient (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cheng et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. 2013</ref>). While RV surveys of M dwarfs are limited to targets within tens of parsecs, microlensing probes stellar hosts much further away and towards the Galactic center, at distances of a few to several kiloparsecs. Microlensing also probes stars in the Galactic bulge, which may not form giant planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Thompson 2013</ref>). The metallicities of the disk stars in microlensing samples are therefore expected to be enhanced relative to those monitored by RV. RV surveys have shown a strong correlation between metallicity and planet frequency over a wide range of metallicities (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005, JJ10, MB14)</ref>, and thus the Galactic metallicity gradient has been hypothesized to be the cause of the difference in inferred giant planet frequency around M dwarfs between microlensing and RV surveys. JJ10 found the empirical relation between giant planet occurrence, stellar mass, and metallicity </p><formula xml:id="formula_31">f (M ⋆ , [Fe/H]) = (0.07 ± 0.01) (M ⋆ /M ⊙ ) 1.0±0.3 × 10 (1.2±0.2)[Fe/H]<label>(23)</label></formula><p>for planets with masses 1 &lt; m p sin i/M Jup &lt; 13 on orbits within a &lt; 20 AU, which has a significantly steeper scaling with metallicity than the JJ10 result. This implies that the dependence of the frequency of Jupiter and super-Jupiter mass planets on host metallicity is much steeper for M dwarfs than for higher mass stars. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. (2013)</ref> find a more shallow metallicity dependence for Jovian hosts of</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">f ([Fe/H]) = (0.02 ± 0.02) × 10 (1.97±1.25)[Fe/H]<label>(25)</label></formula><p>by examining the HARPS M dwarf sample. </p><p>for Jovian hosts from the combined data set. MB14 acknowledge the shallower dependence on metallicity reported by the Neves et al. (2013) study and attribute it to their inclusion of a sub-Jupiter mass planet in their sample of Jovian hosts, which happens to orbit a star with a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.19 ± 0.08. MB14 further emphasize the fact that there are no planets with m p sin i &gt; 1 M Jup orbiting M dwarfs with measured metallicities below +0.08 dex in either the HARPS or CPS samples. We would like to know what these relations between planet frequency and metallicity imply for the frequency of giant planets expected from the microlensing sample. We therefore apply these relations to a simulated microlensing host star sample with a stellar mass distribution similar to that expected for actual microlensing samples, covering the range 0.07 ≤ M l /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0 in a log-uniform fashion (see Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014 for details on creating such a sample). The remaining task is to determine the metallicities of the stars in our simulated sample.</p><p>Actual microlensing samples are mostly comprised of low-mass and distant (and thus faint, typically with V 18) stars, the light from which is often blended with that of the source and perhaps also nearby stars due to crowded fields and limited seeing from ground-based observations. Metallicity measurements are therefore out of reach with current technology and the metallicity distribution of the microlensing sample remains unknown. Instead, we estimate the metallicity distribution of our simulated sample using the recent Galactic metallicity maps from the SDSS-III APOGEE experiment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. 2013</ref>) for our disk lenses, and the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) derived from a sample of microlensed dwarfs and subgiants ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bensby et al. 2013</ref>) for our bulge lenses. As we demonstrate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, the parameter distributions (e.g. M l , t E ) of our simulated sample basically match those of the GA10 sample (except for lens distances -we will come back to this later in the section), and thus we expect the metallicity distribution for the actual microlensing sample to be roughly similar to that which we derive here.</p><p>We determine the metallicities of our simulated disk lenses as follows. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. (2013)</ref> lists the parameters of their fits to the measured metallicities as a function of height above the plane, z, and Galactocentric radius, R. We model the median metallicities of disk stars as a function of R (in several bins of |z|, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. 2013</ref>) using these linear fits. At a given R, we assume the distribution in metallicity about these median values is a Gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.2 dex, which is equal the measured spread these authors report. We then assign our disk lenses a random metallicity drawn from a Gaussian constructed in the above manner. The Galactocentric radius of a given disk lens, with distance D l from Earth and at Galactic longitude and latitude (l, b), is R = (x 2 + y 2 ) 1/2 , where x = R 0 − D l cos l cos b and y = D l sin l cos b, and where we take R 0 = 8 kpc as the Solar radius. The height above the Galactic disk of a given lens is given by z = D l sin b. We set a maximum possible metallicity of [M/H] = 0.6 dex as there are no measurements of stellar metallicities larger than this value in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>We assign each of our bulge lenses a random metallicity from the MDF shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 12a</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bensby et al. (2013)</ref>, regardless of the location of the event, (l, b), since <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bensby et al. (2013)</ref> do not find statistically significant differences in the metallicity distributions of stars closer to (|b| ≤ 3 • ) or farther from (|b| &gt; 3 • ) the Galactic plane nor in the metallicity distributions of stars closer to (|l| ≤ 2 • ) or farther from (|l| &gt; 2 • ) the Galactic center.</p><p>The resultant metallicity distribution for our simulated microlensing sample is shown in <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>. The blue and red lines represent the metallicities of the bulge and disk lenses, respectively, while the black line shows the distribution of the full sample. The median metallicity of the full sample is 0.17 dex with a 68% confidence interval of −0. As expected, we find that the distribution of metallicities for our simulated microlensing sample is systematically higher than that of RV surveys.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The top panel shows the relative number of lens star metallicities for our simulated microlensing sample. The blue and red lines represent the metallicities of the bulge and disk lenses, respectively, while the black line represents the full sample. The metallicities of our bulge lenses were estimated using the MDF measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bensby et al. (2013)</ref> from microlensed bulge dwarfs and we estimate the metallicities of our disk lenses using the Galactic metallicity gradients measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. (2013)</ref> from the SDSS-III APOGEE experiment. The bottom panel shows the cumulative fraction of metallicities for the bulge and disk lenses, as well as for the full sample. We find a median metallicity for our simulated sample of 0.17 dex with a 68% confidence interval of −0.23 &lt; [M/H]/dex &lt; 0.41. Now that we have metallicities for the microlensing sample, we compute the frequency of Jupiters and superJupiters on orbits within a &lt; 20 AU implied from the CPS results (MB14) given by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(24)</ref> using the median values of the fit parameters (i.e. the median normalization and scalings with host mass and metallicity reported by MB14). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the resultant distributions and cumulative distribution functions of the implied frequency of planets with 1 &lt; m p sin i/M Jup &lt; 13 for our simulated microlensing sample and the CPS sample.</p><p>We find a mean occurrence rate of Jupiters and superJupiters of 0.36 is expected for our simulated microlensing sample from the MB14 relation. This expected frequency is discrepant by a median factor of 13 (4.4 − 44 at 95% confidence) from the actual value. In § 7 we derive planet frequencies from the combined constraints of real microlensing surveys and the HARPS RV survey, and from these combined constraints, we find a frequency of planets with masses 1 &lt; m p sin i/M Jup &lt; 13 and periods 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 5 of 0.032 +0.014 −0.017 , consistent with the value reported by MB14 for the CPS M dwarfs of 0.065 ± 0.030 but still a median factor 2.3 (0.22 − 8.8 at 95% confidence) times smaller (see previous section for discussion). We will discuss a few possible reasons for the inconsistency in the frequencies implied by the MB14 relation for our simulated microlensing sample and the actual value we find from the combined constraints of microlensing and RV surveys.</p><p>First, we pose a question. What if giant planets do not form around bulge stars (e.g. Thompson 2013)? To investigate this possibility, we repeat the calculation described above for our simulated microlensing sample, except we set the frequency of giant planets for bulge hosts to zero. We find a mean occurrence rate of 0.25 implied by equation 24, which is discrepant from the actual value by a median factor of 9.1 (3.0 − 30 at 95% confidence). Thus, while this hypothesis shifts the implied frequency for the microlensing sample in the right direction, it does not seem to be enough to cause agreement. On the other hand, this idea is attractive for another reason. It could also explain the difference in the lens distance, D l , distributions between our simulated sample (which assumes planets are equally common around stars regardless of their location) and that of the actual GA10 microlensing sample. GA10 find a median lens distance of 3.4 kpc, while our simulated microlensing sample yields a median value of 6.7 kpc. If there are no planets in the bulge, then the median distance to planet hosting lenses in the disk is 5.8 kpc. Thus, the idea that planets do not form around bulge stars could help to explain the shorter lens distances inferred from the GA10 sample relative to that inferred from our simulated sample, while leaving the distributions of the other microlensing parameters for these samples in agreement (see § 5.3.3 of Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014) for more information on the properties of our simulated sample and how they compare with those of the GA10 sample).</p><p>Next, we examine the possibility that the MB14 relation is not correct. We also compute the implied occurrence rates from the relations between planet frequency and mass and metallicity derived in JJ10 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. (2013)</ref>. The mean occurrence rates implied by equation 23 (JJ10) for our simulated microlensing sample is 0.058, a median factor of just 2.1 (0.70 − 7.0 at 95% confidence) larger. The mean occurrence rate implied by equation 25 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. 2013</ref>) is 0.065, while the value from equation 26 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. 2013</ref>) is 0.23. These implied frequencies are median factors of 2.4 (0.79 − 7.9 at 95% confidence) and 8.3 (2.8 − 28 at 95% confidence), respectively, larger than the actual value. The more shallow scalings of these other relations do bring the RVexpected planet frequencies closer to agreement. Perhaps surprisingly, the JJ10 relation provides the best agreement between the CPS sample and our simulated microlensing sample, even though their stellar sample included higher mass (FGK) stars whereas the MB14 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. (2013)</ref> samples include only M dwarfs.</p><p>Given the fact that the median metallicity of our simulated microlensing sample is about 0.17 dex (assuming the distribution we derive is correct), while that of the CPS M dwarfs is -0.1 dex, then it seems that the frequency of giant planets must have a weaker dependence on [Fe/H] then implied by MB14. Another possibility is that the metallicity dependence saturates at some value, with (e.g.) a flat distribution for metallicities above the saturation value. It could even be a combination of the various effects we discuss, i.e. a suppression of the formation of giant planets in the bulge, a slightly weaker scaling with metallicity, and a saturation of the giant planet frequency above some threshold <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we also note that it is unlikely the MB14 relation between the frequency of planets with masses 1 m p sin i/M Jup 13 on orbits with a &lt; 20 AU extends down to giant planets with masses between 0.1 m p sin i/M Jup 1 given the fact that RV surveys generally do not detect the bulk of this planet population due to the steep planetary mass function inferred from microlensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>. We show in the next section that the frequency of giant planets with masses between 0.1 m p sin i/M Jup 30 and periods between 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 5 is f G = 0.17 +0.07 −0.08 , which would seem to suggest that the scaling of giant planet frequency with host metallicity is also a function of planetary mass. This is supported by the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. (2013)</ref>, which demonstrate that the scaling of planet frequency with host metallicity for Neptunian hosts (as opposed to Jovian hosts) is not only more shallow, but that it possibly even works in the opposite direction (i.e. that planet frequency of Neptunes is anti-correlated with <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>), although the latter is not statistically significant when compared against a constant functional form. These authors therefore determine that a constant functional form of f = 0.03±0.01 is preferred for Neptunian hosts, which is quite different from the relations they find for Jovian hosts given by equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(25)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>.</p><p>In the end, the scaling of the frequency of giant planets (in particular of Jupiters and super-Jupiters) with stellar metallicity among M dwarfs remains a puzzle. However, we predict that if future RV surveys can begin detecting the bulk of the giant planet population inferred from microlensing, which typically have K ∼ 1 m s −1 and P ∼ 9 yr, these planets will be detected around more metal-poor stars. The frequency of Jupiters and superJupiters around metal-rich stars is already found to be very high from RV surveys, which implies that the large population of giant planets with 0.1 m p sin i/M Jup 1 inferred from microlensing (and not currently detected by RV surveys) would either be detected around stars with lower metallicities or in multi-planet systems around the metal-rich M dwarfs.</p></div>

The blue and black lines represent the planet frequencies for the CPS M dwarf sample and our simulated microlensing sample (which has the same stellar, i.e. lens, mass distribution), respectively. The bottom panel shows the cumulative fraction of systems with a given planet frequency for both samples. We find a mean giant planet occurrence rate of 0.36 for our simulated microlensing sample implied by the MB14 relation, which is a median factor of 13 (4.4 − 44 at 95% confidence) larger than the value we derive from microlensing and RV constraints from HARPS in § 7.</p><p>CPS M dwarf surveys in the regions of planet parameter space for which there is some overlap. This enables us to synthesize the detection results, i.e. combine the individual constraints, from microlensing and RV surveys to determine planet frequencies across a very wide region of parameter space. We choose to combine the constraints from the microlensing results (GA10; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sumi et al. 2010</ref>) with those from the RV survey of HARPS (BX13) since their detection limits have been carefully characterized. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and figure 8 display these combined constraints in bins of log P and m p sin i. Our methods for combining these results are as follows.</p><p>• 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 2 : Since microlensing has basically no sensitivity to planets with periods 10 2 days, we use the constraints on the planet frequencies for these periods from the HARPS survey alone.</p><p>• 10 2 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 3 : We include constraints from both microlensing and RV within this period range. However, in these bins, BX13 measure only upper limits on the planet frequency. The frequencies we derive in this paper from microlensing are consistent with these upper limits, however they serve as lower limits on the planet frequency in these bins since microlensing surveys are incomplete for these periods. Therefore, the true frequency is likely somewhere between the RV and microlensing estimates in these bins.</p><p>• 10 2 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 3 : Although there is some overlap for these periods, this parameter space is dominated by microlensing, and so we adopt the microlensing estimates.</p><p>• 10 4 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 5 : The HARPS survey has no sensitivity to these orbital periods (other than trends), while the sensitivity of microlensing surveys cuts off near the short end of this range for higher planet masses. Thus, we adopt the microlensing estimates in these bins but note that, due to the rapidly declining sensitivity of microlensing surveys in this period range (and especially for the lower-mass bins at these periods), the frequencies in these bins are really lower limits.</p><p>The microlensing results constrain the frequency of planets with projected separations near the Einstein ring for masses down to about ∼ 5 M ⊕ , so the planet frequencies we derive in the mass range 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 from microlensing requires an extrapolation of our mass function (see equation 11). However, the required extrapolation is only about 0.7 dex in log q for a primary mass of</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ .</formula><p>The planet frequency as a function of log (m p sin i/M ⊕ ) and log (P/days) that we derive with the above rules are displayed in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref>. The cells are color coded according to the synthesized planet frequency in the corresponding area. In cells where we have a lower limit from microlensing, the color represents this lower limit, whereas the cells that have only upper limits are given colors equal to the quoted 1σ upper limits.</p><p>We also derive the integrated frequencies of various populations of planets. In order to compute the contribution due to microlensing constraints, we bin the output of our simulations over the appropriate area of planet mass and period, and add the result with the contribution from the RV constraints of the HARPS survey in accordance with the rules we list above. However, because BX13 report the planet frequencies in decade bins of mass and period, we cannot robustly determine true planet frequencies from their survey for planet populations with mass cutoffs that are not equal to 1, 10, 100, or 1000 M ⊕ . To determine their frequencies, BX13 compute an effective number of stars whose detection limits confidently exclude the existence of planets with similar masses and periods. This effective number of stars is only determined in specific bins and we do not know how these are distributed within a given bin. Thus, we must make approximations and we compute the frequencies in the following manner. We assume the mean number of planets of a given population (e.g. giant planets) is equal to the actual number BX13 detect, drawing a value from a Poisson distribution with such a mean. We then divide by our own effective number of stars which we calculate by normalizing the frequency of the population to a specific value at the actual number of detections. This specific value is an approximation of the planet frequency which we compute by assuming the planet frequency is evenly distributed throughout the BX13 decade bins. We numerically determine uncertainties for the HARPS constraints simply from the Poisson error on the number of detections, combining them (numerically) with the uncertainties from the microlensing contribution.</p><p>We Upper Limit</p></div>

This roughly yields the frequency of planets with masses between 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 in the same period range. We find this frequency to be 0.23 ± 0.03, which is nearly consistent with the frequency inferred from the HARPS survey by BX13 of 0.36 +0.50 −0.10 .

As we discussed in § 2, the lowest mass of a "giant planet" is uncertain, and likely encompasses a range of masses. Even more uncertain, then, is the transition radius between rocky, icy, and giant planets. However, if we make the simple assumption that all the planets with radii R p &gt; 4 R ⊕ in the Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013) M dwarf sample from Kepler are giant planets, then we calculate the frequency of giant planets with masses m p sin i 30 M ⊕ and periods 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 to be 0.014 ± 0.007. This is nearly consistent with the frequency of planets in the same mass and period ranges measured BX13 of 0.043 ± 0.021.

They extrapolate to find the frequency of such planets with orbital semimajor axes a &lt; 20 AU, assuming either a flat distribution in P beyond 2000 days or a power-law distribution (∝ P 0.26 ), to be 0.17 ± 0.03 and 0.19 ± 0.03, respectively. Around a Solar-type star, 20 AU is roughly 7.4 times the location of the ice line, assuming a ice = 2.7 AU(M/M ⊙ ) 2/3 , where we have adopted the scaling found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon (2008)</ref> for mass accretion rates that are proportional to stellar mass, ˙ M ∝ M ⋆ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, we map the observable parameters (q, s) of the population of planets inferred from microlensing into the observables (K, P ) of an analogous population of planets orbiting a stellar sample monitored with RV. We derive joint distributions of these RV observables for simulated samples of microlensing systems with similar stellar mass distributions as the M dwarf RV surveys of HARPS (BX13) and CPS (MB14). We then apply the actual RV detection limits reported by BX13 to predict the number of planet detections and long-term RV trends we expect the HARPS survey to find, and we apply roughly estimated detection limits to make predictions for the CPS sample. Comparing our predictions with the actual numbers reported by these RV surveys, we find consistency. We predict that HARPS should find N det = 1.4 ± 0.8 planets right at the edge of their survey limit, and indeed, they find one such planet around Gl 849 (BX13). This star also appears in the CPS sample, where this very same planet was originally discovered ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Butler et al. 2006</ref>). We expect the CPS survey to detect N det = 4.7 +2.5 −2.8 planets with periods P 100 days and masses m p sin i 10 2 M ⊕ . The number of such planets they actually detect is four, around the stars Gl 179, <ref type="bibr">Gl 317, Gl 649, and Gl 849 (Howard et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Johnson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. , 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Butler et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>The fact that our predicted numbers of detections and the actual numbers are consistent implies that microlensing and RV surveys are largely disjoint, with only a small amount of overlap for orbital periods between roughly 100 − 10 3 days and planetary masses larger than about a Jupiter mass. This limited overlap is such that, due to the steeply declining planetary mass function, RV sur-veys infer low giant planet frequencies around M dwarfs, detecting only the high-mass end of the giant planet population (m p M Jup ) inferred by microlensing. For RV surveys to be sensitive to the majority of this population, measurement precisions of ∼ 1 m s −1 (including instrumental errors and stellar jitter) over time baselines of ∼ 10 years are required. The frequency of Jupiters and super-Jupiters around metal-rich stars is already found to be very high from current RV surveys, which implies that the large population of giant planets with 0.1 m p sin i/M Jup 1 inferred from microlensing (and not currently detected by RV surveys) would either be detected by future, more sensitive RV surveys around stars with lower metallicities or in multi-planet systems around the metal-rich M dwarfs.</p><p>However, we are left with a puzzle concerning the scaling of the frequency of Jovian planets (1 m p sin i/M Jup 13) with stellar metallicity inferred from the CPS M dwarf sample ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Montet et al. 2014</ref>). We estimate the metallicity distribution of our simulated microlensing sample using the bulge MDF of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bensby et al. (2013)</ref> and the Galactic metallicity gradients from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayden et al. (2013)</ref> and find a median metallicity of [M/H] = 0.17 dex with a 68% confidence interval of −0.23 &lt; [M/H]/dec &lt; 0.41. Using this metallicity distribution, we find that the occurrence rate implied by the scaling inferred by MB14 is over-predicted by a median factor of 13 (4.4 − 44 at 95% confidence) relative to the actual frequency found by microlensing surveys. This could suggest that the MB14 relation is incorrect or perhaps incomplete. A significantly shallower scaling with metallicity seems to be required for agreement (more in line with that reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Johnson et al. 2010a</ref> or perhaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. 2013</ref>), or perhaps the metallicity dependence saturates at some value, with (e.g.) a flat distribution for metallicities above the saturation value. We also investigate another possibility. What if giant planets do not form around bulge stars (e.g. Thompson 2013)? We show that if this were true, the occurrence rate for the microlensing sample implied by the MB14 relation moves closer to agreement with the measured value (a median factor of 9.1, or 3.0 − 30 at 95% confidence, discrepant), but probably does not account for the full difference. This solution would also be attractive because it could partially explain the difference in the lens distance distributions between our simulated microlensing sample and the GA10 sample.</p><p>We also point out that it seems unlikely the relations between planet frequency and metallicity hold for giant planets with masses 0.1 m p sin i/M Jup 1 given the fact that RV surveys are not sensitive to the bulk of the giant planet population inferred from microlensing surveys. This suggests that the scaling of giant planet frequency with host metallicity is a function of planetary mass. This hypothesis is supported by the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neves et al. (2013)</ref>, which suggest that the scaling of planet frequency with host metallicity is significantly different between Jovian and Neptunian hosts.</p><p>Finally, since we have demonstrated that the giant planet frequencies measured by microlensing and RV surveys are actually consistent, we are able to combine their constraints to determine planet frequencies across a very wide region of parameter space. The combined constraints on the giant planet occurrence rate around M dwarfs as a function of orbital period and planet mass are summarized in table 3 and plotted in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref>. We also show that the planet frequencies in the mass range 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 and period range 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 2 are consistent with the detection results from the Kepler M dwarf sample reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Swift et al. (2013)</ref>. We can integrate over various regions of this plane to compute total planet frequencies.</p><p>We find the frequency of giant planets with 30 m p sin i/M ⊕ 10 4 and 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 to be f G = 0.15 +0.06 −0.07 . For a more conservative definition of giant planets (50 m p sin i/M ⊕ 10 4 ), we find f G ′ = 0.11 ± 0.05. The frequency of Jupiters and super-Jupiters (1 m p sin i/M Jup 13) with periods 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 is f J = 0.029 +0.013 −0.015 , consistent with the measurement by MB14 of f J = 0.065±0.030. We find the frequency of all planets with 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 4 and 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 to be f p = 1.9 ± 0.5. These planet frequencies are closer to lower limits on the planet frequency, because our combined constraints on the planet frequency include the lower limits in the period range 10 2 − 10 3 days, where the sensitivity of microlensing surveys declines. This is a very broad result, covering four orders of magnitude in planetary mass and four orders of magnitude in orbital period. But perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that it is possible to get a more complete picture of the demographics of exoplanets by including constraints from multiple discovery methods. In a future paper, we plan to compare and synthesize the planet detection results found here with those from direct imaging surveys.</p><p>This research has made use of NASA's Astrophysics Data System and was partially supported by NSF CA-REER Grant AST-1056524.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROPERTIES OF PREDICTED RV DETECTIONS</head><p>The expected numbers of planet detections and trends we find for the HARPS and CPS RV surveys are consistent with their reported values. Here, we aim to determine if there is a subset of the planet population inferred from microlensing that we predict RV surveys will preferentially discover. We have already demonstrated that RV surveys are only able to detect the high-mass end of the giant planet population inferred from microlensing, but it would be interesting if, for example, RV surveys were more sensitive to analogs of the microlensing planets found around disk lenses relative to analogs of those found around bulge lenses. Both RV and microlensing techniques have their own selection effects which are imprinted on the distributions of the physical and orbital properties of the planets detectable by both methods and could, in principle, constrain the subset of microlensing planets accessible by RVs (see <ref type="table">Section 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref> for a detailed description of key differences between these two techniques). Understanding the conflation of the selection effects from both of these exoplanet discovery methods will improve our understanding of the overlap between microlensing and RV surveys.</p><p>Our simulations provide some diagnostic power to examine the properties of the predicted microlensing planets that RV surveys identify as planets and trends. Since we have a much better grasp on the detection sensitivities of the HARPS sample than we do for the CPS sample, we use the results of our comparison with HARPS sample in this section. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows distributions of R E , D l , t E , |µ|, q and s for our simulated planetary microlensing events which we predict BX13 to identify as either a detection or a trend. In order to explain these plots, we need to know how K and P scale with the Einstein radius, R E , the distance to the lens, D l , the distance to the source, D s , the planet/star projected separation, s, and the planet/star mass ratio, q. The radial velocity of the host star scales as</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">K ∝ a P q ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>where q is the mass ratio. Combining this with Kepler's 3rd law, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">K ∝ a −1/2 M 1/2 l q .<label>(A2)</label></formula><p>Given an inclination and mean anomaly, the semi-major axis scales as a ∝ sR E . Using this semi-major axis scaling and</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">R E ∝ M 1/2 l [x (1 − x)] 1/2</formula><p>, where x ≡ D l /D s , we can substitute the relevant quantities into equation (A2) to find the scaling of the velocity of the host/lens star with R E , s, x, and q:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">K ∝ R 1/2 E s −1/2 [x (1 − x)] −1/2 q .<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>By a similar process, we can start with Kepler's third law and find the scaling of the period with R E , s, and x to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">P ∝ R 1/2 E [x (1 − x)] 1/2 s 3/2 .<label>(A4)</label></formula><p>The top left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows that the predicted trends tend to have larger Einstein radii than the predicted detections. At fixed s, q, D l , and D s , equation (A4) becomes P ∝ R 1/2 E , meaning that longer periods correspond to larger Einstein radii. Since one of our criteria for a planet detection includes have a period that is less than the duration of observations, so that a Keplerian fit could be performed with full phase coverage, the planets identified as trends will have periods longer than those identified as detections. Also, at fixed s, q, D l , and D s , equation (A3) reduces to K ∝ R 1/2 E ∝ M 1/4 l . In general, RV signals increase with planet mass and decrease with period. Planets identified as trends have larger periods than those identified as detections, so in order to produce a detectable signal (i.e. K), trends must necessarily be associated with larger planet masses which requires larger M l at fixed q. This is consistent with what is seen in the top right and middle left panels of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. We see that the trends have a preference for longer timescales. At fixed relative proper motions, µ, and lens distances, D l , larger Einstein radii mean longer timescale events because t E ∝ R E . Since disk lenses tend to produce longer timescale events than bulge lenses, <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> suggests that trends should be found preferably around disk lenses. Both the detections and trends show non-trivial dependence on the lens distance. For x ≪ 1, we have from equations (A3) and (A4), the scalings K ∝ D The bottom two panels of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> illustrate that predicted trends tend to have larger mass ratios relative to the predicted detections, which follows the fact that larger planet masses produce enhanced RV signals relative to smaller planet masses at fixed a and M l . Predicted trends also tend have larger values of projected separation, producing longer periods, hence why these events are predicted to preferentially show up as trends rather than detections. At fixed R E and x, equation (A4) shows the strong dependence on projected separation, P ∝ s 3/2 , for the longer period planets that are identified as trends.</p><p>We also investigated how the distributions of microlensing and orbital parameters of the predicted detections and trends depend on their host star locations. This is an important question to answer because it might provide insight into the differences in detections between RV and microlensing surveys and distinguish potential differences in the actual sample of host stars probed by these two methods. We have shown that RV surveys have decreased sensitivity to intermediate host star distances relative to close and far, i.e. close to the source star in the associated microlensing event, host star distances. So, for example, if RV surveys are mostly sensitive to analogs of the microlensing planets in the bulge, it could mean we predict that they would find more planets than what they actually find, if for some reason, planets do not actually form in the bulge (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Thompson 2013</ref>). Additionally, any distance-dependent gradient of properties that affect planet frequency, e.g. the Galactic metallicity gradient (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cheng et al. 2012</ref>), could affect our predictions due to the relative RV sensitivity dependence on host star distance. We find that there is not a significant preference for planets around disk or bulge hosts.</p><p>Next, we plot the distributions of select orbital parameters (a, cos i, e, M 0 ) of the planets for which we predict RV surveys to identify as either a detection or a trend in <ref type="figure">figure 10</ref>. The top left panel shows that the semimajor axis distribution of the predicted detections peaks at a smaller value than that for the predicted trends, and lacks the tail  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.

In each of the plots, the solid grey distribution represents both the bulge and disk events for all the events falling within ±σ M⋆ of the mass of each star in the HARPS sample.

The sharp cutoff in the distribution of semimajor axes for the detections is set by the maximum time baseline (T max ≈ 5.75 yr) in the HARPS sample since we adopt the criterion that P ≤ T for a planet detection. In the top right panel, the distributions of cos i for the predicted planet detections and trends show a strong decline as cos i → 1, corresponding to face-on orbits where RV has no sensitivity since K ∝ sin i.</p><p>The bottom left panel of <ref type="figure">figure 10</ref> displays the eccentricity distributions. The planets on circular orbits, which make up 38% of the population, are not included in this plot to show detail in the rest of the distributions. We find that the eccentricity distribution of both the detections and trends are similar in form to the prior we adopt (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>), except for a slight over-representation at high eccentricities, e &gt; 0.8. These planets would, in practice, be much less detectable with the RV technique relative to those on circular orbits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>, however these high eccentricity planets only account for a small percentage of the total population. The bottom right panel shows that the distribution of the mean anomalies for the predicted planet detections is slightly peaked at apastron, M 0 = π. This is due to the fact that planets on eccentric orbits spend more time at apastron where microlensing is more likely to catch them during an event. Additionally, planets detected by microlensing at apastron are near the minimum allowed period given their projected separation, and so tend to have shorter periods (see equation 21 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>). This does not seem to be the case for the predicted long-term RV trends.  <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. Distributions of select orbital parameters associated with the predicted planetary detections and trends, distinguishing between detections and trends. In each of the plots, the solid grey distribution represents both the bulge and disk contributions for all the events falling within ±σ M⋆ of the mass of each star in the HARPS sample. The blue solid line represents the predicted detections and the red dotted line represents the predicted trends produced by planets orbiting host stars in both the disk and the bulge. There is a pile-up of planets with eccentricities of zero, accounting for 38% of the population, but these are not drawn in the plot so that the form of the rest of the distribution is visible. The distribution of eccentricities matches that of our prior, except for a slight over-representation of high eccentricity (e &gt; 0.8) planets counted as detections and trends. In practice, planets with eccentricities e 0.6 will not be detectable by <ref type="bibr">RVs (Cumming et al. 2008</ref>), however, these high eccentricity planets only account for a small percentage of the total population.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>4 yr and K med ≈ 0.24 m s −1 .

At intermediate lens distances (near ∼ 5 kpc), there is a relative decrease in RV signals.</figDesc></figure>

(2013)</ref>, as well as a measurement of the giant planet (0.3 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 15) frequency around F, G, and K dwarfs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1.">Kepler M Dwarfs</head><p>Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013) refine the stellar parameters of a sample of M dwarfs from Kepler and compute planet frequencies as a function of orbital period and planetary radius. We perform a rough comparison with their results in the bins corresponding to planet masses between 1 ≤ m p sin i/M ⊕ ≤ 10 and orbital periods between 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 2 . The empirical mass-radius relations derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref> tell us that a planetary radius of ≈ 4 R ⊕ corresponds to a mass of ≈ 10 M ⊕ . Assuming planetary densities identical to that of the Earth, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref> relations say 1 R ⊕ corresponds to 1 M ⊕ . Thus, in terms of radius, we compare the frequencies derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013)</ref> between 1 ≤ R p /R ⊕ ≤ 4 for periods between 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 2 (ignoring the sin i factor). We choose to compare results in these specific bins of mass (radius) and orbital period because these are the regions of this parameter space for which we expect the most overlap between Kepler and the HARPS RV survey, from which</p></div>			</div>
