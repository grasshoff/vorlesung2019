			<abstract>
				<p>Motivated by the order-of-magnitude difference in the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and radial velocity (RV) surveys, we present a method for comparing the statistical constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred from these methods. We first derive the mapping from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict the distribution of RV observ-ables for the planet population inferred from microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a fiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We find that RV and microlensing surveys have some overlap, specifically for super-Jupiter mass planets (m p 1 M Jup) with periods between ∼ 3 − 10 years. However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller frequency than the overall giant planet frequency (m p 0.1 M Jup) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs with orbits of 30 years.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The field of exoplanets has reached the state where statistically significant samples of planets have been detected via multiple different methods: radial velocities, transits, microlensing, and direct imaging. Each of these techniques are sensitive to different, yet complementary regions of parameter space, both in terms of the orbits and physical properties of planets, as well as their host stars. This means that it should be possible to derive generalized constraints on the demographics of planets over a broader region of parameter space than is available to each method individually by synthesizing their various data sets. This is not a trivial task, as each method of exoplanet discovery introduces unique observational biases and selection effects that have to be reconciled before comparing directly with detections from other methods.</p><p>Various RV and microlensing surveys have provided independent constraints on the demographics of exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sousa et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mayor et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howard et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mayor et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bonfils et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>). These two methods are generally complementary. RV surveys are sensitive to low-mass planets at short periods and larger planets at longer periods (ultimately limited to planets with periods less than the duration of the survey), while microlensing is sensitive to planets with projected separations near the clanton@astronomy.ohio-state.edu</p><p>Einstein radius of their host stars, which generally corresponds to larger separations than are covered by RV surveys (∼ 4 AU for a Solar mass star, and scaling as the square-root of the mass of the host star).</p><p>With regards to giant planets, this complementarity of RV and microlensing surveys is important. The two techniques are generally probing regions of parameter space where we expect planet formation to operate differently. RVs are most sensitive to orbits interior to the snow line, whereas microlensing is more sensitive to orbits exterior to the snow line. The snow line is the point in protoplanetary disks at (and beyond) which water ices can deposit out of the nebular gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hayashi 1981)</ref>. Past the snow line, deposition of water ices increases the surface density of the disk by a factor of ∼ 2 − 3, increasing the isolation mass by a factor of ∼ 4 − 5, allowing for gas giant formation by core accretion within the observed, short lifetimes (∼ 1 − 10 Myr) of gaseous disks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zuckerman et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pascucci et al. 2006</ref>), at least for Solar-mass stars. Giant planets detected by RV are thus generally expected to have migrated while those detected by microlensing presumably formed in situ. Therefore, by combining constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred by the two methods, we can get a complete picture of giant planet formation and migration, and disentangle these two competing physical effects.</p><p>RV and microlensing surveys also differ in terms of host stars: RV samples are targeted, but this is not the case for microlensing. The rarity and unpredictability of mi-crolensing events render a targeted survey ineffective, so the general observing strategy is to instead monitor large numbers of stars in the most dense fields towards the Galactic bulge. Such serendipitous microlensing events are dominated by M dwarf lenses, as these are more common than higher mass lenses.</p><p>In terms of giant planets, which we define as having masses m p 0.1 M Jup (see the companion paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014)</ref>, for a discussion of what exactly constitutes a "giant planet"), comparing detection results from RV and microlensing surveys is particularly interesting, because giant planets formed by core accretion are predicted to be rare around M dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Laughlin et al. 2004</ref>). This prediction has been claimed to be confirmed by RV surveys of M dwarfs, who find a paucity of giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bonfils et al. 2013</ref>) relative to Solar-mass stars. However, because these surveys are mostly sensitive to separations less than the snow line, it is not clear if this is a consequence of a lack of formation or a lack of migration. Indeed, microlensing surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>) find that giant planets beyond the snow line are more common by an order of magnitude than short period giant planets probed RV surveys, which on its face is in contradiction to the generic prediction of core accretion.</p><p>Motivated by this order of magnitude difference in giant planet frequency, here we develop the formalism and methodology for comparing and synthesizing the exoplanet detection results from RV and microlensing surveys. In a companion paper, we employ this methodology to determine if these two independent measurements of giant planet frequencies are consistent with the same population of planets.</p><p>We provide a high-level overview of the RV and microlensing techniques in § 2, highlighting the key differences necessary to understand before comparing exoplanet demographics derived independently from these two methods. In § 3 we provide an order of magnitude estimate that demonstrates that the "typical" microlensing planet, defined such that its parameters place it in the peak region of sensitivity for microlensing surveys, should be marginally detectable by RVs. We derive distributions of the period and velocity semi-amplitude expected from this "typical" microlensing planet, allowing for circular and eccentric orbits in § 4. In § 5 we develop a procedure to marginalize over all microlensing parameters, including the projected separation, the host star/planet mass ratio, host star mass, and lens distances to produce a posterior distribution of radial velocity observables for a population of planets analogous to that inferred from microlensing. We show this marginalized distribution and compute the number of planets per star a RV survey of M dwarfs (with some fiducial sensitivity and number of epochs per star) should detect, as well as the number of long-term RV trends per star resulting from planets, in § 6 and provide a discussion of our conclusions in § 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TECHNIQUES</head><p>The observables, and the physical processes that produce them, of RV and microlensing surveys are fundamentally different. The manner in which the targets are "selected" and the ways in which the two types of surveys are carried out are thus also different. This section provides a brief overview of both RV and microlensing techinques, and is meant to highlight key differences that are critical to understanding the comparison of exoplanet demographics derived independently from these two methods. For additional information on the methodology of RV planet searches and more complete reviews of the microlensing technique, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cumming (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Gaudi (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gaudi ( , 2012</ref>.</p><p>Radial Velocities: RV surveys monitor the time variance of the Doppler shift of absorption lines in stellar spectra, looking for variance resulting from orbital motion of the stars due to a companion (or companions). The primary measurements that are derived from such observations are the velocity semi-amplitude, K, and the period of variation, P . A measurement or a constraint on the eccentricity, e, of the system along with K and P yield a calculation of the mass function of the system, which, in the limit m p ≪ M ⋆ , has the form (m p sin i) 3 /M 2 ⋆ . Here, m p is the mass of the planet, i is the inclination (defined as the angle between the plane of the sky and the planet's orbital plane, such that i = 0 • corresponds to viewing the system face-on and i = 90 • corresponds to edge-on), and M ⋆ is the mass of the host star. Combined with an estimate of M ⋆ , it becomes possible to compute the minimum planet mass, m p sin i, and the semimajor axis of the planet, a.</p><p>Practically, to detect a planet with RV, the measurement uncertainties (both systematic and intrinsic errors, such as those resulting from stellar jitter) must be low enough to distinguish the periodic variation of the Doppler signal. Ignoring instrumental errors, the uncertainty of an RV measurement of a typical stellar absorption line scales as σ RV ∝ ∆ 3/2 /(W I 1/2 0 ), where ∆ is the full-width at half-maximum of an absorption line, W is its equivalent width, and I 0 is the continuum intensity <ref type="bibr">(Beatty &amp; Gaudi, in preparation)</ref>. This sets some general target requirements for RV surveys. In order to maximize sensitivity, it is best to observe stars with lots of absorption lines (spectral types FGKM), that emit lots of photons (bright, nearby), that are not rapidly rotating (typically no later than late F stars), and that are stable (not active, have few star spots, etc.).</p><p>The required observational cadence is such that sufficient coverage over all phases of RV variation is obtained. However, because the RV variation is periodic, this is not a strict requirement (although it does affect the overall sensitivity of a survey of a given duration). For instance, in order to detect a planet of period P , a RV survey must run for a duration (i.e. maximum time baseline) equal to at least P . In this case, the cadence must be significantly shorter than P to obtain good phase coverage. On the other hand, if the duration of the survey is several times longer than P , then the cadence need not be so short. Though, in general, the shorter the cadence, the greater the period sensitivity of the survey.</p><p>Consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which a RV survey can detect planets with a given period depends on the strength of the signal K, the magnitude of the measurement uncertainties σ, the duration of the survey T , and the total number of observations N . The time-dependent radial velocity of a star orbited by a planet on a circular orbit with period P has the form v (t) = K sin (2πt/P − φ 0 ), where φ 0 is an arbitrary phase. If we assume a uniform and continuous sampling of the radial velocity curve, wherein observations at N epochs are taken over a survey duration T , each with a measurement uncertainty σ, then we can estimate the SNR of the detection to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SNR (φ 0 ) = N σ 2 1 T T /2 −T /2 [v (t) − v (t)] 2 dt 1/2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v (t) is the time average of v (t) and is a function of φ 0 . Averaging equation (1) over φ 0 , we obtain a "phase-averaged" SNR, which we designate by the variable Q, for a RV detection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q ≡ ≡SNR φ0 = N 2 1/2 K σ × 1 − 1 π 2 P T 2 sin 2 πT P 1/2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>When P T &lt;&lt; 1, the SNR for a RV detection is very nearly independent of period,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q ∼ N 2 1/2 K σ .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>As one might expect, more epochs, decreased measurement errors, and longer survey durations increase the SNR of a RV planet detection. For periods of roughly the survey duration (P ∼ T ), the actual behavior shown by equation (2) is slightly more complicated, but equation (3) is a good approximation. For the purposes of this paper, we assume that an RV survey must collect data over a time baseline T ≥ P in order to detect a planet of period P , however we assume no detection dependence on orbital eccentricity. In practice, planets on orbits with eccentricities e 0.6 are much more difficult to detect by RV <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cumming 2004</ref>), but as we will show in later sections (see § 4.2 and § 6.2), we choose an eccentricity prior that puts a small fraction of planets on such eccentric orbits and thus our uncertainties due to this assumption are small compared to other sources of error.</p><p>RV observations rely on detecting light from host stars, requiring many photons to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. This can be advantageous, as it is often possible to obtain a wealth of information about RV-discovered planet hosting stars, including their colors, magnitudes, surface gravities, parallaxes, proper motions, and more. The trade off being that RV surveys are limited to the more luminous, or nearby, host stars. The basic observing strategy for most RV surveys is then to select a specific set of targets and monitor those targets for their duration. In contrast, microlensing surveys do not even require the collection of photons from host stars.</p><p>Microlensing: The microlensing technique monitors the magnification of a background star (i.e. the source) as it passes behind (or very nearly behind) a lensing system. Physically, microlensing probes the instantaneous gravitational structure of the lensing system, which determines the magnification pattern. The magnification pattern, together with the source trajectory and impact parameter, u 0 , determines the shape of the observed light curve. Light curves resulting from a microlensing event produced by a binary acting as a gravitational lens have distinct features that reveal the binary nature of the lens, even at small mass ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mao &amp; Paczynski 1991)</ref>. A planet orbiting a star is simply a binary lens system with a small mass ratio, q ≪ 1, and will produce a magnification pattern, and thus light curve, that is dominated by the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dominik 1999</ref>). The planet can only detected when the source crosses a perturbation produced by the planet in the magnification pattern of the host star. The magnitude and form of the resultant planetary signal are determined by the size, shape, and location of these perturbations. Perturbations with a larger area on the sky have a higher probability of a source crossing, thus detection probabilities are higher for physically larger perturbations. The properties of the planetary perturbations are largely determined by the mass ratio q and the projected separation s in units of the angular Einstein radius, θ E .</p><p>There are five parameters routinely measured from a microlensing event due to a simple lens consisting of a single, isolated mass. The light curve alone allows one to measure the blend flux, F b , the magnified source flux, F s , the Einstein crossing time, t E , the impact parameter in units of the Einstein radius, u 0 , and the time of maximum magnification, t 0 . For a microlensing event due to a binary lens, consisting of a host star and planet, it is also typically possible to measure the projected separation in units of the Einstein radius, s, and the planet-to-star mass ratio, q, although in certain limiting cases, both q and s are subject to discrete and continuous degeneracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dominik 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gaudi &amp; Gould 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gaudi 1998</ref>). It is often not possible to measure the mass of the lens star, M l , or the distance to the lens, D l ; to do so requires measurement of higher-order effects in the observed light curves, namely finite source effects and microlens parallax <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Refsdal 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gould 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gould , 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Witt &amp; Mao 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Witt 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Holz &amp; Wald 1996)</ref>. It is also possible to infer M l and D l with measurements of the lens flux and finite source effects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bennett et al. 2007</ref>). Without measurements of M l and D l , it is impossible to calculate the Einstein radius in physical units, R E . Thus, in such cases, it is not possible to directly measure the planetary mass or projected separation in physical units.</p><p>There are multiple different channels through which planets can be detected by microlensing, each corresponding to different lens geometries and/or source trajectories:</p><p>• Source crossing of a planetary caustic resulting from either close or wide separation planets in low magnification events. Although such perturbations are unpredictable, this is referred to as the "main" channel for planet detections by microlensing because the planetary caustics have the largest area on the sky and thus have the highest probability of perturbing a source image magnified by the primary lens mass (i.e. the host star).</p><p>• Perturbations from the central caustic resulting from either close or wide planets in highmagnification events. High-magnification events are relatively rare, but can be recognized in ad-vance of the peak.</p><p>• Resonant caustic perturbation in modest to high magnification events.</p><p>• Isolated, short timescale events resulting from wide-separation or free-floating planets.</p><p>Another way of understanding these detection channels is to realize that planets are only detected when they perturb the images created by the primary lens (i.e. the host star).</p><p>The optical depth to a microlensing event in lines-ofsight towards the Galactic bulge is of order 10 −6 ; the chance that a given star will lens a background source is small. A small fraction of stars that do undergo microlensing events will host planets that perturb the magnification pattern significantly. In a microlensing planet search, many stars must be monitored at a relatively high cadence. The typical (i.e. median) timescale of primary microlensing events is ∼ 20 days, requiring a cadence of just a few days to detect. The timescale of planetary perturbations scales as ∼ q 1/2 t E , which is roughly ∼ 15 hours for a Jupiter-mass planet or ∼ 1 hour for an Earth-mass planet orbiting a Solar-type star. Thus, the required cadence to accurately detect and characterize planetary systems needs to be of order tens of minutes or less.</p><p>Monitoring enough stars at a high enough cadence to detect planetary perturbations has not been possible until the relatively recent advent of large format CCD cameras with fields-of-view (FOV) of several square degrees. Rather, first generation microlensing planet searches have operated on the two-stage process advocated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gould &amp; Loeb (1992)</ref>, wherein survey collaborations such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE; Udalski 2003) and Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sako et al. 2008)</ref>, with large FOV cameras monitor several tens of square degrees at a cadence of a few observations a day or less. They reduce their data in real-time, alerting possible microlensing events typically before peak magnification. These alerts prompt follow-up teams, such as the Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork (PLANET; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albrow et al. 1998</ref>) and the Microlensing Follow Up Network (µFUN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010)</ref>, that have access to narrow-angle telescopes with full longitudinal coverage in the Southern Hemisphere to monitor ongoing microlensing events on hour timescales.</p><p>The PLANET collaboration has substantial access to 0.6−1.5 m telescopes located in South Africa, Perth, and Tasmania, allowing them to monitor dozens of events each season and search for planets via the main channel. The µFUN collaboration employs a single 1.3-m telescope in Chile to monitor promising alerted events in order to try to identify high-magnification events substantially before peak. When events are identified as high-magnification, other telescopes in the collaboration are engaged to obtain continuous coverage of the light curve during the high-magnification peak, which often gets as bright as I 15. The high-magnification enables the use of relatively small-apertures (0.3 − 0.4 m), allowing amateur astronomers to contribute to the photometric follow-up, which make up over half of the members of the µFUN collaboration. This approach searches for planets by looking for perturbations from the central caustic, rather than the main channel.</p><p>Key Differences: The main difference between observing strategies is that stars are targeted in RV surveys, while they not targeted in microlensing surveys. This is a reflection of the fact that these two techniques probe completely different physical mechanisms in the systems they observe. RV surveys search for periodic variations, and the information about a planetary system is contained within this periodicity. On the contrary, the information about a planetary system detected by microlensing is contained within a single light curve, the entirety of which is observed on ∼ month timescales. Microlensing has a unique advantage in that the technique is sensitive to planets on long-period orbits (∼ tens of years) without a need to observe for comparable timescales.</p><p>Microlensing events are rare, unpredictable, and transient signals, resulting from a chance alignment of stars. The required alignment is very precise, and so the microlensing event rate per star is low. For a range of lens distances, dD l , the contribution to the event rate scales</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">as ∝ n (D l ) M 1/2 l</formula><p>, where n (D l ) is the number density of lenses and M l is the lens mass and thus the integrated event rate is explicitly dependent on the mass function of lenses (see § 5.1 for more on event rates; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Griest 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kiraga &amp; Paczynski 1994)</ref>. Consequently, microlensing surveys do not get to "choose" their targets; their targets are instead determined by the shape of the mass function of lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gould 2000)</ref>.</p><p>RVs provide strong constraints on the properties of host stars and their planets, yielding measurements of m p sin i, a, and usually e. In a majority of cases, microlensing provides only q and s, neither of which holds any information about orbital eccentricity or orientation. In addition, the projected separation is only weakly correlated with the orbital semimajor axis.</p><p>Another important distinction between the two techniques is their sensitivities to different phase spaces of planetary orbits. A host star will appear to have no radial velocity when viewed face-on (i = 0 • ), and will have maximum radial velocity when viewed edge-on (i = 90 • ). RV surveys are thus most sensitive to edge-on systems. In a microlensing event, bound planets are detected when they perturb the images created by the primary lens. In events where the source is significantly magnified, the images are always located near the Einstein ring of the primary. The detection probability for planets is thus maximized when the planet has a projected separation equal to the Einstein ring, s = 1. Microlensing surveys are most sensitive to face-on systems because there is more overlap between the (projected) planetary orbit and the Einstein ring of the primary than there is in edge-on systems.</p><p>The Einstein radius is physical units, R E = D l θ E , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R E (M l , D l , D s ) = 4GM l c 2 D l (D s − D l ) D s ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where D l is the distance to the lens mass, M l , and D s is the distance to the source. A lens with mass 0.5 M ⊙ located at a distance D l = 4 kpc that is lensing a source located D s = 8 kpc away has an Einstein radius R E ≈ 2.9 AU. Since the detection probability for a planet in a microlensing event is maximized when the projected separation is equal to the Einstein ring, microlensing has a peak sensitivity to planets located beyond the ice line, a distance of about a ice = 1.7 AU(M l /0.5 M ⊙ ) 2/3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref>. As we have shown above, the sensitivity of RV surveys declines towards longer periods. However, this does not mean there is no overlap at all between RV and microlensing surveys. A planet with mass 1 M Jup and a semimajor axis of 2.9 AU orbiting a 0.5 M ⊙ star on a circular orbit will produce a velocity semi-amplitude of K ∼ 25 m s −1 (P/7 yr) −1/3 (m p /M Jup ) when viewed edge-on. For current state-of-the-art RV surveys, sensitivities of σ ∼ 1 − 2 m s −1 are routinely achieved, so detecting such a planet would simply be a matter of observing the target for at least ∼ 5 years. Indeed, several such planets have been detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bonfils et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Montet et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AND VELOCITY OF A TYPICAL MICROLENSING PLANET</head><p>The main goal of this study is to develop a methodology for mapping the parameter space of analogs to the planets detected by microlensing into RV observables. Furthermore, we aim to gain a deep understanding of how survey sensitivities from both methods are imprinted on the distributions of RV observables we derive. Microlensing is sensitive to a given mass ratio, q, and projected separation, s. With s and the Einstein radius, R E , we can calculate the projected separation in physical units, r ⊥ = sR E . The combination of q and the lens mass, M l , yields the planet mass, m p . We can then map r ⊥ into a semimajor axis, a, and thus a period, P , which together with m p , maps into a velocity semiamplitude, K. Of course, there are unknown physical parameters of microlensing detected systems 1 , namely M l and the distance to the lens, D l . Thus, in mapping a given microlensing detection, characterized by a (q, s) pair, we must adopt reasonable priors on M l and D l and marginalize over them to infer the true distribution of (r ⊥ , m p ). Since a microlensing detection offers no constraints on the orientation of a planet's orbit, priors on the orbital parameters must be adopted to complete the final step of mapping into a (K, P ).</p><p>In this section, we begin by providing an order of magnitude estimate of the radial velocity observables (K, P ) that would be produced by a "typical" microlensing planet on a circular orbit. We define the "typical" microlensing planet as one residing in the peak region of sensitivity with the following parameters: a host star mass of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ , a mass ratio of q ∼ 5 × 10 −4 , and a projected separation of r ⊥ ∼ R E ∼ 2.5 AU, where R E ∼ 2.5 AU is the typical Einstein radius for a 0.5 M ⊙ lens ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010)</ref>. This corresponds to a typical microlensing planet mass of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m p ∼ qM l ∼ 0.26 M Jup ∼ M Sat .</formula><p>The semi-major axis of a planet in terms of its pro-jected separation is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">a = r ⊥ sin β ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where sin β = cos 2 θ + sin 2 θ cos 2 i, θ is the orbital phase angle and i is the inclination of the planetary orbit. For this order of magnitude estimate, we assume a median value of the sin β distribution. For randomlyoriented, circular orbits, θ will be distributed uniformly as 0 ≤ θ &lt; 2π, and the distribution of inclinations is such that cos i is uniformly distributed as 0 ≤ cos i ≤ 1. The median value of cos i is simply 0.5, so the median value of sin i is given by 1 − (0.5) 2 ≈ 0.866. The distribution of sin β is identical to the distribution of sin i in the case of circular orbits, so their median values are exactly the same. This gives us that the typical semi-major axis for a microlensing planet is a typ ≈ r ⊥ 0.866 . We can now compute the orbital period from Kepler's 3rd law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P typ ≈ 2π (GM l ) 1/2 a 3/2 typ ≈7 yr M l 0.5 M ⊙ −1/2 r ⊥ 2.5 AU 3/2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where we have assumed that m p &lt;&lt; M l . The radial velocity semi-amplitude of this typical microlensing planet is thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">K typ ≈ 2πG P typ 1/3 m p sin i M 2/3 l ≈ 5 m s −1 M l 0.5 M ⊙ 1/2 q 5 × 10 −4 × r ⊥ 2.5 AU −1/2 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>for a planet of mass m p ∼ 0.26 M Jup on a circular orbit at the median sin i ≈ 0.866. Radial velocity surveys of low-mass stars (particularly M dwarfs) have reached time baselines comparable to this 7 yr period, and sensitivities of a few m s −1 are routinely achieved, so we can compute the SNR, via equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>, to which such surveys should be able to detect these sorts of planets. We examine a fiducial RV survey which consists of a sample of stars each with roughly N ≈ 30 epochs and uncertainties σ ≈ 4 m s −1 (which consists of, for example, 2 m s −1 precision errors and 3.5 m s −1 stellar jitter). Equation (3) then tells us that our fiducial RV survey should detect planets around low-mass stars with periods of ∼ 7 yr and K ∼ 5 m s −1 with Q ∼ 5. This would only constitute a marginal detection, but planets with larger mass ratios and/or smaller projected separations would be more readily detectable and should show up in the RV sample. In addition, RV surveys should be beginning to discover trends (i.e. long-term RV variations) in their samples, resulting from the long-period companions microlensing finds. To the extent that the parameters of our fiducial RV survey are reasonable, this implies that microlensing and RV surveys are beginning to overlap a common region of parameter space, warranting a careful, thorough comparison between these two samples.</p></div>

If we were able to detect every planet and measure these properties, we could in principal derive this distribution function. However, the number of planets we can actually detect depends on many observable parameters affecting detectability, some of which belong to the set {α} or are functions of the parameters in the set {α}. We group these observable parameters affecting detectability into the set {β}, containing k elements including (for RV surveys), but not necessarily limited to, velocity semi-amplitude, orbital period, stellar radius, inclination, mean anomaly, and argument of periastron:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">{K, P, R ⋆ , i, M 0 , ω}.</formula><p>In reality, the number of planets actually found in any exoplanet survey, be it RV, microlensing or other, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">N pl,obs = β0 dβ 0 β1 dβ 1 · · · β k dβ k d k N pl d {β} × k j=0 Φ (β j ) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where Φ ({β}) is the set of "efficiency" functions for each parameter in {β} that a particular survey suffers.

Indeed, the parameters we can partially marginalize out depends on the type of survey, and presents a great challenge when trying to synthesize exoplanet demographics from multiple different surveys. Regardless, comparing and synthesizing data from multiple exoplanet detection data methods is the only way to cover a maximal amount of observable space and thus get as close to we can to obtaining the true distribution function, d n N pl /d{α}, ultimately providing key empirical constraints necessary to learn about planet formation. This study is a step in that direction, as we aim to describe a comparison between microlensing and RV surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Circular Orbits</head><p>In § 3, we examined the "typical" microlensing detection and assumed fixed values of i, θ, and thus a, thus deriving one (K, P ) pair. In this section, we perform the next step of deriving the distributions of K and P resulting from marginalizing over the unknown orbital parameters, fixing the eccentricity to zero, e = 0. We are still assuming fixed M l = 0.5 M ⊙ , q = 5 × 10 −4 , s = 1, and r ⊥ = 2.5 AU, i.e. our "typical" microlensingdetected planetary system. For a fixed source distance of D s = 8 kpc, r ⊥ = 2.5 AU and M l = 0.5 M ⊙ implies D l ∼ 4 kpc.

The marginalization over the longitude of the ascending node, Ω, is also unnecessary, as this angle is degenerate in a microlensing detection. This will also be true when we consider eccentric orbits, although in that case, we will need to marginalize over a range of eccentricities and arguments of pericenter.</p><p>Rather than attempting to derive an analytic form of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, we determine the posterior distribution numerically. This is accomplished by creating an ensemble of circular orbits, each described by a set of parameters {a, i, M 0 }, drawn from mostly trivial priors. For each orbit, the mean anomaly, M 0 , is drawn from a uniform distribution in the range [0, 2π) and cos i is drawn uniformly from the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. We adopt a distribution in the form of¨Opikof¨ of¨Opik's law ( ¨ Opik 1924), i.e. log-uniform, for the semimajor axis, consistent with the observed intrinsic distribution of planet separations from RV studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>).

In the case of circular orbits, the solution is trivial. There are two other constants necessary to completely describe the orbit in rectangular coordinates, C = a sin ω sin i and H = a cos ω sin i. These are not necessary for computing the projected separation, and we include them only for the sake of completeness (for more information, see pg. 68 of Perryman 2011). Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> are general equations, but in our case, they greatly reduce in form because the projected separation, ˜ r, is independent of the longitude of the ascending node 2 , Ω. Also, for now, the eccentricity is set to zero. In the next section, this will no longer be the case.</p><p>Once we compute the projected separations, we "pick out" those orbits with˜rwith˜ with˜r consistent with that of the microlensing detection, r ⊥ . Specifically, the criterion we employ is |˜r|˜r − r ⊥ | &lt; 0.001R E , and is a numerical representation of the Dirac delta function in r ⊥ of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>. We then compute the joint distribution of K and P from those orbits that survive. This joint distribution is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>, along with constant SNR contours (equation 2) assuming N = 30, T = 10 yr and σ = 4 m s −1 .</p><p>This figure illustrates an important point. In § 3 we found that the typical microlensing planet (at the median inclination and mean anomaly, and thus at fixed semimajor axis) should be detectable by our fiducial RV survey at a SNR of about 5. However, when the orbital parameters {a, i, M 0 } are allowed to vary, we find that the typical microlensing planet is not always detectable by our fiducial RV survey. The spread in both K and P results completely from variance in the orbital parameters {a, i, M 0 } and thus only a subset of realizations of the typical microlensing planet turn out to be detectable. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> also demonstrates how the sensitivities of both the microlensing and RV methods are imprinted on the distribution of RV observables we derive. There are two competing effects that produce a double-peaked distribution in K for a given P . This is reflected in the structure of the inner contour lines. These two effects arise from a preference for edge-on and face-on orbits over intermediate inclinations. The first effect is that edge-on orbits are preferred since the distribution of cos i is uniform on <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref> for a randomly-oriented, circular orbit. This tends to produce velocity semi-amplitudes near the maximum possible value and causes the over-density in parameter space bounded by the inner, darker contour at larger K values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>. The other effect is that there is more phase space for a microlensing detection near face-on orbits since microlensing is sensitive to projected separations near the Einstein radius, producing velocity semiamplitudes near the minimum possible value. Planets with face-on orbits spend more time near the Einstein ring than those with edge-on orbits and are thus more likely to produce a detectable perturbation during a microlensing event. The over-density in parameter space due to this effect is bounded by the inner, lighter shaded contour at relatively lower K values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>. Thus, after marginalizing d 2 N pl /(dKdP ) over the period, the independent distribution of K is imprinted with a feature, a peak, in the interior of its allowed range, resulting from the superposition of these two effects (shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>).</p><p>There are distinct physical reasons for the shapes of these contour lines resulting from constraints on the allowed parameter space. Here we derive these constraints for the general case, including eccentric orbits, as we will need to return to the following relations when including eccentricity. The minimum period that a microlensing planet can have is realized when the projected separation is equal to the apastron of the planetary orbit, r ⊥ = a (1 + e). From Kepler's 3rd law, this period is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">P min = 2π r 3 ⊥ GM l 1/2 (1 + e) −3/2 .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>The upper bound on K for a given period results from the case that produces the largest radial velocities: an edge-on orbit (i = 90 • ).

The priors of the mean anomaly, M 0 , and the argument of pericenter, ω, are uniform on [0, 2π). At periastron, we have M 0 = 0, while M 0 = π corresponds to apastron. We examine four different priors on eccentricity to see how sensitive the K and P distributions are to the eccentricity distribution. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distributions using the various eccentricity priors we explore. First, we try a couple priors that are delta functions at given values of eccentricity (i.e. all planets have a specific value of eccentricity) to explore the effects orbits of fixed eccentricity will have on the resultant K and P distributions. The eccentricity prior in the top left panel of <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref> is dN pl /de ≡ δ(e − 0.1) and that of the top right panel is dN pl /de ≡ δ(e − 0.6). It is clear from these two panels alone that eccentricity can affect the joint distribution of K and P , as the allowed parameter space can be increased significantly relative to the circular case.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref> varies between the value for circular orbits, e = 0, and that for the maximum eccentricity, e = e max = 0.6.</p><p>Finally, we also consider the intrinsic (de-biased) eccentricity distribution determined by Zakamska et al. </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">dN pl de ∝ e exp − 1 2 e 0.3 2 .<label>(30)</label></formula><p>When using this prior we find a sharp feature in the distribution of P , corresponding to circular orbits. This pile-up corresponds to a similar feature in the semimajor axis distribution, resulting from the fact that the Zakamska et al. (2011) eccentricity distribution has a pile-up of planets on circular orbits relative to planets on eccentric orbits. When using this eccentricity prior, we find the median values of 4.71 m s −1 , 7.51 yr for K and P , respectively.</p><p>In summary, including a range of eccentricities does not significantly change the median values of K or P , but does serve to significantly broaden both distributions, particularly that of P . Microlensing is most sensitive to planetary perturbations from planets near the Einstein radius, and so is most sensitive to face-on orbits. For finite eccentricities, projected separations from a(1 − e) to a(1 + e) can satisfy the requirement that r ⊥ /R E = a(1 ± e)/R E = s, rather than just a. The distribution of P is thus sensitive to variations in eccentricity, whereas at fixed s, q, M l , i, the velocity semi-amplitude scales as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">K ∝ P −1/3</formula><p>1 − e 2 −1/2 , such that changes in e have two effects that work in opposite directions on K (and so approximately cancel), meaning that the distribution of K is much less sensitive to e. However, we will see in future sections that when we marginalize over a range of s, q, M l , and i, sharp features in the distribution of P are diminished and that variations in these parameters tend to spread out both K and P .</p><p>The allowed RV parameter space into which a planet detected by microlensing can be mapped is severely limited in the case of circular orbits, but allowing for eccentric orbits relaxes these constraints. When eccentricities are allowed to be non-zero, a much larger region of (K, P ) space is made available, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure  2</ref>. The colored lines show these relaxed constraints, influenced mainly by the upper bound on the eccentricity prior. When the eccentricity is allowed to vary, the peak of the P distribution occurs at the minimum possible period for a circular orbit from equation (21). As the eccentricity is allowed to get arbitrarily close to 1, the entire parameter space becomes available. However, we place a conservative upper limit on the eccentricity to be 0.999.</p><p>We henceforth adopt as our eccentricity prior that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zakamska et al. (2011)</ref>. Since this eccentricity distribution is determined from RV planet detections around FGK dwarfs, many of which must have migrated, it is unclear if the M dwarf planet population follows this distribution. However, unless a very large fraction of large-separation planets have very high eccentricities, our results will not depend sensitively on the precise eccentricity prior we adopt.</p></div>

We repeat this process varying all the different parameters and stack the resultant distributions of K and P , weighting each event by its event rate, d 4 dΓ/(dD l dM l d 2 µ), and a timescale, t E , bias. This yields a marginalized distribution that represents a full, weighted mapping of microlensing planet parameter space into radial velocity planet parameter space, i.e. our best estimate of the expected probability distribution of the radial velocity observables for a sample of stars hosting analogs to the planets inferred from microlensing surveys.</p></div>

Since we are only interested in the relative probabilities of our ensemble of microlensing events, the absolute normalization does not matter, and we can instead compute the mass density in place of the number density in the event rate equation. The mass function, dΓ/dM l , in the event rate equation provides the relative weighting for the various individual lens masses.

We set the lower mass limit to be the minimum mass for hydrogen burning, taken to be about ∼ 0.07 M ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chabrier et al. 2000)</ref>. Nevertheless, there is a subset of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> events for which there are mass measurements (see <ref type="table">table  1</ref>). We perform a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test between the event rate and timescale weighted distribution of M l for our simulated sample with the distribution of measured M l for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al.

Because the exact functional form of their detection efficiency with respect to timescale is unknown (and likely unknowable), we adopt a simple function that reflects the overall trend of increasing efficiency with timescale. We assume that our simulated microlensing survey is not at all sensitive to events shorter than 10 days, and above 10 days, we are equally sensitive to all timescales. Our timescale efficiency function is then simply Φ (t E ) = Θ (t E − 10), where Θ (t E ) is the Heaviside step function and t E is in units of days.</p><p>To include the effects of this selection function, we multiply the event rate by the value of this function to provide the statistical weights for each event.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.">Drawing Event Parameters</head><p>The priors we adopt for the microlensing event parameters are as follows. The source is assumed to always be in the bulge, at a distance of D s = 10 kpc. We choose 10 kpc because, as explained above, the source in all microlensing events is most probably be located between the center of the Galactic bulge and its back edge, which correspond to distances of 8 and 11 kpc, respectively, for the bulge model we adopt. Our results do not significantly change for fixed source distances within this range. The lens is allowed to either be in the bulge or in the disk (the way in which this is determined is described in § 5. The Galactic longitude and latitude of each microlensing event are drawn uniformly from within the intervals</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">−8 • ≤ l ≤ 0 • and −5 • ≤ b ≤ 8 • ,</formula><p>respectively. These ranges in l and b cover the most dense fields monitored by the OGLE survey. We also select a time of observation for each microlensing event between the months of March and September (i.e. the"microlensing season," when the Galactic bulge is visible). This affects the event rate because it determines the velocity of the Earth along the line-of-sight of the microlensing event, v ⊕ , which determines the expected lens-source relative proper motion (see § 5.1.2). We later show that our results are insensitive to variations in the event location and the time of observation.</p></div>

Since our disk has a 1 kpc hole centered on the galaxy, if D l and the line-of-sight are such that the lens lies within this hole, then the disk density, ρ l,disk , is zero and the probability that the lens is in the disk is zero.

We adopt a lower limit of log q = −5 because this is where the planetary detection sensitivities of microlensing surveys begin to rapidly decline, although a more conservative value of log q = −4.5 is typically used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. 2010</ref>), and thus we are extrapolating the results slightly beyond their region of sensitivity. This extrapolation does not actually affect most of our results because, as we show in this paper and its companion paper, RV surveys are not sensitive to these planets (although it does affect the overall frequency estimate from the synthesized dataset in the companion paper). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Mapping the Entire Microlensing Parameter Space</head><p>to the RV Observables K and P The final, marginalized distribution of RV observables, shown in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, represents a full microlensing parameter space mapping into the radial velocity values K and P . This plot is the median joint distribution of K and P resulting from varying planetary mass functions consistent with the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>, each of which includes an ensemble of microlensing events observed along a single line-ofsight towards Baade's Window (l = −1 • , b = −3.9 • ) at a single epoch. The peak of the K distribution, when marginalized over all P , is set by the lower bound on the value of q we sample from our prior of the mass ratio distribution. If we had set the lower bound of our prior on q lower, this peak would occur at a yet lower value of K. However, because we choose our normalization of each planetary mass function such that there is a fixed number of planets per dex 2 , continuing the distribution to lower values of q does not affect our estimate of the number of detectable (or trending) planets, provided that the minimum q is set so that the resulting K and P are always well outside the region of detectability. The spread in the P distribution, when marginalized over K, is set primarily by the limits of s where we sample our prior on the projected separation and the distribution of eccentricities.</p><p>The median values of this joint distribution of K and P are ≈ 0.24 m s −1 and ≈ 9.4 yr, respectively. The 68% intervals in K and P are 0.0944 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 1.33 and 3.35 ≤ P/yr ≤ 23.7, respectively, and the 95% intervals are 0.0422 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 16.8 and 1.50 ≤ P/yr ≤ 94.4, respectively. Although the median value of the K distribution is sensitive to our choice of the lower limit on the mass ratio, log q = −5, this lower limit is not arbitrary, as it roughly corresponds to the cutoff in the planetary detection sensitivity by microlensing surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. 2010</ref>). Thus, K ≈ 0.24 m s −1 then represents the median value of K at which RV surveys would detect planets if they were sensitive to all the planets for which microlensing surveys are sensitive. This median K differs significantly from our order of magnitude estimate in § 3, which was ∼ 5 m s −1 for the typical microlensing planet. The difference between the median value found by marginalizing over the microlensing parameter space and the order of magnitude estimate arises from the steeply declining planetary mass function inferred from microlensing surveys and because we consider somewhat lower mass ratios than the minimum value of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> sample.</p><p>We ran similar simulations where the line-of-sight was allowed to vary within the most dense fields monitored by OGLE, where l and b were chosen uniformly between [−8 • , 0 • ] and <ref type="bibr">[−5 • , 8 • ]</ref>, respectively. We also ran simulations where the time of observation was allowed to vary between dates during the "microlensing season," when the bulge is visible between March and September. Allowing for different observation times changes the velocity of the Earth along the line-of-sight, v ⊕ , which affects the expected lens-source relative proper motion (see §5.1.2). We find that variations in the line-of-sight and the Earth's velocity along the line-of-sight do not significantly change our results. The median of the resultant K and P distributions only change by as much as ∼ 0.003 m s −1 and ∼ 0.07 yr, respectively, from the case where the line-of-sight is fixed towards Baade's Window and the Earth's velocity is constant along this lineof-sight for all microlensing events. For simplicity, and since our stellar density models are normalized along the line-of-sight towards Baade's window (see § 5.1.1), we fix our line-of-sight to be that towards Baade's Window and Earth's velocity along this line-of-sight to be a constant for all simulations in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Estimate of the Fraction of Analogs to Those</head><p>Planets Detected by Microlensing Observable by RV Surveys We can use our joint K and P distribution, marginalized over all microlensing parameter space and shown in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, to predict an estimate of the fraction of microlensing planets that are detectable by RV surveys. In order to do this, we need a rough estimate of the detection efficiency for RV surveys, i.e. a minimum mass to which they are sensitive as a function of orbital period. We estimate this by solving equation (2) for K and then transforming this K into m p sin i via the velocity semi-amplitude equation for a circular orbit. This yields m p sin i as a function of the minimum SNR, which we designate as Q min for the predicted detections:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">m p sin i| min = 2 N σ 1 − 1 π 2 P T 2 sin 2 2πT P −1/2 × M 2/3 l P 2πG 1/3 Q min .<label>(61)</label></formula><p>Substituting in the values for the number of epochs per star and average precision for our fiducial RV survey of N ≈ 30 and σ ≈ 4 m s −1 , respectively, and assuming P ≪ T , we estimate the minimum m p sin i as a function of orbital period to which our fiducial RV survey is sensitive to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">m p sin i| min ≈ 69 M ⊕ P 7 yr 1/3 × M l 0.5 M ⊙ 2/3 Q min 5<label>(62)</label></formula><p>for periods less than the time baseline of observations. This is still likely to be in the giant planet regime (i.e. m p 0.1 M Jup ). For periods larger than this baseline, RV surveys would only see a fraction of the period of the planetary orbit and so could not claim a detection at this SNR. However, these planets would be seen as RV drifts, or trends, the sensitivity of which would be given by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(61)</ref> for the chosen values of N , σ and T . We also assume that the full range of eccentricities can be identified by such RV surveys as detections or trends. In reality, significant selection effects hinder detection of planets with orbital eccentricities e 0.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cumming 2004</ref>). However, due to our choice of eccentricity prior, only about 8% of planets have e ≥ 0.6.</p><p>While this introduces uncertainty to our estimate of detectable planets and trends, the total error is dominated by the uncertainty in the quantity F , arising from uncertainties in both the normalization and slope of the planetary mass function as measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>, respectively. We use the estimate of detection sensitivity given by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(62)</ref> to predict the fraction of analogs to the planets inferred from microlensing surveys that RV surveys should detect as planets or long-term drifts by applying a SNR cut in the (K, P ) parameter space of the microlensing population and count the number of relative planets that lie in the "detectable" and "trending" regions. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates this procedure. The predicted number of planets per star that will be detected by such an RV survey, which we designate as f det , is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">f det = 1 N ml i F i N det,i ,<label>(63)</label></formula><p>where N ml is the number of microlensing events per realization (see § 5.5), N det,i is the number of planets that are detectable according to equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(62)</ref> and thus lie in the blue region of <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, and F i is the fraction of stars hosting planets in a given realization. Similarly, the number of planets per star we predict to be seen as trends by our fiducial RV survey, which we designate as f tr , is given by equation (63) but with N det,i → N tr,i , where N tr,i is the number of planets that lie in the red region of <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, i.e. the number of planets that produce detectable radial velocities but have orbital periods longer than the duration of our ficucial RV survey.</p><p>In the mathematical formalism developed in § 4, the predicted number of planets per star is given by f det = N det /N ⋆ , where N ⋆ is the number of stars monitored by a given RV survey and where N det is given by equation (9), which takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">N det = d 2 N dKdP Φ (K) Φ (P ) dKdP ,<label>(64)</label></formula><p>where Φ (K) = Θ (K − K det ) and Φ (P ) = Θ (T − P ) are the selection functions that determine which planets are detectable. Here, K det = K (Q min , N, σ, T, P ) is the minimum detectable K. The functional form of K det is found by solving equation (2) for K and substituting in the appropriate parameter values. The mathematical expression for the expected number of trends is the equivalent to equation (64) except in this case, we have Φ (P ) = Θ (P − T ). For a SNR cut of 5 or higher (i.e. Q min = 5), corresponding to a detection efficiency given by equation (62), we predict that RV surveys should on average detect f det = 0.049 +0.046 −0.026 planets per monitored star and find f tr = 0.024 +0.024 −0.014 long-term RV trends per monitored star resulting from planets. The uncertainties in these quantities come from the error in F , which arise from the uncertainties in the normalization and slope of the planetary mass function from the measurements of G and p by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>, respectively (refer to § 5.4 for details). Thus, if an RV survey were to monitor a sample of N ⋆ = 100 M dwarfs with a mass distribution covering the interval 0.07 ≤ M ⋆ /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0 uniformly in log M ⋆ , we predict dN/dK <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.

The filled yellow circle represents where the typical microlensing planet lies in this parameter space at the median inclination and mean anomaly and on a circular orbit (Ktyp ∼ 5 m s −1 , Ptyp ∼ 7 yr). The median value of the period distribution is ≈ 9.4 yr and the median value of the velocity semi-amplitude distribution is ≈ 0.24 m s −1 . The 68% intervals in K and P are 0.0944 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 1.33 and 3.35 ≤ P/yr ≤ 23.7, respectively. The blue and red colored line represents a constant SNR of Q min = 5, the form of which is given by equation (2). The blue shaded area represents the region of parameter space where planets are detected at Q ≥ 5, and have P ≤ 10 yr. The red shaded area represents the region of parameter space where long-term trends are detected by our fiducial RV survey (N ≈ 30, σ ≈ 4 m s −1 , T ≈ 10 yr). For Q min = 5, corresponding to a detection efficiency given by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(62)</ref> Of course, in real RV surveys, the number of epochs, time baselines and RV precisions are different for each star in their sample. This means that each star has different detection sensitivities, so while the above results give a rough estimate of the fraction of predicted detections and trends, a more careful analysis is needed to more accurately compare microlensing predictions with current RV studies. This is the aim of an upcoming paper in which we will apply the methodology presented in this work to derive distributions of RV observables for analogs of the planets found by microlensing. After carefully estimating RV detection sensitivies of current RV surveys of M dwarf samples, we will predict the number of planets these surveys should find and compare with the number of planet detections they report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Our order of magnitude calculation demonstrates that an RV survey with an average number of epochs per star N = 30, average precision σ = 4 m s −1 , and time baseline T = 10 yr, should be able to detect the typical microlensing planet (M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ , M p ≈ 0.26 M Jup , r ⊥ ∼ 2.5 AU) on a circular orbit with an inclination equal to the median value of a uniform prior in cos i at a SNR of about 5. However, if we allow the orbital parameters of this typical microlensing-detected planet to vary, we find that it is not always detectable via RVs. This motivates our study to map analogs of the population of planets inferred from microlensing into the RV observables K and P to determine the number of planets per star RV surveys should detect and see as trends. In doing so, we are able to show that although the regions of planet parameter space where microlensing and RV surveys are sensitive are largely disjoint, there is some overlap for giant planets with masses m p 10 2 M ⊕ and with orbital periods between ∼ 3 − 10 years.</p><p>An RV survey with a duration of ∼ 10 years has significant overlap with microlensing surveys in terms of period. We find that the median period of analogs to the planets inferred by microlensing is P med ≈ 9.4 years, with a 68% interval of 3.35 ≤ P/yr ≤ 23.7. However, due primarily to a steeply declining planetary mass function, we find that the median velocity semi-amplitude of such planets is K med ≈ 0.24 m s −1 , with a 68% interval of 0.0944 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 1.33. The steeply declining planetary mass function measured by microlensing is primarily responsible for the shape of the posterior distribution of K for these planets, and puts a majority of the planet population inferred from microlensing out of reach for RV surveys. The detection sensitivity of RV surveys to such planets is thus ultimately limited by their velocity precision. The best precisions of state-of-the-art RV surveys is ∼few m s −1 (including both instrumental errors as well as stellar jitter), so the bulk of the the planet population inferred from microlensing is inaccessible by RVs. In order for RV surveys to access the bulk of these planets, precisions of ∼ 0.1 m s −1 need to be achieved. However, in order to detect the large population of giant planets (m p 0.1 M Jup ) inferred from microlensing, precisions of only ∼ 1 m s −1 are needed.</p><p>We find that orbital eccentricity and inclination also significantly impact the mapping of microlensing parameters into the RV observables K and P , although to a lesser extent than the planetary mass function. Allowing for eccentric orbits greatly increases the area of allowed parameter space (see figures 1 and 2) and variations in the inclination increase the spread of K values directly, since K ∝ sin i for a given period, host star mass and mass ratio. Nonetheless, we find that variation of the orbital parameters tend not to shift the median K and P , but mostly serve to increase the spread in these observables.</p><p>Despite the fact that RV and microlensing surveys are sensitive to different parameters, have very different targeting/observing strategies, and thus suffer from different selection effects, we have demonstrated that it is possible to statistically compare detection results from these two completely independent techniques. We find that a RV survey monitoring a sample of 100 M dwarfs with a mass distribution covering the interval 0.07 ≤ M ⋆ /M ⊙ ≤ 1.0 uniformly in log M ⋆ , and with an average number of epochs per star N = 30, average sensitivity σ = 4 m s −1 , and time baseline T = 10 yr, should on average detect 4.9 +4.6 −2.6 giant planets and identify 2.4 +2.4 −1.4 as long-term trends at a SNR of 5 or higher if analogs of the planets detected by microlensing orbit local M dwarfs. In practice, real RV surveys could have different sensitivities than those implied by our fiducial survey. A careful comparison of microlensing and RV detection results will require knowledge of the specific sensitivities of all stars monitored by RVs, but the methodology of comparison will be very similar to that laid out in this study. In a companion paper, we do just this, comparing microlensing results with the M dwarf RV studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al.

The lens star mass, M l , is drawn from a distribution dΓ/dM l ∝ M −1 l between [0.07 M ⊙ , 1.0 M ⊙ ]. Next, we draw two com- ponents of the lens-source relative proper motion in the North and East galactic directions, µ = (µ N , µ E ). Each component is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 mas yr −1 , 20.0 mas yr −1 . We show in fig- ure 4 that there are no microlensing events with sig- nificant event rates that have relative proper motions |µ| 15 mas yr −1 . This is due to the exponential cutoff of high (and low) relative proper motions in the event rate, as shown in equation (47). Thus, choosing compo- nents of the relative proper motion from a larger range, e.g. 0 mas yr −1 , 200.0 mas yr −1 , results in exactly the same distribution.</figDesc></figure>

Contours of the probability density of K and P , marginalized over the entire microlensing parameter space, are shown in greyscale. The contour levels, going from grey to black, are 1%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 80% of the peak density. The filled yellow circle represents where the typical microlensing planet lies in this parameter space at the median inclination and mean anomaly and on a circular orbit (Ktyp ∼ 5 m s −1 , Ptyp ∼ 7 yr). The median value of the period distribution is ≈ 9.4 yr and the median value of the velocity semi-amplitude distribution is ≈ 0.24 m s −1 . The 68% intervals in K and P are 0.0944 ≤ K/m s −1 ≤ 1.33 and 3.35 ≤ P/yr ≤ 23.7, respectively. The blue and red colored line represents a constant SNR of Q min = 5, the form of which is given by equation (2). The blue shaded area represents the region of parameter space where planets are detected at Q ≥ 5, and have P ≤ 10 yr. The red shaded area represents the region of parameter space where long-term trends are detected by our fiducial RV survey (N ≈ 30, σ ≈ 4 m s −1 , T ≈ 10 yr). For Q min = 5, corresponding to a detection efficiency given by equation (62), we predict that such a survey should (on average) detect f det = 0.049 +0.046 −0.026 planets per star and see ftr = 0.024 +0.024 −0.014 trends per star due to planets. should should detect N det = f det N ⋆ = 4.9 +4.6 −2.6 giant planets and identify N tr = f tr N ⋆ = 2.4 +2.4 −1.4 trends due to a giant planet, at a minimum SNR of 5. If we relax the SNR constraint to Q min = 1, which would correspond to a sensitivity of m p sin i| min ≈ 14 M ⊕ P 7 yr 1/3 × Q min 1 M l 0.5 M ⊙ 2/3 (65) for periods less than 10 yr, we find f det = 0.16 +0.10 −0.06 and f tr = 0.082 +0.062 −0.037 . This would mean our fiducial RV survey should detect N det = 16 +10 −6 planets and see N tr = 8.2 +6.2 −3.7 trends due to planets from a sample of 100</figDesc></figure>
