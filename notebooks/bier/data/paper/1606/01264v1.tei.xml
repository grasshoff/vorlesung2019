				<p>We introduce a new transit search and vetting pipeline for observations from the K2 mission, and present the candidate transiting planets identified by this pipeline out of the targets in Campaigns 5 and 6. Our pipeline uses the Gaussian Process-based k2sc code to correct for the K2 pointing systematics and simultaneously model stellar variability. The systematics-corrected, variability-detrended light curves are searched for transits with the Box Least Squares method, and a period-dependent detection threshold is used to generate a preliminary candidate list. Two or three individuals vet each candidate manually to produce the final candidate list, using a set of automatically-generated transit fits and assorted diagnostic tests to inform the vetting. We detect 147 single-planet system candidates and 5 multi-planet systems, independently recovering the previously-published hot Jupiters EPIC 212110888b, WASP-55b (EPIC 212300977b) and Qatar-2b (EPIC 212756297b). We also report the outcome of reconnaissance spectroscopy carried out for all candidates with Kepler magnitude K p ≤ 13, identifying 12 targets as likely false positives. We compare our results to those of other K2 transit search pipelines, noting that ours performs particularly well for variable and/or active stars, but that the results are very similar overall. All the light curves and code used in the transit search and vetting process are publicly available, as are the follow-up spectra.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler Space Telescope, operated by NASA, has discovered the majority of known exoplanet candidates, with 4175 planet candidates identified over its 47-month nominal mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>). Kepler obtained high-precision (∼ tens of ppm) photometry of ∼ 170, 000 stars over a field of view of 115 deg 2 , identifying exoplanets by the characteristic repeated dip in brightness as they transit their host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borucki et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Koch et al. 2010</ref>). After the failure of two of the four reaction wheels which formerly stabilized its pointing, it has been revived as the two-wheeled mission K2, using the two remaining wheels with the radiation pressure of the Sun to balance the third axis of rotation. K2's observing sequence consists of a succession of ∼ 70-80 day 'Campaigns', each targeting a field in the Ecliptic plane ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Howell et al. 2014</ref>), with photometric precision comparable to that of the nominal Kepler mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vanderburg &amp; Johnson 2014)</ref>. As a result of the short Campaigns, K2 is unable to detect planets with periods as long as were accessible with Kepler. On the other hand, by covering many different fields it is able to search for short-period planets around a larger number of bright stars and to probe a wider range of environments.</p><p>K2 has diverse science goals (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Howell et al. 2014</ref> for a more detailed discussion). It vastly increases upon the number of bright E-mail: benjamin.pope@physics.ox.ac.uk Sun-like stars and nearby late-type stars which were included in the Kepler prime mission. Short-period transiting planets discovered around these stars will be particularly good targets for future atmosphere studies. K2 is also advancing stellar astrophysics through the study of pulsating stars, eclipsing binaries and transients, as well as observing extragalactic and Solar System targets. By surveying fields located in or close to the Ecliptic plane, K2 observations cover several nearby, young open clusters and associations, such as ρ Ophiuchi (ρ Oph) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) (Campaign 2), the Pleiades (Campaign 4), Praesepe (or the Beehive Cluster) (Campaign 5), and Taurus and the Hyades <ref type="bibr">(Cam- paigns 4 &amp; 13)</ref>. K2 observations of these clusters are opening a new window on young star variability, including accretion-related variability, stellar activity and rotation, and pulsations, but enable also the discovery and characterisation of young eclipsing binaries and transiting planets. The latter are particularly important probes of the early stages of planetary evolution.</p><p>In this paper we present a new pipeline to correct K2 light curves for instrumental systematics and stellar variability, search them for planetary transit candidates, and perform a series of diagnostic tests to weed out false posisitives. We apply this pipeline to <ref type="bibr">Campaigns 5 &amp; 6 (hereafter C5 and C6)</ref>, identifying 77 and 71 single-planet candidates among the 25139 and 28291 targets surveyed in each Campaign, as well as 5 systems showing multiple sets of transits. While our method is applicable to any K2 light curve, and indeed readily adaptable to data from other instruments, a particular focus of its design has been to ensure good performance for young, variable stars, which represent a larger fraction of the most interesting targets for K2 than for previous transit search missions.</p><p>K2 has already led to a number of noteworthy planetary transit discoveries, including: disintegrating rocky planetesimals transiting a white dwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>) and an M-dwarf <ref type="bibr">(Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015</ref>), two unexpected additional planets in the hot Jupiter-hosting system WASP-47 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker et al. 2015</ref>), planetary companions to field M-dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crossfield et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schlieder et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hirano et al. 2016b</ref>), transiting planets orbiting young stars in the Hyades and Upper Sco ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mann et al. 2016b</ref>,a) and many more individual planets. Several groups have also published catalogues of K2 planet candidates, including Foreman-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Osborn et al. (2016b)</ref> have presented systematic searches for single-transit events in K2, identifying long-period planet candidates. Where there is overlap, we will compare our results to these published catalogs.</p><p>The different pipelines used on K2 data to date differ in subtle ways from each other, and from ours, at every stage of the light curve detrending, transit search and vetting process, but particularly important differences are found in the light curve extraction and detrending step. This is because of the importance of instrumental systematics (and, to a lesser extent, stellar variability) in K2 data. In the K2 mission, the Kepler satellite is balanced at an unstable equilibrium, using two reaction wheels and with solar radiation pressure keeping the third axis approximately steady. The third axis orientation must be maintained, however, by small thruster firings every ∼ 6 hours, moving a typical star by of order ∼ 1 pixel across the detector, with the result that K2 data contain significant pointing-related systematic photometric trends that make robust inference about the presence of planets more difficult than in the nominal Kepler mission. Several data-reduction pipelines have been developed by different groups to compensate for this effect <ref type="bibr">(Vander- burg &amp; Johnson 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Armstrong et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lund et al. 2015</ref>), including our detrending pipeline (which we use in this paper) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aigrain et al. 2016a</ref>, hereafter APP16). A unique feature of our approach is that systematics and stellar variability are modelled simultaneously rather than sequentially, which significantly improves the results when both effects are significant, especially on similar timescales. The methods used in the remainder of our pipeline for transit search and vetting are relatively standard, but were implemented with particular attention to scalability and computational efficiency, and in such a way as to enable easy, uniform human vetting at the present time, as well as -in the future -progression towards a fully probabilistic asssessment of the likelihood that individual candidates are bona fide planets.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sections 2, 3 and 4 describe our light curve preparation, transit search and vetting methodology, respectively. Our catalog of transiting planet candidates from C5 and C6 is given in Section 5, together with the results of preliminary spectroscopic reconnaissance. Section 6 gives links to the code used in our pipeline, all of which is publicly available, and we give our conclusions and discuss plans for future improvements in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">LIGHT CURVE PREPARATION</head><p>K2 photometric time series are typically affected by sawtooth-like variations in measured flux, due to the drift and subsequent thruster reset of the spacecraft boresight roll angle. This effect, needed to maintain spacecraft pointing near the unstable equilibrium induced by solar radiation pressure, causes each star to move by of order ∼ 1 pixel over the course of each thruster-reset period of ∼ 6 hours. This is translated into variations in flux by the differential sensitivity between pixels (inter-pixel variations) and across the surface of each pixel (intra-pixel variations), and by the loss of light outside the photometric aperture as it imperfectly matches and tracks the point spread function (aperture losses). Other systematic effects are also present (as they were in the light curves from the original Kepler mission), but the pointing-related variations are by far the most prominent. In addition to these instrumental systematics, the light curves also contain intrinsic stellar variability, most commonly due to the rotational modulation of star spots. Both systematics and variability can severely hinder the detection of planetary transits, and must be filtered or modelled before the transit search can proceed.</p><p>The standard approach until now has been to do this sequentially, first modelling the systematics while ignoring the variability, then using some variation on a high-pass filter to remove most of the variability while preserving any planetary transits (the latter step exploits the fact that transits occur on shorter timescales than most forms of stellar variability). However, this approach breaks down when both systematics and variability are of comparable amplitude, and occur on similar timescales. While the typical rotation periods of K2 target stars (days to weeks) are significantly longer than the ∼ 6 hour characteristic timescale of the pointing variations, there is nonetheless significant power in the variability of many stars on 6 to 12-hour timescales. This is particularly problematic for K2, which observes a larger fraction of young, rapidly rotating, active stars than earlier transit-search missions. In such cases, modelling the systematics and variability simultaneously tends to be more effective, particularly if -as in the case of K2 -the systematics can be constrained to depend primarily on the star's position on the detector, which should have no impact on its intrinsic brightness. This is the approach implemented in the k2sc pipeline APP16, which uses a Gaussian process to model the systematics and variability simultaneously. The model contains two distinct components: the first depends on position only and represents the pointing-related systematics, and the second depends on time only, and represents the variability (plus any residual systematics not related to position). A sophisticated outlier rejection scheme is used to ensure that flares, eclipses and transits do not adversely affect the modelling, but are nonetheless preserved. We model the stellar variability one of two ways, either with the quasi-periodic exponential sine squared kernel in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rasmussen &amp; Williams 2005)</ref> or with a squared exponential, and decide between the two by calculating a Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Lomb 1976) of the input lightcurve; if this shows a strong periodicity, we choose the quasiperiodic kernel. Otherwise, we represent stellar variability with a slowly-varying squared exponential kernel.</p><p>We begin with the K2 light curves available at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), which we process with k2sc to remove both systematics and variability. We exclude <ref type="bibr">EPICs 200008644 -200009280 in C5</ref>, which correspond to cluster superstamps (large contiguous regions of active pixels that cover star clusters) and to trans-Neptunian objects, and 200041889 -200061149 in C6, which track Trojan asteroids.</p><p>While cluster science is a key science goal of K2, standard MAST-pipeline aperture photometry is not reliable in the extremely crowded fields of the cores of clusters, as are treated with superstamps. Many more widely distributed cluster members and probable cluster members outside the superstamp have MAST lightcurves; we exclude from the analysis presented here stars with very high cluster membership probability, in particular Praesepe stars (C5), as the subject of a separate study.</p><p>In APP16, we tested k2sc on both the Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) light curves, and light curves corrected for commonmode systematic trends by the Kepler Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Twicken et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stumpe et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Smith et al. 2012</ref>). We found that the latter typically result in slightly improved photometric precision on transit timescales (as measured using our proxy estimate of the 6.5-h combined differential photometric precision, or CDPP). This is most likely due to the fact that some of the common-mode trends removed by the PDC pipeline are related to variations in (e.g.) telescope focus and the temperature of various components, and not directly to the pointing, and are thus not modelled by k2sc. On the other hand, k2sc significantly improves the precision of PDC light curves, and enhances our ability to detect planetary transits (as demonstrated by APP16 using transit injection tests). We therefore use the k2sc-processed PDC light curves as our starting point for the transit search. The interested reader is referred to APP16 for more details on k2sc and its application to K2 light curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TRANSIT SEARCH</head><p>Candidates are initially identified by a Box-Least-Squares (BLS) algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref> which evaluates a signal-to-noise statistic, the signal detection efficiency (SDE), for a simple boxshaped transit for a grid of zero epochs spanning the Campaign and for periods ranging from 0.7 d to 98% of the total duration of the Campaign, using our own version of the algorithm (Parviainen 2016). We apply this search to a GP-detrended light curve, which has been prewhitened, where we subtract the GP time component to model smooth out of transit variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carpano et al. 2003</ref>). We record the SDE, and best-fitting period, epoch and duration for each target.</p><p>Using this preliminary fit, we then fit a transit model using the PyTransit package (Parviainen 2015b), a fast implementation of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> analytic transit light curves.</p><p>We use the BLS SDE to identify promising candidates for more detailed study. Using the injection test results from APP16 <ref type="figure">(Figure 10</ref>), we expect non-planet-hosts to be distributed around a mean SDE of ∼ 6, roughly uniformly in log-period. In APP16 we therefore recommended a cut in SDE of ∼ 8 as a simple and effective way of selecting transit candidates. As is apparent in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, in our real data, there is in fact some slope to this distribution, as well as a larger number of candidates at short periods.</p><p>In order to deal with this, we define an SDE threshold as a function of period. First, we discard single transit candidates as beyond the scope of this study, and examine the remaining objects. In preliminary inspection, we note that ∼ 65 long-period candidates in C6 result from systematics associated with particular pairs of bad epochs, leading to a pileup of candidates with poorly-corrected lightcurves with zero epochs in two ∼ 0.5 d windows. We therefore identify these from a histogram of fitted BLS zero epochs, and remove these candidates before proceeding. We also discard candidates for which the log-likelihood of a sinusoidal fit is greater than that of a transit, as a way of removing the most obvious variable sources. We then split the objects into 50 bins in period space, each containing an equal number of objects (469 for C5 and 457 for C6), thus using a variable bin size. In each bin we find the median SDE, and the median absolute deviation-estimated standard deviation. Since there is a trend in the median as a function of period, we fit a second-order polynomial to the distribution of period as a function of median SDE, subtract this from each, and find the standard deviation of the residuals. We then select for further analysis all candidates that lie more than 3 σ above this value in each bin. We illustrate this in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, displaying a plot of SDE versus period for both Campaigns, including all objects, selected objects, and vetted objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VETTING</head><p>The procedure described in the previous section leads to a preliminary candidate list for each Campaign, which still contains both false detections caused by light curve artefacts or other abnormalities, and astrophysical false positives, i.e. transit-like events which are not caused by a planet. To identify these and produce a cleaner candidate list, we visually inspect the light curves, along with a set of diagnostic plots based on transit model fits, broadly following the approach outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Some light curves are affected by poorly-corrected systematics. These show residual ∼ 6 hour variability which can lead to a spuriously large BLS detection statistic. We therefore systematically discard detections at the characteristic thruster firing period, and multiples thereof. Furthermore, the time component of the k2sc GP model does not always model very short-period or high-amplitude stellar variability well. This is especially true for classical pulsators such as RR Lyr and Cepheid variables: while the overall variability pattern is modelled adequately, the extrema are not, leaving periodic dips in the residuals, which can lead to a high BLS statistic. Finally, while planetary transits and short-duration stellar eclipses are typically flagged as outliers by the k2sc model (so that they are left unchanged by the detrending process), the outlier flagging procedure is less successful for high-amplitude eclipsing binaries (EBs) where the eclipse duration exceeds a few percent of the period. In those cases, the time component of the GP model partially reproduces the eclipses, leaving in the residuals shallow, periodic eclipse-like events which can superficially resemble planetary transits. All of these categories of false positive are readily identified by visually comparing the raw light curve, the systematics and time-dependent components of the k2sc GP model, and the detrended light curve.</p><p>Eclipsing binaries (EBs) are the major source of false positives remaining after this step. The different types of EBs that can mimic a transit signal are discussed extensively in the literature (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Charbonneau et al. 2004</ref> for an overview); we merely list them here: grazing EBs, EBs containing a large primary or small secondary star, and blended EBs (EBs whose eclipses are diluted by the light of a third star enclosed in the photometry aperture). To aid in the identification of such systems, we systematically produce, for all our candidates, a single-page report displaying key diagnostics in graphical and numerical form, as listed below. An example of such a report is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the reports for all the candidates listed in Section 5 are provided online as supplementary material. The report shows, from top left to bottom right:</p><p>• Unfolded light curve plots showing the raw light curve, the systematics and time-component of the k2sc GP model, and the <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

The parameters of the transit fits are epoch, period, planetto-star radius ratio, impact parameter and stellar density. We also report the transit depth and duration, which are computed from the best-fit transit model. Note that the transit models are evaluated with 3 min time-sampling and binned up by a factor of 10 to account for the smearing of the ingress and egress caused by the relatively sparse sampling of K2 long cadence observations. The vetting process for transit candidates identified during the Kepler prime mission (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2010</ref>) also relies on the use of so-called "rain diagrams": plots of flux versus x-and y-position of the target centroid. Such diagrams are highly effective at identify- ing blended EBs, where the target centroid can change significantly during eclipses (except for hierarchical triple system where the EB and contaminant are essentially co-located). In the case of K2, one must use the difference between the star's predicted position (based on the overall pointing variations of the satellite) and its measured centroid. We systematically produce such plots and use them in the vetting process, but they have not yet been incorporated into the single-page reports.</p><p>Any candidates which show clear signs of being false detections, or being caused by EBs, on the basis of the diagnostics described above, are discarded from the final candidate lists. Rather than define quantitative criteria for rejecting or keeping a candidate, at least two individuals vet all the candidates independently, and only those considered passable by all the vetters are retained. This clearly leaves scope for considerable improvement: ideally we would like to perform a systematic, quantitative assessment of the probability that each candidate is indeed a planet, based on all the available information. One way to do this automatically is to use machine learning tools, such as the random forest algorithm recently implemented for <ref type="bibr">Kepler (McCauliff et al. 2015</ref>), trained on transit candidate lists vetted by humans. However, this is beyond the scope of the present paper.</p></div>

Although they did not explicitly fail any of the vetting tests, we did not include them in the final candidate lists, as it is difficult to distinguish a real transit from residuals from imperfectly modelled, stochastic stellar variability on the same timescale.

Vanderburg (priv. comm.). As we were co-ordinating our spectroscopic reconnaissance efforts, we shared our targets lists for magnitudes K p &lt; 13. Within that range, there is a very substantial overlap between our lists, with only a small number of objects found by one group but not by the other. In several cases, we have rejected candidates found by Vanderburg as having evidence for a secondary eclipse; in other cases, Vanderburg finds evidence of a secondary eclipse where we do not (see Comments in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1 and 2</ref>). A few of our candidates were not detected by Vanderburg, these correspond to active stars whose variability and systematics are better-modelled by the k2sc GP model than by piecewise polynomial detrending. Finally, we failed to detect a few of Vanderburg's candidates. In those cases, we see no evidence for a transit in our light curve, but the signal is clear in the k2sff light curves. These are all bright stars, for which we suspect that the k2sff photometric apertures are better suited to the point spread function than those used by MAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vanderburg &amp; Johnson 2014)</ref>. This comparison shows that the different light curve detrending, transit search and vetting processes are complementary, and that a more complete candidate list may be obtained by combining the results of several pipelines than by any single pipeline. We also note that the overall transit detection potential of K2 may be best exploited by combining k2sff aperture photometry (or similar) with k2sc detrending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Multiple Planet Systems</head><p>We also checked for additional transiting planets in the systems identified in Section 4. At the vetting stage, we made note of systems for which there was visual evidence of more than one set of transits. For each such system, we then subtracted the best-fit model for the first set of transits and repeated the transit search and fitting on the residuals. The process was iterated until no further sets of transits were found.</p><p>We detect two sets of transits around each of EPIC 212012119 (C5); and 212393193, 212703473, and 212779596 (C6), and three sets of transits around 212768333 (C6). The parameters of these systems are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. For each of these systems, we provide a vetting diagnostic diagram similar to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for each set of transits separately in the supplementary online material.</p><p>EPIC 212651213 and 212651234 show two identical sets of transits which pass our initial vetting procedure, indicating a photometric blend. EPIC 212651213 was later found to be triple-lined (see Section 5.2), while 212651234 shows no RV variation over 3 epochs. We therefore conclude that EPIC 212651213 is an eclipsing SB3 system, and the apparent transits on 212651234 are the result of a photometric blend. These two systems are therefore not included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In addition to these, we detect three transit-like events with ∼ 3 to 5% depth around EPIC 212656205, which do not have a periodic relation and have different depths. These may represent a planar hierarchical multiple stellar system, or multiple close-in giant planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Spectroscopic Reconnaissance</head><p>For most of the objects in the EPIC catalogue, spectra have not previously been obtained and only photometric information is available. A single, moderate to high resolution spectrum can be used to determine the host star's spectral type and evolutionary stage, and to check for obvious signs of binarity (double-or triple-lined spectra). For single-lined, main-sequence cool stars, additional spectra can reveal km/s radial velocity variations, indicative of a stellar or substellar companion. All our candidates which passed the vetting stage and were bright enough for efficient spectroscopic follow-up (K p ≤ 13) were observed at least once with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), at the 1.5-meter Tillinghast Telescope on Mt Hopkins, Arizona. TRES has three spectroscopic resolving power settings available: 41,000 (high), 30,000 (medium), and 20,000 (low); reconnaissance is typically conducted in the medium resolution mode. In most cases, the radial velocity (RV) precision achievable with TRES (∼ 0.1km/s or somewhat better) is not sufficient to detect the signal of a planetary-mass companion to a main sequence star, except for hot Jupiters under favourable conditions.</p><p>Where possible, the systems were observed at or near quadrature in order to maximise the chances of resolving multiple sets of stellar lines. Any systems identified as giants, double-or triplelined binaries based on the first observation were not observed any further. These are noted as "GIANT", "SB2" or "SB3" in the final column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 2 and 2</ref>. Additional spectra were taken near the opposite quadrature for some of the remaining single-lined candidates, if the planet-to-star radius ratio indicated that an orbital solution might be feasible with TRES. If the resulting radial velocity change was too large for a planetary companion, the system was classified as a single-lined stellar binary (labelled "SB1" in the tables). In the case of EPIC 212110888, which contains a hot Jupiter, further additional spectra were obtained in order to obtain a full orbital solution, which is consistent with the parameters published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lillo-Box et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hirano et al. (2016a)</ref>, with TRES spectra best fit by a 166 ± 21 RV semi-amplitude planet, with a mass of 1.18 +0.15 −0.15 M J . One system (EPIC 212808289) may host a warm Jupiter, but additional spectra, ideally with better radial velocity precision, are needed to confirm this. The inner planet in EPIC 212703473 is also a likely hot Jupiter. For EPIC 212066407 and 212803289 we list RV semi-amplitude K as determined by TRES, while for 211733267 and 211818569, with 2 epochs showing little variation we list upper limits on K. The remaining systems included in the TRES reconaissance spectroscopy program which were not found to show any evidence of binarity are simply noted as "OK" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 2 and 2</ref>. For the brightest among them, a full orbital solution might be feasible with dedicated high-precision radial velocity instrument, otherwise a statistical evaluation of the likelihood that the companion(s) is/are indeed planetary ("validation") could be performed based on all the information available to date plus high spatial resolution imaging.</p><p>Overall, the TRES reconaissance program enabled us to rule out 8 out of the 86 single-planet candidates from C5, and 2 out of the 71 from C6, as giants or spectroscopic binaries, for a final total of surviving 147 single-planet candidates across both Campaigns. The data used and produced in the course of this paper are also publicly available. The full set of k2sc-processed K2 lightcurves is available at MAST https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/, and the candidate reports used in the vetting process are provided with this paper (for surviving candidates only) as supplementary online material, and the TRES spectra of our candidates have been uploaded to the 'ExoFOP-K2' website https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a new pipeline to search for transiting planet candidates in K2 data, and reported the results of applying this pipeline to <ref type="bibr">Campaigns 5 &amp; 6</ref>, together with reconnaissance spectroscopy of the brightest of our candidates. We recover known planets and identify false positives due to stellar-mass companions. We have made our code, light curves, and diagnostic data products publicly available to facilitate confirmation and comparison, and look forward to comparing our results with future work using other methods.</p><p>We have compared our results to those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2016)</ref>, the only published catalog which covers one of the Campaigns we have analysed (C5), as well as with the unpublished candidate list produced by A. Vanderburg for both C5 and C6. In both cases, our results are generally consistent. The two candidates identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2016)</ref> and not by ourselves lie outside our chosen period search range. In several cases, we identified candidates found by Vanderburg, but discarded them at the vetting stage. On the other hand, we also failed to detect a few of his candidates altogether, and these correspond to cases where the photometric precision of our light curves is not as good as that of the k2sff light curves used by Vanderburg for the same object.</p><p>We also identify a small number of candidates, which were not reported by other teams. These are predominantly orbiting variable stars, which is consistent with our stated intention to write a pipeline that is particularly robust to astrophysical variability. More detailed comparison to other methods will become possible once more groups have published candidate lists for C5 and C6, and once we have processed earlier Campaigns, for which published candidate lists are already available.</p><p>Our results are broadly compatible with the K2SC injection tests presented in APP16, but a direct comparison is not feasible, as we have made some small but significant changes to our transit search methodology since. We will repeat the injection tests at a later date, after processing more Campaigns, to provide a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of our final pipeline. There are a number of possible modifications to our pipeline that may yield improvements in sensitivity or reliability in the future. First, as noted above, for some bright stars our light curves are not as precise as those used by some other teams. We use the PDC-MAP light curves as our starting point; these are extracted using fixed, pixelized photometric aperture masks. For some types of stars (particularly bright stars, as noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson 2014 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lund et al. 2015</ref>), these apertures may not be optimal. Better sensitivity to shallow transits might be achieved by applying k2sc to light curves extracted using more optimized apertures. Another area where we hope to make progress in the near future is in making the vetting process more automatic, perhaps by implementing and training machine learning algorithms to distinguish between planetary transits and false positives.</p><p>Beyond the discovery of individual interesting systems, a significant element of the long-term legacy of the K2 mission will be improved estimates of short-period planet incidence rates around types of stars which were relatively under-represented in the Kepler prime mission (such as M-dwarfs), as well as the ability to check for if the incidence of short-period planets depends in a measurable way on direction within the Ecliptic plane. By making all our code publicly available, we hope to facilitate the evaluation of such incidence rates, by providing all the tools needed for complete end-to-end simulations of the detection process.
