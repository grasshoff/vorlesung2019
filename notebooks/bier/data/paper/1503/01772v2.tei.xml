				<p>We investigate the possibility of constraining the sin i degeneracy of α Cen B b-with orbital period P=3.24 d; a = 0.042 AU; m sin i = 1.1 M ⊕-to estimate the true mass of the newly reported terrestrial exoplanet in the nearest stellar system to our Sun. We present detailed numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of the exoplanet in the α Cen AB binary system for a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities, and semi-major axes. The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of α Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with α Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46 •-53 • relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of 75 • in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of α Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that α Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2.7 M ⊕ , implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over 1800 exoplanets have been discovered over the past 25 years to orbit stars other than our Sun (NASA Exoplanet Archive, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akeson et al. 2013</ref>), a remarkable achievement enabled by continued advances in precise instrumentation and calibration, cadence and observational strategies, and computational analysis techniques. The discovery of a 1.13 M ⊕ sini terrestrial planet in a 3.2 day orbit around the K1V dwarf α Cen B by <ref type="bibr">Du- musque et al. 2012 (hereafter D12</ref>) is an exemplary case, with a reported velocity semi-amplitude of 51 cm/s and a reported uncertainty of only 4 cm/s. Substantial care is taken by D12 in the characterization of stellar activity that dominates the radial velocity signal, and in the understanding of instrumental systematic errors, to take advantage of binning high cadence observations. This discovery not only represents the closest known exoplanet to our Sun, but also the lowest mass planet with the smallest Doppler signature detected with the radial velocity method to date. The masses of terrestrial exoplanets in multiple exoplanet systems have also been measured around more distant stars via transit timing variations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Steffen et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Marcy et al. 2014</ref>). Much work remains to be done in confirming this detection, and in this paper we assume the detection is robust.</p><p>One of the unavoidable limitations of the radial velocity method is the sini inclination degeneracy in the mass of the exoplanet that results from observing only the velocity component of the stellar <ref type="bibr">reflex</ref>  is projected along our line of sight. It is critical to resolve this inclination degeneracy to directly constrain the mass of α Cen B b and to confirm that it is definitively a planet just slightly more massive than the Earth. The most direct approach to determine the inclination of the α Cen B b orbit with respect to our line of sight would be to confirm or rule out transits of the exoplanet in front of α Cen B. However, these observations have not yet been published, and will be challenging even from space given the required precision, the expected transit duration, and the brightness of α Cen B. Additionally, the radial velocity observations in D12 lack the precision necessary to detect the expected Rossiter-McLaughlin signature of a transiting planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Winn et al 2010)</ref>, although that does not detract from the significance of this discovery. Another common approach to constrain the orbital inclination with respect to our line of sight is to invoke dynamical stability arguments for multiple exoplanet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fang et al. 2012</ref>). However, these arguments do not apply to this system with only one identified exoplanet to date.</p><p>In this work, we invoke dynamical modeling and observational arguments to constrain the inclination of the orbit of α Cen B b. We first present our dynamical simulations and results. Next, we review constraints on the inclination of α Cen B b that can be inferred from the literature. Finally, we suggest future work to constrain the inclination and consequently the true mass of α Cen B b. α Cen is one of the most well-characterized stellar systems due to its proximity to the Sun. The exoplanet host star is part of a ∼5 Gyr triple system. The AB binary has an eccentricity of ∼0.52, a semi-major axis of ∼23.4</p><p>AU, an orbital period of 80 years, a closest approach of ∼11.2 AU, and an inclination of 79.205 ± 0.041 • on the sky so that it is viewed nearly edge-on ( <ref type="bibr">Yildez 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Morel et al. 2000</ref>, and references therein). The less massive M dwarf C component Proxima Cen is at a relatively distant ∼15,000 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wertheimer &amp; Laughlin 2006</ref>).</p><p>We carry out 567 N-body simulations of the α Cen AB system with a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities and semi-major axes for α Cen B b. The simulations are carried out in the rest frame of α Cen B. We start with the Mercury6 N-body integrator code <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chambers 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Chambers &amp; Wetherill 1998</ref>). The original Mercury6 code does not include corrections for the tidal circularization and general relativistic precession of bodies close to the host star, as is relevant for α Cen B b. Thus, we added these functions to the Mercury6 Fortran code in stubbed place-holder functions while using the bs and radau integrators.</p><p>For the tidal interactions between the host star and exoplanet, we implement Equations 10 and 11 from Rodriguez et al. (2011), taken in the limit that the planet mass is much less than the host star mass, accounting for star-planet and planet-star tides (e.g. ignoring planetplanet tides for multi-planet systems). We assume a tidal Q of 100 for α Cen B b and 10 6 for α Cen B, as is typically estimated for terrestrial planets and stars respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bodenheimer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Wu 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Penev et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Pena 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Ray et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, Lagus &amp; Anderson 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Goldreich &amp; Nicholson 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966</ref>). An error in the planet Q value will translate into an error in the tidal circularization time-scale, and we verify our implementation by recovering the tidal circularization timescale for the Jovian exoplanet HD 209458b of ∼82 Myr from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bodenheimer et al.(2003)</ref>.</p><p>For general relativistic corrections, we implement the correction based upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rodriguez et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Buetler (2005)</ref>, ignoring the precession of the central body. We verify the accuracy of our implementation with the known precession of Mercury in the Solar System. We also tried but did not use corrections from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Danby (1962)</ref> which does not include a tangential component, and one from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vitagliano (1997)</ref>.</p><p>We adopt the parameters in D12 for the period and planet mass, and AB stellar parameters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 1)</ref>. We assume the effect of Proxima Cen to be negligible as is done in other analyses of the dynamical evolution of the α Cen system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Quintana et al. 2002)</ref>. We do not increase the mass of α Cen B b for increasing inclinations w/r/t to our line of sight, except to note this would have the effect of decreasing the stability and thus our simulations represent a more conservative estimate. Using the relation R = 2R * (ρ * /ρ pl ) 1 3 , and assuming the density of the Sun and the density of Earth for α Cen B and B b respectively, we calculate a Roche radius for α Cen B of 3.15 R * (0.012 AU). We assume that the planet is tidally destroyed if the semi-major axis evolves to within this orbital distance, and we also assume that the planet does not survive a stellar collision.</p><p>For 91 simulations, we place α Cen B b at its current semi-major axis of 0.042 AU, with relative inclinations to the AB orbital plane of <ref type="bibr">0,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">60,</ref><ref type="bibr">75,</ref><ref type="bibr">90,</ref><ref type="bibr">105,</ref><ref type="bibr">120,</ref><ref type="bibr">135,</ref><ref type="bibr">150,</ref><ref type="bibr">165</ref> and 180 degrees (e.g. both prograde and retrograde orbits are considered), and eccentricities of e =0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6. Orbits that achieve e&gt;0.7 fall within the Roche radius of the α Cen B. We ran these 91 simulations four times - <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> with general relativistic precession and tidal forces, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> with general relativistic precession but no tidal force, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> with tidal force but no general relativistic precession, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> without either general relativistic precession or tidal forces, for a total of 364 simulations. Each of these 364 simulations were carried out for a duration of 2 Myr.</p><p>Next, we carry out 196 simulations by placing α Cen B b at different formation initial semi-major axes of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75 and 4 AU, with different initial inclinations of 0,15,30,45,60,75 and 90 degrees with respect to the AB orbital plane, and with initially circular orbits. All simulations ≥0.2 AU were carried out for a duration of 1 Gyr, and the simulations at 0.1 AU were halted after ∼250 Myr. Finally, we carry out 7 simulations with a fourth fictional equal mass planet in a coplanar 2:1 orbital resonance with α Cen B b with inclinations of 0, 15, 30, 45, 70 and 90 degrees with respect to the AB orbital plane. Because the simulations involve short dynamical time-scales due to the 3.2 day period of α Cen B b, we ran our simulations on the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute "bluedot" 128-core cluster, using the local disks on each node to avoid network disk bottlenecks in the computation time. Simulation orbital parameters are recorded in ASCII text to disk every 100 years, which result in ∼1 GB of data per simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">NUMERICAL SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>We present our simulation results in this section. We find that within 0.1 AU, the precession of α Cen B b's orbit due to general relativity dominates the dynamical evolution of the system, leading to stable orbits at all orbital inclinations relative to the orbital plane of the α Cen AB binary for up to 250 Myr. Without GR precession and tidal forces, the Kozai mechanism would eject planets with inclinations &gt;60 • at the current semi-major axis of α Cen B b.</p><p>For a simulated planet formation location of 0.2 AU, the Kozai mechanism significantly alters the orbit of α Cen B b for inclinations &gt;60 • , resulting in migration, ejection or collision with α Cen B, even with GR precession and tidal forces included. For simulated planet formation locations of 0.3-1.2 AU and relative inclination of &gt;60 • , the Kozai mechanism significantly alters the orbit of α Cen B b. We find the same outcome for simulated planet formation locations of 1.3-2.0 AU and relative inclinations of &gt;45 • . For simulated planets above the critical Kozai angle of 39.2 • at an initial inclination of 45 • , and interior to 2.0 AU, the Kozai mechanism excites the eccentricity of the planet orbit without inducing migration. For simulated planet formation locations of 2.25 and 2.5 AU, only planets with inclinations less than the critical Kozai angle of 39.2 • survive, and external to 2.5 AU, no simulated planets survive at any inclination for more than a few Myr.</p><p>Only three simulations resulted in a stable migration of α Cen B b to a circular orbit at a smaller semi-major axis. The first starts off at a semi-major axis 0.2 AU and a relative inclination of 75 • , and the planet migrates to 0.035 AU <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4</ref>, bottom right). For the two simulations shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 13 and 14</ref>, the planet migrates to just exterior to the Roche radius of α Cen B in ∼10 5 years. This rapid migration is potentially not survivable by the planet. The change in orbital energy is ∼80 times the binding energy of an Earth mass and density planet, and this energy must be dissipated in the planet. For the simulated planet at an initial inclination of 60 • and semi-major axis of 1.3 AU shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref>, after ∼120 Myr the Kozai mechanism does induce a steady migration inward to ∼0.5 AU. However, at that point the planet collides with α Cen B b rather than continuing its inward migration, as the eccentricity is not damped fast enough by the tidal circularization.</p><p>Finally, for the seven simulations of α Cen B b in a 2:1 orbital resonance with a second planet of comparable mass, the planets orbital inclination is stable at all inclinations. None of our simulations result in the improbable capture of α Cen B b by α Cen A. This would have been an intriguing outcome to show that it was possible for α Cen B b to conversely form around α Cen A and get captured in its present orbit by α Cen B.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Dynamical simulations for α Cen B b with an initial semi-major axis of 0.042 AU, an eccentricity of 0, and prograde inclinations of 30,45,60 and 75 degrees. Other initial inclinations are not shown for clarity. The tri-panels from top left clockwise are the simulations <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> without general relativistic precession and without tidal forces, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> without general relativistic precession and with tidal forces, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> with both tidal forces and with general relativistic precession, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> with general relativistic precession and without tidal forces, respectively. In all plots, the different colors indicate different initial inclinations, and each simulation is carried out for a duration of 2 Myr. Data points are plotted every 100 years and connected via line-segments. Any simulation that terminates prior to 2 Myr resulted in the collision of the simulated α Cen B b with α Cen B or in some cases ejection. These plots demonstrate the importance of general relativistic precession over the Kozai mechanism in the orbital evolution of α Cen B b at its present semi-major axis.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INCLINATION OF α CEN B B FROM THE LITERATURE</head><p>In this section, we discuss the results of our simulations, and combine them with existing literature to infer formation scenario dependent constraints on the presentday orbital inclination of α Cen B b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Simulation Implications</head><p>The results of our simulation suggest that we cannot place any dynamical constraints on α Cen B b at its present location, with stable orbits found at all inclinations tested. However, the current inclination of α Cen B b with respect to the AB binary orbital plane is also tied to the formation mechanism of the exoplanet. α Cen B b could have formed in situ, migrated to its current location in a disk, migrated in resonance with another planet, or migrated via the Kozai mechanism or via planet-planet scattering among other possibilities.</p><p>We first consider whether it is feasible that α Cen B b migrated via the Kozai mechanism to its present location. It is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> that a Kozai migration in this system requires a fine-tuned decreasing initial inclination as a function of increasing semi-major axis. Higher initial inclinations are dynamically unstable, and lower inclinations are stable. In our three simulations in which Kozai migration successfully completed, the final inclinations are 46 • -53 • relative to the AB orbital plane and less than the initial inclinations. Only one of our three migration simulations resulted in a circularized orbit exterior to the Roche radius of the star at a position comparable to the present semi-major axis of α Cen B b. The migration in the other two simulations is so rapid that the planet possibly does not survive the tidal dissipation of orbital energy. For the planet with an initial inclination of 60 • and semi-major axis of 1.3 AU <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 15</ref>), a steady inward Kozai migration does start. However, the process is clearly very fine-tuned to initial conditions, as the planet is destroyed halfway through the migration. Consequently, the Kozai migration is likely not a robust planet formation outcome for α Cen B b in this system from initial semi-major axes larger than ∼1 AU.</p><p>While the fragility of the Kozai migration mechanism may seen unexpected, Wu (2003) does note that Kozai migration is not a common outcome of their simulations of HD 80606 b. Further, the binary companion to HD 80606 in Wu (2003) is located at 1100 AU, compared to ∼23 AU for α Cen A. The much shorter orbital timescale for α Cen A, when compared to the tidal circularization and GR precession time-scales, may account for the fragility of the Kozai mechanism in our simulations.</p><p>Similarly, although not directly demonstrated in our simulations, planet-planet scattering events are unlikely to result in a significantly inclined orbit of α Cen B b with respect to the AB orbital plane at its present semi-major axis. If α Cen B b was initially formed at a larger semimajor axis, and it received a significant orbital inclination boost from a planet scattering event, then the Kozai oscillation from α Cen A would dominate the dynamical evolution of α Cen B b thereafter. Thus, α Cen B b would still require a fine-tuned inclination as a function of semi-major axis to avoid ejection or tidal disruption.</p><p>We next turn to consider the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ, or formation and then migration in a primordial disk with or without a hypothetical second planet in resonance. give us the strongest constraints on the range of allowed inclinations for exoplanets in the α Cen system. The salient points from this extensive list of references can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. Planet formation is more efficient around α Cen A compared to α Cen B.</p><p>2. Planet formation is less efficient for increasing misalignments, decreasing rapidly at inclinations of ∼&gt; 25 − 45 • due to the Kozai mechanism.</p><p>3. Mutual orbital inclination decreases with decreasing orbital semi-major axis.</p><p>4. Planet formation of ∼2-5 exoplanets within 2 AU is feasible.</p><p>5. Short orbital period planets within ∼0.05 AU are often discarded due to the short dynamical timescale w/r/t to numerical time-steps for computational efficiency, which is one factor that motivated our analysis.</p><p>6. Additional simulations of the α Cen system assume coplanarity in a 2D code and are thus not relevant to our discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kley &amp; Nelson 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Muller &amp; Kley 2012</ref>).</p><p>In particular, the results of oligarchic growth simulations carried to 200 Myr in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guedes et al. (2008</ref> <ref type="table">, Table  1</ref>) yield populations of planets with a standard deviation of inclinations of ∼ ±8.6 • , orbital semi-major axes of ∼0.2-1.8 AU, and eccentricities of ∼0.02-0.35 from an initial set of co-aligned planetesimals. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Quintana et al. 2002</ref> specifically investigated oligarchic growth simulations carried to 400 Myr for a planetesimal disk initially inclined w/r/t to the AB orbital plane. The outcome of the simulations for planet formation around α Cen A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figures 4, 8, 9</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Quintana et al. 2002)</ref> and α Cen B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 10</ref>) generally produce planets inside of ∼0.5 AU with inclinations of &lt; 20 • , regardless of the initial planetesimal disk inclination w/r/t to the AB binary orbital plane. For planets exterior to ∼1 AU, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Quintana et al. 2002</ref> find that the proto-planet can retain their initial mis-alignment. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zhao et al. 2012</ref> presented an analysis of the inclination evolution of an exoplanet in the presence of a primordial gas disk in a binary system and concluded that the inclination will remain small as well.</p><p>From these literature simulations, we conclude that α Cen B b could have likely formed with an initial inclination ±20 • w/r/t to the AB binary orbital plane, which    Figure 11. The same as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>, with general relativistic precession and tidal forces included in the simulations. This figure shows that α Cen B b is dynamically stable at all possible prograde and retrograde inclinations at its present location for 2 Myr, and that the general relativistic precession has the effect of slowing down the tidal circularization of the orbit of α Cen B b at this semi-major axis.  Thus, for semi-major axes inside of this value, we are extrapolating our conclusion about the evolution of protoplanets inclinations. Future detailed studies of planetesimal evolution interior to 0.36 AU are warranted.</p><p>α Cen C is currently far enough away (∼15,000 AU) from the AB binary to be ignored as having any current dynamical influence on α Cen B b. However, at some point during the early formation of the α Cen system, assuming the C component is bound, C may have had a closer approach to the AB system in a fashion sufficient to warp or disturb the circumsecondary disk or young protoplanets around the B component. This could have resulted in a misalignment, disruption, or migration of the B circumsecondary disk / protoplanets, but such a misalignment would not have been likely to survive the dynamical influence of α Cen A in our simulations and literature simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">α Cen B and its Stellar Spin Axis Alignment</head><p>We next consider if we can infer any constraints on the orbital inclination of α Cen B b from the stellar-spin axis alignment of α Cen B. The spin of α Cen A is observed to be aligned with the AB orbital plane, as inferred from projected rotational velocity combined with the observed rotation period and radius measurements obtained from asteroseismology and interferometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bazot et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Kervella 2003</ref>). However, the slower rotation period of α Cen B (∼36-42 days; <ref type="bibr">Dewarf et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Jay et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Buccino &amp; Mauas 2008</ref>, combined with the low vsini of 1.1±0.8 km/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Saar &amp; Osten 1997)</ref>, precludes a useful constraint on the inclination of the stellar spin axis from R∼10 6 spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frutiger et al. 2005</ref>). Given the observed rotation period and stellar radius, the expected rotational velocity is ∼1 km/s for α Cen B, which is consistent with the observed v sin i.</p><p>The best observational constraint on the inclination of the spin axis of α Cen B comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dumusque (2014)</ref>. Through the modeling of simultaneous radial velocity and photometric observations of α Cen B, Dumusque (2014) derives an inclination on the sky of the stellar spin axis of α Cen B of 45 +9 −19 degrees. With an unknown orientation on the sky, this corresponds to a minimum misalignment of &gt;20 • at 2-σ with the orbital plane of the AB binary.</p><p>We can make a related analysis by comparing the stellar jitter activity level of α Cen B to the Sun. D12 reported the observation of differential rotation for α Cen B from the radial velocity jitter induced by the rotational modulation of starspots. The 2008-2011 radial velocity observations in D12 yield periods of <ref type="bibr">39.76, 37.80 and 36.71 days in 2009,2010, and 2011</ref> respectively. These observations span the minimum to maximum in the ∼8.8 yr stellar activity cycle reported for α Cen B ( <ref type="bibr">DeWarf et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Ayres 2009</ref>). The rotation period evolution is consistent with α Cen B exhibiting a Sun-like "butterfly diagram" evolution of starspots from latitudes of ∼ ±30 • to the stellar equator from epochs of minimum to maximum activity. Thus, we can constrain the spin axis of α Cen B to be ∼&gt; 30 • deviant from an axis normal to the sky. Otherwise, the spots would be visible at all rotational phases in 2009, and the projected radial velocity rotational modulation would likely not be observed at the detected amplitude. This is consistent with the measurement in Dumusque (2014), but as noted in Dumusque (2014) the rotation periods reported are susceptible to error because of the harmonic fitting to the radial velocity time-series.</p><p>We can take this line of inquiry one step further. D12 derives radial velocity r.m.s. in the 2008-2011 seasons of 1.18, 1.50, 2.19 and 2.15 m/s respectively, corresponding to an increase in quadrature of ∼1.8 m/s in projected radial velocity jitter from the increased stellar activity from 2008 to 2011. The Suns expected radial velocity jitter due to rotational modulation is ∼0.4 m/s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Makarov et al. 2009</ref>). This value is a factor of ∼4 below the observed jitter for α Cen B despite the slower rotational velocity of α Cen B compared to the Sun -∼1.1 km/s for α Cen B vs. ∼1.6 km/s for the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pavlenko et al. 2012</ref>). Further, D12 measures activity levels of LogR HK = -4.99, -4.94, -4. <ref type="bibr">89 and -4.90 in 2008-2011</ref> respectively, compared to the solar mean activity level of -4.90 <ref type="bibr">(Ma- majek et al. 2008</ref>). In other words, the activity level of α Cen B is comparable to that of the Sun. If we assume α Cen B to have a spot frequency, size, and temperature contrast similar to that of the Sun, the projected radial velocity jitter of α Cen B is difficult to reconcile with the estimated jitter of the Sun without the spin axis of α Cen B being nearly perpendicular to the normal to the plane of the sky (e.g. ∼&gt; 60 • ). Instead, α Cen B must have larger spots or larger spot temperature contrast to account for the factor of ∼3 needed to reconcile the observed RV jitter and rotation period relative to the Sun, which likely can be attributed to the differences in spectral type.</p><p>Finally, if the axis of stellar spin was perpendicular to the normal to the sky, and aligned with the direction of orbital motion rather than the orbital plane, this would be consistent with the arguments presented thus far. However, a noticeable cycle in the activity of α Cen B could be apparent over the course of the 80 year orbital period of the AB binary, and this is not observed with detailed studies of activity dating back a few decades <ref type="bibr">(Flannery &amp; Ayres 1978</ref><ref type="bibr">, Dewarf et al. 2010</ref>. While this scenario is not expressly discounted, we conclude from the above arguments that the stellar spin axis of α Cen B is likely ∼&gt; 30 • deviant from the normal to the plane of the sky, with the most likely value of 45 • coming from Dumusque (2014) implying a misalignment of &gt;20 • with the AB orbital plane. However, the misalignment is likely not significantly larger -e.g. ∼&lt;45 • misalignment -lest we run into difficulty to accounting for the observed differential rotation and jitter amplitude, and lack of activity modulation over the ∼80 year binary orbit. Thus, unlike α Cen A, α Cen B is likely ∼20-45 • misaligned with the AB orbital plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Binary Stellar Spin Alignment</head><p>Barring direct observational constraints of the stellar spin alignment of α Cen B, we can invoke spin-orbit alignment measurements of young binaries of comparable separations to α Cen AB in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hale (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Howe &amp; Clarke (2009)</ref>, and at larger separations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jensen et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Monin et al. (2006)</ref>, to estimate the likely spin-orbit alignment of α Cen B. These studies identify that at separations of ∼&lt;100 AU, the spins of stars in a young binary are typically aligned to within ∼ 10 − 30 • of the orbital plane. Additionally, observations of young low mass stellar binaries indicate that circum-primary and circm-secondary disks are usually aligned with the orbit of the binary as well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Prato et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Monin et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Watson et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Wheelwright et al. 2011</ref>). These observations are supported by binary disk modeling of systems including eccentric systems like α Cen ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pichardo et al. 2005</ref>). Thus, this suggests on an ensemble basis, although it is not conclusively demonstrated through direct observation, that the spin of α Cen B is aligned with the AB orbital plane to within ∼ 30 • . Such an alignment is consistent with the observed rotational modulation and radial velocity jitter amplitude of α Cen B presented in D12 and marginally consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dumusque (2014)</ref>, given the arguments presented herein thus far.</p><p>On the other hand, however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Skemer et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jensen &amp; Akeson (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Roccatagliata et al. (2011)</ref> present evidence for mis-aligned disks in the triple system T Tauri, the binary system HK Tauri, and the binary Haro 6-10 respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jensen et al. (2004)</ref> notes that compact triples can increase the odds of spin-orbit misalignment. Thus, if Proxima Centauri was closer to α Cen AB earlier in the evolution of this triple system, it could have warped the circum-secondary disk around α Cen B into misalignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Spin-Orbit Alignment of α Cen B b</head><p>In §4.3 and 4.4, we have made the argument that the spin of α Cen B is aligned with the orbital plane of the AB binary with an angle of ∼20-45 • from direct observational constraints, and from less conclusive comparative studies of binary stars with and without circumstellar disks. We next consider if the orbital plane of the exoplanet α Cen B b is aligned with the stellar spin of α Cen B. This might be expected for an exoplanet forming in situ or migrating in an aligned proto-planetary disk. Observations of solitary transiting exoplanets in short orbital periods around single stars indeed demonstrate that the exoplanet orbit and stellar spin are well-aligned for older systems with effective temperatures &lt;6000 K and exoplanet masses &gt;0.2 M J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albrecht et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Winn et al 2010</ref>. Additionally, for multiple, compact terrestrial exoplanet systems, co-alignment within a few degrees is the norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fang et al. 2012</ref>). However, there are a number of short-period systems that are mis-aligned, and this is thought to be due to migration of the exoplanets via planet-planet scattering or the Kozai mechanism. Further, a number of studies have predicted that exoplanets in binary systems are more likely to be mis-aligned <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Parker &amp; Goodwin 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Wu et al 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Xie et al. 2011</ref>.</p><p>Tidal interactions of a close-in exoplanet, even if initially misaligned, can be re-aligned with the stellar spinaxis within the tidal circularization time-scale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Winn et al. 2010)</ref>. Given the age of α Cen of ∼5 Gyr, one could assume that the system has had adequate time to re-align α Cen B b to the stellar spin axis of α Ceb B via the action of stellar tides, regardless of any initial misalignment. However, the mass of α Cen B b is orders of magnitude smaller than 0.2 M J , and thus the re-alignment time-scale is orders of magnitude longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht et al. 2012</ref>). It is likely that α Cen B b is not massive enough to excite stellar tides to induce the re-alignment on a timescale that is shorter than the age of the α Cen system. Indeed, HAT-P-11 b is one of the lowest mass exoplanets with a measured Rossiter-McLaughlin effect at ∼26 M ⊕ , and it is an outlier that is misaligned with the stellar spin axis of its host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Winn et al. 2010</ref>). More observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for single, short-period terrestrial mass planets are needed to determine if orbital re-alignment is likely or rare. Thus, we cannot conclusively argue that an initially mis-aligned α Cen B b was re-aligned with its host stellar spin axis. However, we can assert that if the initial planet-forming disk around α Cen B was aligned with the spin axis of α Cen B and not the AB orbital plane, and if α Cen B b did not undergo Kozai migration, then α Cen B b will have likely retained that primordial spin-orbit alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fang et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The constraints that we can place on the inclination of α Cen B b and consequently its true mass are reliant on considerations of the formation mechanism of the planet. Without any consideration of the planet formation mechanism, our dynamical simulations show that the inclination of α Cen B b in its present location and consequently its true mass are unconstrained. However, by considering possible formation scenarios, we can place a useful constraint on the inclination of the planet:</p><p>1. If the planet migrated via the Kozai mechanism or planet-planet scattering to its present location, even if this is an unlikely outcome from our simulations, then the current inclination of α Cen B b is likely &lt;55 • mis-aligned with the AB orbital plane, corresponding to an angle of &lt;65 • with respect to our line of sight. While this may seem like a very weak constraint, this corresponds to an upper mass limit of &lt;2.7 M ⊕ (&lt;3.3 M ⊕ taking the 3-σ upper limit to the msini from D12), with a transit probability of 15%.</p><p>2. If instead α Cen B b formed in situ, or migrated in a proto-planetary disk with or without an additional planet in orbital resonance, then previous literature dynamical simulations suggest that α Cen B b is &lt;20 • mis-aligned with the AB orbital plane, corresponding to an angle of &lt;30 • with respect to our line of site, and a mass of &lt;1.3 M ⊕ (&lt;1.6 M ⊕ taking the 3-σ upper limit to the msini) and a transit probability of 30%.</p><p>3. Finally, if we consider the recent result in <ref type="bibr">Du- musque et al. (2014)</ref> and our interpretation that α Cen B is misaligned with the AB orbital plane by ∼20-45 • , and if we instead assume that the orbit of α Cen B b is aligned with the spin axis of α Cen B from an initial primordial disk alignment with the spin of α Cen B, then we can estimate the inclination of α Cen B b to also be ∼10-55 • inclined with respect to our line of site, with a negligible transit probability and a mass of 1.14-2.7 M ⊕ .</p><p>Thus, independent of the formation scenario, we can conclude that α Cen B b likely possesses a mass &lt;2.7 M ⊕ orbiting a star in the nearest stellar system to the Sun (&lt;3.3 M ⊕ taking the 3-σ upper limit to the msini from D12). This puts the planet in the range of masses expected for terrestrial planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Marcy et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In addition to confirming the terrestrial nature of α Cen B b, future determination of the composition and bulk density of α Cen B b will help discern amongst the formation mechanisms presented in this paper. Unfortunately, given the recently reported stellar spin-orbit misalignment of the α Cen B with the AB orbital plane, the transit probability is possibly low and requires a space-based photometer. Regardless, transits are still worth excluding. Future direct imaging surveys will be challenged by the maximum projected separation of ∼33 milli-arcseconds of α Cen B b and &lt;1 milli-arcseconds astrometric stellar reflex motion of α Cen B, and the light from α Cen A. Time-resolved interferometric measurements of the spot rotation of α Cen B b could help confirm the reported stellar spin angle of α Cen B.</p><p>Our conclusion relies on the assumption that the radial velocity detection of α Cen B b is secure. Future observational radial velocity constraints on the msini are warranted to confirm the planet detection. Finally, our analysis may be applicable to the planets found in the binary systems such as HD 41004, γ Ceph, and Gliese 86 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Muller &amp; Kley 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Akeson et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>We thank the anonymous referee for a thoughtful review that improved the clarity and presentation of this manuscript.
