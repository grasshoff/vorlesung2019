<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Executive Summary</head><p>In this white paper report, we present an assessment of the current capabilities and the future potential of the precise radial velocity (PRV) method to advance the NASA goal to "search for planetary bodies and Earth-like planets in orbit around other stars." (U.S. National Space Policy, <ref type="bibr">June 28, 2010)</ref>. PRVs complement other exoplanet detection methods, for example offering a direct path to obtaining the bulk density and thus the structure and composition of transiting exoplanets.</p><p>PRVs will provide essential NASA mission support for: "The first task on the ground is to improve the precision radial velocity method by which the majority of the close to 500 known exoplanets have been discovered. … Using existing large ground-based or new dedicated mid-size ground-based telescopes equipped with a new generation of high-resolution spectrometers in the optical and near-infrared, a velocity goal of 10 to 20 centimeters per second is realistic." -page 7-8, Astro 2010 Decadal Survey "New Worlds, New Horizons"</p><p>The demands on telescope time for the above mission support, especially for systems of small planets, will exceed the number of nights available using instruments now in operation by a factor of at least several for TESS alone. Pushing down towards true Earth twins will require more photons (i.e. larger telescopes), more stable spectrographs than are currently available, better calibration, and better correction for stellar jitter.</p><p>We outline four hypothetical situations for PRV work necessary to meet NASA mission exoplanet science objectives:</p><p>1) Access to full-time long-term use of a 4-m class telescope equipped with a HARPS-like instrument dedicated to PRV observations, to supplement the 100 nights per year projected to be available to the TESS mission, and to support a long-term survey needed to identify optimum targets for an AFTA-type direct imaging mission.</p><p>2) Access to long-term use of a 10-m class telescope with a next generation spectrograph stable at the level of 5 cm/s, at the level of nominally 20% of the time, to push towards the confirmation and characterization of true Earth twins. This will also require significant advances in the ability to correct for stellar jitter.</p><p>3) Access to an IR spectrograph or second arm of a visible spectrograph on a 4-m class telescope equipped with a CARMENES-like instrument stable at the level of &lt;1 m/s dedicated to PRV observations, to be available to the TESS mission, to assess the removal of wavelengthdependent stellar-jitter, and to survey nearby M dwarfs for habitable planets.</p><p>4) A NIR or visible diffraction-limited spectrograph for a large-aperture telescope with extreme AO to achieve unprecedented precision and compete with ESPRESSO.</p><p>These scenarios are all mid-scale projects that exceed the cost of a NASA individual investigator grant. Approximately, these efforts will each cost ~$2-5M/yr over a decade split between instrument development and operations, will require the procurement of available telescope resources, and will require significant investment in technology development and multi-faceted data analysis. With such efforts, the potential to achieve the Decadal Survey PRV prediction remains.</p><p>In Section 3 we present the current and future programmatic relevance of the radial-velocity (RV) method for current and planned NASA missions, including TESS and JWST. In Section 4 we present the analysis of potential facilities to meet NASA mission science objectives. In Section 5, we present constraining astrophysical sources of RV noise, or "jitter," and our current understanding thereof. In Section 6, we present areas of technology development for advances in instrumental precision and data analysis. In Section 7, we present a compilation of United States based community input on the PRV method from the past decade, and conclude with definitions, acknowledgments, and references cited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">NASA Programmatic Considerations</head><p>Ground-based PRV capabilities play a critical role in support of NASA exoplanet missions, past, present, and future. We live in a golden age for the study of exoplanets, largely due to progress enabled by the discovery of transiting exoplanets. PRV surveys identified hot Jupiters that were subsequently shown to transit and led to pioneering studies of exoplanet atmospheres with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Charbonneau et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Deming et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">, Knutson et al. 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Kepler and K2</head><p>More recently, NASA's Kepler mission has shown that most stars host planets smaller than Neptune (4 Earth radii), often in compact systems with coplanar orbits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Latham et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Howard et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). PRVs are playing an essential role in confirming and characterizing the bulk properties of the most accessible Kepler planet candidates by providing orbital solutions and mass determinations to complement the sizes measured by Kepler, thus leading to the characterization of a handful of rocky planets with compact atmospheres.</p><p>Determining the masses for small Kepler planet candidates with sufficient accuracy to show that they are rocky has been a severe challenge to the best PRV instruments in the world. For example, more than 100 nights with HIRES on Keck 1 were dedicated to following up 22 stars hosting 49 Kepler planet candidates, based on the prediction that orbital motion could be detected for a planet with an Earth-like density. This effort ( <ref type="bibr">Marcy et al. 2013</ref>) yielded 28 mass determinations with accuracies between 1 and 3 sigma -good enough to confirm the planetary nature of the candidate, but not good enough to characterize the planet as rocky with a compact atmosphere.</p><p>Even before the launch of Kepler it was realized that the limited access to state-of-the-art PRV follow up would be a bottleneck to the confirmation and characterization of small Kepler planets. An international collaboration was established to build a northern copy of the highly successful HARPS on the 3.6-m telescope at the European Southern Observatory, with the primary goal of following up rocky planet candidates identified by Kepler. HARPS-N began science operations on the 3.6-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma in August 2012. There are now five confirmed rocky planets with mass determinations better than 5 sigma and with internal structure and composition remarkably similar to Earth and Venus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>):</p><p>CoRoT-7b from the original HARPS, Kepler-36b from a photo-dynamical model, Kepler-10b and 93b from HARPS-N, and Kepler-78b ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>): The mass-radius diagram for planets smaller than 2.7R Earth with masses measured to better than 20% precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>). The shaded gray region in the lower right indicates planets with iron content exceeding the maximum value predicted from models of collisional stripping <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Marcus et al. 2010</ref>). The solid lines are theoretical mass-radius curves <ref type="bibr">(Zeng &amp; Sasselov 2013)</ref> for planets with compositions of 100% H 2 O (blue), 25% MgSiO 3 -75% H2O (purple), 50% MgSiO 3 -50% H2O (green), 100% MgSiO 3 (black), 50% Fe -50% MgSiO 3 (red), and 100% Fe (orange). The best-fit relation based on the <ref type="bibr">Zeng &amp; Sasselov (2013)</ref> models is the dashed light blue line representing an Earth-like composition (modeled as 17% iron and 83% magnesium silicate using a fully-differentiated, two-component model). The shaded region surrounding the line indicates the 2% dispersion in radius expected from variation in Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Grasset et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>With 77 observations from HIRES and 109 from HARPS-N, Kepler-78-b has the best mass determination for an Earth-sized rocky exoplanet to date, with a 17% mass uncertainty ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Pepe et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">, Howard et al. 2013</ref>). At V=12 mag, Kepler-78 represents a bright Kepler target. The semi-amplitude of its orbital motion, 2 m/s, is large enough to be determined with HIRES and HARPS-N because of the very short period, 8.5 hours. Determining the mass of a true Earth twin from the reflex motion of 10 cm/s due to a one-year orbit around a star like the Sun for a typical Kepler candidate at V=14 mag is hopelessly beyond the reach of present PRV instruments.</p><p>NASA's K2 mission, a two-reaction-wheel reincarnation of Kepler, has embarked on a two-year survey of 10 fields along the ecliptic. K2 is expected to provide a significant number of additional short-period rocky planet candidates suitable for follow up with existing PRV facilities in both the north and south. It remains to be seen whether the photometric precision achieved by K2 together with the limit of 3 months per campaign field will allow detection of interesting small planets at the same rate as the baseline Kepler mission, but several initial discoveries have been reported ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Crossfield et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">TESS and JWST</head><p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), scheduled for launch in 2017, has a primary ground-based follow-up observation goal of measuring masses for at least 50 transiting planets smaller than 4 Earth radii. Nearby transiting systems discovered by TESS will provide prime targets for spectroscopic studies of exoplanet atmospheres with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and for follow-up observations by other missions under development, such as CHEOPS and PLATO.</p><p>Selection of the very best transiting-system targets for JWST and interpretation of JWST spectroscopy of a planetary atmosphere will require knowledge of the structure and composition of the planet's interior. This is one of the drivers for measuring masses for small TESS planets that are the most promising targets for JWST. The transiting systems identified by TESS will typically be 30 to 100 times brighter than the Kepler candidates. This will bring many more small planets within the reach of the PRV facilities that will be available for following up TESS candidates. The TESS Science Office is responsible for organizing the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP). Many of the top PRV teams are already on board, representing more than 4000 hours of telescope time for PRV follow up during the baseline mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Ricker et al. 2014</ref>). While this may be sufficient to secure the 50 promised mass determinations, it will leave many interesting targets untouched for future follow up by the community</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Future space-based direct imaging missions</head><p>The exoplanet science for future NASA space-based direct-imaging missions -e.g. AFTA-WFIRST with a coronagraph or starshade, a Probe class mission, or a &gt;8 meter flagship mission -falls into two possible categories:</p><p>1) Spectroscopy and sini determinations for known RV planets; and 2) Searches for planets beyond RV limits and their spectral characterization.</p><p>Mission design requirements for each category necessitate an informed assessment of what we know already about exoplanet populations. In particular, what is the planet population around accessible direct imaging targets that RV currently has and has not detected? Additionally, what would the detected and undetected planet populations look like in the 2020s, when such a direct imaging mission may launch?</p><p>The goal of answering these questions is to ascertain how much "blind searching" the direct imaging space missions should be doing. If direct imaging target stars are being observed well with the RV method, then not much direct imaging mission time is needed doing blind searches for new exoplanets. However, if the RV survey completeness leave lots of room for new direct imaging discoveries, then substantial direct imaging mission time should be dedicated to such searches. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the RV survey completeness and sensitivity is crucial to future direct imaging mission science. The Exo-C interim report (http://exep.jpl.nasa.gov/stdt/Exo-C_InterimReport.pdf) recommended a detailed review of existing RV data for our best imaging search targets. AFTA-Starshade arrived at the preliminary conclusion that there is a need for a long-term decade-long RV survey for AFTA direct imaging targets, not only for identifying targets, but also for RV limit curves for targets which have been ruled out to have Jovian companions from RV surveys. There are currently less than a half-dozen known exoplanets, all gas giants, suitable for direct imaging (SAG 9 report).</p><p>Little research has been done to date exploring the overlap between direct imaging targets and RV surveys identifying long-term trends. The PRV method has demonstrated the ability to identify stellar and brown dwarf direct-imaging targets based on long-term RV trends around nearby bright stars. For example, the TRENDS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Crepp et al. ,2012</ref>) has taken the long-term RV variations from the California Planet Search and followed them up with high contrast imaging to look for low mass companions at large separations. Can this approach be extended to lower mass exoplanets at larger orbital separations?</p><p>Recognizing this knowledge gap, the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program contracted with Andrew Howard to compare the direct imaging target lists for Exo-C, Exo-S and AFTA studies with RV survey results from the California Planet Search and eta Earth samples observed with the Hamilton Echelle and HIRES high-resolution spectrographs at the Lick and Keck Observatories, respectively. We briefly summarize the results of the report from <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Howard and Fulton (2014)</ref>. The Lick and Keck RV surveys targeted mostly main sequence dwarfs in a sample of FGK spectral types and main sequence stars from the Bright Star Catalog and Gliese-Jahreiss catalog, in addition to other sources. These surveys did not include earlier spectral-type stars, evolved stars, or young stars, in some cases due to lack of absorption lines for RV information content, and in other cases because of RV jitter due to stellar activity and the rotational modulation of starspots, and to pulsations. Southern stars with declinations below -30 o , representing a quarter of the sky, were not targeted from the Lick and Keck Observatories. Many suitable southern targets have been observed with CORALIE (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Pepe et al. 2002)</ref> and the original HARPS (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Pepe et al. 2011</ref>), but were not addressed in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Howard and Fulton (2014)</ref> report.</p><p>Howard &amp; Fulton (2014) identified 76 targets from the Lick and Keck RV surveys that overlap with the 312 stars in the Exo-C, Exo-S and AFTA studies target lists <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>). In other words, approximately 75% of entries in direct-imaging target lists for proposed future NASA missions have not been observed with the Lick and Keck RV surveys. One-third of the direct-imaging targets that have not been observed with Lick and Keck can be attributed to being too far South on the sky (below -30 o ). The remaining two-thirds are either earlier-type stars or have active photospheres. Since direct-imaging exoplanet searches prefer brighter and younger stars, the direct-imaging target lists are biased towards earlier-type stars than targeted by RV surveys.  For the 76 RV targets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Howard &amp; Fulton (2014)</ref> that overlap with direct-imaging targets, the median RV completeness limit is ~100 M Earth (~1/3 M Jupiter ) at 1 AU, decreasing at larger semimajor axes to ~1000 M Earth (~3 M Jupiter ) at ~8 AU, with a large variation of approximately one order of magnitude for individual stars ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). To summarize, current RV surveys are limited to the detection of Jovian-mass planets and sub-stellar companions at orbital separations amenable to direct imaging, for the targets that do overlap (~25%) between RV and directimaging samples. We compare these sensitivities to the expected sensitivities for an AFTA Coronagraph and starshade direct imaging mission. The period range of interest for a direct imaging mission is ~200 to 7000 days; planets with shorter periods will not be resolved from the star with current high-contrast imaging technology, whereas planets with longer periods will be too faint to detect with a 1-1.5 meter diameter telescope. Early estimates indicate that such a direct imaging mission should be sensitive to 2 R Earth objects out to 1.5 AU, 4 R Earth objects out to 3 AU, Saturnsized objects to 7 AU, and Jupiter-sized objects out to 9 AU (Exo-C Interim Report).</p><p>We conclude that there is a clear phase space of exoplanets that could be discovered or characterized by direct imaging that have not been adequately probed by RV surveys to date. These include sub-Jovian planet masses around FGK stars, particularly for sub-Saturn planets between 1 and 7 AU, and exoplanets around A and early F stars in general. A task of this report is thus to investigate what might be feasible with the PRV method over the coming decade to detect sub-Saturn mass planets in this semi-major axis regime.</p><p>To extend these RV searches towards lower masses and longer orbital periods more suitable for direct-imaging mission goals (e.g. a Saturn at 5 AU), a NASA coordinated and sustained long-term (&gt;10 yr) RV monitoring campaign of nearby stars is required. Indeed, it is not too early to get started on a PRV survey of potential targets for an eventual flagship direct-imaging mission, because the best targets will inevitably need to be at wider separations in orbits with longer periods around their host stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis: Ground-Based Telescope Resources Necessary to meet NASA objectives</head><p>In this section, we analyze four hypothetical situations for PRV work necessary to meet NASA mission exoplanet science objectives, in particular follow-up of transit candidates from TESS and Kepler/K2, and precursor searches of direct imaging targets for a future direct imaging mission:</p><p>1) Access to full-time long-term use of a 4-m class telescope equipped with a HARPS-like instrument dedicated to PRV observations, to supplement the 100 nights per year projected to be available to the TESS mission, and to support a long-term survey needed to identify optimum targets for an AFTA-type direct imaging mission (e.g. Exo-C).</p><p>2) Access to long-term use of a 10-m class telescope with a next generation spectrograph stable at the level of 5 cm/s, at the level of nominally 20% of the time, to push towards the confirmation and characterization of true Earth twins. This will also require significant advances in the ability to correct for stellar jitter.</p><p>3) Access to an IR spectrograph or second arm of a visible spectrograph on a 4-m class telescope equipped with a CARMENES-like instrument stable at the level of &lt;1 m/s dedicated to PRV observations, to be available to the TESS mission, to assess the removal of wavelengthdependent stellar-jitter, and to survey nearby M dwarfs for habitable planets.</p><p>4) Access to a NIR or visible diffraction-limited spectrograph for a large-aperture telescope with extreme AO to achieve unprecedented precision and compete with ESPRESSO.</p><p>All four scenarios we investigate are mid-scale projects that exceed the cost of a NASA individual investigator grant. Approximately, these efforts will cost ~$2-5M/yr each over a decade split between instrument development and operations, will require the procurement of available telescope resources, and will require significant investment in technology development and multi-faceted data analysis. With such efforts, the potential to achieve the Decadal Survey PRV prediction remains.</p><p>Dedicated facilities with stable instrumentation focused on a small number of targets with high cadence over a long time baseline is necessary to achieve NASA objectives, particularly on &gt;4-meter class telescopes in the near-term (~20-50 cm/s), and &gt;8 m class telescopes in the medium term (~10-20 cm/s) and &gt;25 m telescopes in the long term (&lt; 10 cm/s). These resources are required for primarily two reasons: the cadence necessary to model the effects of stellar jitter, and collecting a sufficient number of photons on nearby stars. The present state of the art for velocity stability is illustrated by the two HARPS spectrographs, which currently achieve a long-term RV zero point precision of ~70-80 cm/s.</p><p>Many of the advances in PRVs are primarily being led by European efforts (e.g. the original HARPS, and the performance expected for ESPRESSO, CARMENES, and CODEX). At over $10M apiece, next-generation PRV spectrographs have outgrown the PI-based grant model of building an instrument at a single or small number of institutions for less than $5M. This can be addressed through programmatic means, both in terms of coordination, funding for technology development and the construction of major new PRV facilities, and the acquisition of suitable telescope resources.</p><p>In Section 4.1, we present a brief proposed standardization of the definition of Doppler Precision, which is a term that can often be taken to mean different things by the community. In Section 4.2, we quantify the expected survey capabilities of the first two spectrometer scenarios listed above in support of NASA mission objectives. In Sections 4.3 and 4.4, we compare the benefit of the latter two spectrometer scenarios listed above by quantifying the expected wavelength-dependent performance of visible and near-infrared PRV spectrometers, modeling both the photon noise and stellar jitter as a function of wavelength and stellar effective temperature, and the primary benefits of diffraction-limited spectrometers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Definition of Doppler Precision</head><p>The community would benefit from a standardized definition of what is meant by precision in order to make accurate comparisons between instruments and Doppler analysis techniques. Ideally, future literature should include estimates of all three of these metrics.</p><p>• The single measurement precision is a function of SNR, analysis technique and spectral resolution. This metric reflects the floor of the Doppler precision for a given instrument and characterizes the instrumental precision. This is the only metric that can be accurately simulated.</p><p>• The short term RMS over a week or two of consecutive observations is a useful metric for characterizing instrumental precision because this timescale is long enough to capture instrument and analysis errors, but short compared to changes in fractional spot coverage or stellar magnetic fields for chromospherically inactive stars. Unfortunately, this metric cannot be simulated -it can only reflect the performance of an instrument after it is commissioned.</p><p>• The long term RMS (over a season or years) includes velocities from the stellar atmosphere as well as center of mass velocities from the star. This is the useable Doppler precision that limits what exoplanet semi-amplitudes a particular instrument can detect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">TESS and Exo-C Target Samples</head><p>We make use of the Exo-C target sample, and a simulated TESS candidate sample, to quantify the utility of NASA access to a PRV spectrometer, for either a precursor survey for Exo-C, or for dedicated follow-up observations of candidates for TESS. We show the apparent magnitude distribution of both samples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. We restrict the Exo-C target sample to 172 stars with spectral types later than ~A4 (B-V&gt;0.1) and a declination &gt;-30 degrees. For TESS, we simulate a volume-scaled sample, with the brightest candidate at V=7.0, and 62 targets with V&lt;10.0. This is consistent with the more rigorous simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Winn (2014)</ref>. There is no overlap in apparent magnitude between the two target lists. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">K Semi-amplitude Sensitivity</head><p>From Section 3.3, the Exo-C interim report (http://exep.jpl.nasa.gov/stdt/ExoC_InterimReport.pdf) estimates a direct imaging detection sensitivity to approximately Saturnsized objects out to ~7 AU. The RV semi-amplitude of a Saturn at the location of Jupiter in the Solar System is K=3.8 m/s. From the TESS Science Memo (Winn 2014), the expected RV semi-amplitudes of TESS candidate exoplanets range from ~1-4 m/s, with a typical value of 3 m/s. Consequently, we are interested in a survey that is able to reliably detect K=3 m/s and smaller signals. These are much larger signals than the K=9 cm/s RV semi-amplitude of an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU, but looking towards the future we extend our survey simulations down towards that detection threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Choice of Telescope Aperture</head><p>For our analysis, we assume either dedicated (e.g. 100% time allocation) access to a 4-meter class telescope, or partial (e.g. 20% time allocation) access to a 10-meter class telescope. In the 4-m class, NASA already operates the IRTF 3-m, and NSF operates the KPNO 4-m and WIYN 3.6-m telescopes. In the 10-m class, NASA is already a 1/6th partner in the Keck I and II telescopes, and is a partner in the LBT. The NSF operates the Gemini N&amp;S telescopes. Consequently, there are existing NASA and NSF telescope facilities that match our assumed telescope apertures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Survey Simulation Parameters</head><p>For each target in each survey, we assume that we need a minimum of 10 observations to reliably detect an exoplanet orbiting companion. In Section 4.2.6 we consider the viability of this assumption. For each observation, we assume a telescope slew and target acquisition "overhead" time of 3 minutes (time to move the telescope to align the target with the spectrometer slit and start telescope guiding). We assume a minimum integration time per target per epoch of 5 minutes to average over stellar RV variability from p-mode oscillations (Section 5.2.1.1). We consider two survey options for both the Exo-C and TESS target lists:</p><p>1) A survey with a fixed measurement precision, which will result in longer integration times for fainter targets. In this survey, we assume the spectrometer instrument stability precision is smaller than the achievable precision from the photon and detector noise, and thus can be ignored. The photon noise is dependent on the brightness of the target star.</p><p>2) A survey with a fixed integration time of 3600 seconds per target per epoch, which will result in an apparent magnitude dependent single measurement precision. In this survey simulation, we include a systematic noise floor from instrument stability.</p><p>In both survey simulations, we do not include the impact of stellar jitter, which we will address in Sections 4.3 and 5.2. We also don't address how long the surveys have to last in order to cover the range of periods we are interested in. For Exo-C, the orbital periods will span on the order of a decade. Consequently, these simulations represent minimum survey durations in the idealized limit. Actual survey times will be longer. In the first survey option, there are cases where it takes an ideal integration time of t &gt; 1 hour to reach a specified single measurement precision for N desired observations at that precision. In those cases, we assume that the practical integration time upper limit will be 1 hour (t p = 1 hr), and that the actual number of observations N p will increase such that N p t p = N t. In other words, observations at lower precision are co-added to achieve the desired number of observations at the specified precision.</p><p>For the spectrometer, we assume an end-to-end throughput, including telescope mirrors, spectrograph optics, and detector quantum efficiency, of 10%. We assume a spectrograph resolution of R = 100,000, with a Nyquist pixel sampling in the spectral dimension and 4 pixels in the spatial direction, with no dark current, a detector read noise of 5 electrons per pixel, and a detector gain of 4. Using the standard CCD equation, we compute the SNR of an observation from the detector noise and photon noise as a function of the apparent V-band magnitude, telescope aperture, spectrograph parameters and exposure time t <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figures 5-8</ref>). We assume that an SNR per resolution element of 600 is required to reach a 10 cm/s photon noise precision, as is estimated for ESPRESSO's spectral grasp of 350-730 nm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Pepe et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Finally, for the execution of survey, we assume eight hours of observation per night on average.</p><p>We assume a loss of 50% of the survey time due to poor weather conditions and other hardware and software failure modes. We do not include any survey time for dedicated followup of specific targets (see Section 4.2.5).    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Is a minimum of 10 observations per target realistic?</head><p>With the radial velocity method, the minimum number of observations needed to detect an exoplanet with a stellar reflex motion semi-amplitude K and a single measurement precision of σ is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">í µí± !"# = 2 í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí¼ í µí°¾ !</formula><p>where the SNR is the detection confidence (e.g. SNR=10 for a 10-sigma detection; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Gaudi &amp; Winn 2007)</ref>. With a known orbit, such as for the confirmation of a TESS transiting planet candidate, the factor of 2 drops out (Winn 2014).</p><p>We investigate whether this theoretical limit is justified. We review the discovery paper literature listed at the NASA Exoplanet Archive for 120 radial-velocity discovered exoplanets orbiting a variety of host star spectral types and evolutionary states ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akeson et al. 2013</ref>). This sample represents ~20% of the exoplanets discovered with the radial velocity method to date, and excludes such systems that are radial velocity confirmation of known transiting planets.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, we plot K/σ as a function of the number of observations reported in the discovery papers. We note that σ is not the reported uncertainty on the semi-amplitude of the stellar reflex motion, but rather the typical single measurement uncertainty. In the absence of an explicitly documented typical single measurement uncertainty in the discovery paper, we also use the reported rms of the (O-C) residuals when available. We also keep track of whether a discovery paper announces the discovery of a single exoplanet, two exoplanets, or more than two exoplanets, or additional exoplanets in a system with a previously identified exoplanet or exoplanets. In the case of exoplanets in a system discovered non-simultaneously (e.g. in a series of papers with sequentially more observations), we categorize the first exoplanet discovery paper as a single exoplanet system (or two if the first paper announce two exoplanets, etc.), and the additional exoplanets reported in subsequent discovery papers are categorized as multiple exoplanet systems. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. We plot the number of observations reported in radial velocity discovery papers, compared to the expected theoretical limits for a given K/σ , where σ is not the reported uncertainty on the semi-amplitude of the stellar reflex motion, but rather the typical single measurement uncertainty. Brown squares: literature-reported K/σ values as a function of the number of observations reported in radial velocity discovery papers for single-exoplanet systems; black diamonds: two planet systems; blue triangles: three or more planet systems. The blue solid diagonal line represents the theoretical detection limit in K/σ as a function of the number of observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Gaudi &amp; Winn 2007)</ref>, and the orange, red and green solid diagonal lines are two, four and ten times the theoretical minimum number of observations. The red, black and blue vertical dashed lines correspond to 30,70, and 120 observations. From <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, there are several notable trends from discovery paper literature:</p><p>1) 3 or more exoplanet systems require a minimum of ~100 epochs; 2) 2 exoplanet systems require a minimum of ~30 epochs in some high SNR cases, and more than ~70 epochs otherwise.</p><p>3) For less than ~70 observations, discovery papers for any number of planets typically report &gt;2-4 times the theoretical minimum number of observations necessary. 4) For greater than ~70 observations, radial velocity exoplanet discoveries are pushing towards the theoretical limit for the minimum number of observations, independent of the number of planets.</p><p>Consequently, our survey simulations represent a minimum survey duration. Detailed follow-up of exoplanet system candidates will require up to an additional 70-100 epochs or more per candidate for confirmation, more than ten times the minimum assumed for our survey. Given the known frequency of exoplanets from Kepler, we may expect more than 10% of survey targets will require additional follow-up. Thus, to include survey time for candidate follow-up, particularly multi-planet systems and systems at low K/σ &lt; 2, actual survey durations will approximately double what is simulated here to be consistent with the discovery standards as reported in the current exoplanet literature. Furthermore, as noted above, we have not yet integrated into this assessment the contribution to the radial velocity precision from stellar jitter, which we will address in Sections 4.3 and 5.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6.1.">Fixed Integration Time Surveys</head><p>For the surveys with a fixed integration time of 3600 sec, we calculate that it will take 168 nights (0.46 years) to observe 62 TESS targets, and 466 nights (1.28 years) to observe 172 Exo-C targets with the number of observations per target N=10, and overhead for bad weather. For a dedicated telescope access, this is a relatively short survey. For a telescope with ~20% of the year dedicated to the survey, these surveys would take 2.3 and 6.4 years for TESS and Exo-C respectively. As mentioned in 4.2.5, these represent minimum survey durations, since we do not account for stellar jitter and follow-up observations. Also, we have not taken into account the exoplanet orbital periods of interest, which can exceed one decade for Exo-C targets.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 10 and 11</ref>, we present the achievable measurement precision as a function of apparent V magnitude and instrument noise floor for 4 and 10-m telescopes and spectrograph parameters as described in the preceding sections. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12 and 13</ref>, we translate this into the minimum semi-amplitude K detection limit.    From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12 and 13</ref>, we draw the following conclusions: 1) For targets brighter than V~8, which encompasses nearly all of the Exo-C sample, PRVs are firmly in the systematic instrumental noise regime for both 4-m and 10-m telescopes with integration times of one hour, down to instrumental stability noise of less than ~10 cm/s. 2) TESS targets are primarily photon-noise limited on a 4-m telescope for V&gt;11, and photon-noise limited on a 10-m telescope for V&gt;13, with instrumental noise an increasingly important factor for brighter TESS candidates, particularly when the instrumental noise is greater than ~ 50 cm/s. 3) With a spectrometer that delivers better than 10 cm/s instrumental stability, Exo-C targets could readily be surveyed for Earth-mass companions (e.g. K~10-20 cm/s), with better survey performance on a 10-m aperture but still feasible on a 4-m telescope. 4) Saturn-mass exoplanets at 5 AU (e.g. K=3 m/s) could be surveyed down to V~10 on a 4-m telescope, and V~12 on a 10-m telescope, with a spectrometer instrumental stability of ~60 cm/s or better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6.2">Fixed Measurement Precision Survey</head><p>For the surveys with a fixed target measurement precision, we calculate the exposure times needed to reach the specified precision for a given apparent magnitude bin (Section 4.2.4). We use bins of 0.1 magnitudes. If the exposure time is less than 5 minutes, we set it equal to five minutes. Then we add an overhead time of 3 minutes for target acquisition. For each apparent magnitude bin, we calculate the number of observations needed to reach a specified semiamplitude sensitivity, with a minimum of 10 epochs, as in Section 4.2.4. We then multiply the on-target time by the number of observations. Then we multiply this total integration time by the number of TESS or Exo-C targets in that apparent magnitude bin. We sum up this quantity, and multiply by the time lost due to weather and daytime to arrive at the minimum survey duration times. We present in Figures 14-25 the simulated minimum survey duration times for the TESS and Exo-C target samples, and for 4-m and 10-m telescopes.            From these simulation results in Figures 14-25, we draw the following conclusions:</p><p>1) A spectrometer capable of 5 cm/s single measurement precision (e.g., an instrumental noise floor of ~1-2 cm/s) can survey 172 Exo-C targets for Earth-mass planets in 1 AU orbits (K~10 cm/s) with a minimum survey duration of ~15 years with 20% time allocation on a 10-m class telescope. 2) A survey of exoplanets down to the mass of Neptune at 5 AU (K~50 m/s) can be accomplished for Exo-C targets with a cumulative telescope time of ~1 year on either a 4-m at 100% time allocation or a 10-m telescope at ~20% time allocation. However, since the orbital period of such an exoplanet at 5 AU would be ~12 years, the survey duration would be necessarily longer, and could be designed to go down to smaller semi-amplitude sensitivity as a result (e.g. K=10-20 cm/s in bullet points #1 above). 3) A survey of 62 TESS targets down to K~50 cm/s would also take ~12 years. 4) It is prohibitive to survey 62 TESS targets for Earth-mass planets at 1 AU (K~10 cm/s), with a minimum survey duration of &gt;300 years on a 10-m class telescope with 20% time allocation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.7">Summary Conclusions</head><p>To summarize, both of the first two spectrometer options presented at the beginning of Section 4 offer the capability for the identification of Neptune-mass and larger exoplanets for Exo-C direct imaging:</p><p>1) A ~50 cm/s instrument stability spectrograph on a 4-m telescope with 100% time allocation, and 2) A ~5 cm/s instrument stability spectrograph on a 10-m telescope with ~20% time allocation</p><p>Additionally, a ~5 cm/s instrument capability on a 10-m class telescope could enable the detection of Earth analogs for a future flagship direct imaging mission. Minimum survey durations of ~15 years will be necessary, requiring a long-term survey commitment and investment for both the survey and follow-up of candidate exoplanets. For option #1, the minimum survey time is due to the orbital period of the Exo-C exoplanets, and for option #2 it is due to the SNR needed to reach this level of precision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Summary Conclusions</head><p>We draw the following conclusions from Figures 34-41 in Section 4.3.3:</p><p>1) Stellar jitter, when treated as a systematic noise term, dominates the limiting RV precision for stars with T&gt;4000 K, even for relatively quiescent stars, with integration times of 1 hour on 4-m and 10-m telescopes. 2) For F dwarfs and early G dwarfs, stellar jitter is less pronounced for λ &gt; 1 micron.</p><p>However, for relatively quiescent stars, the NIR offers only marginal advantage over the visible. This advantage is more prominent for more active stars. 3) For mid-to-late G, K and early M dwarfs, in the presence of any stellar jitter, the optimal wavelength regime of observation appears to be λ &gt; 2.3 microns with the CO absorption bandhead. Thus, NIR PRVs are critical to reach sub-m/s exoplanet signals. 4) For M dwarfs at 10 pc, with T&lt;4000 K and median stellar jitter, photon noise dominates the stellar jitter for λ &gt; 0.8 microns, with some marginal advantage at λ &gt; 2.3 microns with the CO absorption bandhead. 5) Even low stellar jitter can triple the RV uncertainty compared to photon noise alone, for a given effective temperature and wavelength of observation.</p><p>In Section 5.2, we discuss the time-scales and properties of stellar jitter. In our preceeding analysis, we have treated stellar jitter as a noise term. However, stellar jitter is a signal. With proper PRV wavelength coverage (ie, spectral grasp) to take advantage of the wavelength dependence of stellar jitter, simultaneous photometric monitoring, and/or a more dense observation cadence on the time-scales of stellar rotation periods (e.g. one observation at least every week for Sun-like rotation period), it may be possible to model and remove stellar jitter from RV time-series. However, we expect the signal analysis will not be ideal, particular in the presence of multiple exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Robertson et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">, Robertson &amp; Mahadevan 2014</ref>).</p><p>These future challenges represent a risk that requires investment in instrument technology and data analysis techniques, especially given the lack of demonstrated NIR precision of &lt; 5 m/s to date. The instrumentation risks may be retired in the next 1-3 years (e.g. by 2017) as planned NIR PRV spectrometers are commissioned by the PRV community independently of NASA efforts (Section 6.1). Assuming this risk is retired and irrespective of cost, NIR PRVs offer a promising wavelength regime to detect exoplanet signals of K &lt; 1 m/s. This will be particularly important for surveying Exo-C targets for terrestrial mass planets at 1 AU.</p><p>To conclude, the third spectrometer options presented at the beginning of Section 4 and in the Executive Summary offers the potential to mitigate the impact of stellar jitter on PRV sensitivity to exoplanets: 3) Access to an IR spectrograph or second arm of a visible spectrograph on a 4-m class telescope equipped with a CARMENES-like instrument stable at the level of &lt;1 m/s dedicated to PRV observations, to be available to the TESS mission, to assess the removal of wavelength-dependent stellar-jitter, and to survey nearby M dwarfs for habitable planets.</p><p>Such a capability will both complement and enhance visible PRV instrumentation.</p></div>

Coupling a spectrometer to the AO-corrected starlight completely changes the optical, mechanical, and thermal design possibilities for the spectrometer.</p><p>The primary benefits of a diffraction limited spectrometer compared to a seeing limited spectrograph are driven by the smaller spectrograph size and optics: 1) Cost, without including the cost of equipping a telescope with an AO system.</p><p>2) The prospect for illumination stability via the use of a single mode fiber.</p><p>3) The potential for improved mechanical/thermal stability. 4) High spectral resolutions are possible.</p><p>The primary drawbacks of a diffraction limited spectrometer compared to a seeing limited spectrograph are: 1) Again cost, for telescopes not already equipped with an adaptive optics system.</p><p>2) The lack of on-sky demonstrated performance with diffraction limited PRV spectrographs to date. 3) Throughput efficiency coupling starlight into single-mode fibers, which is somewhat mitigated by other throughput savings (ie, from not needing optics to mitigate modal noise).</p><p>Fortunately, to address the drawbacks there are active areas of PRV research.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">A Summary of the Historical Relevance of PRVs to the Exoplanet Field</head><p>Over 650 exoplanets have been discovered or confirmed over the past 23 years with the PRV method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akeson et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">, Wright et al. 2011</ref>), starting with the discoveries of HD 114762 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Latham et al. 1989</ref>) and 51 Peg b <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>. The PRV method exploits the time domain and spectroscopy to measure subtle changes in Doppler shifts with time in Nyquist sampled spectra with resolutions on the order of 100,000 (R=lambda/delta_lambda). The Doppler shift is produced by the reflex motion of the star in response to a Keplerian orbital companion. The projected reflex velocity semi-amplitude for a circular orbit companion is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K = 28.4 M p sin i / (M * + M p ) ⅔ P -⅓ m/s</formula><p>where M p is in Jupiter masses, (M * +M p ) is in solar masses and P is in years, and the unknown inclination i is in radians (Ch 7, Exoplanet Community Report). Doppler velocities of a few m/s produce shifts in the observed spectra of ~1/1000th of a detector pixel. For comparison, the barycenter motion of the Earth can produce apparent radial velocity shifts of up to ±30 km/s, and instrumental changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, illumination of the optics, and orientation in the Earth's gravity on a classical spectrograph can produce systematic shifts of ~5 km/s. Two different approaches have been pursued for measuring the much smaller changes in stellar RVs induced by orbiting exoplanets. One approach introduces a gas absorption cell into the beam of stellar light entering the spectrograph, allowing high-fidelity calibration and removal of the various instrumental shifts. The second approach focuses on stability, both by illuminating the spectrograph with stable images using fiber feeds and by careful design and construction to eliminate instrumental drifts. Particularly important is control of the atmospheric pressure at the dispersing elements, to eliminate changes in the index of refraction. This is the reason the HARPS spectrographs are in vacuum chambers. Continuous monitoring of instrumental drifts has also been implemented in some spectrographs. Precise determination of the barycenter motion of the Earth taking into account any changes in the rate of exposure during an observation can also be important. The capability of the community to correct for systematic sources of Doppler shifts has steadily improved with time, and consequently the exoplanet detection sensitivity has continually improved to smaller mass planets and longer orbital periods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 43</ref>).  With these advances in calibration and/or stability, the PRV technique enabled the discovery of hot Jupiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">, Marcy &amp; Butler 1996</ref>, systems with more than one planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Butler et al. 1999</ref>), Jupiter analogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Marcy et al. 2002)</ref>, planets in orbital resonance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Laughlin et al. 2005</ref>), super-Earths and possible water-worlds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Mayor et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">, Pepe et al. 2011</ref>), planets around evolved subgiant stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Johnson et al. 2011</ref>), the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and determination of spin/orbit (mis)alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Queloz et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">, Winn et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">, Triaud et al. 2009</ref>, and many other discoveries.

Stellar jitter can include P-mode oscillations (minutes), granulation (hours), rotationally modulated spots and plages (days to months), magnetic activity cycles (years), and rotational line-broadening in younger stars (which lowers the RV information content). These astrophysical noise sources are discussed in greater detail in <ref type="bibr">Dumusque</ref>  The present state-of-the-art in correcting PRVs for stellar jitter is illustrated by the reported detection of an Earth-mass planet, α Cen B b, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Dumusque et al. (2012)</ref>. After correcting the velocity of the V=1.3 mag K1 dwarf host star, α Cen B, for its 80-year orbital motion with its visual companion α Cen A; for the shifts of a few m/s due to a magnetic cycle of 8.8 years; for shifts connected with the star's rotation in 35 days; and after minimization of the shifts due to granulation over a few hours and acoustic oscillation over a few minutes by a combination of extended exposure times and repeated visits during the same night; then a 3.23-day orbit with semi-amplitude of K=51 +/-4 cm/s emerged, corresponding to a minimum mass of M P sin(i) =1.1 M Earth , and a maximum mass of 2.7 M Earth from formation scenarios and dynamical simulations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Plavchan et al. 2015)</ref>. A total of 453 observations spanning four years were required for this RV detection. Current near-infrared PRV performance has not yet achieved an adequate precision (&lt; 3 m/s) to assess the potential benefit for correcting stellar jitter in quiescent main sequence stars, but has been applied to younger, more active stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bailey et al. 2012</ref>). Thus, the number of targets that can be surveyed with a precision of ~10-50 cm/s in a given night is largely independent of telescope aperture for telescopes larger than 4m (Section 4.2).</p></div>

We present these different signals in order of timescale. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 44</ref> we present an overview of the stellar signals that are understood and can be mitigated, and the stellar signals that still pose problems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.1 Stellar oscillations</head><p>Pressure waves, also called P-modes, propagate at the surface of solar-type stars leading to a expansion and contraction of external envelopes over timescales less than 15 minutes for GKM dwarfs (5-15 minutes for the Sun; <ref type="bibr">Broomhall et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Arentoft et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">, Schrijver &amp; Zwann 2000</ref>. The individual radial-velocity amplitudes of P-modes are typically a few tens of cm/s, but the interference of tens of modes with close frequencies introduces RV variations on the order of 1 m/s for GKM dwarfs, depending on the spectral type and evolutionary stage of the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bedding et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Bouchy &amp; Carrier 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Bedding &amp; Kjeldsen 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">, Schrijver &amp; Zwann 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">, Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995</ref>).</p><p>Because of the short timescale of oscillations, it is possible to average out this signal by increasing the exposure time to at least the period of the signal. In addition, theory and observations show that the frequencies of the P-modes rise with the square root of the mean density of the star and that their amplitudes are proportional to the ratio of the stellar luminosity over the stellar mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arentoft et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Christensen-Dalsgaard 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">, Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995</ref>. Therefore when going from G to M dwarfs, the period of these oscillations decreases, as well as their amplitudes. Observing later spectral-type stars therefore implies a smaller contribution of oscillations, and a shorter exposure time required to average them out.</p><p>As an example, for the solar analog α Cen A (spectral type G2V), the amplitude of the oscillation signal measured using HARPS is 1.2 m/s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Dumusque et al. 2011a</ref>). For the K0V dwarf α Cen B, the amplitude of the oscillations measured with the same instrument is 0.39 m/s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.1.2">Granulation</head><p>At the surface of the Sun, a transition in the way energy is transported occurs. The surface becomes optically thin and energy can escape by radiation, carrying out the major part of the energy. This sudden cooling down of convection cells gives rise to a phenomenon called granulation. When reaching the stellar surface, the ascending hot gas of the convection cell flows horizontally, which form the granules, before descending in dark intergranular lanes once it has cooled down.</p><p>The average lifetime of a granule is approximatively ten to thirty minutes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Title et al. 1989)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bahng &amp; Schwarzschild 1961)</ref>. The velocity of convection inside these granules is a few km/s, but averaging the velocities of granules and intergranules over the entire stellar disc reduces the net signal to an amplitude of a few m/s. In addition to granulation at small scales and short periods, and supergranules at large scales and longer periods, a more or less continuous convection pattern in size and timescale exists. This induces a continuous RV signal from 15 minutes induced by granules, up to 48 hours for supergranules.</p><p>An approach for averaging out this signal is to observe a star several times during the same night, spanning as long a time interval as possible. Then, binning the data over the night helps to reduce the jitter induced by granulation phenomena. This strategy has been applied to a sample of ten stars observed several times per night with HARPS, resulting in the detection of seven low-mass planets, including the Earth-mass exoplanet orbiting α Cen B (Pepe et al. 2011). A possible way to account for the uncertainties introduced by the signal of granulation phenomena is to add a red noise model when fitting exoplanet orbits to the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.2.1">Effects of starspots and plages</head><p>A starspot, emitting less light than the average stellar surface, will break the symmetry between the blue-shifted approaching limb and the red-shifted receding limb of a rotating star, and will induce an apparent RV variation as it passes across the visible stellar disc.</p><p>A plage at the disc center is only slightly hotter than the average stellar surface temperature and will induce a small flux effect. A plage on the limbs will be brighter due to a limb-brightness dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Meunier 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">, Unruh 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">, Frazier 1971</ref>, while the star emits less light at this location due to limb-darkening. Plages induce a smaller flux effect than spots, even though they tend to be an order of magnitude more extended than starspots (Chapman 2001).</p><p>Plages and starspots are both affected by strong local magnetic fields. These magnetic fields suppress the convection locally, thus suppressing the convective blueshift effect inside the active regions (~300 m/s for the Sun, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Dravins 1981</ref>). These regions therefore appear redshifted in comparison to the quiet photosphere affected by convective blueshift, which can induce an RV variation as the star rotates. This RV effect of the inhibition of convective blueshift will be of the same order of magnitude for spots and plages, because both regions are affected by strong local magnetic fields. Big spots on the Sun have filling factors of about 0.1%, which implies a peak-to-peak RV jitter of 1.2 m/s. For a plage, the maximum peak-to-peak RV amplitude is given by í µí»¥í µí± í µí± = í µí± × (3.87 + 0.11 í µí±£ í µí± í µí±í µí±(í µí±) + 0.10 í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí± 2 )</p><p>Plages are ~10 times more extended than spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Chapman et al. 2001)</ref>. A big plage on the Sun will therefore have a filling factor of 1%, which induces a peak-to-peak RV jitter of 4.5 m/s.</p><p>For slowly rotating stars, the main activity-induced RV variation is caused by the inhibition of the convective blueshift inside active regions. The velocity of convection is smaller for later spectral type stars, so K to M dwarfs should be less affected by stellar activity than G dwarfs. Stellar activity can induce a signal at the rotational period of the star and its harmonics. It is therefore possible to fit sine waves with periods fixed at the rotational period of the star and its harmonics to account for the RV activity signal. This approach has been applied successfully to several cases (e.g. Boisse 2011, Dumusque 2012).</p><p>It is also possible to go further and model the activity signal using the photometric, R' HK , BIS SPAN, and FWHM amplitudes. If the activity of the star can be explained by a major active region on the stellar surface, this technique has been shown to be efficient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Dumusque et al. 2014</ref>). Gaussian processes can be trained on the photometric light curve alone, and can then be used to model the RV jitter (cf. the FF' method, Aigrain 2012; Haywood 2014).</p><p>Another small effect of spots is due to the fact that spots are depressed compared to the photosphere (the Wilson depression) because they are cooler. The depth of the Wilson depression has been estimated in many studies, ranging from 500 -2500 km. This induces a modification of the gravitational redshift inside the spotted region, and thus an RV variation of a few cm/s (Cegla 2012).</p></div>

This effect is not well quantified, but could induce an amplitude of ~0.5 m/s for common flares <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Saar 2009</ref>). These phenomena are not periodic and can be quite frequent (Audard 2000). Nevertheless, not all M dwarfs are flaring, and some of them are extremely quiet (e.g. Bonfils 2013a).

A magnetic cycle is characterized by very small or no active regions at minimum, and an important number of active regions at maximum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Spectroscopic Properties of Stellar Jitter</head><p>The embedded signals from photospheric velocities do not appear as Doppler shifts. Photospheric velocities (or spots) affect the line profiles of spectral lines -they do not imprint a shift of λ x v/c. However, current spectrometers do not have resolution to distinguish the photosphere from center of mass stellar velocities. The ability to identify and remove photospheric signals is at the very heart of whether the PRV community can ever make use of 10 cm/s instrumental precision on real stars.</p><p>With current spectral resolutions (R up to 115,000) the photospheric velocities are indistinguishable from Doppler shifts. Attempts to decorrelate spot signals and granulation have had some success, but will be increasingly more difficult for velocity semi-amplitudes K &lt; 0.5 m/s. Improper decorrelation can introduce false-positive signals. What is possible to do at 1 m/s precision may be difficult and ambiguous for long term RMS velocities at the level of 10 cm/s.</p><p>In addition to trying to continued efforts to decorrelate stellar noise, it is worth considering whether instruments can be built to detect the photospheric signals. Astrophysicists who model granulation compare line bisectors from their 2D and 3D convection models to line bisectors in the R~500,000 FTS solar spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Asplund et al. 2000)</ref>. A spectrum with R=500,000 and greater than Nyquist sampling can detect time correlated changes in stellar granulation. Spectrometers with sufficient resolution to detect and model the stellar noise may succeed in the search for 10 cm/s signals. The Doppler shifts will trivially come for free. Along these lines, ESPRESSO is designed for a second resolution of R=230,000 in addition to the R=150,000 mode (Section 6.1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Reiners et al. (2010)</ref> concludes that near-infrared (NIR) PRVs are only advantageous for stars later than M4 in spectral type, based upon estimates of signal-to-noise and RV information content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bottom et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015)</ref> also conclude that red (~0.8-1.0 micron) PRVs are optimal for early M dwarfs. However, these conclusions do not take into account the effects of the reduced stellar jitter in the NIR. In Section 4.3, we present a model for and analysis of the wavelength dependence of stellar jitter. We show that red and NIR PRVs may provide higher precision due to the reduced stellar jitter amplitudes at longer wavelengths (instrumentation and telluric absorption challenges aside).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Wavelength Dependence</head><p>These theoretical arguments in favor of red and NIR PRVs have also recently been supported by PRV observations. For example, Anglada-Escude et al. (2012a) demonstrate that Barnard's Star (M4V) is stable down to 80 cm/s over 4 years when using the red-most part of the HARPS wavelength range (between 650-680 nm). Including the bluer part of the spectrum (380-650 nm) increased the long-term RMS to about 1.4 m/s, and using the Iodine wavelength range only (450-620 nm) the RMS was as high as 1.6 m/s. Moreover, the authors argue that the increase in noise at bluer wavelengths is not the result of lower SNR, but is due to wavelength-dependent sources of stellar noise acting more strongly in the blue. A similar explanation could account for the difference in the RMS of PRV measurements of Kepler-78b with HARPS-N compared to HIRES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Howard et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">, Pepe et al. 2013</ref>). These results provide motivation to move to longer wavelengths in order to achieve sub-1 m/s long-term precision for stars of all spectral types.</p></div>

(2014)</ref> has shown that activityinduced RV variations can be well-reproduced by simple models based on the off-transit photometric variations of the star. CoRoT-7 is an active G9 star displaying peak-to-peak activity-driven RV variations of the order of 20 m/s. It hosts a compact planetary system including at least one transiting super-Earth, CoRoT-7b ( <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2009</ref>) and one subNeptune mass planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Queloz et al. 2009</ref>). The CoRoT-7 system was observed intensively with the HARPS spectrograph for 26 consecutive nights from 2012 January 12 to February 6, with multiple well-separated measurements for each night. These observations were analysed in conjunction with simultaneous CoRoT photometry, allowing the activity-driven RV signal to be reproduced using the FF' method of Aigrain et al. (2012) and a Gaussian process that has the covariance properties of the lightcurve ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Haywood et al. 2014</ref>). The FF' method uses the offtransit variations in the star's lightcurve and its first time derivative to model the suppression of convective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots on a rotating star. The Gaussian process accounts for any remaining activity-induced signals that may result from other activity-related processes such as photospheric inflows towards active regions or limb-brightened facular emission.</p><p>Accounting for stellar activity in this way allowed the authors to estimate the masses of CoRoT7b and CoRoT-7c with realistic allowance for the uncertainty introduced by the stellar activity, and to rule out the presence of an additional planetary companion at an orbital period of 9 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.5">Time-scale Dependence on Stellar Parameters</head><p>Stellar activity affects RVs in a number of ways, over a wide range of different timescales. Here, we summarize how radial velocity jitter scales with stellar parameters like mass and age. Processes like stellar surface granulation and seismic oscillations introduce noise on timescales of minutes to hours. While the timescales for these oscillations are typically on the order of minutes for dwarf stars, for evolved stars they increase and can be as long as hours. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding (1995)</ref> found that asteroseismic oscillation amplitude varied close to linearly with the luminosity to mass ratio of stars, implying that asteroseismic radial velocity jitter is more important for stars more massive than the sun than it is for lower mass stars. There is, however, a large amount of scatter in oscillation amplitudes for a given spectral type, and it is hard to predict which stars will show large amplitude oscillations. Out of 2000 dwarf stars observed by Kepler for asteroseismology, only 500 exhibited detectable oscillations (Chaplin et al 2011).</p><p>Stellar surface granulation happens on slightly longer timescales than asteroseismic oscillations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bastien et al (2014)</ref> showed that RV jitter correlated with 8 hour flicker, which Bastien et al (2013) and Cranmer et al (2014) have linked to stellar granulation processes. The inverse correlation between flicker derived stellar surface gravity and RV jitter implies that similarly to asteroseismic oscillations, stellar granulation induces lower amounts of RV jitter for lower mass stars (Dumusque 2011a). In particular, Bastien et al (2014) demonstrated a roughly linear relation between granulation induced RV jitter and stellar surface gravity, with typical levels of RV jitter dropping below a 2-3 m/s observational floor for stars with log(g) &gt; 4.5.</p><p>RV jitter due to stellar rotational modulations takes place on timescales of days to months. Models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aigrain et al. 2012</ref>) have been developed and validated to estimate RV variations from white light photometric measurements (assuming the photometric bandpass and spectroscopic bandpass are similar), so it is possible to estimate the ensemble properties of starspot modulations from photometric measurements of stars of various spectral types. The sample of Kepler stellar rotation periods and photometric amplitudes from <ref type="bibr">McQuillan et al. (2014)</ref> suggests that while rotation periods increase towards lower stellar masses, both the fraction of stars showing photometric rotational modulations and the amplitude of those modulations typically increase towards lower mass. The net effect is that the typical RV amplitude of starspot modulations stays close to constant at the ~1 m/s level for FGK and Mtype stars, albeit with a wide scatter in amplitudes ( <ref type="bibr">Vanderberg et al. 2015</ref>). In addition to the dependence on spectral type, the stellar rotation periods (and therefore ages) are closely related to the level of RV jitter. Young, fast rotating stars will exhibit larger radial velocity variations (see Section 5.4; Saar 1998). Similarly, other tracers of stellar age-like magnetic activity indicators (particularly R' HK ) can determine the level of RV jitter.</p><p>Due to the relatively recent development of PRV technology capable of measurements on the 1 m/s level, the jitter induced by long period magnetic activity cycles has not been thoroughly explored as a function of stellar properties. Lovis et al (2011) searched HARPS data for magnetic activity cycles and reported on their strengths and correlations with velocity for stars of various effective temperatures. In particular, the authors found that for lower stellar effective temperatures, correlations between RV and the R' HK activity indicator became less significant, and that the typical RV semi-amplitude (and its scatter) caused by magnetic activity cycles increase with stellar mass. Stars below 5000 K have essentially no observable correlation between RV and magnetic activity cycles, which hotter stars can exhibit variations of up to 10 m/s semi-amplitude over the course of a magnetic cycle. Gomes da Silva et al (2011) extended this work into M dwarfs, albeit with fewer target stars and shorter observational baselines, and found that a Sodium-based activity indicator was a better predictor of RV jitter in M dwarfs than other indicators like R' HK . Unfortunately, the short observational baseline, small sample, and observational sampling technique limited the conclusions about activity indicator correlation with RV jitter for M dwarfs in Gomes da Silva et al (2011). Alternatively, the solar RV variation can be estimated from the observed surface brightness distributions using the known differential rotation profile. Makarov ey al. (2010) integrated highresolution solar surface brightness maps derived from Mount Wilson observations, which were processed and calibrated to ensure a close match with the observational TSI data. As a side product of that analysis, the daily variation of the integrated solar RV can be estimated. The average multi-year standard deviation was estimated at 0.21 m/s. This estimate should be used as a lower bound, because it accounts only for the part of variation induced by the photometric irregularities and asymmetries on the rotating surface. The physical motion in the photosphere caused by, for example, supergranulation or surface flows, is not included. A strong correlation of RV variation with the solar activity cycle was found, with the running standard deviation varying between 0.02 m/s on the quietest months and 0.5 m/s at the maximum of activity in 2000. Exceptionally active intervals of time, when a large group of spots and plages appears on one side of the visible hemisphere, are characterized by RV dispersions of up to 1.4 m/s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.6">The Sun in Context</head><p>Most of the long-term photometric variability of the Sun (442 ppm) comes from the solar cycle. Short-term variations of TSI (and, presumably, of integrated RV) are most of the time significantly smaller. If the PMOD TSI data are divided into consecutive 10-day intervals, the irradiance standard deviation is estimated for each interval, and the median value of the standard deviation is computed for 960-day intervals (a typical duration for exoplanet RV data sets), the range of the TSI standard deviation is between 70 ppm and 260 ppm depending on the magnetic activity level. This still underestimates the short-period variability, which is more relevant for exoplanet detection, The mean over the 10-day standard deviation values is 182 ppm, the median is 139 ppm, and the 15th and 85th percentiles are 53 and 320 ppm, respectively. Using the scaling relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Makarov et al. (2009)</ref>, the brightness-related RV standard deviation over several years is:</p><p>σ RV = 0.442 × 7 ×10 5 × 2 km/s = 0.062 m/s but the short-term variation can be much smaller. Formally, the Earth's signal (0.089 m/s) can be confidently detected in a 2-3 years observing run for a Sun seen equator-on even at the height of magnetic activity. Yet, these numbers may strongly underestimate the overall RV jitter of the Sun.</p><p>Supposedly the most direct way of estimating the overall σ RV of the Sun is to use the multi-year series of the SOHO MDI data. The RV measurements taken with the Doppler spectrograph are pixellized over the visible disk, and it appears straightforward to integrate the measurements, convolving them with a weight function corresponding to the limb darkening function and subtracting the differential rotation pattern. Unfortunately, the MDI data are burdened by large systematic errors of unknown origin and instrumental resets. Still, the data can be divided into a number of "smooth" intervals, typically, 150-200 days long. High-order polynomials or Fourier series can be fitted to remove the systematic and instrumental effects. The robust standard deviations (estimated from the 85th and 15th percentiles) of the daily residuals range from 0.9 to 1.0 m/s. These values may represent more realistic estimates of solar RV jitter, because they include the physical motion of the surface.  <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>, have looked into the benefits of red and NIR PRVs compared to visible PRVs. Such studies assume telluric absorption can be perfectly modeled without sacrificing precision, which is one of the major NIR PRV challenges ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Seifahrt et al. 2010</ref>). In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bottom et al. (2013)</ref> looked at the optimal wavelength to observe main sequence stars of different effective temperatures for a HZ survey, and what spectral types such a survey would optimally contain <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figures 45,46</ref>). These studies did not consider the wavelength dependence of stellar jitter, which is a primary scientific driver for NIR PRVs, and which we discuss in detail in Sections 4.2 and 5.2.3.  Finally, perhaps the most exciting recent discovery with NIR RVs is the direct detection of RV variation from Jovian planets with significant CO absorption lines at 2.3 microns such as τ Boo b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Rodler et al. 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">, Snellen et al. 2010</ref>). This method may be applicable to the direct RV detection of Earths with a future generation of NIR RV instrumentation and observatories <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Snellen et al., 2013)</ref>. Here the precision in the radial velocity is not as important, with semiamplitudes on the order of ~10 km/s. Rather sensitivity with large apertures and low-read noise detectors combined with advanced modeling and removal of telluric and stellar signals becomes necessary, beyond current capabilities to detect such a faint signal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Young Stars, Active Stars</head><p>The discovery of planetary systems that are drastically different from our own, including those with short orbital period gas giants and those with large obliquities, has led to significant revisions in planet formation and migration theory. While the ensemble properties of planetary systems and their stellar hosts can provide some constraints on formation models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Helled et al. 2013</ref>), a much more direct test of the new ideas would be to find planets soon after formation. Competing formation scenarios (e.g., cold start vs. hot start; <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Marley et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Fortney et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Galvagni et al. 2012</ref>) and migration scenarios (planet-disk vs. planet-planet; <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Lin et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, Lin &amp; Ida 1997</ref> predict observationally distinct differences that may persist for up to ~1 Gyr.</p><p>However, only a few of the nearly 1000 RV-detected exoplanets orbiting field stars have ages that are likely to be less than 1 Gyr, and none have ages that are precisely known. This is a consequence of RV surveys preferentially targeting older, less active field stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Wright 2005)</ref>. In contrast, the presence of starspots on a rotating star can periodically distort stellar absorption lines, and, if unaccounted for, can give the appearance of RV shifts of many hundreds of m/s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Queloz et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Desort et al. 2007</ref>). The decline in stellar rotation and activity with age is both well established and quantified (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Skumanich 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Barnes et al. 2010</ref>. Observations accumulated over the most recent decade are starting to quantify how stellar jitter declines with age and what the implications are for the detection of planets at young ages.</p><p>Observations at visible wavelengths of adolescent age stars in nearby open clusters have found mean stellar jitter measurements of 16 m/s in the Hyades (625±50 Myr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Paulson et al. 2004</ref>) and 13 m/s in Praesepe (580±50 Myr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Quinn et al. 2012</ref>). Nevertheless, with sufficient monitoring, short-period sub-Jupiter mass planets can and have been identified (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Quinn et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Quinn et al. , 2014</ref>). Observations of younger stars in nearby moving groups <ref type="bibr">(10-150 Myr)</ref> find roughly an order of magnitude increase in stellar jitter (131 m/s for FGK stars; <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Paulson &amp; Yelda 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Lagrange et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Hillenbrand et al. 2014</ref>). This increased RV variability, which can be pseudo-periodic, has led to the premature announcements of two young planets in these groups (TW Hya, <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Setiawan et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">BD +20 1790</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, Hernán-Obispo et al. 2010</ref>), both of which were subsequently shown to be caused by starspots (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Huélamo et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Figueira et al. 2010a</ref>). The increased stellar jitter translates to typical detection limits of several Jupiter masses at short orbital periods; this is corroborated by the detection of one of the youngest planets known, a 2.8 M Jupiter giant planet with a 320 day period orbiting a weakly active ~150 Myr star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Borgniet et al. 2014</ref>). Several pioneering studies of the youngest T Tauri age stars have revealed stellar jitter values as large as several km/s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Huerta et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Prato et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Crockett et al. 2012</ref>). In these cases, exoplanet detection via visible RVs is may not be feasible, athough van <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Eyken et al. (2012)</ref> identified an enigmatic young candidate planet in Orion.</p><p>Given the underlying motivation for finding young planets, observers have recently developed techniques to mitigate the effects of stellar jitter. One direct way to accomplish this is to obtain precise RV measurements at NIR wavelengths; the brightness contrast between cool starspots and the photosphere is diminished in the near-infrared, which translates into smaller stellar jitter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bailey et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Crockett et al. (2012)</ref> report reductions in stellar jitter by factors of 2-5 for infrared measurements versus visible measurements. We note though that the overall effectiveness of this is still being developed, since most infrared RV survey work has been conducted with 1990s generation infrared arrays (e.g., CSHELL, NIRSPEC) in contrast to more modern facilities (e.g., CRIRES, iSHELL, IGRINS). Nevertheless, with resulting jitter values of ~100 m/s, the detectable young planets are limited to gas giants with short orbital periods.</p><p>Finally, we highlight that some success is being achieved at overcoming the effects of stellar jitter by observing active stars at multiple wavelengths and/or with multiple techniques (photometry, spectropolarimetry). In one promising case, the observed stellar jitter was filtered</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Instrumentation Objectives</head><p>Current PRV detection sensitivity is primarily limited by two categories of systematic effects: astrophysical sources of radial velocity "jitter" and long-term instrumental stability, i.e. the extent to which wavelength shifts due to the instrument can be calibrated and corrected. In this section, we look towards future efforts to advance instrumentation stability.</p><p>There are significant questions from the astronomy community as a whole whether the PRV technique can be extended towards the goal of detecting the 9 cm/s K semi-amplitude signal of a 1 Earth-mass planet in a one year habitable orbit around a G type star. The uncertainty of the semi-amplitude must be reduced to ~1-2 cm/s on a time-scale two orders of magnitude longer than the 3.2-day planet orbiting α Cen B ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Dumusque et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Invoking simple photon statistics to extrapolate from the current state of the art in PRVs towards future capabilities is dangerously naïve, since systematic errors due to the instrumentation will set the ultimate error floor. To achieve precisions better than 1m/s will require careful stabilization of the spectrograph pressure, temperature, and optical/mechanical structure, together with better wavelength calibration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Wavelength Calibration</head><p>There are two primary approaches to wavelength calibration for PRVs, represented by the mature HARPS-S and HIRES spectrometers on the ESO 3.6-m and Keck 10-m telescopes respectively. PRVs are obtained with HIRES via an iodine gas cell for a common optical path relative wavelength calibration in the 500-650 nm range to achieve a single measurement precision of ~1-3 m/s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Butler et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">, Vogt et al. 1994</ref>. This approach is necessitated by the thermal, pressure and illumination instability of the spectrograph. HARPS-S relies on stabilizing the thermal, pressure and illumination of the spectrograph to use a non-common optical path wavelength calibration source, currently Thorium-Argon gas, over a broader wavelength range to achieve a single measurement precision of ~0.7 m/s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Mayor et al. 2003</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Common Optical Path</head><p>Herein we review current and planned approaches to spectrograph wavelength calibration in the visible and NIR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.1.">Telluric Lines</head><p>At wavelengths longer than about 600 nm, ground-based photometric and spectroscopic measurements must contend with the effects of absorption by molecules in Earth's atmosphere. These telluric absorption features result from rotational and vibrational transitions of molecules including H2O, O2, O3, CO2, CH4, and N2O. While there are atmospheric windows with comparatively little telluric absorption, low-level molecular absorption is present at nearly all wavelengths in the infrared. The average properties of the telluric absorption lines vary considerably between species, and in some cases, on short timescales for a given species. For example, the numerous H2O absorption features in the visible and infrared may undergo substantial variations in visible depth on short timescales as the concentration of water vapor in the troposphere changes. Variations in telluric absorption lines can impact broadband photometry when filters overlap with atmospheric features (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Blake &amp; Shaw 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Berta et al. 2012</ref>, and also have the potential to confound ground-based transit spectroscopy observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Mandell et al. 2011</ref>). Variable telluric absorption lines also pose a problem for high-precision Doppler measurements at red and infrared wavelengths. These telluric lines must be precisely modeled, or completely avoided, to achieve the ultimate in Doppler precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Cunha et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Telluric absorption lines do offer the tantalizing possibility of calibrating the wavelength scale of any high-resolution spectrum they contaminate. When <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Griffin and Griffin (1973)</ref> first proposed the simultaneous absorption reference as a means for obtaining PRV measurements with slit spectrographs, it was telluric O2 lines they were suggesting as a wavelength reference. However, Earth's atmosphere is no substitute for stable, controlled gas absorption cell. In Earth's atmosphere, the absorbing molecules are moving with the wind, mainly horizontally, at velocities of 10 to 20 m/s. This means that the telluric absorption spectrum is not a zero velocity wavelength reference, rather one with a small intrinsic velocity that changes with time and telescope altitude and azimuth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Balthasar et al. 1982)</ref>. At the same time, molecular transitions are pressure sensitive, so variations in the pressure profile of Earth's atmosphere lead to subtle shifts in the centers and shapes of telluric lines. Since contributions to the optical depth for a given line come from a range of altitudes, and therefore pressures, telluric lines are also fundamentally asymmetric, and their shapes and positions change with time as barometric pressure changes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Caccin et al. 1985</ref>). Wind and pressure can conspire to shift the effective centers of telluric lines by up to a few tens of femtometers. Telluric lines also have appreciable widths. In the visible and infrared, the numerous H 2 O lines are pressure broadened and have widths of about 0.01 nm (FWHM), meaning that they may be marginally resolved by highresolution spectrometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Livingston &amp; Wallace 1991)</ref>. This limits their usefulness for recovering information about the LSF of a slit-based instrument. Finally, the significant temporal variations in the optical depths of telluric H2O lines pose a different challenge. Some lines will alternate between the optically thin and optically thick regimes depending on atmospheric conditions. This can result in very complex blends between lines that are close in wavelength but have different nominal strengths.</p><p>Despite these challenges, telluric lines still hold great promise as a simultaneous wavelength calibrator for moderate-precision RV spectroscopy. If these lines, and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere, can be sufficiently well modeled, Doppler precision approaching that achieved with other techniques may be possible. Forty years ago, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Griffin &amp; Griffin (1973)</ref> estimated that Doppler measurements with a precision of 10 m/s should be possible for bright stars using telluric O2 lines as a wavelength reference. Since that time, numerous authors have demonstrated that the Griffins' prediction was essentially correct. Recently, long-term precision better than 5 m/s has been demonstrated. In the visible, measurements of stellar radial velocities using telluric lines with a precision of 5 to 20 m/s have been demonstrated over a wide range of timescales using many different analysis techniques and instruments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Smith 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Cochran 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Snellen 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Barnes et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Figueira et al. (2010b</ref><ref type="bibr">Figueira et al. ( , 2011</ref> carried out an extensive analysis of six years of archival HARPS data, and found that an overall Doppler precision of 10 m/s using telluric O2 lines could be improved to about 2 m/s by using a simple, but physically motivated, model of wind patterns above the observatory.</p><p>There has also been substantial progress at infrared wavelengths, where telluric lines are prevalent and there is increased interest in Doppler measurements of cool, red stars. Until recently, the relative dearth of wavelength calibration sources available in the infrared made the use of telluric lines even more appealing. Many authors have explored the use of telluric CO2, CH4, and N2O lines as a wavelength reference in the infrared, with some results approaching the level of precision achieved at visible wavelengths (e.g. ). Overall, the Doppler precision using telluric lines that has been demonstrated in the infrared is somewhat worse than in the visible, at the level of 5-10 m/s over periods of weeks using the CRIRES instrument on the VLT. This limitation is, at some level, instrumental, since there is no high-resolution, multi-order infrared instrument like HARPS or HIRES.</p><p>As a new generation of high-resolution, infrared spectrographs employing broad-band calibration sources, such as frequency combs and stabilized Fabry-Perot cavities, is about to come online (including IRD, SPIRou, CARMENES, and iSHELL; see Section 6.1.2), it is crucial that we extract the maximum Doppler information from these data by employing the best possible models of telluric absorption. These models can be based on radiative transfer calculations using molecular transition data and a model of Earth's atmosphere (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Seifhart et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Blake &amp; Shaw 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bender et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Lockwood et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Gullikson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bertaux et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Kausch et al. 2014</ref>), or strictly empirical and derived from an ensemble of spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Artigau et al. 2014</ref>). In most cases, today these models provide excellent fits to observed telluric spectra, with residuals in the cores of lines of moderate optical depth of a few percent. However, precise Doppler measurements using the entire available stellar spectrum, including those portions subject to appreciable telluric absorption, will require improvements to these telluric models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.2.">Visible Gas Cells</head><p>Iodine cells provide an easily implemented and inexpensive wavelength calibration for high resolution visible spectrometers, enabling them to reach a Doppler precision of 1.5 m/s. The superimposed iodine spectrum has three great attributes and one great drawback. The superimposed iodine spectrum is obtained simultaneously with the stellar spectrum. During an exposure of a star, any changes that occur in the optical performance of the spectrometer (wavelength or LSF) or in the illumination pattern of its optics (near-field or far-field) are simultaneously revealed in the shapes and positions of the thousands of iodine lines from 5000 -6200 Angstroms. Thus, the three great attributes of superimposed iodine spectrum are the conveyed wavelength scale, LSF, and simultaneity with the stellar spectrum.</p><p>The drawback of the iodine technique stems from the blending of all stellar absorption lines with iodine lines. The blending forces the practitioner to construct a forward-modeling spectrum synthesis formed by multiplying the underlying iodine and stellar spectra, convolved with the floating LSF and placed on a floating wavelength scale. The great drawback is that the underlying intrinsic stellar spectrum is not known (i.e. prior to convolution with the LSF) and therefore must be deduced by taking a spectrum of the star without the iodine cell (a "template spectrum") and deconvolving it. The deconvolution suffers two indignities. The LSF at each wavelength is not known perfectly, so the deconvolved spectrum carries a systemic error, including asymmetries in the lines, caused by the poorly known LSF. Also, the deconvolution process is inherently ill-defined mathematically, causing "noise" to be injected into the deconvolved spectrum. Thus, this needed ingredient in the forward modeling process induces systematic errors in the resulting RVs, typically at the level of ~1.5 m/s. A final drawback of the iodine technique is that the LSF and wavelength scale must be determined anew for each spectrum, as the spectrometer itself is typically unstable at the level of ~1 km/s. The need to determine LSF and wavelength scale anew, at each wavelength in the spectrum, necessitates higher signal-to-noise ratios in the spectrum and hence longer exposure times.</p><p>Ultimately, the iodine technique is roughly a factor of 10 "slower" than RV techniques that rely on intrinsic stability of the spectrometer itself. For example, work on Kepler-78 b by both Keck-HIRES and HARPS-N achieved similar Doppler precision with exposures of ~1 hour, but the telescope aperture ratio is a factor of 7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Howard et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Pepe et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.3.">NIR Gas Cells</head><p>In the red end of the visible spectrum (e.g. 650-900 nm), there are no known suitable gases with high enough optical depth with large dipole for ro-vibrational transitions, with water being the strongest, for use in absorption gas cells. In the NIR, however, a number of candidates have emerged and been deployed with NIR high-resolution spectrographs that provide comparable benefits to the iodine gas cell in the visible (see Section 6.2.1.2). In particular, both the room temperature ammonia and isotopic methane gas cells have yielded PRV measurements of ~5 m/s in the NIR in the H and K bands over time-scales of a couple years <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Mahadevan &amp; Ge 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Bean et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Anglada-Escude et al. 2012b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">, Plavchan et al. 2013a</ref>). The benefit of using an isotopic methane cell ( 13 CH 4 ) over regular methane ( 12 CH 4 ) is that the reduced mass of the molecule is changed with the presence of the extra neutron. The change in the reduced mass produces an effective shift of ~10 nm of all the ro-vibrational absorption lines in the NIR relative to the variable telluric methane absorption lines. However, care must still be taken to model and remove the dense telluric lines where telluric and gas cell absorption bands overlap. Additionally, the line density of isotopic methane is so high that identifying the continuum in a spectrum is not possible in the K-band. As a result, Plavchan et al. (2013a) resorts to simultaneously solving for the blaze function correction and RV measurements. The resulting forward model has too many free parameters to be readily fit with a least-squares brute force approach, and an amoeba-simplex parameter search algorithm is employed instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Nelder &amp; Mead 1965</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Non-Common Optical Path</head><p>With illumination, pressure, temperature and gravity stabilized spectrographs, non-common optical path wavelength references can be used to derive spectroscopic wavelength solutions and PRV measurements. Emission line lamps have been used in spectroscopy for wavelength calibration for centuries, and their specialized use for PRVs has progressed rapidly over the past decade.</p><p>In the visible, Thorium-Argon lamps are used with the HARPS spectrometers to achieve ~70 cm/s single measurement precision. Thorium-Argon wavelength calibration can have limited simultaneous application for faint targets due to scattered light and longer integrations, but can still be obtained before and after a science observation. Additionally, emission line lamps have finite lifetimes. HARPS is able to achieve such precise long-term wavelength calibration by using a nested series of Thorium-Argon lamp, including one that is only turned on once a year to calibrate the other Thorium-Argon lamps that are used and replaced more frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Pepe et al. 2000</ref>).</p><p>In the near-infrared, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Mahadevan et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Mahadevan et al. ( ,2012</ref> have shown that Uranium-Neon emission line lamps also produce a dense set of emission lines across the YJH bands, and was successfully demonstrated with the PATHFINDER spectrograph, and will be employed for wavelength calibration with the HPF spectrograph.</p><p>To mitigate the non-homogeneous coverage of emission lamp lines across orders, particularly towards the red, PRV scientists have started to explore the stabilization of Fabry-Perot etalons for PRV wavelength calibration, with lab-based stability of 30 cm/s demonstrated in the nearinfrared ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Halverson et al. 2014</ref>), and less than 1 m/s in the visible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">McCracken et al. 2014</ref>) with the potential for 1 cm/s stability. Fabry-Perot etalons involve the injection of white light or laser light into a mirrored resonant cavity. The light that escapes from a pinhole in the cavity alternatively destructively and constructively interferes with itself as a function of wavelength, producing a repeating pattern of emission lines for wavelength calibration, with the shape of the lines affected by the finesse of the cavity. Without stabilization of the cavity length, the interference pattern can shift in wavelength with a radial velocity equivalent of hundreds of meters per second.</p><p>Several groups are also pursuing the use a laser frequency comb (LFC) to monitor the instrumental line profile of stabilized spectrographs in the visible and near-infrared ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Li et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">, Osterman et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">, Langellier et al. 2014</ref> ). LFCs are ultra-stable wavelength references, with equivalent radial velocity stability of &lt; 1 cm/s. This extreme precision is achieved by the comb spanning a factor of two in wavelength (an octave), allowing the use of a frequency double to self-reference the comb to itself (from one end of the spectrum to the other), locking both the line-spacing and the wavelength zero-point. Since the LFC lines are narrow, the recorded LSF of a calibration exposure is a true representation of the Optical Transfer Function (OTF), and thus instrumental changes can be detected and distinguished. However, laser frequency combs still have shortcomings. One is the limited wavelength range (100-150 nm). Another technical challenge is the intrinsically varying line profile of the LFC. While source comb lines are practically delta functions on the dispersion scale of the spectrograph, those source comb lines are so dense that filtering of every N-th line (N=10…40) is necessary to clearly resolve a comb like spectrum with an astronomical spectrograph. This filtering relies on Fabry-Perot cavities, which are sensitive to environmental changes, and if stabilization is insufficient then the line profiles of the filtered LFC can change over time, introducing instrumental errors. State of the art LFCs suppress these effects to a cm/s level, although it is still an issue that these systems are very complex and expensive ($1-2M). Development efforts focus on long-term stability and "turnkey" operation (with or without a laser physicist on call), with such a comb to be tested on sky at HARPS in 2015.</p><p>Finally, to get around the need for line-filtering Fabry-Perot cavities in LFCs, which complicates the optical components and electronics considerably, other teams are pursuing the use of "micro-combs" on a chip, with a recent on-sky demonstration in the NIR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Yi et al. 2015</ref>). These combs have native line-spacing that matches the spectral resolution of astronomical spectrographs (e.g. R=50,000), eliminating the need for line-filtering. However, these combs are not octave-spanning, and are less stable (but still at a few cm/s) and must be locked to an external wavelength reference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Spectrograph Illumination and Stabilization</head><p>Performing any measurement on a recorded spectrum it is important to understand how the spectral lines are formed by the instrument, and if that has any effect on the results. The shape and position (the RV signal) of the 1-dimensional extracted line profile, or LSF, is affected by the following:</p><p>A. The wavelength dependent intensity of the light source, the actual spectrum we like to recover B. The stability of the spectrograph C. The shape, size and stability of the slit D. The light intensity distribution (illumination function) over the spectrograph slit E. The illumination function of the spectrograph optics F. The optical transfer function of the spectrograph 1</p><p>Of course A is affected by astrophysical processes we do not control. As we advance in controlling effects of B-F it becomes more and more obvious that we need a better understanding of the actual stellar spectrum, if we aim to push RV measurements to the cm/s level. Stellar noise (granulation, spots, plagues, active regions, etc.) is imprinted in the spectrum in a way that is very hard to reconstruct, even if we have full control over the instrumental effects (Section 5.2).</p><p>HARPS has paved the way to show how and what extent can we eliminate B by tightly controlling and stabilizing the environment of a spectrograph (gravity invariant location via fiber feed, to avoid time dependent mechanical distortions; vacuum enclosure to mitigate pressure and temperature variations that affect the optical properties; mK level temperature stabilization to avoid mechanical distortions due to non-zero/differential thermal expansion coefficients of the opto-mechanical elements).</p><p>The importance of C is obvious, since essentially every spectral line is a monochromatic image of the slit. This is a static component: once the shape and size of the spectrograph input is chosen, it does not change over time. It is important to note, though, that for exquisite stability the slit cannot be altered in any way, i.e. by adjusting the slit width or exchanging fiber feeds, since any error in repositioning directly translates to RV errors.</p><p>The size of the slit, or fiber, is constrained by light-coupling efficiency at the telescope focal plane. Usually the slit width is matched to the size of the median seeing disk. With recent advances in adaptive optics (e.g. the MagAO system on the Magellan telescope) a significant gain of throughput (or resolution, by applying a smaller slit) can be achieved even in the visible by feeding a spectrograph via an AO system. The table below lists estimated slit efficiencies for the GMT AO system in the visible, using different level of correction and assuming 0.7 arcsec circular slit, matching the median seeing condition. Using high order corrections the gain is significant, 70% at 550nm, almost halving the exposure time. For NIR spectrographs this is even more important. Besides overall throughput gain AO feeds can also contribute a lot to D, by stabilizing the slit illumination function. Tip-tilt or "first-order" AO systems have been employed at several spectrographs (TRES, HARPS, etc.), but operating at relatively low (0.1-10 Hz) frequencies the main objective is to quickly correct telescope guiding errors. For slit-fed spectrographs the star wandering within the jaws of the slit (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 47a</ref>) can cause severe RV errors, since the spectrograph optics translates a non-evenly illuminated slit to a side-lobed LSF. Thanks to the light-scrambling properties of fibers the output of an optical fiber, which serves as the "input slit" for the spectrograph, has much less of a resemblance how the light was fed into the fiber at the input (telescope) end. At the first order the star can be imaged a bit to the side of a fiber, the output end face is still evenly illuminated and thus results a stable LSF (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  47b</ref>). Circular cross section fibers, however, do not scramble light perfectly. The mixing of light rays in the azimuthal sense is nearly perfect, but in the radial direction it is not. (Shining a laser into a fiber at an angle, and projecting the light emerging from the fiber to a screen, can easily demonstrate this: the illumination pattern resembles a ring, not an expected Gaussian distribution.) Numerical simulations and laboratory tests clearly show (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 48</ref>) that breaking the non-circular geometry of the fiber can significantly improve on the scrambling. It was first explored by industrial applications where laser beam delivery for metal cutting required an even and constant distribution of light/heat, and so these applications started using square fibers. But D-shaped or hexagonal fibers works just as well. Astronomy prefers octagonal shapes since that is very close to the overall circular seeing limited image of a star. Coupling at the telescope is most efficient this way, while the 1-dimensional projected image of an octagonal slit is the narrowest and thus it provides the highest possible spectral resolution. (Using square fibers core of the LSF becomes a top-hat function, which is "less sharp".)</p><p>Since the LSF, as mentioned, is the monochromatic image of the slit, any change in the illumination distribution of the slit directly translates to changes in the line profile. These changes are often not 100% symmetric, resulting in the shift of the LSF barycenter, or an instrumental RV signal. Moreover, as apparent from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 48</ref>, the changes are wavelength dependent, so different spectral lines would exhibit different amount of instrumental drift, adding even further noise to a RV measurement. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 48</ref>. Illumination patterns at the fiber output (near-field) for on-axis and off-axis input illumination, for circular (top) and square (bottom) fibers. The two leftmost columns shows the input and output in white light, while the colored columns give a sense of wavelength dependence in 50 nm increments from 450 nm to 800 nm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 49</ref>. Illumination patterns at the spectrograph optics (far-field, or pupil illumination) for onaxis and off-axis input illumination for a square fiber. Unlike the near-field of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 48</ref>, the far field is still very sensitive to the fiber input conditions, even for a non-circular fiber geometry.</p><p>While non-circular fibers prevent changes in the slit illumination, or the so-called near-field, it only means that the spatial distribution of light rays, as those exit from the fiber, is even. But the angular distribution of light, so called the far-field (that one can observe projecting the light from a fiber to a distant screen) is also very important. The reason is that the optical transfer function (OTF) of the spectrograph highly depends on what part (and with what distribution of intensity) the optical elements are illuminated. Light passing through near the edges of lenses suffer more heavily of optical aberrations. Thus if a spectrograph is illuminated by a ring-like pattern it would produce heavily aberrated images of the slit, and the centroid of such LSF would be obviously different than the aberration free LSF of a more centrally illuminated optical system. Therefore the pupil illumination, E, or far-field pattern within a spectrograph is very important. Numerical simulations or laboratory experiments have shown that using non-circular fibers does not solve this problem (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 49</ref>). The way of minimizing this effect is therefore: -Use spectrograph design in which the pupil illumination is very similar at all wavelengths, since the OTF is also wavelength dependent. Therefore the white pupil optical arrangement is highly beneficial for PRV spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-</head><p>Use non-circular fibers along with an optical double scrambler. This is a simple (1-2 element) optical device that is inserted into a break of the fiber link. It injects the light emerging from the first section of the fiber run to the second section in such way, that the perfectly scrambled spatial distribution of rays (the near-field) is translated to an even angular distribution while the imperfectly scrambled angular distribution (the far-field) of the first fiber segment becomes the near-field for the second fiber segment. This way both the near field (the slit illumination) and the far-field (the spectrograph pupil illumination) gets evenly mixed and becomes uniform.</p><p>Build an optical system that is least sensitive to changes in pupil illumination, by design. During the optimization of a spectrograph optical design one can illuminate the system on the edge and the center, and calculate how much the resulting centroid locations of simulated line profiles would shift. The HARPS instrument was not designed this way, although by chance the system had such a behavior that changing pupil illumination shifted lines several hundred m/s to the blue at the short wavelength end of spectral orders, while an almost exactly same amplitude but opposite shift occurred for the lines at the long wavelength end of a spectral order. Thus, doing cross correlation over an entire spectral order, these effects cancelled each other resulting a net zero RV error. (Note, that if the RV content of the spectrum is not evenly distributed within a spectral order the net effect is not zero.) But other spectrograph designs, like SOPHIE, were not as lucky. Realizing this the next generation of PRV instruments are being designed with this in mind. The G-CLEF optical system for the GMT and the ESPRESSO design for the VLT both incorporated pupil-illumination insensitivity to the optical design process. While non-circular fiber geometries and optical double-scramblers stabilize and even out the near and far field illuminations, factors D and E are still varying in time due to physical changes in the fiber as temperature changes and/or the telescope moves. Since the seeing limited image of a star is at the order of several tens to several hundred microns (reaching mm scale with the ELTs), the optical fibers are inherently multi-mode. Even at a single wavelength light can propagate through such large core fiber in thousands of ways (modes). Looking at the intensity distribution at any point within or after the fiber (near field or far field) what we see is essentially the superposition (or interference) of these multiple modes. Such speckle pattern is clearly apparent when illuminating a fiber with a coherent source, like a laser. Such pattern changes as the fiber moves and the overall barycenter can also be affected by this, which translates to a small but disturbing instrumental RV signal. Agitating (shaking) the fiber can decrease this modal noise (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 51</ref>), although constant mechanical stress/disturbance of the fiber decreases the lifetime of the fiber link and results in some quality loss (increased focal ratio degradation, meaning that over time some fraction, up to 10%, of the light can be lost due to internal scattering as the fiber, that is constantly agitated, ages). Note, that at high resolutions the wavelength across the size of the slit (or in other words a spectral line) is so small that the light is almost monochromatic within the LSF. Another way of solving the modal noise problem is to utilize photonic devices. Recent developments of photonic lanterns and multicore fibers hold the promise of transferring light from a large core, multi-mode fiber into a set of single mode fibers (photonic lantern) or into a fiber that has a large diameter but light is essentially guided in many small fibers embedded within (multi-core fibers). Similarly to an optical double scrambler these devices can perform modal scrambling, further stabilizing the slit and pupil illumination. The total throughput of these devices is not sufficient yet, and the modal scrambling properties also need to be improved, but the technology is promising.</p><p>Last but not at least the optical transfer function (F) of the spectrograph is relevant for PRV stability since decoupling instrumental effects from astrophysical phenomena is only possible if we understand how and why the LSF is changing over time. Instrumental and environmental effects can alter the OTF (and thus the LSF), and unless calibration exposures can clearly show that these changes are internal to the instrument there is no way of knowing if the change was in the instrument or in the stellar source.</p><p>The problem is that in a realistic optical system the OTF is not known, since manufacturing and alignment errors can significantly alter it compared to the target optical design/model. Therefore modeling of the OTF is only possible by fitting real calibration data, e.g. emission line profiles of a ThAr lamp. But the illumination of a calibration source does not fully mimic the illumination of a stellar source -E.g. the number of modes excited in a fiber are very different for a steady and Gaussian or top-hat like calibration illumination, compared to the dancing speckle pattern of a star produced by atmospheric seeing. Thus changes seen in a calibration exposure LSF might not fully resemble the changes of the LSF of a stellar source.</p><p>The iodine cell (or other gas cell) technique is not sensitive to such de-coupling, since the calibration source is illuminated by starlight, essentially the science exposure carrying the calibration information. However, due to the relevant absorption, the limited wavelength range, and the complex modeling of iodine lines this technique has its own limitations.</p><p>Since every calibration and correction leaves residuals behind, it is a good strategy to minimize the need for the corrections or number of parameters that describe them. If the OTF of an optical system is highly varying along the spectrum (with wavelength and spatial position on the detector) then a large number of parameters are required to describe it, and also a large number of calibration features are required to provide sufficient data for fitting these parameters. It is possible, however, to design optical systems in which the OTF is a very smooth function of wavelength or spatial position on the detector (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 52)</ref>. By creating a PSF that is highly uniform across the entire echellogram the number of parameters describing the LSF in a calibration or stellar spectrum becomes minimal, and thus fitting is more robust, the residuals are smaller, resulting better PRV performance. Note, that it is only true, if such behavior (uniform PSF) is a property of the as-built optical system, thus not just the optical design process but also the tolerance analysis has to incorporate guidelines of PSF/OTF uniformity.</p><p>In any optical system that needs to cover a wide wavelength range there will be a dependence of the OTF with wavelength. But if the FWHM of the PSF of the spectrograph optics can be small compared to the geometrical image of the slit, then the shape of the LSF will be more dependent on the geometrical shape/size of the slit, C, which is constant in time and not dependent on wavelength. Thus in such case the recorded spectral lines will be very uniform across any given spectral order, or the entire recorded spectrum (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 53</ref>). Of course this is much easier to achieve when the image of the slit is several tens of microns, since typical imaging cameras of spectrographs render images of zero extent sources to a size of 2-20 microns (the FWHM of a camera optic PSF is at the order of a detector pixel). So for the 8-10m class telescopes or ELTs, where the spectrograph entrance slit is naturally large due to the large plate scale (1" per mm for the GMT), it is not hard to achieve a small PSF compared to the slit image. Still, for smaller telescopes and spectrographs it is advantageous to not just minimize the FWHM of the PSF of the spectrograph, but as pointed out above, to make it uniform even at the expense of not forcing the PSF to be as small as possible. , and comparing it to the same quantity for HARPS (right, single echellogram since HARPS has just one camera). Note how small the size of the PSF and its variation is, thanks to the optical design, for G-CLEF. NOTE that HARPS was not designed to such requirement, although they consciously enforced left and right symmetry, which luckily also brought the same symmetry for sensitivity in changes of pupil illumination (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 50</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 53</ref>. Spot diagrams for the G-CLEF camera designs, following the structure of the echellograms: each spot is placed according to its location on the focal plane. The boxes are 2x2 pixels (30x30 microns), and wavelengths are noted for each box, in Ångstroms. The spots are not just sharp, concentrated, mostly round and smooth, but very uniform across a spectral order (horizontally) or at least display a left-to-right symmetry within an order. In the middle, for comparison, the geometrical image of the slit (a fiber) is shown, to scale. It is clearly apparent that the pure geometrical image of the fiber end face is much larger than any of the spots. The shape of the recorded spectral lines, the LSF, is a convolution of this optical transfer function (the PSF) of the spectrograph and the slit input function (the fiber end face). Since latter is dominant, the resulting LSF is uniform across the echellogram, the intrinsic line width and shape is not a function of wavelength. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> In order to clearly distinguish between the point spread function (PSF) of the standalone spectrograph optics, (which is only dependent on the optical system itself) and the line profiles of the recorded spectrum (which depends not just on the PSF but also on the slit shape, slit illumination and pupil illumination) we refer to the PSF of the optics as the optical transfer function or OTF. This is valid since the OTF the Fourier transform of the PSF. We refer to the shape of the extracted one-dimensonal spectral line as the line spread function or LSF, which, again, is the result of the convolution and product of multiple instrumental properties/effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Diffraction Limited PRV Spectrographs</head><p>The motivation for developing new PRV spectrometers at NIR wavelengths is many-fold (Section 4.3). However, there exists an additional relevant threshold that is crossed when designing PRV instruments for wavelengths beyond λ=1.0 micron: it becomes possible to correct for Earth's turbulent atmosphere using adaptive optics to reach the diffraction limit of large aperture telescopes. Designing a spectrograph at the diffraction-limit behind an AO system works in favor of improved RV precision. Upon creating a spatially compact input image, gains in spatial resolution translate directly into higher spectral resolution and also higher SNR observations (see below). While seeing-limited instruments can achieve adequate resolution to sample stellar absorption lines, finer sampling yields higher Doppler precision and enables the study of more subtle effects involving line asymmetries, which are important for false-positive analysis involving starspots ( <ref type="bibr">Figueira et al. 2013</ref>). Furthermore, seeing-limited spectrometers require large and expensive gratings to measure precise Doppler shifts. In addition to a large beam diameter, the focal length of individual optics must be commensurately long to help mitigate aberrations. In comparison, the physical dimensions of a diffraction-limited spectrometer are an order of magnitude smaller in all directions, allowing for a small observatory footprint (mechanical, electrical), high spectral resolution using off-the-shelf components (R&gt;100,000), higher optical quality components, faster design and development timeline, improved thermal stability, and much lower overall cost.</p><p>Diffraction-limited designs can also completely eliminate spurious RV variations caused by modal noise. The pure Gaussian beam of a single-mode fiber provides a stable illumination of the spectrograph optics irrespective of changes to wave-guide boundary conditions. Singlemode design options (whether a single small fiber or multiplex) are not available to seeinglimited instruments given the large number of electromagnetic modes (thousands) excited by much larger optical fibers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Chazelas et al. 2010</ref>). Recent developments in the astro-photonics show promise for employing so-called "photonic-lanterns" to collect large amounts of starlight using multi-mode fibers, which then output an array of single-mode fibers, thus maximizing throughput while maintaining single-mode operation at the expense of detector real estate.  . Comparison input image size for telescopes limited by atmospheric turbulence and those using adaptive optics. As a result of this order of magnitude effect, a diffraction-limited spectrometer will achieve high spectral resolution, high spatial resolution, high throughput, and a compact optical design, while naturally operating in a wavelength range ideal for detecting extrasolar planets.</p><p>Improved spatial resolution not only benefits spectral resolution but also permits the identification of nearby stellar companions, either physically associated or background contaminants, which can easily confuse RV signals. In fact, the fiber acts to effectively "block out" starlight as viewed by the acquisition camera thus acting as a coronagraph. For example, the fore-optics in a diffraction-limited spectrometer could achieve high contrast to directly image nearby companion stars that dilute transit observations or create false positive signals. Such capabilities would offer a powerful tool for reconnaissance Kepler and TESS observations and save telescope time by instead maintaining focus on the highest priority candidate planets.</p><p>A diffraction-limited input image also reduces the intensity of bright OH-emission lines by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to seeing-limited designs. While initially envisioned as a possible wavelength reference, the intrinsic stability of OH-lines limits RV precision to several tens of meters per second, even when NIR observations are coupled with detailed atmospheric modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Blake et al. 2007</ref>; see also Section 6.2.1.1). By reducing the signal of OH-lines, AOfed Doppler spectrometers thus achieve a higher SNR ratio. Further, internal Bragg gratings used to suppress the brightest OH-lines in multi-mode fibers may also be used in tandem with much smaller fibers, including single mode.</p><p>In addition to the numerous practical benefits of developing diffraction-limited PRV instruments, AO-fed spectrographs provide access to science cases completely inaccessible to seeinglimited designs, such as the ability to study planets orbiting close-separation binary stars (Figures 55). Binary stars constitute 50% of all stellar systems, yet our understanding of planet formation and evolution is currently based on single stars alone. Due to a selection bias, seeinglimited spectrometers cannot spatially separate the light from two nearby sources. A diffraction-limited spectrometer can circumvent this issue by using AO to prevent spectral contamination and enable the first systematic study of planets in close-separation binaries.</p><p>Studies of the binary planet population also have important theoretical implications for our understanding of how planets form and evolve:</p><p>• How does the occurrence rate of planets change as a function of binary star separation?</p><p>• How does the occurrence rate of planets change as a function of binary star mass ratio?</p><p>• How does the eccentricity distribution of planets in binaries differ from that of single stars?</p><p>The presence of a second star changes the properties of a protoplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Artymowicz &amp; Lubow 1994)</ref> and, depending on its separation and relative inclination, may either promote or inhibit the growth of dust grains, planetesimals, and embryos ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Payne et al. 2009</ref>). Models must be able to account for this extra source of radiation and gravity and would benefit significantly from observational constraints in addition to those imposed by single stars alone.</p><p>Closely spaced binaries (&lt; 100 AU) can offer unique testing grounds to help discriminate between various planet formation models. A diffraction-limited spectrograph would enable the first RV survey that systematically targets systems with progressively smaller separations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 56</ref>). Benefiting from an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution, it becomes possible to explore an expansive, important, and as yet unstudied parameter space. In other words, PRV measurements using an AO-fed design will pave the road towards a much deeper understanding of planet formation and evolution.   </p></div>

(2015, Figure 4): The mass-radius diagram for planets smaller than 2.7R Earth with masses measured to better than 20% precision (Dressing et al. 2015). The shaded gray region in the lower right indicates planets with iron content exceeding the maximum value predicted from models of collisional stripping (Marcus et al. 2010). The solid lines are theoretical mass-radius curves (Zeng &amp; Sasselov 2013) for planets with compositions of 100% H 2 O (blue), 25% MgSiO 3 -75% H2O (purple), 50% MgSiO 3 -50% H2O (green), 100% MgSiO 3 (black), 50% Fe -50% MgSiO 3 (red), and 100% Fe (orange). The best-fit relation based on the Zeng &amp; Sasselov (2013) models is the dashed light blue line representing an Earth-like composition (modeled as 17% iron and 83% magnesium silicate using a fully-differentiated, two-component model). The shaded region surrounding the line indicates the 2% dispersion in radius expected from variation in Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios (Grasset et al. 2009).</figDesc></figure>

For this computation, we use synthetic SEDs from the BT-Settl models at log g = 4.5 with solar metallicity (Allard et al. 2012), and the results are shown in Figure 28. In Figure 29, we divide Table 1 from Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015) and apply a normalization to scale the results from Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015) to match the parameters in Bottom et al. (2013). The figures are qualitatively similar, and in Figure 30 we plot the ratio of the two figures, interpolated on the Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015) wavelength and temperature grid. Figure 30 shows that the predicted RV precision from the independent works of Bottom et al. (2013) and Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015) agree to within ~40% over all wavelengths and stellar effective temperatures which is remarkable given the independent approaches taken by the authors. There are subtle differences between the two approaches: 1) Bottom et al. (2013) predicts a better RV precision than Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2015) for stellar effective temperatures of &gt;3500 K and wavelengths &lt; 0.7 microns. 2) Beatty et al.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_46"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Starspots dominate the stellar jitter for rapidly rotating stars, because the distortion of the RV increases with the projected rotational velocity, v sin(i). Above a v sin(i) of 3 or 4 km/s, starspots dominate the RV variation even if plages are present. For slowly rotating stars, stellar jitter induced by the inhibition of convection by plages can dominate. A recent study by Dumusque et al. (2014) based on observations of the Sun and including the effect of the inhibition of convection inside active regions can be used to estimate the RV effect of spots and plages. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitude in m/s that a spot with a filling factor f can induce is given by í µí»¥í µí± í µí± = í µí±×(1.04 + 4.65 í µí±£ í µí± í µí±í µí±(í µí±) + 0.40 í µí±£ í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí± 2 − 0.02 í µí±£ í µí± í µí±í µí± í µí± 3 )</figDesc></figure>

Variation of these indicators is a warning that observed RV variations may be due to plages and/or spots on the stellar surface. For M dwarfs the H-alpha emission and sodium activity index are useful activity indicators (Gomes da Silva 2012).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_49"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Gilliland et al. (2011) reported that the Sun was among the quietest 15% of stars based upon the photometric variability of main sequence stars in the Kepler data set. Indeed, radial velocities surveys with HARPS and HARPS-N are targeting the most quiescent nearby stars, since they will be the easiest to probe down to lower exoplanet masses. However, the Gilliland et al. (2011) result makes use of a noise estimate on a time-scale of hours (CDPP6 from the Kepler mission), which is of course relevant to transiting exoplanets with transit durations on the order of several hours. This time-scale is not relevant for the radial RV search of exoplanets in Habitable-Zone orbits around main-sequence stars. Instead, Basri et al. (2013) report that the Sun is a more "normal" star in terms of stellar activity, from analysis of Kepler photometric variability on time-scales of months and years. The median logR' HK of the Sun is ~ -4.95, which is slightly quieter than α Cen B's value of ~ -4.90. Compared to other Solar-type stars (e.g. Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand 2008), the Sun is also a typical star in this regard. The rotational modulation of starspots for the Sun is modeled from solar data to be ~0.4 m/s (Makarov et al. 2009). For comparison, the rotational modulation of star-spots for α Cen B is reported in Dumusque et al. (2012) to produce a semi-amplitude of ~2 m/s -a factor of five higher that can likely be attributed to its later spectral type. The integrated RV of the Sun as a star can be estimated in several ways. One can use the empirical relation σ RV versus photometric RMS flux found by Paulson et al. (2004) for the Hyades. Using the multi-year photometric variability of the Sun estimated from the PMOD TSI (total solar irradiance) data, the average solar RV variation comes up to 1.7 m/s. However, the Sun is a much older star than the Hyades, and rotates more slowly. The RV variation caused by star spots and other photometric features on the surface is proportional to the projected rotational velocity, v sin(i), as shown in Makarov (2009). Assuming an average v sin(i) = 5.6 km/s for the Hyades sample, the estimate should be scaled down to 0.6 m/s for the Sun.</figDesc></figure>

Relative time to detect a HabitableZone planet of a fixed mass as a function of stellar effective temperature and wavelength of observation, for a spectral grasp of 0.1 microns. Hashed regions indicate atmospheric telluric absorption bands. This figure demonstrates the advantage of going to longer wavelengths for lower-mass targets, and that there is little difference in survey time for M dwarfs from 0.7 to 2.5 microns. The analysis is based on photon plus read-noise estimates only, and does not include instrumental nor stellar activity noise models, the latter of which is likely to be wavelengthdependent (See Section 4.3).</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, members of the PRV community are confident that near-infrared instruments can be developed to be stable at the level of 1-3 m/s, approaching the current performance of visible spectrographs. Three examples are now under development: CARMENES at Calar-Alto (~2015; Quirrenbach et al. 2012), the Habitable Planet Finder on the HET (~2016; Mahadevan et al. 2012), and SPIRou on the CFHT (~2017; Artigau 2014). There is a large number of planned or in development PRV spectrometers, both in the visible and near-infrared. Herein we provide a list of these spectrometers. Another excellent list is maintained by the CARMENES spectrograph team (http://carmenes.caha.es/ext/spectrographs/index.html).</figDesc></figure>

Real changes in the far field illumination are not as extreme, of course, so above results proportionally scale down accordingly, resulting sub-micron shifts of the spectral lines (which are still significant, hundreds of m/s in RV space). Still, it is clear that a thoughtful spectrograph design (G-CLEF blue arm, left) can significantly decrease the false RV signals due to pupil illumination changes. NOTE that the similar figure for HARPS has a color scale that is 10x larger. Also note that HARPS was not designed with pupil illumination insensitivity in mind since back then its importance was not yet recognized.</figDesc></figure>

As of 
2010, the state of the art consisted of using telluric lines for wavelength calibration, resulting in 
achieved precisions of ~50-100 m/s (Tanner et al. 2012, Crockett et al. 2012, Bailey et al. 
2012). Instruments that require cryogenic cooling can often be a factor of a few times more expensive than Habitable Planet Finder (Mahadevan et al. 2012, Quirrenbach et al. 2012, Yuk et al. 2010, 
Rayner et al. 2012). Additionally, recent advances have pushed the achievable RV precision in 
the NIR, with current facilities now closer to parity with the visible, using ammonia and isotopic 
methane absorption gas cells (Bean et al. 2010, Anglada-Escude et al. 2012b, Plavchan et al. 
2013a), and the recent commissioning of a NIR fiber scrambler prototype with non-circular core 
fibers on CSHELL at the IRTF (Plavchan et al. 2013b). The next generation of NIR facilities 
hold the potential to achieve ~1 m/s single measurement precision, but much work will be 
needed over the next several years, including improvements in the analysis and removal of 
telluric lines and the generation of stellar templates (Seifahrt et al. 2010).

(~1 m/s) on NASA-, NSF-, or privately-funded telescopes. These instruments would 
provide the cadence, precision, and wide sky coverage needed for surveys to find rocky 
planets orbiting nearby stars. Some of these upgrades or new instruments using existing
