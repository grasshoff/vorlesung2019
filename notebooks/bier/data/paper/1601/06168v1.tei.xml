			<abstract>
				<p>Determining which small exoplanets have stony-iron compositions is necessary for quantifying the occurrence of such planets and for understanding the physics of planet formation. Kepler-10 hosts the stony-iron world Kepler-10b, and also contains what has been reported to be the largest solid silicate-ice planet, Kepler-10c. Using 220 radial velocities (RVs), including 72 precise RVs from Keck-HIRES of which 20 are new from 2014-2015, and 17 quarters of Kepler photometry, we obtain the most complete picture of the Kepler-10 system to date. We find that Kepler-10b (R p = 1.47 R ⊕) has mass 3.72 ± 0.42 M ⊕ and density 6.46 ± 0.73 g cm −3. Modeling the interior of Kepler-10b as an iron core overlaid with a silicate mantle, we find that the iron core constitutes 0.17 ± 0.11 of the planet mass. For Kepler-10c (R p = 2.35 R ⊕) we measure mass 13.98 ± 1.79 M ⊕ and density 5.94 ± 0.76 g cm −3 , significantly lower than the mass computed in Dumusque et al. (2014, 17.2 ± 1.9 M ⊕). Our mass measurement of Kepler-10c rules out a pure stony-iron composition. Internal compositional modeling reveals that at least 10% of the radius of Kepler-10c is a volatile envelope composed of hydrogen-helium (0.2% of the mass, 16% of the radius) or super-ionic water (28% of the mass, 29% of the radius). However, we note that analysis of only HIRES data yields a higher mass for planet b and a lower mass for planet c than does analysis of the HARPS-N data alone, with the mass estimates for Kepler-10 c being formally inconsistent at the 3σ level. Moreover, dividing the data for each instrument into two parts also leads to somewhat inconsistent measurements for the mass of planet c derived from each observatory. Together, this suggests that time-correlated noise is present and that the uncertainties in the masses of the planets (especially planet c) likely exceed our formal estimates. Transit timing variations (TTVs) of Kepler-10c indicate the likely presence of a third planet in the system, KOI-72.X. The TTVs and RVs are consistent with KOI-72.X having an orbital period of 24, 71, or 101 days, and a mass from 1-7 M ⊕ .</p>

To understand the formation of these common planets, we must constrain their compositions. Are they terrestrial, or are they "water worlds" that are primarily water by volume, or are they stony-iron cores overlaid with thick, hydrogen-rich envelopes of volatiles?</p><p>In the last few years, the exoplanet community has measured the masses of dozens of small exoplanets, enabling the study of the compositions of individual planets and the identification of several stony-iron super-Earths. Corot-7 b (R p = 1.58 ± 0.10R ⊕ , M p = 5.37 ± 1.02 M ⊕ ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruntt et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Haywood et al. 2014</ref>) and Kepler-10 b (R p = 1.46 ± 0.034 R ⊕ , M p = 4.56 ± 1.23 M ⊕ ; <ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>) were the first stony-iron planets discovered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carter et al. (2012)</ref> used transit timing variations to determine the mass of Kepler-36 b from orbital perturbations it induced on neighboring planet Kepler-36 c. At the time of writing, Kepler-36 b has the bestdetermined mass and density of the known rocky exoplanets (M p = 4.56±1.23, ρ p = 8.8±2.5g cm −3 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Howard et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pepe et al. (2013)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grunblatt et al. (2015)</ref> measured the mass of the Earth-density planet Kepler-78 b (R p = 1.20 ± 0.09R ⊕ , M p = 1.87 ± 0.26M ⊕ , ρ p = 6.0 ± 1.7g cm −3 ), the closest Earth-analog in terms of planet mass, radius, and density, although it is far too hot to support life as we know it.</p><p>However, some small planets have definitively nonrocky surfaces and require hydrogen-helium envelopes to explain their low bulk densities. For instance, three of the six planets orbiting Kepler-11 are smaller than 4 R ⊕ and have densities lower than 1.0 g cm −3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lissauer et al. 2013</ref>). Likewise, two of four the planets orbiting Kepler-79 (a.k.a. KOI-152) are smaller than 4 R ⊕ and have densities lower than 1.0 g cm −3 (Jontof- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hutter et al. 2014</ref>). In an intensive Kepler follow-up campaign spanning 4 years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marcy et al. (2014)</ref> measured or constrained the masses of 42 small exoplanets using Keck-HIRES, finding many planets that have volatiles and a few planets that might have stony-iron compositions.</p><p>The mass measurements listed above allowed the community to probe composition trends within the planet population. Based on the density-radius distribution of 65 exoplanets smaller than Neptune, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref> found two empirical relations: among planets smaller than 1.5 R ⊕ , density increases nearly linearly with increasing planet radius in a manner consistent with a stony-iron composition like Earth's. However, bulk density decreases with increasing radius for planets between 1.5-4.0 R ⊕ , implying an increasing admixture of volatiles above 1.5 R ⊕ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rogers (2015)</ref> used a hierarchical Bayesian framework to rigorously test the transition from stony-iron planets to planets with a gaseous envelope and found that at and above 1.6 R ⊕ , the majority of planets have a volatile envelope, while the remaining minority are sufficiently dense to be comprised of iron and silicate only. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dressing et al. (2015)</ref> measured the mass of Kepler-93 b (R p = 1.478 ± 0.019, M p = 4.02 ± 0.68) and determined that Kepler-93 b and the other known rocky planets <ref type="bibr">(Kepler-78 b, Kepler-36 b, Kepler-10 b, and Corot-7 b)</ref> all have masses and radii that can be explained with an iron-silicate composition. By contrast, KOI-273 b (R p = 1.82 ± 0.10R ⊕ , M p = 5.46 ± 2.50M ⊕ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gettel et al. 2015</ref>) is too big to be rocky and requires a small volatile envelope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wolfgang &amp; Lopez (2015)</ref> used a hierarchical Bayesian model to explore the diversity of planet mass, density, and composition as a function of planet radius. They found that planets smaller than 1.5 R ⊕ are typically rocky, whereas planets larger than 1.5 R ⊕ typically require a small fraction of hydrogen gas or other volatiles to explain their densities. Furthermore, small differences in the mass fraction of hydrogen in the planet's envelope explain the broad range of planet densities at a given radius for planets between 2-4R ⊕ .</p><p>Although planets smaller than 1.5 R ⊕ tend to be stonyiron and planets larger than 1.5 R ⊕ tend to have at least a small hydrogen envelope, there are exceptions to the pattern. In the Kepler-138 system, which contains three planets smaller than 1.5 R ⊕ , at least one planet, Kepler-138 d (R p = 1.212 ± 0.075R ⊕ , M p = 0.640 +0.674 −0.387 M ⊕ , ρ p = 2.1 +2.2 −1.2 g cm −3 ), has a low enough density to require a volatile envelope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kipping et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jontof-Hutter et al. 2015</ref>). Kepler-138 d is the smallest exoplanet that we know to contain a gaseous envelope.</p><p>The Kepler-10 system is a powerful testing ground for our understanding of the compositions of small planets. Kepler-10 is a sun-like star with slow rotation and little stellar activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dumusque et al. 2014</ref>). It has two planets discovered via transits in the Kepler Mission: Kepler-10 b, which has an orbital period of 0.84 days and radius 1.47 R ⊕ , and Kepler-10 c, which has an orbital period of 45 days and radius 2.35 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Du- musque et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. (2011, hereafter B11)</ref> measured the mass and bulk density of Kepler-10 b and determined that it was rocky, making this planet the first rocky planet discovered by the Kepler Mission, and the second rocky exoplanet discovery. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Du- musque et al. (2014, hereafter D14)</ref> reported that Kepler-10 c has a radius of 2.35 R ⊕ , a mass of 17.2±1.9 M ⊕ , and a density of 7.1± 1.0g cm −3 . Based on its position in the mass-radius diagram, D14 interpreted the composition of Kepler-10 c as mostly rock by mass, with the remaining mass in volatiles of high mean-molecular weight (likely water). They noted, however, that compositional degeneracy prevented them from determining the precise water fraction.</p><p>Kepler-10 c is unusual in that the mass reported in D14 is large compared to other exoplanets its size. Most exoplanets with radii 2.0-2.5 R ⊕ have much lower masses than 17 M ⊕ , with a weighted mean mass of 5.4 M ⊕ <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014</ref>) in that size range. For example, HD 97658 b, a planet discovered in RVs ( ) that was subsequently observed to transit its star, has a radius of 2.34 ± 0.16 R ⊕ and a mass of 7.87 ± 0.73 M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dragomir et al. 2013</ref>). Kepler-68 b has a radius of 2.32 ± 0.02 R ⊕ and a mass of 7.15 ± 2.0 M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gilliland et al. 2013</ref>). Although there is a large scatter in the observed masses between 2 and 2.5 R ⊕ , this scatter results from a few low-mass planets of this size. For example, Kepler-11 f, which has a radius of 2.49 ± 0.06 R ⊕ , has a mass of 1.94 +0.32 −0.88 M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2013, Weiss et al. in prep.)</ref>. In contrast, the most massive planet in this size range other than Kepler-10 c is Kepler-131 b. The initial mass measurement of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-131 b (Marcy et al. 2014</ref>) was R p = 2.41 ± 0.20 R ⊕ , M p = 16.13 ± 3.50 M ⊕ , resulting in a bulk density of 6.0 ± 1.98 g cm −3 , but additional measurements obtained since publication show the mass to be much smaller; the confusion was from astrophysical rather than instrumental sources (personal communication, H. Isaacson in prep.). Thus, Kepler-10 c seems to be unusual in its high mass for planets between 2-2.5 R ⊕ . All of these planets except Kepler-10 c are included in the empirical mass-radius relation to exoplanets between 1.5 and 4 R ⊕ (M p /M ⊕ = 2.69(R p /R ⊕ ) 0.93 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014)</ref>, according to which a planet of size 2.3 R ⊕ should have a mass of 5.8 M ⊕ .</p><p>In this paper, we build on the data and analysis of D14, adhering to the techniques therein as completely as possible but with the addition of 72 RVs from Keck-HIRES, in an effort to calculate a new and improved two-planet orbital solution for the Kepler-10 system. We also notice that Kepler-10 c exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs), i.e. perturbations to its orbit, as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kipping et al. (2015)</ref>. Because Kepler-10 b is dynamically distant from Kepler-10 c (P c /P b = 54), Kepler-10 b cannot perturb Kepler-10 c sufficiently to reproduce the observed TTVs. Therefore, we infer the existence of a third planet in the system, planet candidate KOI-72.X, which explains the observed TTVs. We explore various dynamic configurations for KOI-72.X that reproduce the observed TTVs and are consistent with the RVs as well. Finally, we comment on the compositions of Kepler-10 b and Kepler-10 c, and how their masses, radii, and densities compare to those of other small transiting planets.</p><p>HIRES has a long history of achieving precision RVs with an RMS of ∼ 2 m s −1 on quiet, sun-like stars over many years of observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howard et al. 2010;</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Our group has used HIRES to measure and place upper limits on the masses of many small planets, especially in the Kepler era (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marcy et al. 2014</ref>). Because the planets transit and are vetted through a variety of astrophysical techniques, the burden of confirming the planet does not fall entirely to radial velocities. In this case, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fressin et al. (2011)</ref> validated the planetary nature of Kepler-10 c, incorporating the transit shape and depth in multiple passbands, highresolution imaging and spectroscopy of the host star, and stellar population synthesis to find a conservative false alarm probability of 1.6 × 10 −5 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lissauer et al. (2012)</ref> demonstrated the very low probability of having a false alarm planet in a multi-planet system, further reducing the false alarm probability of Kepler-10 c by an order of magnitude. Thus, it is not necessary to determine the mass of Kepler-10 c (or any other statistically validated small planet) with 3σ significance in order to confirm the planet's existence or to make statistically significant claims about the composition of the planet. A mass upper limit might exclude a purely stony-iron composition with 3σ confidence while only being 1σ away from a mass of zero. Such planets provide valuable information about the exoplanet population, and excluding them from population studies on the basis of their large fractional mass uncertainty (σ m /m) will systematically exclude the lowmass exoplanets. Modern exoplanet mass-radius relations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rogers 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wolfgang &amp; Lopez 2015)</ref> incorporate the low-significance mass detections.</p><p>Both the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs have successfully obtained high-precision RVs of Kepler stars in the past ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>). Notably, two teams used each spectrograph to independently measure the RV signal from the low-mass planet Kepler-78 b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Howard et al. (2013)</ref> obtained a mass of 1.69±0.41M ⊕ for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-78 b, and Pepe et al. (2013)</ref> obtained a mass of 1.86 ± 0.32. The independent detections of the RV signal in both spectrometers, and the agreement in the amplitude of that signal, demonstrate that both the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrometers are capable of accurately and precisely measuring low-amplitude RV signals.</p><p>Ground-based RV follow-up of Kepler-10 has been ongoing since Kepler-10 b and Kepler-10 c were discovered. B11 presented 52 RVs obtained on <ref type="bibr">Keck-HIRES in 2009</ref>, the first seasons after Kepler-10 b and c were discovered, and D14 presented 148 RVs obtained on TNG-HARPS-N that span the summers of 2012-2013. The early measurements presented in B11 targeted the quadrature times of planet b, whereas the later measurements from D14 targeted the quadrature times of planet c.</p><p>We present 20 additional RVs from 2014-2015 which, in combination with all the previous RVs, comprise the largest dataset of Kepler-10 RVs to date of 220 RVs total <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1 and</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). HARPS-N, which is a fiberfed, thermally stable spectrometer in a vacuum, achieves better velocity precision at given signal-to-noise than the HIRES spectrometer, but the larger aperture of the Keck telescope (10 m compared to 3.6 m) collects more pho- tons. Thus, both telescope-spectrometer setups achieve a velocity precision of a few m s −1 per half hour observing Kepler-10. Although only 20 RVs were taken since the publication of D14, combining all the data provides several major advantages over either the B11 or D14 data alone. Because the Kepler field is best accessible during the summer, the data from both HIRES and HARPS-N are clumped in intervals of 2-3 months, a timescale barely longer than the orbital period of Kepler-10 c (45.3 days). Observing just 1-2 orbits of planet c could be problematic if the stellar rotation period is comparable to the orbital period of planet c and temporarily phases with the orbit of planet c over a few rotation cyles. Furthermore, incomplete observing phase coverage combined with noise can result in additional power in an alias of the planetary signal or a peak resulting from the window function <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dawson &amp; Fabrycky 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rajpaul et al. 2015</ref>). The combined data cover observing phase as a function of sidereal day, solar day, and solar year better than either data set does alone (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), improving our resilience to noise manifesting in monthly and yearly aliases of planet c's orbit. Furthermore, the combined baseline of 6 years <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref> is much longer than the 2-year baseline achieved in either of the previous papers. The long observing baseline helps to average out possible spurious signals that can arise from stellar activity on the timescales of stellar rotation and convection (∼ 1 month). The long baseline also improves our sensitivity to possible long-period sig-nals. These advantages motivate combining all of the reliable data.  Offsets between the RV data sets have been applied.

Any correlations in the final RVs with the heights of these Gaussians (PSF parameters) likely indicate small inadequacies of our PSF model to completely describe the shape of the instrumental PSF. RV shifts caused by the gravitational influence of orbiting bodies should not be correlated with the shape of the instrumental PSF.</p><p>In order to clean the RVs of any possible systematic trends we detrend the final RVs by removing correlations with the instrumental PSF parameters, the magnitude of the RV uncertainty, and the S/N ratio of the spectrum. After masking any 5σ outliers, we search for significant correlations by calculating the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for each of these variables with RV (Spearman1904). We take note of any parameters that show a correlation coefficient greater than 0.1 and include these variables in a multivariate ordinary least squares linear regression using the STATSMODELS 5 package in Python. This final multidimensional surface is then subtracted from the final RVs. This technique improves the RMS of the RV time series of Kepler-10 from 4.9 m s −1 to 4.6 m s −1 by detrending against nine PSF parameters and the S/N ratio of the spectra. To check that the detrending algorithm does not accidentally remove the signal of the planets, we calculated a two-planet circular fit to both the detrended and non-detrended RVs. The RMS of the change in RV introduced by the detrending algorithm was 1.2 m s −1 (i.e., less than the uncertainty in each RV), and the solutions for all parameters were consistent within 0.1 m s −1 (much less than our 1σ uncertainties in the parameters). We do not add the random noise introduced by the detrending algorithm to our error budget because our technique for solving for the jitter (see Equation 1) naturally incorporates the uncertainties that arise through this method. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the Kepler-10 RVs from HIRES and HARPS-N phase-folded to the orbital periods of the two transiting planets, with red diamonds indicating the weighted mean RV in bins of 0.1 orbital phases to guide the eye. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows the MCMC posterior distributions of two-planet circular fits to the HIRES RVs alone (blue) and the HARPS-N RVs alone (green).

We are motivated to explore a two-planet circular orbit because the RVs do not demand eccentric orbits for either Kepler-10 b or Kepler-10 c. Furthermore, B11 and D14 model the Kepler-10 system with circular orbits, so we explore a two-planet circular fit to enable a direct comparison to their results.</p><p>The photometrically determined transit times from Kepler constrain the orbital ephemerides of Kepler-10 b and c. Specifically, the photometry precisely constrains the time of transit, orbital period, and inclination of each planet. The remaining free dynamical parameter for each planet is the mass. We solve for the mass via the observable semi-amplitude of the RV sinusoid, K.</p><p>In addition to the dynamical parameters, fitting RVs from two different spectrographs incurs several nuisance parameters. There is a zero point offset for each set of RVs. Each measured RV has some internal uncertainty, plus error of astrophysical origin (from stellar oscillations, plage, starspots, magnetic activity, etc.), plus additional errors from the spectrometer. For each spectrometer, we report the combined astrophysicallyinduced error and spectrometer-induced error as a jitter term, σ jitter , which we add in quadrature with the internal uncertainty in the RV to obtain the total uncertainty of each RV. The internal uncertainty of the RV varies from measurement to measurement, whereas the jitter term is the same for all RVs taken by a single spectrometer.</p><p>Therefore, the two-planet circular fit has seven free parameters: the semi-amplitude of the RVs resulting from planet b (K b ), the semi-amplitude of the RVs resulting from planet c (K c ), the velocity zero-point of the RVs (γ), an offset between the RVs taken by the HIRES spectrograph and the RVs taken on the pre-upgrade HARPS-N CCD (offset 1), an offset between the RVs taken by the HIRES spectrograph and the RVs taken on the post-upgrade HARPS-N CCD (offset 2), the jitter of the HIRES spectrograph (j 1 ) and the the jitter of the HARPS-N spectrograph (j 2 ).

David Kipping measured the transit times TT Kip , as documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kipping et al. (2015)</ref>, and Eric Agol measured the transit times TT Agol with the method described here. To include the impact of correlated noise on the transit timing uncertainty measured from the short cadence data, we carried out the following procedure: 1) We did a joint fit to the transits of both planets assuming white noise and polynomial detrending near each transit. Overlapping transits of the two planets were modeled simultaneously. We let the transit times of 10 c vary, but fixed the transit times of 10 b to a periodic ephemeris. 2) We optimized this fit with a Levenberg-Marquardt model, and then subtracted it from the short cadence data. 3) We computed the autocovariance of the residuals to this initial fit for the short cadence light curve as a function of the number of cadences, a(n), where a(0) is the variance of the data and a(1) is the covariance between residuals separated by one cadence, etc. We concatenated data across gaps when computing the autocovariance as these gaps are a small fraction of the entire dataset. 4) Using the computed autocovariance of the data, we computed the best-fit transit model to Kepler-10 c with the model for Kepler-10 b subtracted. We did not detrend at this stage, but instead used a covariance matrix computed from a(n):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σ i,j = a(|i − j|).

We then allowed transit time to vary by ±3σ t,i for each transit, and mapped out the effective chi-square, χ 2 = −2 ln L, versus timing offset. 5) We found the upper and lower time offsets at which the χ 2 of the fit changed by one, and chose the maximum of these offsets and σ t,i to estimate the transit timing uncertainty. The best-fit times of transit and the uncertainty are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.  were due to noise, rather than planetary dynamics. First, we used a bootstrap test, which is a common method in the RV literature to assess whether an apparently coherent, sinusoidal signal could be produced by noise. Second, we used a Monte Carlo test. We applied each test to both TT Agol and TT Kip .  We numbered the observed TTVs (O-C values) from 1-N and produced 10,000 fake data sets of length N . To construct each fake data set, we randomly drew a number j between 1 and N and used the jth observed transit as the first transit in our fake data set. We repeated this procedure (including the possibility of drawing j again) until we had a fake data set of length N . Thus, it would be possible to draw j N times, or to draw each number between 1 and N exactly once, or any other combination from the N N possibilities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Analytical Motivation</head><p>If the observed coherent TTVs are due to the dynamical interactions of planets in the system, they indicate the presence of a third planet (KOI-72.X). Known planets (b and c) cannot cause the TTVs because planet c cannot be its own perturber, and planet b is too far away in period space (P c /P b = 54) to perturb planet c at the amplitude observed. Therefore, the best dynamical explanation of the TTVs is the existence of a third planet. The periodogram of the residual RVs after the RVs due to planets b and c are subtracted does not present a strong peak (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>). Therefore we cannot unambiguously identify the orbital period KOI-72.X from the RVs alone.</p><p>We use analytic theory to predict the most likely orbital periods of a third planet. Equation 5 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lithwick et al. (2012)</ref>, also called the TTV equation, relates the super-period of the TTVs to the orbital periods of the two planets:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 P TTV = j P − j − 1 P (2)</formula><p>where P TTV is the super-period measured from the TTV sinusoid, P is the inner period, P is the outer period, and the planets are near the j : j − 1 resonance. Because the perturber can exist just inside or just outside the j : j − 1 mean motion resonance, and because the perturber can be interior or exterior, there are 4 solutions for each j : j − 1. Using Equation 2, we can predict a series of likely orbital periods for the perturber, planet candidate KOI-72.X, which are enumerated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>6.2. Dynamical Solutions For each candidate orbital period for KOI-72.X listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, we perform a series of numerical N-body integrations using <ref type="bibr">TTVFast (Deck et al. 2014</ref>). We use the analytically predicted orbital parameters as inputs to the integrator at epoch T 0(BJD − 2454900) = 53.67844. TTVFast predicts the times of transit of each planet in the N-body simulation, and the RVs of the star at the times of RV observation. To determine the orbital parameters that best reproduce the observed transit times and RVs, we minimize the following statistic:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">χ 2 = k (TT c,k − TT c,mod,k ) 2 σ 2</formula><p>TT,c,k</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">+ i (RV i − RV mod,i ) 2 σ 2 RV,i<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the residuals between the observed and modeled transit times and RVs are simultaneously minimized. We fit the TTVs of only planet c, since planet b does not have significant, coherent TTVs. We use a combination of a Nelder-Mead and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) minimization algorithm to find the orbital parameters and masses for planets c and d that produce a local minimum near the input orbital period. We allow the period (P ), eccentricity (e), argument of periastron passage (ω), mean anomaly (M ), and mass (m) of planets c and d to vary. We fix the inclination i = 90 • and longitude of ascending node Ω = 0 • for all planets, for simplicity.

Even after using the Nelder-Mead minimizer to find the best orbital parameters for planets c and d with this initial guess, the lowest value of χ 2 attained is 269, which is significantly worse (according to the BIC) than any of the analytically predicted solutions, with ∆BIC = 52 (i.e. very strongly disfavored) with respect to the best three-planet solution. Thus, we numerically demonstrate that the TTV equation accurately predicts orbital periods for KOI-72.X that best reproduce the observed TTVs.</p><p>In the last row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> ("ctrl. 2"), we perform an N-body integration in which we simulate only planet b (which still has fixed orbital properties and a fixed mass) and planet c (for which the orbital parameters and mass are allowed to vary). The χ 2 statistic for this control test is 267 (∆BIC = 22.5), demonstrating that the best threeplanet solution is strongly favored over the two-planet solution. In particular, the solutions for KOI-72.X at P=101, 24, and 71 days achieve significantly lower BIC values than the two-planet model, suggesting that these orbital periods are strongly favored over a two-planet model.</p><p>The transit duration variations (TDVs) of Kepler-10 c are negligible. The various coplanar solutions for KOI-72.X that we examine all produce negligible TDVs as well, and so TDVs do not help break the degeneracy of the orbit for KOI-72.X in this particular system. The absence of TDVs implies that KOI-72.X is not highly inclined with respect to planets b and c.</p><p>The various dynamical solutions for KOI-72.X yield m X between 1-7M ⊕ . Without being able to choose the correct dynamical solution, we cannot pinpoint the mass of non-transiting planet candidate. However, the masses that best fit the TTVs and RVs are consistent with the population of low-mass, small planets discovered by Kepler and η-Earth surveys.</p><p>The family of solutions for KOI-72.X all yield similar masses for planet c (13.5-15 M ⊕ ). This is likely because (1) the mass of KOI-72.X is small, meaning that it contributes little to the RVs, (2) planet c cannot create its own TTVs, and so the presence of TTVs should not be correlated with planet mass. For Kepler-10 c, modeling the TTVs with an N-body integrator does not result in an erroneously low planet mass. In this section, we estimate compositions of the planets Kepler-10 b and Kepler-10 c assuming the mass estimates from our formal fits using all available data. However, given the issues discussed in Section 2.3, actual uncertainties are larger than we assume for this analysis.</p><p>Kepler-10 c falls near the high density extreme among the locus of sub-Neptune-sized planet mass-radius measurements characterized to date. As such, Kepler-10 c presents a valuable test case for planet formation theories and interior structure models. Comparing measured masses and radii to theoretical mass radius relations, which incorporate the behavior of materials at high pressure, reveals insights into the planets' possible bulk compositions. We employ planet interior structure models from <ref type="bibr">Rogers &amp; Seager (2010a,b)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref> to provide a mapping from planet mass and composition to radius, and apply the Bayesian approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rogers &amp; Seager (2010a</ref><ref type="bibr">) (and applied in Schmitt et al. 2014</ref>) to invert planet composition constraints from the radial velocity and transit observations.</p><p>The first point to note about Kepler-10 c's bulk composition is that its transit radius is likely not defined by a "rocky" or "solid" surface. In the vast majority (98.4%) of dynamical solutions to the combined Kepler photometry, HIRES spectroscopy, and HARPS-N spectroscopy dataset, Kepler-10 c has a sufficiently low mean density (less dense than a pure magnesium silicate sphere) that the planet must have a substantial complement of volatiles (astrophysical ices and/or H/He) that contribute to the observed transit depth. Only 1.6% of the the Kepler-10 c mass-radius posterior probability corresponds to scenarios in which the planet is sufficiently dense to have a stony-iron composition (comprised of an admixture iron and silicates alone). Since Kepler-10 c's measured density necessitates that the planet contains a volatile complement that contributes to the transit depth, the planetary composition is inconsistent with a "solid" or "rocky" makeup.</p><p>The nature of Kepler-10 c's volatiles is ambiguous; the planet could have a H/He envelope contributing less than a fraction of a percent by mass to the planet, or a water envelope contributing a few tens of percent of the planet mass. The measured mass and radius of Kepler-10 c are consistent with a "water-world" composition; less than 0.95% of the Kepler-10 c mass-radius posterior PDF spills into a low density regime wherein an H/He envelope is required (corresponding to planet configurations that are less dense than even a 100% pure water sphere with T eq = 550 K). Assuming a 2-component planet interior structure model, where in the planet consists of an Earth-like stony-iron core (modeled as a 30:70 mix or iron and magnesium silicates) surrounded by a pure water envelope, the water mass fraction is constrained in this scenario to be M env,H2O /M p = 0.280 +0.119 −0.102 (where the median, and range between the 16th and 84th percentiles are quoted) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 17)</ref>. At the other extreme, the measured mass and radius of Kepler-10 c are also consistent with a dry (water-less) mixture of stony-iron material and H/He. Coupling the planet mass-radius posterior distribution to a 2-component planet interior structure model wherein the planet consists of a Earthlike stony-iron core surrounded by a 30 times enhanced metalicity solar composition envelope, the H/He envelope mass fraction is constrained to be M env,H/He /M p = 0.0023 +0.0017 −0.0012 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>). Whether the planet's volatile envelope is dominated by H/He or water, the radial extent of the envelope, ∆R env , accounts for more than one  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>.

Only 13.6% of the posterior probability of Kepler-10 b spills into a low-density regime of mass-radius parameter space where volatiles are demanded. Under the assumption of a 2-layer rocky planet model consisting of an iron core and a silicate mantle (having molar magnesium fraction Mg# = 90%), the iron core mass fraction of Kepler-10 b is constrained, M Fe,core /M p = 0.169 +0.115 −0.117 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>). The measured mass and radius of Kepler-10 b is consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition (32.5% iron core by mass), while an iron-enhanced Mercury composition (70% iron core by mass) is strongly disfavored.</p><p>All the composition constraints described above are based upon the combined analysis of the Keck HIRES and HARPS-N radial velocity measurements. The qualitative constraints on Kepler-10 b and c's bulk compositions are largely unchanged when only the Keck HIRES radial velocities are used to derive the planet mass. Omission of the HARPS-N dataset from the analysis leads to a downward shift in the density of Kepler-10 c, an upward shift in the density of Kepler-10 b, and an overall broadening of all the posterior PDFs. The downward shift in the density of Kepler-10 c further strengthens the conclusion that Kepler-10 c has a volatile envelope. Conditioned on the HIRES data alone, there is only a 0.4% posterior probability that Kepler-10 c is more dense than a pure silicate sphere (compared to 4.1% conditioned on both HARPS-N and HIRES). Further, the posterior probability that Kepler-10 c is sufficiently dense to have water envelope (instead of H/He) also decreases to 62% (compared to 99% conditioned on both HARPS-N and HIRES). On the other hand, the shift in Kepler-10 b posterior distribution toward higher masses and densities leads to increased posterior probability at higher Kepler-10 b iron core mass fractions M Fe,core /M p = 0.44 <ref type="bibr">+0.15 −0.19</ref> (compared to 0.17 ± 0.12 based on both HARPS-N and HIRES).</p><p>8. <ref type="bibr">DISCUSSION</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Insights on successful observing strategies for</head><p>Kepler follow-up The source of the discrepancy between the HIRES and HARPS-N RVs is unknown. However, the apparent timevariability of K b and K c on both instruments suggests that a time-correlated noise (or astrophysical signal) confounds both data sets on timescales of a summer observing season. This time-correlated property could be from stellar rotation and the stellar magnetic cycle or from an additional planet in the system. The most effective way to combat this time-correlated noise is to increase the quantity and baseline of observations of this star. This strategy of employing a long observing baseline compared to time-correlated noise influences should be employed on other stars with low-mass planets to avoid confusion in the future.  This paper is the third study of the masses and densities of the Kepler-10 planets. B11 and D14 previously measured the planetary and stellar properties of the Kepler-10 system. The stellar and planetary parameters they found are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref>. The planetary properties obtained in this paper are also shown. We include our solutions to the two-planet circular fit, the two-planet fit in which planet c is allowed eccentricity, and the best three-planet fit. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref> reveals how the estimates of the masses of Kepler-10 b and c have changed based on which RVs were included in the analysis. B11 used 52 RVs from Keck HIRES that were timed at the quadratures of planet b, and spanned 2 seasons <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref>. They assumed that both planets had circular orbits. They obtained masses of m b = 4.56 ± 1.23 M ⊕ , and an upper limit for planet c, m c &lt; 20 M ⊕ . D14 used 148 RVs from TNG HARPS-N that were timed at the quadratures of planet c, and spanned 2 seasons <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref>. They assumed that both planets had circular orbits. They obtained m b = 3.3 ± 0.49 M ⊕ , a measurement 1σ lower than the B11 mass for Kepler-10 b, and a mass measurement for planet c of M c = 17.2 ± 1.9 M ⊕ . Analyzing the 52 literature RVs plus 20 new RVs from HIRES, we obtain m b = 4.61 ± 0.83M ⊕ and m c = 5.69 +3.19 −2.90 M ⊕ , which are 1.1σ and 3.1σ away from the values in D14, respectively. We combine the 72 RVs from HIRES with 148 literature RVs from HARPS-N to obtain the best orbital coverage of both planets and the longest baseline. In our twoplanet circular fit (the most direct orbital comparison to the previous studies), we obtain m b = 3.72±0.42 M ⊕ and m c = 13.98 ± 1.79 M ⊕ . The mass we obtain for Kepler-10 b sits between the two previously published values. Likewise, the mass we obtain for Kepler-10 c represents a compromise between the 2σ detection in the HIRES data and the massive planet obtained in the HARPS-N data.</p><p>When we allow the orbit of Kepler-10 c to be eccentric, or when we add a third planet to the system, the mass of Kepler-10 c does not change significantly. The mass for Kepler-10 c obtained in the eccentric fit (m c = 14.59 ± 1.90 M ⊕ ) is consistent with our circular fit. Likewise, the masses for planet c obtained for various orbital solutions of candidate KOI-72.X all resulted in m c = 13-14.5M ⊕ , i.e., all within 1σ of the mass we obtained in the twoplanet circular fit. Therefore, allowing the orbit of planet c to be eccentric, or including a third planet at a variety of orbital periods, does not significantly affect the mass computed for Kepler-10 c.</p><p>8.3. Updated mass-radius and density-radius relations We incorporate our newly derived mass measurements of the Kepler-10 planets, as well as several new planet discoveries, in an updated mass-radius relation. The planets are the same as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref>, with the inclusion of planets listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 20</ref> shows how the weighted mean density and weighted mean mass of planets changes from 0-4 Earth radii. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 20</ref> shows where Kepler-10 b and c sit in the density-radius and mass-radius diagrams for planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ . As one of the first rocky exoplanet discoveries, Kepler-10 b has shaped our expectations for rocky exoplanets. Like Kepler-10 b, most of the rocky exoplanets discovered so far are larger than the Earth. This is because larger planets are easier to detect in transit, and because the masses of large, rocky planets are easier to measure than the masses of small, possibly rocky planets.</p><p>Kepler-10 b, at 1.47 R ⊕ , sits very close to the peak of the density-radius diagram (at 1.5 R ⊕ ).

Note. -c The variety of orbital solutions with similar goodness of fit for planet candidate KOI-72.X prevents an accurate characterization of the planet's true orbital parameters and mass. The numbers shown here reflect the best three-planet solution, which is strongly preferred over the two-planet solution and over other three-planet solutions based on the BIC.  <ref type="bibr">[2014]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2015]</ref> is among the highest for planets between 2.0 and 2.5 R ⊕ . However, its density is still lower than the density of Kepler-10 b. Neither the empirical density-radius relation for rocky planets, nor the <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> prediction for the densities of rocky planets, intersects with Kepler-10 c's position on the mass-radius diagram. Extrapolating from both of these relations, we would expect the density of a 2.35 R ⊕ Earth-composition planet to be 11 g cm −3 , nearly twice the observed density for Kepler-10 c. The mass and radius of Kepler-10 c are inconsistent with a stony-iron planet.</p><p>Composition modeling for Kepler-10 c strongly disfavors a rocky interpretation. Less than 2% of the posterior distribution on the planet's mass and radius permits a planet denser than pure perovskite. A stony-iron composition like the Earth and other known rocky exoplanets is excluded with high confidence. Kepler-10 c may have a stony-iron interior overlaid with a 0.2% mass (16% radius) hydrogen-helium envelope. Alternatively, Kepler-10 c may be a stony-iron interior covered with super-ionic water and a steam envelope.</p><p>Planet candidate KOI-72.X cannot be shown on the mass-radius diagram because it does not transit, and so its radius cannot be measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we present the revised masses and densities of Kepler-10 b and c based on 220 RVs from two telescopes, 1.5 times as many RVs as were used in the most recent analysis of this planetary system. The combined RVs yield a baseline 3 times as long as any previous RV publication for this system. We find Kepler-10 b has m b = 3.72 ± 0.42 M ⊕ and ρ b = 6.46 ± 0.73 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> , and Kepler-10 c has m c = 13.98 ± 1.79 M ⊕ and ρ c = 5.94 ± 0.76 g cm −3 . However, we note that analysis of only HIRES data yields a higher mass for planet b and a lower mass for planet c than does analysis of the HARPS-N data alone, with the mass estimates for Kepler-10 c being formally inconsistent at the 3σ level. While we cannot identify the source of the disagreement between the HIRES and HARPS-N RVs, we note that the apparent time-variability of K b and K c in both instruments suggests that time-correlated noise, in the form of either stellar activity or an additional planet, is responsible for the apparent discrepancy. The time-correlated noise indicates that the uncertainties in the masses of the planets (especially planet c) likely exceed our formal estimates. More RVs and/or better priors on the stellar rotation period are needed to adequately model the time-correlated noise without compromising our analysis of the planetary signal of Kepler-10 c. We jointly analyze the TTVs and RVs of the Kepler-10 system to find planet candidate KOI-72.X. Several possible orbital solutions exist for KOI-72.X, with orbital periods ranging from 21-100 days, and masses ranging from 1-7M ⊕ . The existence of KOI-72.X has a negligible effect on the mass solutions for Kepler-10 b and Kepler-10 c. The blue crosses show the weighted mean density in bins of 0.5 R ⊕ to guide the eye, and their vertical error bars represent the RMS scatter of planet densities in that bin. The green line is the predicted bulk density for a 32.5% Fe, 67.5% MgSiO 3 planet (like Earth) as a function of radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Seager et al. 2007</ref>). The red line is an empirical linear fit to planet density as a function of radius for Rp &lt; 1.5R ⊕ . The black line is an empirical power law fit to planet mass as a function of radius for Rp &gt; 1.5R ⊕ . Right: planet mass as a function of planet radius for Rp &lt; 4R ⊕ . The symbols and lines are the same as to the left, but the sizes of the dots corresponds to 1/σ 2 m .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Mass-radius posterior distribution for Kepler-10 b and Kepler-10 c, compared to theoretical mass-radius relations. The color bar indicates the mass-radius posterior probability density conditioned on the combined HIRES and HARPS dataset. The solid curves represent theoretical mass-radius relations for notable compositions: pure Fe (grey), Earth-like stony-iron (brown), pure silicate (yellow), pure water (blue). The water planet mass-radius relation includes thermal effects and the presence of a super-critical steam envelope.</figDesc></figure>

Posterior probability density distribution for Kepler-10 c, as a function of planet mass, Mp and the H/He envelope mass fraction M env,HHe /Mp (upper panel), and radius fraction R env,HHe /Rp (lower panel).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_19"><head>Figure 20 .</head><label>20</label><figDesc>Figure 20. Left: planet density as a function of planet radius for planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ , updated from Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014). Planets with mass measurements from RVs are in gray; planets with mass measurements from TTVs are in gold. The size of the dot corresponds to 1/σ 2 ρ . Kepler-10 b and c are shown as large red stars. The solar system planets are shown as blue diamonds. The blue crosses show the weighted mean density in bins of 0.5 R ⊕ to guide the eye, and their vertical error bars represent the RMS scatter of planet densities in that bin. The green line is the predicted bulk density for a 32.5% Fe, 67.5% MgSiO 3 planet (like Earth) as a function of radius (Seager et al. 2007). The red line is an empirical linear fit to planet density as a function of radius for Rp &lt; 1.5R ⊕ . The black line is an empirical power law fit to planet mass as a function of radius for Rp &gt; 1.5R ⊕ . Right: planet mass as a function of planet radius for Rp &lt; 4R ⊕ . The symbols and lines are the same as to the left, but the sizes of the dots corresponds to 1/σ 2 m .</figDesc></figure>
