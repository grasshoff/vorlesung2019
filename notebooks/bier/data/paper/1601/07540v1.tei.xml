			<abstract>
				<p>Published photometry of fading events in the PTFO 8-8695 system is modelled using improved treatments of stellar geometry, surface intensities, and, particularly, gravity darkening, with a view to testing the planetary-transit hypothesis. Variability in the morphology of fading events can be reproduced by adopting convective-envelope gravity darkening, but near-critical stellar rotation is required. This leads to inconsistencies with spectroscopic observations; the model also predicts substantial photometric variability associated with stellar precession, contrary to observations. Furthermore, the empirical ratio of orbital to rotational angular momenta is at odds with physically plausible values. An exoplanet transiting a precessing, gravity-darkened star may not be the correct explanation of periodic fading events in this system.</p>

(2012)</ref> of a possible hot Jupiter transiting the M-dwarf T-Tauri star PTFO 8-8695 is of particular interest. Not only is the system exceptionally young (∼3 Myr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briceño et al. 2005)</ref>, which is of significance in the context of timescales for planetary formation and orbital evolution, but also it exhibits variability and asymmetry in the transit light-curves observed in the two seasons of the Palomar Transient Factory Orion project ( <ref type="bibr">PTFO;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">van Eyken et al. 2011</ref>). While part of the variability may arise through intrinsic stellar effects (such as starspots), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> offered an insightful and credible interpretation that requires precession of the orbital and rotational angular-momentum vectors on short timescales (∼ 10 2 d, to account for the variable transit depth) coupled with a significantly gravity-darkened primary (to generate the light-curve asymmetry). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> constructed a detailed numerical realisation of this model, including periodic precession, which reproduced the variable light-curve extremely well. Because of their interest in physically modelling the precession, they constrained their model fits by adopting specific values for the stellar mass; and in order to reduce the number of free parameters they assumed (with some observational justification) synchronous rotation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kamiaka et al. (2015)</ref> relaxed this assumption, and showed that, while the system geometry at the two observed epochs is reasonably well deter-E-mail: i.howarth@ucl.ac.uk mined, multiple plausible solutions of the intervening precessional motion exist (as had been anticipated by <ref type="bibr">Barnes et al.)</ref>. Both the Barnes et al. and the Kamiaka et al. models predict that, as observed, transits should not occur at some epochs, as a consequence of orbital precession. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ciardi et al. (2015)</ref> have recently published follow-up observations which demonstrate further transit-like features in the light-curve with the correct orbital phasing, albeit at epochs not consistent with the specific precession model advanced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref>; but while this paper was being prepared, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Yu et al. (2015)</ref> reported additional observations which challenge the Barnes et al. framework. Thus PTFO 8-8695b remains, at best, only a candidate planet. The purpose of the present note is to examine this issue through more-detailed modelling of the stellar emission, to test, in particular, the gravity-darkening hypothesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Motivation</head><p>Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kamiaka et al. (2015)</ref> adopted classical von <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zeipel (1924)</ref> gravity darkening, in which the emergent flux is locally proportional to gravity; that is, T eff() ∝ g β with β = 0.25 (where T eff() is to be understood as the local effective temperature).</p><p>However, von Zeipel's derivation was based on consideration of a barotropic envelope in which energy transport is diffusive -i.e., radiative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lucy (1967)</ref> argued that for stars with convective envelopes the gravity-darkening exponent β is expected to be considerably smaller; this argument certainly applies in the case of PTFO 8-8695 (spectral type ∼M3; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briceño et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>Recent work suggests that von Zeipel's 'law' may overestimate gravity darkening even in radiative envelopes <ref type="bibr">(Es- pinosa Lara &amp; Rieutord 2011)</ref>; and, while it may be argued that, in respect of convective envelopes, "nothing is clear" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rieutord 2015)</ref>, it is surely the case that the gravitydarkening exponent will be less than in radiative envelopes. The limited empirical evidence is broadly consistent with Lucy's estimate of β 0.08 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rafert &amp; Twigg 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pantazis &amp; Niarchos 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Djuraševi´Djuraševi´c et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, 2006</ref>), and it is this value that will be adopted here.</p><p>The best-fit parameters derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">their</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) 1 imply a ratio of rotational angular velocity to the critical, or break-up, value of ω/ωc 0.70 ± 0.04, and thence an equatorial:polar temperature ratio of ∼ 0.90 ± 0.02. To achieve the same temperature contrast with β = 0.08 (and hence to achieve roughly the same degree of light-curve asymmetries) requires significantly more rapid rotation: ω/ωc 0.95 ± 0.02. Of course, any change in ω/ωc leads to changes in the shape of the star (and has implications for the rotation period and the projected equatorial rotation velocity, ve sin is), so it is not necessarily obvious that a consistent solution to the light-curves can be achieved with a more plausible gravity-darkening exponent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Implementation</head><p>To examine this issue, a modified version of the code for spectrum synthesis of rapidly rotating stars described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Howarth &amp; Smith (2001)</ref> has been used. The code, exoBush, 2 simply divides the rotationally distorted stellar surface into a large number of facets; evaluates the local temperature and gravity at each point; and sums the intensities I(λ, µ, T, g) 3 to produce a predicted flux, taking into account occultation by an opaque, nonluminous transiting body of assumed circular cross-section (e.g., an exoplanet).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Spin-orbit geometry</head><p>The spin-orbit geometry is conveniently considered in a right-handed co-ordinate system defined by the angularmomentum vectors, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The convention adopted here is that the planetary-orbit and stellar-rotation angular-momentum vectors o, s lie in the xy plane, with their vector sum L defining the y axis. Stellar rotation is assumed to be prograde (a choice that is necessarily arbitrary, leading to ambiguities in several model parameters; cf. the caption to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3)</ref>, and the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight is required to be in the range 0 ≤ is ≤ π/2. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Spin-orbit geometry; the y axis coincides with L, the sum of the orbital and stellar-rotation angular momenta (unit vectorsôvectorsˆvectorsô, ˆ s), which lie in the xy plane. The line of sight, 'los', is shown for precessional phase ψ; it is offset from the total angularmomentum vector L by the angle i L . The observer's-frame inclination angles io (between the line of sight andôandˆandô) and is (between the line of sight andˆsandˆandˆs) are not shown explicitly.</p><p>Orbital motion is retrograde with respect to the stellar rotation for ϕs + ϕo &gt; π/2, prograde otherwise (where the ϕ angles are defined in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Simple precession amounts to a rotation of o and s about L; observationally, this is equivalent to counterrotation of the line of sight. Rather than impose a physical model of precession (which requires assumptions about quantities such as the stellar moment of inertia), in the present work the precessional angle ψ is left as a free parameter for each epoch of observation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Stellar properties</head><p>Barnes et al. <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> approximated the geometry of the rotationally distorted star by an oblate spheroid; here, the stellar surface is computed as a time-independent Roche equipotential (cf., e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Howarth &amp; Smith 2001)</ref>, neglecting any gravitational effects of the companion. The global effective temperature is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T 4 eff = T 4 eff() dA dA</formula><p>where the integrations are over the distorted surface area, taking into account gravity darkening. For very rapid rotators this may not correspond to any particular 'observed' temperature (since the integrated line and continuum spectra will not precisely match any single-star standards), but it is at least a well-defined quantity. Values of T eff = 3470 K and polar gravity log (g) = 4.0 (cgs) are adopted here, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briceño et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref>. These values enter the analysis only through the calculation of the surface intensities, discussed below; otherwise, no assumptions are made, or are required, in respect of specific values of the mass or polar radius, and other reasonable choices for log (g) would have no important effect on the results. respectively; the continuous curve is the (monochromatic) blackbody result. Note that the y scale is logarithmic; the modelatmosphere intensities can show large departures from black-body behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Intensities</head><p>Since the temperature and surface gravity must vary significantly over the stellar surface (in order to generate the observed transit-curve asymmetries), the dependence of the emergent intensity on these quantities is of interest. In this work, R-band surface intensities were evaluated as I(µ, T eff() , g) by interpolation in the 'quasi-spherical' limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) published by Claret, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hauschildt &amp; Witte (2012)</ref>, supplemented by surfacenormal intensities kindly provided by Antonio Claret. His 4-coefficient LDC parametrization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Claret 2000)</ref>, which reproduces the actual I(µ) distributions extremely well, was used.</p><p>The intensities derive from solar-abundance, lineblanketed, non-LTE Phoenix model atmospheres (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Claret et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows that the model-atmosphere emissivities can depart substantially from black-body results, by up to a factor ∼10 at 2.5 kK. Thus although the principal intention of the present analysis is to consider the consequences of an appropriate treatment of gravity darkening, the use of model-atmosphere intensities also represents a noteworthy if minor technical improvement over previous work, which adopted black-body fluxes coupled to a single, global, two-parameter limb-darkening law.</p><p>For the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> best-fit models, the implied equator-pole temperature range is ∼3650-3350 K (for T eff = 3470 K); over this temperature range, the model-atmosphere R-band surface-normal intensity ratio is ∼0.47, while the black-body ratio is ∼0.57. Relaxing the assumption of blackbody emission is therefore liable to counteract the drive to larger values of ω/ωc required by adopting a smaller value for the β exponent. Rs/a and Rp/a are the stellar polar radius and the planetary radius in units of the orbital semi-major axis; ω/ωc is the ratio of stellar angular rotation to the critical value. Angles are defined in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>; the sum ϕo + ϕs, and the stellar-rotation &amp; orbital inclinations, is &amp; io, are derived quantities, not free parameters in the model. is consequently also adopted, as a fixed quantity. Because the dispersion in the data appears not to be purely stochastic, all points were equally weighted.</p></div>

Disappointingly, the technical improvements to the basic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> model implemented here lead to a somewhat poorer overall match than they achieved.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Angular-momentum results</head><p>The empirical results summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, obtained in the absence of any constraint on the angular-momentum ratio, yield (median, 95% confidence intervals). This is discrepant, by almost three orders of magnitude, with the prediction of §4.1; furthermore, the negligible orbital precession implied by the small value of ϕo is inconsistent with the absence of transits at some epochs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kamiaka et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>Reasonably extensive sampling of parameter space, including several tens of millions of MCMC replications starting from multiple initial parameter sets, encourages the view that the solution summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> locates the global minimum in χ 2 hyperspace. However (and particularly given that the model is constrained by observations only two epochs), the question arises as to whether a physically better model may exist with lower, but still acceptable, statistical probability -that is, does a preferable solution occur at a local χ 2 minimum?</p><p>To investigate this issue, further solutions were sought, again through the MCMC process but imposing a variety of constraints on the Ls/Lo ratio. In all these experiments, the angular-momentum ratio was found always to drive towards the smallest allowed values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the outcomes of two such experiments, one in which Ls/Lo was fixed at the Barnes et al. value of 2.5, and one in which it was required to be ≥1 (with the outcome that the chain settled on a value very close to 1). Neither of these models, nor any others examined, can be considered as giving satisfactory fits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Consequences of stellar precession</head><p>In the basic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2013)</ref> model explored here, a large part of the light-curve variability between epochs arises through precessional 'nodding' of the star (almost independently of the orbital angular-momentum issue discussed above). This nodding gives rise to two potentially observable diagnostics. First, because of changes in sin is, variability is expected in the projected equatorial rotation velocity, ve sin is (by a factor ∼ 1.2 between the 2009 and 2010 epochs). This may be easier to study spectroscopically than the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, because the variability timescale is very much longer (allowing acquisition of better data).</p><p>Secondly, because the hotter polar regions of the star are presented towards the observer in 2010, the system is predicted to be brighter, by as much as ∆R = 0. m 30 for the 'best' solution of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The PTFO photometry is in clear contradiction with this prediction. Although there is significant non-orbital variability, the observations shown by van <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eyken et al. (2012)</ref> fall in the range R 15.20 ± 0.05 at both 2009 and 2010 epochs (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 2 and 3</ref>; the extreme peak-to-peak range is only 0. m 17). This is a strong argument against the basic foundation of the Barnes et al. model: any significant changes in the transit morphology resulting from precession of a gravity-darkened star are necessarily accompanied by changes in the overall brightness 5 -which is not observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Stellar rotation</head><p>As anticipated, the solution with β = 0.08 requires a large (and reasonably well-defined) value for ω/ωc. The associated values of stellar mass, radius, and equatorial rotation are not independent, but it is straightforward to compute consistent sets of values for given ω/ωc and rotation period Prot. van <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eyken et al.

Supposing the stellar mass to be ∼ 0.4 ± 0.05 M ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briceño et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. 2013</ref>), rotation must indeed be close to, or somewhat faster than, synchronous to match this radius <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4)</ref>, which in turn implies an equatorial rotation velocity ve 160 km s −1 .</p><p>van <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eyken et al.

If we suppose the inclination at that epoch to be close to the 2010 December value, then ve 95 km s −1 . Rapid rotation may lead to underestimation of ve sin is (because a consequence of gravity darkening is relatively low visibility of equatorial regions; cf., e.g., Townsend, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Owocki &amp; Howarth 2004)</ref>, but the discrepancy between observed and expected equatorial velocities is too large to be explained by this effect. Though less secure than the photometric constraint, this is therefore a further source of conflict between the model and observations.</p></div>

While other, physically more acceptable solutions are not completely ruled out, reasonably extensive exploration of parameter space has failed to locate any such solution.</p><p>Independently of this issue, the adoption of a smaller gravity-darkening exponent than previously assumed leads inexorably to the requirement of near-critical stellar rotation. Such rapid rotation raises two further, and more general, difficulties for the model. First, given the 'known' radius, the projected rotational velocity is predicted to be approaching a factor two greater than observed. Secondly, a substantially gravity-darkened star must exhibit significant photometric variability associated with precession of the rotation axis; no such variability is observed.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that either the basic model omits important physics, or that a conventional transiting exoplanet is not the correct explanation for the fading events in the PTFO 8-8695 system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>van Eyken et al.</head><label></label><figDesc>(2012) reported R-band observations of 11 separate transits in the 2009/10 observing season, and a fur- ther six in December 2010. Barnes et al. (2013) detrended and averaged these results to produce mean '2009' and '2010' light-curves. In order to approach as close as reasonably pos- sible a like-for-like comparison with their results, the Barnes et al. composite light-curves were digitized and form the basis of the present analysis; the Barnes et al. ephemeris</figDesc></figure>

Upper panels: system geometry at the two epochs, for the 'best' solution summarized Table 1; the unit of length is the polar radius. The colour coding of blue-and red-shifted stellar hemispheres corresponds to prograde rotation; retrograde rotation would give rise to identical light-curves, as would mirror images of these panels. The locations of the transiting body at orbital phases 0.0 and 0.25 are shown, to indicate the direction of orbital motion. The projection of the total angular-momentum vector onto the plane of the sky is aligned with the −x axis in each panel (and almost coincides with the orbital angular-momentum vector). Centre panels: corresponding normalized model R-band lightcurves and observations. Bottom panels: the poorer 'best-fit' models obtained with angular-momentum ratios Ls/Lo constrained to values of 1 and 2.5 (q.v. §4.2).</figDesc></figure>
