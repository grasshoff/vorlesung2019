			<abstract>
				<p>We examine the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of differential exoplanet eclipse depth measurements made using the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope during the post-cryogenic mission. We have re-analyzed an existing 4.5 µm dataset, consisting of 10 observations of the XO-3b system during secondary eclipse, using seven different techniques for removing correlated noise. We find that, on average, for a given technique the eclipse depth estimate is repeatable from epoch to epoch to within 156 parts per million (ppm). Most techniques derive eclipse depths that do not vary by more than a factor 3 of the photon noise limit. All methods but one accurately assess their own errors: for these methods the individual measurement uncertainties are comparable to the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10-epoch sample. To assess the accuracy of the techniques as well as clarify the difference between instrumental and other sources of measurement error, we have also analyzed a simulated dataset of 10 visits to XO-3b, for which the eclipse depth is known. We find that three of the methods (BLISS mapping, Pixel Level Decorrelation, and Independent Component Analysis) obtain results that are within 3 times the photon limit of the true eclipse depth. When averaged over the 10-epoch ensemble, five out of seven techniques come within 100 ppm of the true value. Spitzer exoplanet data, if measured following current best practices and reduced using methods such as those described here, can measure repeatable and accurate single eclipse depths, with close to photon-limited results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION 1.Exoplanet measurements and correlated noise</head><p>Measurement of relative flux variations is one of the chief means of characterizing transiting exoplanetary systems. At infrared wavelengths secondary eclipses are a powerful tool for studying the atmospheres of giant exoplanets, their depths approximately equaling the dayside planet-to-star flux ratio. Extracting information about atmospheres, however, is extremely challenging due to the small differential signals produced by transits, secondary eclipses, and phase curves. The relevant signals are often at the level of 100 parts per million (ppm) or smaller, and require the removal of significant instrumental systematics in the two infrared instruments currently capable of providing information at this precision: the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telecope (HST) and the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fazio et al. 2004</ref>) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Werner et al. 2004</ref>). For the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm InSb detectors that remain active on post-cryogenic Spitzer, the systematics are due to the interplay of residual telescope pointing fluctuations with intra-pixel gain variations in the moderately under-sampled camera.</p><p>Over the past decade, a suite of techniques for removing time-correlated noise in IRAC data has been developed. Because of the known coupling between pointing variations and the intra-pixel gain, the earliest methods for correcting cryogenic data used either a simple radial function from a pixel's center ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Reach et al. 2005</ref>) or fit a second order polynomial to the observed flux variations as a function of the source centroid position (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Char- bonneau et al. 2008)</ref>. It soon became clear, however, that a single polynomial surface does not sufficiently de-scribe the intra-pixel gain variations. To measure flux decrements with precision less than ∼ 1%, a more responsive approach is necessary to track the small-scale structure in the gain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ballard et al. 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, after Spitzer entered its post-cryogenic stage in mid-2009, the amplitude of the variations doubled at the current detector temperature of about 28.7 K. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Thus, more flexible nonparametric approaches were developed to measure and remove the systematics. The earliest such methods used some form of nearest neighbor kernel regression to map the intra-pixel gain as a function of centroid position, using a weighted sum of the measured fluxes instead of a predetermined function of centroid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ballard et al. 2010)</ref>. A special case of nearest neighbor kernel regression is BiLinearly Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stevenson et al. 2012</ref>). Additional promising techniques that have appeared in recent years include regression via Gaussian Processes (GP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gibson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015</ref>); Independent Component Analysis (ICA; Morello 2015); and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deming et al. 2015)</ref>. See Appendix B for a detailed review of these techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Repeatability of Spitzer/IRAC Relative Flux Measurements</head><p>As multi-epoch monitoring data have accumulated, investigators have begun to quantify the repeatability and reliability of exoplanet differential flux measurements made with Spitzer and other observatories. A growing body of evidence is showing that modern IRAC correlated noise removal techniques obtain consistent results from one measurement to the next, and obtain consistent results between techniques.</p><p>One indicator of stability is that the individual measurement uncertainties approximately equal the scatter (standard deviation) in independently-measured transit or eclipse depths. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fraine et al. (2013)</ref> analyzed 14 transits of GJ 1214b measured at 4.5 µm with IRAC using a kernel regression decorrelation technique (KR/Data-see section B.4), yielding a scatter in transit depths within 50% of the average reported uncertainty in the individual depths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. (2014)</ref> also used KR/Data to process data for 12 eclipses of XO-3b, yielding individual uncertainties that were equal to the scatter in the ensemble. The XO-3b dataset features prominently in this paper, as a main component of the Spitzer 2015 Data Challenge (see below).</p><p>Older data often benefit from reanalysis with modern methods. Four GJ 436b transits were reprocessed using ICA by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morello et al. (2015)</ref>, who determined that the transit depth did not vary by more than 100 ppm, contrary to earlier estimates computed using polynomial fitting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beaulieu et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The ICA technique was also used to establish a repeatable (within 200 ppm) transit depth for HD 189733b <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Morello et al. 2014</ref>), after many conflicting prior values led to questions of stellar variability. BLISS mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014</ref>) and GP ( <ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015)</ref> were both used to reanalyze four eclipses of HD 209458b, including one taken under non-optimal observing conditions (see §4.3). Both teams concluded that the group of measurements was self-consistent (scatter 30% less than uncertainties for <ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015)</ref>, and that the earlier estimate of a much deeper occultation, which resulted in claims of a possible temperature inversion layer in the planet's atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2008</ref>), was unwarranted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Goals of this paper</head><p>Because of the high relative precision required for eclipse depth and other exoplanet measurements, it is important to characterize the ability of an instrumenttogether with the chosen method of systematics removal-to return consistent results. This is especially crucial when comparing data to models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows 2014</ref>, for a discussion of the difficulty of spectral retrieval from data with low S/N) or measuring atmospheric variability (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Demory et al. 2016</ref>, who found evidence for eclipse depth changes of ∼ 140 ppm over 1 year in 55 Cnc e). Despite the growing number of analyses of multi-epoch transit or eclipse measurements, all have thus far focused on at most two methods of removing correlated noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fraine et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morello et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Demory et al. 2016</ref>), or only considered two epochs per target ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>This paper examines the repeatability of Spitzer/IRAC eclipse depths in the post-cryogenic mission, with an eye towards answering the questions: how stable can we reasonably expect IRAC eclipse depth measurements to be; and how close are they to the truth? We aim to establish limits on both the IRAC instrument and the best modern techniques for removing correlated noise and measuring eclipse depths, using both real and simulated data. Recently, participants undertook a Data Challenge consisting of the measurement of ten secondary eclipses of XO-3b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. 2014)</ref>, and a complementary analysis of a synthetic version of the XO-3b data. In §2 we describe the Data Challenge. We introduce the real XO-3b dataset, give an overview of the Spitzer/IRAC simulator and the creation of the simulated dataset, and outline seven techniques used to decorrelate the photometry. In §3 we report on the results of the data challenge, estimating the single eclipse depth repeatability and the reliability or precision of the results when reduced by the different methods. We compare the variability between methods, as well as the accuracy of the techniques when applied to simulated data. In §4 we discuss the implications of our results for post-cryogenic exoplanet measurements with Spitzer.</p><p>We also evaluate a recent proposal to inflate IRAC eclipse depth uncertainties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>), and suggest application of our approach to future space observatories. We conclude in §5 by summarizing our key results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODOLOGY 2.1. The IRAC 2015 Data Challenge</head><p>To assess the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of post-cryogenic observations with IRAC, the Spitzer Science Center (SSC) in conjunction with active exoplanet researchers from the astronomical community has performed an analysis of the removal of systematics and measured the repeatability of warm IRAC observations. The SSC made available to the public both a real dataset as well as synthetic data (where the eclipse depth is an input) on the IRAC Data Challenge 2015 website 2 . Contributions were solicited, and preliminary results were presented at the IRAC 2nd Workshop on High Precision Photometry, held during the 2015 International Astronomical Union meeting in Honolulu, HI, USA 3 . In this section we describe the real and simulated data and the decorrelation techniques used. c Mean centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.</p><p>d Standard deviation in centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.</p><p>e (x, y) Covariance in centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.</p><p>f Eclipse number as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Real XO-3b Observations</head><p>The XO-3b data used for the Data Challenge consisted of 10 individual secondary eclipse measurements originally analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. (2014)</ref>, and summa-rized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. All measurements were made with post-cryogenic Spitzer in 2012 and 2013, and were taken as part of Program ID (PID) 90032 (PI: H. Knutson). This program also contains two full phase curve measurements of XO-3b at 4.5 µm, but we confine our analysis in this paper to the eclipse-only datasets. The first six epochs took place within about 30 days of each other; the last four occurred about one-half year later and also spanned 30 days. Each epoch consisted of two Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs): an 11-exposure, 30 minute "Pre" AOR to allow short term pointing drift to settle; and a 233-exposure, 8.5 hour "Main" AOR that contained the secondary eclipse. Each exposure produced a FITS format image file, containing a cube of 64 32×32 pixel images taken 2 seconds apart with the source in the subarray field-of-view on the 4.5 µm array.</p><p>The measurements were taken in staring mode (no repositioning within an AOR), and used PCRS Peak-Up to establish the position of XO-3b at the beginning of each AOR. 4 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives the observation start time, Spitzer AOR numbers, and the eclipse number (for comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. 2014</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, which also includes two full phase curve datasets). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Synthetic XO-3b Observations</head><p>Observed variations in eclipse depths are caused by a combination of variations in Spitzer pointing, IRAC detector charge trapping, and possible evolution of the planetary system, as well as the limitations and biases of the technique for reducing correlated noise. We can analyze the data using different techniques to assess differences in the methods, but it is often difficult with real data to completely separate pointing from instrumental or planetary variations. This is one reason we have included synthetic data as part of the Data Challenge, for which both the exoplanet and IRAC are given constant properties. We had originally considered using eclipsing binary stars observed with Kepler as a truth set which could then be observed with Spitzer. Unfortunately, using stellar atmosphere models to extrapolate Kepler eclipse depths to Spitzer wavelengths are as fraught with potential uncertainty as the planetary eclipse depths themselves, suggesting simulated data are the only reasonable path to estimating accuracy. In the simulations, any measured variations in eclipse depth are due solely to (1) random noise and (2) residual correlated noise not removed by decorrelation analysis. This should give us a better insight into the capabilities of the decorrelation methods than real data alone.</p><p>To produce the simulated XO-3b observations used for the Data Challenge, we used IRACSIM, a package built in the IDL programming language. The program uses a model of the Spitzer/IRAC system to create synthetic IRAC point source measurements, outputting FITS image (or image cube) files similar to those produced by the IRAC basic calibrated data (BCD) pipeline. We give an overview of the model in Appendix A. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> gives the simulated observation start times and AOR numbers of the synthetic observations. The simulations followed closely the design of the real observations, with each observing "epoch" containing 2 AORs, a similar number of exposures per AOR, and the same integration parameters. We set the start times for each synthetic epoch at slightly different phases of different actual XO-3b orbits, as often occurs in real observations. This allows for different proportions of sam-  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Light curve for simulated XO-3b observations, AOR number 20150019. The simulation uses known values of the system's stellar, orbital, and transit parameters, in addition to a thermal phase model with albedo, A = 0; radiative timescale, τrad = 1 day; and net rotational angular velocity of the cloud layer, Ωrot = 1, in units of the orbital angular velocity at periastron.

We chose not to duplicate exactly the pointing fluctuations as observed in the real dataset, but attempted to simulate a range of possible Spitzer observing conditions (drawn roughly from the distribution of observed cases), and thus a range of possible decorrelation situations. In practice this resulted in generally larger pointing fluctuations and drifts than found in the real data.</p><p>We used the IRACSIM exoplanet wrapper to model the light curve of XO-3b, obtaining values for the system's stellar, orbital, and transit parameters from the exoplanets.org database (as of 2015 July 2) and simulating the planet's thermal phase variations using the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref>. Since the goal was to understand IRAC data, not XO-3b, we set somewhat arbitrary values of the planetary parameters: (1) albedo, A = 0; (2) radiative timescale, τ rad = 1 day; and (3) net rotational angular velocity of the cloud layer, Ω rot = 1 (in units of the orbital angular velocity at periastron). The resulting phase curve gives a non-flat appearance to the flux outside of eclipse and sets the depth of the eclipse, which we define in terms of the stellar flux. In this case, the model eclipse depth for XO-3b is 1875 ppm, about 16% larger than the actual depth published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wong et al. (2014)</ref>. The model light curve for the 10th epoch is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Decorrelation techniques</head><p>The best hypothesis for the source of IRAC timecorrelated noise is the coupling of pointing fluctuations with intrapixel quantum efficiency variations on the InSb detector arrays. When Spitzer is commanded to continuously observe an inertially fixed target ("staring" mode), a source position will undergo "jitter" and "wobble" with a net amplitude of about 0.08 detector pixels (px) per hour, while also incurring a slow linear drift of about 0.01 px per hour (see §A.1 for an analytical model of these fluctuations). These telescope motions have been described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grillmair et al. (2012)</ref>, and the physical causes of some are known.

A map of the photometric gain of a point source on the central pixel of the 4.5 µm subarray is displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, showing that correlated noise due to pointing fluctuations can be as much as 1-2%, a factor of 10 larger than the XO-3b eclipse depth.</p><p>As part of the Data Challenge, exoplanet experts used a total of seven different data reduction techniques to remove correlated noise from the Spitzer/IRAC photometry and assess the eclipse depth repeatability. We review the seven techniques in Appendix B, including notes on implementation for the XO-3b datasets. Among these are the most commonly used techniques in the current literature to date (BLISS, KR/Data), as well as a group of more recently developed methods [GP, ICA, KR/Pmap, PLD, Segmented Polynomial (K2 pipeline)]. Note that each expert was free to use any approach to centroiding, photometry, and eclipse depth fitting. Thus, any mention of a method by name in this paper refers to the entire data reduction pipeline, not just the correlated noise removal algorithm.</p></div>

Most techniques described in §2.4 use either 2D Gaussian fitting or the flux-weighted "center of light" method to determine a point source center on the undersampled Spitzer arrays.

The sums are over a (7 × 7)-pixel region surrounding the expected position of the source. This centroiding method is sufficiently precise for decorrelation, resulting in positional distortions of at most 0.05 pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ingalls et al. 2014</ref>). A detailed discussion of different centroiding techniques is beyond the scope of this paper; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lust et al. (2014)</ref> for analysis of the accuracy of three centroiding methods. Columns 4-8 of Tables 1 (real) and 2 (simulated) summarize the centroid "clouds" for each epoch, giving the means and standard deviations in x and y position, as well as the xy covariances in centroid. As the real data were all pointed using PCRS peak-up, the mean positions are all within 0.4 pixel of one another, and cluster near the peak of the intra-pixel gain. Negative covariances for most of the real AORs indicate that the clouds are aligned such that y decreases when x increases, which is a common direction for Spitzer/IRAC short-term drift. The bottom 2 rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and  2</ref> list the column means and the statistics for all data taken together. For the real data, the full dataset has a much higher negative covariance than the individual clouds, suggesting that separate pointings fall preferentially along a ∼ −45 • axis. The simulated data feature a much stronger initial drift, as well as a more pronounced y component to the jitter, wobble, and drift than the real data. Some individual xy covariances in the simulated data are much higher than both the mean and the aggregate covariance for the group, due to this exaggerated elongation. This "stretching" of the positions along y reduces the positional redundancy and, as we will see, challenges the ability of most reduction methods to decorrelate the data.</p><p>We display the real XO-3b photometric and other measurements as a function of orbital phase in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, and those for the synthetic data in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. As mentioned, some decorrelation methods use the Noise Pixels parameter,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">˜ β = ( ij f ij ) 2 ij f 2 ij ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which approximates the effective area (in square pixels) of a point source. The sums are over the same (7 × 7)-pixel region over which the centroid is derived. We display˜βplay˜ play˜β as a function of phase in the third panel of <ref type="figure">Fig- ures 4</ref> and 5.

Thus we see in Figures 4 and 5 how˜βhow˜ how˜β is correlated with the centroids to an extent. But˜βBut˜ But˜β also can measure the smearing of the IRAC PSF due to changes in the amplitude of high frequency jitter. Spitzer is known to have normal modes of oscillation with period less than the detector sample time (see §A.3 for a discussion of IRAC sampling). When the amplitude of oscillation changes, the centroid might not vary markedly but the integrated PSF will change its apparent size, altering˜βaltering˜ altering˜β. We display the mean background in the fourth panel, and the aperture flux in the fifth panel of Figures 4 and 5. We normalized the values in these last two panels to the mean value over all AORs, allowing us to notice relative shifts between AORs. Fluxes are estimated using the IDL photometry program aper.pro, with a 2.25-pixel radius circular aperture and a 3-7 pixel background annulus. Backgrounds are the mean value per pixel in the annulus, scaled to the area of the aperture. The net aperture flux is thus the integrated intensity per pixel weighted by the fraction of each pixel lying inside the aperture, minus the background value. (Each team participating in the Data Challenge may have used a different method for measuring the flux, including different aperture sizes or background definitions.)</p><p>Various known features of Spitzer data can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.

The aperture fluxes for some epochs show very clearly the correlated noise signature due to these telescope motions. The eclipse can also be seen in the flux between phase -0.35 and -0.31.</p><p>The background values show a quick ramp in the beginning of each epoch, and settle into a much slower increase with time for the final eight or so hours. This behaves similarly to the "flux ramp" seen by many who work on 4.5 µm staring mode IRAC data (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Knut- son et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lewis et al. 2013</ref>). In this case, however, the ramp disappears after background subtraction so the background ramp is probably caused by a relaxation in detector bias (the IRAC dark bias has a significant wellknown offset that changes with time based on the history of readouts and array idling over the previous several hours), not changing responsivity. The background curves in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> are all normalized to the same value; the fact that they are separated suggests a different mean background between epochs. This can be attributed to fluctuations in the mean detector dark bias or changes in the residual sky subtraction (or a combination of the two).</p><p>The simulation data ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) show many of the same features, with a few differences. First, noise on timescales shorter than the wobble period averages quite cleanly to near zero in the binned measurements of centroid and noise pixels, as compared to the same plots for the real dataset. This suggests the presence in real data of a jitter signal that doesn't integrate to zero in 64 samples, perhaps with a steeper spectrum (more power at low frequencies) than the 1/f signal currently included.  Second, the magnitudes of short and long term pointing drift and the amplitude of pointing fluctuations are all larger than in the real data, as seen in the (x, y) centroids and˜βand˜ and˜β. This is also visible in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> when compared with <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Third, the simulated backgrounds are much more uniform from one AOR to another because we commanded the same linear increase with time, with constant mean and no offsets between epochs. Fourth, the larger spread in position has increased the overall noise in the light curve. This will have consequences for the decorrelation of the measurements and the estimation of eclipse depths.</p><p>We display in Figures 6 and 7 light curves decorrelated using different techniques, for the 5th epochs of the real and simulated observations.</p></div>

For real data, we obtain F ap−bg = 70858 e, F ap = 70917 e, and F bg = 463 e; for the simulations, F ap−bg = 73246 e, F ap = 73358 e, and F bg = 881 e.</p><p>The first term in square brackets of Equation 10, when divided by the remaining three terms, gives the relative contribution of readout noise to σ 2 e .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Repeatability, reliability, and accuracy</head><p>A substantial literature exists in other scientific fields discussing techniques for estimating the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of a set of measurements (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Altman &amp; Bland 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bartlett &amp; Frost 2008</ref>, for discussions of repeatability and reliability). We review and adapt these terms below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Repeatability</head><p>We define the repeatability, R, to be the value below which we can expect the difference between two eclipse depth measurements to lie 68% of the time, for a given data reduction method. For our purposes, R equals the standard deviation (SD) of the differences in separate measurements made with the same method, R = SD(∆ ij ). Repeatability has the same units as the measurements themselves (e.g., ppm). Note that the repeatability is not the standard deviation of the measurements, which indicates the spread in depths around the mean value, but of their differences.</p><p>One way to assess repeatability visually is with "mean/difference" plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Altman &amp; Bland 1983)</ref>, which we show in Figures 10 (real) and 11 (simulated). The plots display, for all pairs of measured eclipses, the difference in depth (∆ ij ) as a function of the pair average eclipse depth. (To obtain a statistically valid estimate for this comparison, each pair must be counted twice, with the order of the indices reversed.) Mean/difference plots often show more clearly the limits of variability of the difference between sets than, for example, correlation plots where the variables are plotted against each other. In mean/difference plots, the horizontal spread of the data (spread in average values in paired epochs) is related to the precision of the measurements (when the overall scatter in values is large, the midpoint between pairs of values will have a relatively large spread). The vertical spread in mean/difference plots indicates the repeatability, i.e., how far apart we expect two separate measurements to be. Specifically, we compute R from the standard deviation of each group of paired differences, labeled "SD" on the bottom left of each frame of Figures 10 and 11.</p><p>Patterns in mean/difference plots can sometimes elucidate patterns in the data, but they need to be examined carefully, because of the inherent correlation between the data axes. If we define x ≡ (D 1 + D 2 )/2 (the horizontal axis) and y ≡ (D 1 − D 2 ) (the vertical axis), it is apparent that the two axes are not independent: the relationship between y and x can be written either     an inverse linear relationship between x and y for paired differences involving epoch 1 (labeled "1-2", "1-3", etc.).

The real XO-3b results show a repeatability of better than 220 ppm in all cases, with an average value of R = 156 ppm. The simulations are less repeatable, with R = 252 ppm. This is probably due to the presence of more noise in the eclipse depth measurements for the simulations, as expected from the greater pointing scatter ( §3.1). To confirm that the repeatability as computed is consistent with our definition above, we have constructed cumulative distributions of each set of eclipse depth differences. As expected, most measured differences are less than R 68% of the time, for both real and simulated data. In only a few cases, the 68th percentile is as much as 20 ppm larger than R.</p><p>Strictly speaking, in earthbound experiments repeatability is usually assessed on consecutive measurements under identical conditions. 5 This is not possible for eclipses, since they cannot be repeated at will. In the time between eclipses, the experimental situation will likely change: a new pointing center and different pointing jitter can change the correlated noise properties; exposure of the detector arrays to other sources of photons may produce latent charge on the pixels of interest, or existing latent charge may decay; the planetary phase curve and eclipse timing and depth may not be the same from one orbit to the next due to stellar variability, perturbations of the planet's orbit, or atmospheric evolution. But for consistency with the astrophysics literature, we will continue to refer to the spread in eclipse <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The measurement of differences under changing conditions is often called reproducibility. depth differences as repeatability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Reliability</head><p>We define the reliability, r, to be the ratio between the intrinsic variability of a set of measurements (in the absence of astrophysical variation) to their observed variability, for a given method. In the context of eclipse depth measurements, the intrinsic variability is the standard deviation in the depth due only to photon noise, σ phot <ref type="figure">(Equation 14)</ref>, and the observed variability is the measured standard deviation in the depth, SD. The measured variance combines both the photon noise and the variance due to "measurement error," caused by residual correlated noise. (Here we assume no variability in the planetary system, but its presence would add to the measured variance and decrease the reliability.) The value of r ≡ σ phot /(SD) is unitless and can range from 0 (all scatter due to measurement error) to 1 (no mea-surement error). Reliability is essentially a normalized measure of precision, and is inversely related to repeatability (we demonstrate this relationship below).</p><p>We list the computed values of r for each method in column 9 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Tables 3 and 4</ref>. For the real data, the reliability is quite high in most cases, with an average of r = 0.52, suggesting that half of the scatter is due to intrinsic photon noise. The ICA and kernel regression (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) techniques appear to have the least amounts of correlated noise (scatter in eclipse depths consistent with more than half photon noise). For the simulated data, however, the values are lower, with an average reliability of r = 0.32.</p><p>Figures 12 and 13 are scatterplots of repeatability vs. reliability for the real and simulated eclipse depths, respectively. These data appear inversely correlated, which is not surprising. If two values are drawn from the same parent population, the variance in the difference between the values should be twice the variance of the original distribution, which means that for large enough samples [SD(∆ ij )] 2 = 2(SD) 2 . Thus by the definition of r, we expect R = √ 2σ phot r −1 . We overlay this theoretical curve, as well as linear fits to R as a function of r −1 on Figures 12 and 13. The two curves for each plot are practically identical, with the fit factors multiplying r −1 within 1% of the theoretical values, indicating statistical self-consistency between [SD(∆ ij )] and SD. This implies that the repeatability and reliability derived from 10-element samples are robust. <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref> plots the reliability for simulated data as a function of that for real data, for the seven decorrelation methods, with lines of different slope overlaid. There seems to be no relationship between the reliability measures for real and simulated eclipses, except that the simulated values are nearly all lower than their real counterparts. Only BLISS has a similar reliability for both real and simulated data (r = 0.40 and 0.44, respectively). The kernel regression techniques both show the largest decrease, with r sim ≈ 0.4 r real . We conclude that BLISS is most robust to increases in positional dispersion, the main source of additional correlated noise between the simulated and real datasets. The (gaussian) kernel regression methods seem to be least robust to such changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">Accuracy</head><p>The accuracy of a technique is a quantitative estimate of how well the technique measures a given characteristic of a system. Earlier definitions of accuracy were synonymous with what is now called trueness, the proximity of the mean of a set of measurements to the true value. Current definitions of accuracy, however, encompass both random and systematic error. That is, accuracy is limited by precision 6 . Even if the mean of a set of measurements is extremely close to the truth (bias is low and trueness is high), if the reliability (precision) is low (the scatter in results is large), the result is still considered to have low accuracy. Assume an exoplanet system is observed N times, and a given technique j yields a set of measurements of the eclipse depth, {D ij } (i = 1, ..., N ), with average value, D j . Let the true depth be D t . We can think of a measurement of eclipse depth as being the sum of the true value, any bias in that measurement (systematic error), B ij , and two random noise terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">D ij = D t + B ij + phot ij + meas ij .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Here, phot ij is the error in measurement ij due to photon noise and meas ij is the random measurement error (e.g. a random component of residual correlated noise). These error terms can be thought of as samples of random variables with means of 0 and standard deviations σ phot and σ meas . Taking the mean of D ij gives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">D = D t + B.<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Thus the average measured value is approximately the sum of the true value and the average bias. Alternately, if we know D t (as we do for the simulations), we can estimate the mean bias as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">B = D − D t .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The scatter in the data about the true value is measured by the mean square error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">MSE = 1 N N i=1 (D ij − D t ) 2 .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>≈ (B 2 ) + σ 2 phot + σ 2 meas . We now define accuracy using the square root of MSE, analagous to using SD for reliability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">a ≡ σ phot /RMSE.<label>(19)</label></formula><p>This has the desired limiting behavior: if the bias is minimized (B → 0; D → D t ), MSE approaches σ 2 phot + σ 2 meas = (SD) 2 and the accuracy approaches the reliability; but as the bias increases, a → 0.</p><p>Columns 11-13 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 4</ref> list the root mean square error (RMSE), the average bias, B, and the accuracy of each technique applied to the simulated XO-3b eclipses. <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> plots a as a function of r. This figure shows how well a technique (1) can be relied on to give the same eclipse depth over multiple epochs where the true depth is constant (reliability: ratio of intrinsic to measured scatter: bottom axis); and (2) can be expected to give the correct eclipse depth over multiple epochs (accuracy: ratio of intrinsic to measured error: left axis). It is better to be on the upper right of the plot (lower scatter, lower error) than on the lower left.</p><p>The majority of the methods have RMSE values similar to their SD values, and thus accuracy nearly equal to reliability. We plot a fit to the data in <ref type="figure">Fig. 15</ref>, a = 1.02 r − 0.02, which confirms that on average the limiting value a ≈ r is reached for these techniques. In other words, the bias is within one standard deviation of zero.</p><p>In detail the ratio a/r, which equals (SD)/RMSE, is not unity but varies by 20% among the techniques. We display a/r as a function of mean absolute bias in <ref type="figure">Figure  16</ref>. The ratio is (roughly) inversely proportional to |B|. This can be understood theoretically if we write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">(a/r) 2 ≈ σ 2 phot + σ 2 meas (B 2 ) + σ 2 phot + σ 2 meas (20) = (B 2 ) (SD) 2 + 1 −1 .<label>(21)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Comparison Between Methods</head><p>The repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are all measures applied to the results of a single decorrelation method. We can also conduct a more direct comparison of methods. First, we use the mean/difference plotting method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Altman &amp; Bland (1983)</ref> to make a visual comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 17 (real)</ref> and 18 display these plots for each pair of methods. Dashed lines show the mean of the differences, ∆, which estimate the relative bias between techniques; and ±SD(∆), which bounds the limits of variability. Column 10 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Tables 3 and 4</ref> list the method that gives the closest match to each of the methods of Column 1. This was chosen as the method giving the smallest range of eclipse values, min(|∆| + SD(∆)).</p><p>Another way of comparing two approaches is to use the Student's t-test to assess whether the results are drawn from a distribution with the same mean. The test posits the null hypothesis that both sets of data have the same mean and attempts to reject it. We use the unpaired version of the test to compute the t statistic (the difference in average values divided by the combined variance) and compare with the t-distribution for the number of degrees of freedom. The bottom right corner of each panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 17 and 18</ref> displays the probability that t is larger than the computed value if the null hypotheses were true. The null hypothesis is rejected if p &lt; 5%, i.e., the measured statistic is in the tail of the distribution. In all the comparisons for simulated data and most comparisons for real data, the hypothesis is not rejected. However, for real data, both KR/Pmap and SP(K2) are likely not to have the same mean as ICA, KR/Data, or PLD.</p><p>We can also do a global comparison of methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test, which posits the null hypothesis that all sets of eclipse depths have the same mean. This analysis assumes that the group of eclipse depths for each method follows a normal distribution, and that each group has approximately the same variance (usually taken to be within a factor of two of each other, which our measurements satisfy). Similarly to the t-test, it computes a statistic and compares it with the expected distribution under the null hypothesis. In this case the statistic is F , the ratio of the average variability among groups (the dispersion of group means) to the average variability within groups (average group variance). The comparison distribution is the F-distribution (also known as the Fisher-Snedecor distribution), which gives the probability of measuring F for the applicable degrees of freedom, given the null hypothesis. Smaller values of F imply a higher probability that the groups share the same mean. For the real data F = 2.8, for which only p = 1.6% of the F-distribution has larger values, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that not all methods have the same mean. If we remove KR/Pmap and SP(K2) from the calculation because they were the only methods that had failed ttests, then F = 0.9. In this case 45% of the distribution has larger values, and we don't reject the null hypothe-  Mean/difference plots comparing decorrelation techniques to each other for real data. Each panel plots differences in XO-3b eclipse depths for each epoch for the two techniques given, as a function of the mean depth for the epoch of the pair of techniques. The epoch is labeled on each point. Three horizontal dashed lines display the mean difference, or relative bias between the methods, ± one standard deviation, and the bottom left of each panel prints these numbers. Horizontal gray lines indicate zero difference. The bottom right of each panel displays the t-test p value, giving the probability that the t parameter is larger than the measured value if the null hypothesis is true (see text). If p &lt; 5%, the null hypothesis is rejected, which we take to mean that the two techniques are not measuring the same mean eclipse depth.</p><p>sis. We conclude therefore that KR/Pmap and SP(K2) eclipse depths are biased relative to the other techniques. For the simulated data F = 0.8 (all techniques), for which 57% of the distribution has larger values, so we don't reject the hypothesis of equal means.</p><p>We emphasize that null hypothesis significance tests like t and F tests are limited in scope and predictive power. In particular, they only allow us to reject the hypotheses of equal means, but not to accept them. Their probability distributions give the probability, assuming the means are equal, that the corresponding statistic has the measured value, not the probability that the means are or are not equal given the measured statistic. Nevertheless, they still have value, at least as a first approach to an inter-method comparison. Bayesian estimation with Monte-Carlo simulations would provide a more robust and comprehensive framework from which to analyze differences and similarities between results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Killeen 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kruschke 2013</ref>), but is beyond the scope of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION 4.1. Repeatability and accuracy of IRAC eclipse depth measurements 7</head><p>We have analyzed 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of hot Jupiter XO-3b using seven correlated noise removal methods. The simulations were in some ways an attempt to replicate the real data, but were given larger pointing fluctuations and drifts, thereby increasing correlated noise and decreasing the positional redundancy that many noise removal techniques rely on.</p><p>For the real data, the statistical uncertainties determined on individual eclipse depths accurately describe the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10 visits. In only one case, BLISS mapping, did the uncertainty need to be increased by 50%. For the simulations, all techniques except BLISS mapping required an increase of 20-60%,   implying that the methods may need slight adjustment to allow individual uncertainties to track the increased pointing fluctuations.</p><p>We defined three terms relating to measurement stability: repeatability (R), the expected difference between repeated measurements; reliability (r), the ratio of intrinsic (photon-limited) to measured variability; and accuracy (a), the ratio of intrinsic to measured error. Repeatability and reliability are inversely related, and reliability is a normalized estimate of precision. Accuracy combines both trueness and precision, and can theoretically never have a value less than the reliability.</p><p>For real XO-3b data, eclipse depths are repeatable within R 180 ppm. In other words, any two single eclipses are expected to be within 180 ppm of each other 68% of the time. The most repeatable techniques have R ≤ 100 ppm, which is about 4 /3 the photon limit ( √ 2σ phot ≈ 75). For the synthetic data, the repeatability is somewhat larger, R 300 ppm.</p><p>When comparing the scatter in eclipse depths with the intrinsic uncertainty due to photon noise, all techniques come within a factor of 3 of the photon limit for the real data (reliability r &gt; 0.33). ICA and the kernel regression techniques (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) exhibit a scatter consistent with more than two-thirds photon noise (r 0.65). For the simulations, the eclipse depth scatter is within a factor of 2-4 of the photon limit. Only the BLISS technique had the same value of reliability for the simulations as the real data, whereas the kernel regression techniques showed reductions of 40%. Even though BLISS may not be as precise as other techniques in the best circumstances, its precision is the most robust to an increasing positional spread.</p><p>The simulations afforded a unique view into the analysis of eclipses, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy and bias of each method based on knowledge of the true depth. The root mean-squared eclipse depth error ranged from 2.5 to 5 times the photon noise limit, yielding accuracy values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4. Most techniques obtained an average eclipse depth within 100 ppm of the true depth (1875 ppm).</p><p>We stress that repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are statistics that refer to the quality of single measurements. To say that a technique has a reliability of r means that an individual measurement of the eclipse depth has a 68% chance of being consistent with other measurements to within 1/r times the photon limit (assuming Gaussian statistics). An accuracy of a means that an individual measurement has a 68% chance of being within 1/a times the photon limit of the true value.</p><p>Techniques that give lower values of these quantities may nevertheless be extremely accurate when the results are averaged over multiple epochs. For example, PLD (r = 0.38 for simulated data) has larger overall scatter in individual measurements than BLISS (r = 0.44), but because PLD has a much lower bias than BLISS (5 vs -59, when averaged over 10 visits), both techniques have similar values of RMSE and are thus considered equally accurate (a = 0.39 for PLD and 0.40 for BLISS).</p><p>4.2. Is there a "best" IRAC correlated noise removal technique?</p><p>After examining the results of processing the 2 × 10 datasets with seven different techniques for data reduction and eclipse depth measurement, we can make some tentative statements about the relative merits of the methods:</p><p>• When the pointing fluctuations are at a normal level, ICA and the kernel regression techniques (KR/Data, KR/Pmap) return repeatability that is within a factor of ∼ 1.5 of the photon limit (r real ≥ 0.65), followed by PLD with r real ∼ 0.5, BLISS and SP(K2) with r real ∼ 0.4, and GP with r real ∼ 0.3. (Here we have used inverse reliability as a normalized proxy for repeatability-see</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">§3.4.2.)</formula><p>• BLISS is the most precise of all methods when the pointing fluctuations are larger (r sim ∼ 0.4).</p><p>• The precision of BLISS is the most robust to changes in the pointing fluctuations and drift (r real = r sim ).</p><p>• BLISS, PLD, and ICA are the most accurate and the most reliable (both a and r ∼ 0.4), at least when pointing fluctuations are larger (simulated data).</p><p>• PLD (with a quadratic phase curve model) yields the least biased results of all methods (however, all other methods used flat or linear phase curvessee below).</p><p>• KR/Pmap and SP(K2), both of which did not include phase curve variations in their eclipse fits, return eclipse depths that are strongly biased, for both real data (they are not consistent with having the same mean as the other methods) and simulated data (their measured average biases are more than twice those of most of the other methods).</p><p>We emphasize that we have not separately controlled for centroiding, photometry, correlated noise removal, or eclipse depth fitting. In comparing techniques above, we are really comparing the entire data reduction pipelines that go along with each method. In particular, the outof-eclipse phase curve model can significantly bias the measured eclipse depth. The simulated eclipses have nonlinear time-dependent phase variations that are concave downward (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Therefore, one expects eclipse fits using a linear (BLISS, GP, ICA, KR/Data) or flat [KR/Pmap, SP(K2)] phase curve to yield a centerof-occultation flux that is lower than the truth, as indeed seems to be the case.</p><p>We can calculate the true eclipse depth bias due to the phase curve model from the (noiseless) input light curve, L(t) ( §A.2), by fitting various phase models to the flux outside occultation and measuring the depth. For the XO-3b simulation shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, the fit eclipse depth is biased by −51 ppm for a flat phase model, −27 ppm for a linear model, and −2 ppm for a quadratic model. Not including SP(K2), these values account for approximately 50% of the measured average biases <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">(Table 4</ref>, column 12). Given that the uncertainties in the mean depths <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">(Table 4</ref>, column 7) have similar magnitudes to the biases, a larger ensemble of measurements would be necessary to make any definite claims regarding bias. Nevertheless, much of the true bias for the methods that used a flat or linear phase model would have been reduced dramatically by a quadratic phase curve.</p><p>In the BLISS processing, quadratic and sinusoidal models were tried but were not favored by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Equation B22). The only method whose reported depths are based on a quadratic phase curve, PLD, yields a relatively low positive bias (+5 ppm), which is consistent, within its uncertainty, with the expected true bias of −2 ppm.</p><p>This leads to the question: given that phase variations are expected to be nonlinear (if they exist at all, they are usually periodic), how should we interpret the BIC when it favors linearity? The BIC often helps minimize free parameters and ensure that models are generalizable among similar datasets; but it also is known to underfit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dziak et al. 2012)</ref>, not allowing for sufficient variability and sometimes leading to biased results. Another quantitive model selection technique, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) tends to overfit data (allow for too many free parameters) and therefore be too tied to the specifics of a given dataset. One approach, suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dziak et al. (2012)</ref> would be to select the best models according to both the BIC and AIC, and bracket a range of model sizes, instead of specifying definitively one model as the "best." In the end, model selection still requires human judgement to balance quantitative criteria such as the AIC and the BIC with reasonable expectations based on theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Are IRAC eclipse depth uncertainties underestimated?</head><p>A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref> derived systematic uncertainties for IRAC eclipse depths. They compared 10 2-epoch pairs of Spitzer eclipse depth measurements for six different planetary systems, each epoch measured by different teams, including measurements from three IRAC wavelength bands and one MIPS band, as well as IRAC data taken using both dithers and star-ing mode. They estimated the systematic variance in each depth from the squared difference in eclipse depth values between epochs, minus the sum of reported variances (squared uncertainties) for each epoch. This is equivalent to our estimate of f dis ( §3.2), but for a sample size of N = 2 instead of 10. In 5 out of 10 comparisons the difference between epochs was larger than the reported uncertainty by more than a factor of 2. Combining results across data analysis methods, planetary systems, IRAC wavelength bands, and from both staring and dithering mode, they concluded that in general single eclipse measurements made with Spitzer/IRAC either have an uncertainty floor of 500 ppm, or that their uncertainties should be multiplied by a factor of f dis = 3. They used their inflated uncertainties to assert that features seen in broadband spectra are more likely due to instrumental systematics than molecular bands.</p><p>Following this, some authors have echoed the conclusions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schwartz &amp; Cowan (2015)</ref> obtained theoretical estimates on the properties of 50 exoplanet atmospheres after first assuming that many of the reported Spitzer eclipse depth uncertainties were underestimated by a factor of 3. Most recently, a general review on the observation of exoplanet atmospheres (Crossfield 2015) also accepted the <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref> assertion regarding overestimated Spitzer precision, stating that, "it is debatable whether broadband photometry usefully determines atmospheric abundances in any transiting exoplanets <ref type="bibr">[em- phasis added]</ref>." If this statement were true, many recent analyses using modern reduction techniques and realistic (but not inflated) uncertainties would be invalidated. For some examples, see the <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wong et al. (2015)</ref> claims regarding high altitude silicate clouds in WASP19b and enhanced C/O ratio in HAT-P-7b; or the <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sing et al. (2016)</ref> categorization of the atmospheres of 10 hot Jupiters from clear to cloudy using HST and Spitzer data.</p><p>Our conclusions contradict those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref>. To avoid the influence of confounding variables that affect measurement stability, the present paper focuses on a single planetary system, using data from a single IRAC band and single observing mode (staring mode), and involves a parallel analysis isolating different correlated noise removal techniques (and their associated data reduction pipelines). In contrast to the f dis = 3 estimate of Hansen et al., we have found for both real and simulated XO-3b data that the statistical uncertainties do not need to be increased by more than 50% to accomodate the scatter in data [for all decorrelation methods except SP(K2), which was created for K2 and not optimized for Spitzer], and in many cases no inflation was necessary. This holds even for simulated data, which had increased correlated noise and decreased spatial redundancy. Our estimates of f dis include confidence intervals based on 10-epoch samples <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(column  6 of Tables 3 and 4)</ref>, which vary by ∼ ± 1 /3f dis . As emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lyons (1992)</ref>, the uncertainty on f dis for N = 2 (the sample size used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>) is much larger, up to a few times the actual value of f dis .</p><p>The chief source of the discrepancies between separate eclipse depth measurements examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref> is the evolution in both observing and data reduction strategies that has occurred to accomodate exoplanet observation. One key example of nonrepeatability of IRAC eclipse depths cited by Hansen et al. is the 4.5 µm measurement for HD 209458b. An early study of this hot Jupiter used broadband Spitzer secondary eclipse spectra from 3.6 to 24 µm to infer the existence of an atmospheric inversion layer in the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2008</ref>). These 2005 measurements were among the earliest eclipse observations made with IRAC, and were obtained using the (then) standard practice of alternating exposures between each IRAC channel, which required a repointing every 4 × 64 subarray images. When Spitzer is commanded to continuously observe an inertially fixed target ("staring" mode), a source's position will fluctuate over a region of about 0.08 px diameter in one hour, while also incurring a slow linear drift of about 0.01 px per hour. Experience shows that this usually yields sufficient redundancy in source position to decorrelate intra-pixel gain in a set of photometric measurements. On the other hand, Spitzer's blind repointing accuracy is much worse: about 0.3 px RMS. It is not surprising, then, that the 2005 measurements of HD 209458b, which were repointed every 256 frames, yielded large discontinuities in the target position, making it extremely difficult to decorrelate the data at 3.6 and 4.5 µm and extract accurate eclipse depths (especially using a low order polynomial fit to the intra-pixel gain, as was the common practice). Subsequent measurements of the full phase curve of HD 209458b (by a team that included two of the three authors on the earlier study) were taken in continuous staring mode with no repointing, and the data were decorrelated using kernel regression as a function of x, y, and noise pixels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zellem et al. 2014</ref>). The new methodology resulted in a 35% lower 4.5 µm eclipse depth that did not require an atmospheric temperature inversion. <ref type="bibr">Hansen et al. (2014, Table 2</ref>) use the difference between the 4.5 µm eclipse depth derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. (2008)</ref> and that derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zellem et al. (2014)</ref> as a baseline estimate of the systematic uncertainty in Spitzer/IRAC measurements at 4.5 µm. This is incorrect, since it treats both approaches to measurement and reduction as equally valid, and equally indicative of the possible range in measurable eclipse depths. The 2005 IRAC measurements of HD 209458b were taken in such a way as to make the intra-pixel systematics in the InSb arrays virtually uncorrectable. In more recent years observational practice has evolved towards a more optimal staring mode configuration, especially with the 2009 advent of PCRS Peak-Up to ensure that targets are repeatably positioned (to within 0.1 px) in a region with minimal intra-pixel gain variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ingalls et al. 2012</ref>). Eclipse data taken in this manner eliminate the discontinuous position jumps present in the 2005 data.</p><p>Also, the techniques for removing correlated noise have improved dramatically from the early days of low order polynomial fitting. Even the sub-optimal 2005 measurements of HD 209458b were shown to be consistent with later measurements after reanalysis using BLISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014</ref>) and GP ( <ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015</ref>). One of the criticisms made by Hansen et al. was that reported uncertainties for published eclipse depths were unrealistic and did not sufficiently take systematics into account. We agree that early methods did not adequately estimate the errors, but this is not a problem in most of the newer approaches, as seen in the current paper.</p><p>In his review of the study of exoplanet atmospheres, Burrows (2014) pointed out that observers and theorists have tended to overinterpret the earliest measurements. The article is a sobering reminder that results from a young field may be overturned by improved approaches to observation, reduction, and theory. The decrease in Spitzer/IRAC correlated noise due to staring mode and PCRS Peak-Up, as well as the improved understanding of systematics and development of better decorrelation techniques, have led to a situation in which the variations in eclipse depths described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref> are now outliers when compared to variations observed today. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. (2014)</ref> is a watershed work that attempted to quantify the uncertainties in Spitzer single exoplanet eclipse depths hinted at by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows (2014)</ref>, via comparisons between paired studies. However, like the earliest theoretical conclusions that were biased by outlier eclipse depth measurements, Hansen et al. may have been similarly biased and overinterpreted the earliest variations in eclipse depths.</p></div>

However, systematics will still be present in future missions: JWST will have similar jitter to pixel scale ratios as found in Spitzer/IRAC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beichman et al. 2014</ref>), which will lead to photometric variability due to intra-pixel gain fluctuations. Furthermore, observers will demand increasingly more precise measurements as more detailed questions are asked regarding e.g., atmospheric variability. Next generation space observatories will undoubtedly be pushed to the limits of their systematic error budgets and, like Spitzer, require a thorough assessment of their stability and accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have performed a Spitzer/IRAC repeatability analysis of 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of XO-3b using seven correlated noise removal techniques. Most methods are capable of estimating accurate uncertainties on individual eclipse depths. The eclipse depth repeatability (expected difference between pairs of measurements) under normal pointing variations averages ∼ 150 ppm, only twice the photon limit, but can worsen as the spread in target positions increases. The BLISS technique, however, is most robust to such changes. The BLISS, PLD, and ICA techniques are the most accurate and repeatable when the pointing fluctuations are larger. Future analysis might benefit from separating the phase curve model from the decorrelation technique, as it can bias eclipse depths.</p><p>A few recent publications have claimed that Spitzer eclipse depth uncertainties should be increased by a factor of 3. Such claims rest upon a comparison of literature estimates of varying provenance and quality, using only two epochs per target, and are not substantiated by our more controlled analysis with a larger, more uniform sample.</p><p>Although we have controlled reasonably well for most important observing variables, our conclusions are strictly valid only for the IRAC 4.5 µm array, and in the particular signal-to-noise regime of XO-3b (photon noise limit on an eclipse depth of ∼ 50 ppm). As multi-epoch Spitzer/IRAC measurements accumulate for a variety of exoplanet targets, the data will better support more broad-based repeatability analysis, which will constrain further the limits of variability for reduction techniques, and ultimately for the instrument itself.</p><p>Some of the lessons learned with IRAC can be usefully applied to future space missions. The high degree of repeatability demonstrated in this paper was facilitated by a careful characterization and optimization of pointing during exoplanet observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grillmair et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ingalls et al. 2012</ref>). This understanding of the systematics was greatly facilitated by a set of dedicated calibration observations. The IRAC team has also found that hosting exoplanet data workshops and engaging the active research community has led to the optimization of observing strategies and improved the quality of data greatly. This paper shows that state of the art reduction techniques do an excellent and consistent job of mitigating systematic noise. Focused data challenges could prove equally effective for future exoplanet space missions.</p><p>We thank the anonymous referee for comments that greatly improved the quality of the paper. We thank Nick Cowan for a thorough reading of an early version of the manuscript and for discussions that helped clarify the conclusions.

Let q(t) ≡ (t − t 0 )/P w (t) + φ w /(2π) (mod 1). The skew phase function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">φ sk (t) =          π 1 2Sw − 2 q : 0 ≤ q &lt; S w π q−Sw 1−2Sw − 2q + 1 2 : S w ≤ q &lt; 1 − S w π 1 2Sw − 2 (q − 1) : 1 − S w ≤ q &lt; 1.

In a normal sine wave, S w equals 1/4, i.e., the curve peaks when the argument of the sine equals π/2. If 0 &lt; S w &lt; 1/4 the curve has a faster than sinusoidal rise, and is skewed to the left. If 1/4 &lt; S w &lt; 1/2 the curve has a slower than sinusoidal rise and is skewed to the right. Either set of S w choices results in a smoothly varying sawtooth-like curve. Additional flexibility is enabled by a time variable wobble amplitude A w (t) and period P w (t), with the values varying continuously in a random walk having maximum excursions assignable via the parameters ∆A w,max and ∆P w,max .

To do this, most of the parameters for a given epoch were generated randomly within the predefined ranges given. a Ranges give either hard limits of a uniform deviate ("U" in column 3), ±1 σ of a Gaussian deviate ("G" in column 3), or a constant value ("C"in column 3).</p></div>

Imaging</head><p>After using the IRAC pointing model to predict the position of a point source as a function of time, the IRAC Point Response Function (PRF) allows one to compute the image of the source at each of those positions. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The PRF is essentially a convolution of the optical point spread function (PSF) and the intra-pixel response function, sampled on each of the IRAC detector arrays. There are 25 PRF image files per IRAC array, each computed for a different region of the array. The files in turn contain 5 × 5 interleaved sets of point source realizations offset 1/5 pixel from each other. For a point source at a given (x[t], y[t]) decimal pixel location, the image of the source at pixel i p j p is made by interpolating between the 5 × 5 PRF realizations</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">I(i p , j p , t) = PRF interp ipjp (x[t], y[t]).<label>(A14)</label></formula><p>Since the core PRF files currently available were built from cryogenic data, we have converted them to post-cryogenic IRAC by assuming that the structure of a point source image is the same as in the cryogenic mission (the optical PSF is unchanged), but that the intrapixel response has changed. To account for this, we scaled the 25 cryogenic PRF realizations with respect to each other such that aperture photometry varied according to the measured post-cryogenic photometric gain map at the same intrapixel offsets. In addition, all PRF centers were shifted such that the center of light centroid (Equations 1 and 2) yields the correct result at zero pixel phase.</p><p>The absolute scaling of I(i p , j p , t) is arbitrary.

Fowler Sampling</head><p>Given ˙ e(i p , j p , t), a function that can be evaluated at arbitrary time, we produce a simulated IRAC image by mimicking the integration and sampling properties of the IRAC electronics.</p><p>IRAC acquires data using the Fowler-sampling technique, defined by the sample time, ∆t, the Fowler number, FN, and the Wait Ticks, WT (IRAC Instrument Handbook, section 2.4). The sample time ∆t is fixed at 0.2 s for full array readout and 0.01 s for subarray readout. At the beginning of an IRAC measurement, each detector (pixel) is reset. Charge is then accumulated due to photoelectron production and noise. The accumulated charge in a pixel is read out every ∆t seconds, for FN "pedestal" reads, P i (t), WT "wait" samples are skipped, and FN "signal" reads, S i (t) are measured. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure A1</ref> (a) is a schematic depiction of Fowler sampling, and its relationship with the pointing model. Each data file contains either one 256 × 256-pixel image for full array readout mode, or 64 32 × 32-pixel images for subarray readout. Define δt as the rate at which the pointing model is sampled. The total charge accumulated in one pointing sample at time t is e(i p , j p , t) = ˙ e(i p , j p , t)δt. To capture possible rapid fluctuations in pointing that might affect the stellar image over the integration, we let the Fowler sample time ∆t be somewhat larger than δt. We typically use δt = ∆t/10, so there are n = 10 PRF realizations to be integrated per Fowler sample.</p><p>We compute e(i p , j p , t) every δt seconds over the course of the entire integration, which lasts t The accumulated charge is stored for every Fowler sampling interval (starting at P 1 and ending at S FN ), including the wait ticks for proper noise accumulation.

The superscript "mean" indicates that this is an estimate of the mean charge.

The technique was used to model instrumental systematics in exoplanet observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gibson et al. (2012)</ref> and first applied to Spitzer/IRAC data by <ref type="bibr">Evans et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>For the Data Challenge, the GP analysis by T. Evans started with a maximum likelihood fit to the eclipse depth, mid-eclipse time, and the variance in the white noise, plus a set of parameters for kernel functions describing how the covariance between two photometric measurements varies with their distance in pixel (x, y) and time. The covariance kernel functions are used analogously to the kernel regression function described below, except the standard kernel regression is applied directly to the photometry. Uncertainties for the eclipse parameters were obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Metropolis-Hastings sampling in the region of maximum likelihood. In the final MCMC step the covariance kernel parameters and white noise variance were held fixed to allow rapid evaluation of the likelihood. One drawback to the GP method is that the evaluation of the N × N empirical covariance matrix among N data points is often prohibitive with large datasets. To avoid this difficulty, fluxes and centroids were binned as a function of time in groups of ∼ 30 s, resulting in N ∼ 1000 data points in each eclipse light curve (see <ref type="bibr">Evans et al. 2015</ref>, for more details).</p></div>

This is the classic "cocktail party problem" of signal processing, which attempts to mimic the human brain's innate capacity for hearing multiple speakers in a crowded room <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hyvärinen &amp; Oja 2000)</ref>. In contrast to principle component analysis, ICA does not assume that the statistically independent signals follow Gaussian distributions, and in fact attempts to maximize the non-Gaussianity after separation. The methods of ICA were first developed for exoplanet light curve analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Waldmann (2012)</ref> and used on Spitzer data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morello et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>The ICA data reduction of the XO-3b real and simulated eclipse datasets, by G.

(2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morello (2015)</ref> for transits. In this variant, the source separation operates on wavelet-transformed individual pixel light curves, after which the resulting components are transformed back to the time domain. The wavelet transform was useful for enhancing the signal to noise ratio in the lower frequency instrument systematics components prior to ICA. By operating on the individual pixel light curves, ICA circumvents a built-in degeneracy that occurs for most decorrelation techniques, which decorrelate aperture fluxes using (x, y) centroids. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The sum of an eclipse light curve model (including a linear phase variation) and scaled versions of the non-eclipse independent components was then fit to the raw light curve. An Adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm with delayed rejection produced chains of 300,000 values to serve as samples of the posterior distributions of the fit parameters. These distributions yielded estimates of the parameters and their uncertainties. The final error bars were then increased to include the ICA component separation error.

IRACSIM: AN IRAC DATA SIMULATOR FOR POINT SOURCE IMAGES To produce the simulated XO-3b observations used for the Data Challenge, we used IRACSIM 8 , a package built in the IDL programming language. The program uses a model of the Spitzer/IRAC system to create synthetic IRAC point source measurements, outputting FITS image (or image cube) files similar to those produced by the IRAC basic calibrated data (BCD) pipeline. The simulator model is built on three major components of Spitzer/IRAC behavior: (1) pointing, (2) imaging, and (3) Fowler sampling. We give an overview of this model here. A.1. Pointing The IRAC pointing model specifies the position of a point source as a function of time, (x[t], y[t]). The model has four main components, based on the known structure of Spitzer pointing variations (Grillmair et al. 2012): a high frequency fluctuation or "jitter" with amplitude ∼ 0.05 px; a sawtooth-shaped "wobble" due to a battery heater cycling on and off (period ∼ 40 min, amplitude ∼ 0.05 px); an approximately 30 minute initial drift of up to 0.1 px; and a long term drift of ∼ 0.3 px per day. (See also Hora et al. 2014, Figure 8 for high fidelity measurements of jitter, wobble, and drift.) The pointing as a function of time is given by:</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. DESCRIPTION OF CORRELATED NOISE REMOVAL TECHNIQUES</head><p>We review below the seven techniques for removing correlated noise used to reduce the XO-3b datasets described in this paper, adding specific notes on implementation. B.1. BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping BLISS mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stevenson et al. 2012</ref>) uses bilinear interpolation over a photometric dataset, to predict the intrapixel response at a given (x, y) location. The procedure establishes a subpixel rectangular grid of node points, referred to as "knots," spanning the dataset. Each knot is assigned the mean flux value from among all points in the dataset for which that knot point is the nearest. The intra-pixel gain at a given data point is then computed from the knot fluxes via bilinear interpolation to the point (x, y).</p><p>For the implementation described here, performed by H. Diamond-Lowe and K. Stevenson, photometric measurements were obtained using the POET pipeline described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stevenson et al. (2012)</ref>, which produced artifact-corrected BCD images interpolated to a 1/5-pixel grid. Centroid positions were measured by fitting a 2D Gaussian profile with fixed width (see the Supplemental Information for <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Stevenson et al. 2010</ref>) on the resampled images, and fluxes were measured using aperture photometry. Intra-pixel effects were removed using BLISS mapping, and various models were attempted to fit the decorrelated light curve, including a flat or possible linear detector "ramp" (time-dependent flux baseline) and flat, linear, quadratic, or sinusoidal phase variations. The eclipse depth, duration, and time of ingress and egress were fit separately for each epoch, as well as commonly among all visits. Acceptance of model parameters was decided by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): BIC = −2 lnˆLlnˆ lnˆL + k ln(n),</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.6. Segmented Polynomial, K2 Pipeline [SP(K2)]</head><p>The segmented polynomial algorithm was originally developed for use with K2 data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Buzasi et al. 2015</ref>), where detrending is normally required due to the presence of spacecraft pointing resets, and other less significant sources of correlated noise. The approach is reminiscent of polynomial surface fitting as used on Spitzer data, but with some differences. Detrending is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a third-order polynomial is fit to the flux vs. (x, y) centroid for the entire time series and removed. This process is repeated, with successive third order polynomial fits being applied to each set of residuals, until there is &lt; 1% further reduction in the high-frequency noise standard deviation. In the second stage, the resulting time series is divided into segments, each of which is iteratively decorrelated using polynomial fitting. This segmented detrending is repeated for 10 different segment lengths between 0.04 and 0.125 of the total time series length, and the final time series is the result of applying a median filter to the 10 results. SP(K2) detrending was applied to the Spitzer Data Challenge measurements by D. Buzasi. Due to time limitations a simple box function was used to fit the eclipse profile, and the uncertainties reported are formal fit errors.</p><p>No attempt was made to tune SP(K2) for Spitzer data. Future analysis might benefit from adjustment of the segmentation and fitting strategy. For K2, the segmentation is partially necessary to accommodate unpredictable discontinuous jumps in source position when the pointing is reset, but this is not as much of an issue for Spitzer staring mode observations (except for observations longer than 12 hours, for which there will be predictable pointing resets). Furthermore, IRAC's intra-pixel gain variations are much larger than those of K2-the gain of IRAC varies by ∼ 8% in Ch 1 (3.6 µm) and ∼ 4% in Ch 2 (4.5 µm) across a pixel, whereas the K2 effect is only about 2%. Spitzer data might be more amenable to spatial, rather than temporal, segmentation of the data in stage 2.</p></div>			</div>

		<title level="m" type="main">used KR/Data. A complementary analysis of the synthetic XO-3b dataset was performed by I. Wong for the Data Challenge. For both analyses only the x and y centroids (as measured using the center of light technique; see §3.1) were used in the kernel&apos;s distance metric, but˜βbut˜ but˜β was employed for most eclipses as a scale factor in determining the optimal aperture size for the photometry. Wong et al. chose k = 50 nearest neighbors for the weighted sums. They fit the data in two ways: each epoch separately, and all epochs combined. The separate fits were only concerned with the eclipse depth, time of mideclipse, and linear slope of phase curve, whereas the global fits also included the planet-to-star radius ratio, the orbital inclination, and the semi-major axis to stellar radius. Both fits were performed using a Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) nonlinear least squares algorithm. They then used both a prayer-bead method and an MCMC routine to estimate the distributions of each parameter and their uncertainties, and reported the largest uncertainty of the two methods. A variation on the kernel regression technique, KR/Pmap, uses the photometry of a separate calibration star as the training set for the regression</title>

	<note>Since the IRAC simulator uses an idealized PRF that cannot replicate the detailed structure of the actual pixel response, the real BD +67 1044 dataset is not appropriate for reduction of simulated data. Instead, a synthetic pixel mapping set was created. The measurements were designed to mimic the actual pmap measurements of BD +67 1044, with similar source flux, integration parameters, mapping centers, and number of data points. The pointing model parameters were taken from the same ranges as for the XO-3b simulations (Table A1), to approximate realistic motions during integration and sampling. Eclipse parameters were derived from the KR/Pmap-decorrelated data by fitting a Mandel &amp; Agol (2002) light curve shape with no phase trend using an L-M nonlinear least squares algorithm. The uncertainties returned were solely the formal uncertainties in the L-M fit, and should be considered underestimates. As a check on the results. Transit Analysis Package (TAP; Gazak et al. 2012) was also used to fit the eclipses, after setting the limb darkening coefficients to zero. While the uncertainties tended to be more realistic under TAP&apos;s MCMC analysis, the eclipse depths themselves were systematically low compared to both the L-M fit and the mean of the other techniques. We therefore decided to use the L-M results and assess the uncertainties using the &quot;overdispersion factor&quot; described in §3.2. B.5. Pixel level decorrelation (PLD</note>
