			<abstract>
				<p>We report on observations of several transit events of the transiting planet TrES-2 obtained with the Cassegrain-Telskop-Kamera at the University Observatory Jena. Between March 2007 and November 2008 ten different transits and almost a complete orbital period were observed. Overall, in 40 nights of observation 4291 exposures (in total 71.52 h of observation) of the TrES-2 parent star were taken. With the transit timings for TrES-2 from the 34 events published by the TrES-network, the Transit Light Curve project and the Exoplanet Transit Database plus our own ten transits, we find that the orbital period is P = (2.470614 ± 0.000001) d, a slight change by ∼ 0.6 s compared to the previously published period. We present new ephemeris for this transiting planet. Furthermore, we found a second dip after the transit which could either be due to a blended variable star or occultation of a second star or even an additional object in the system. Our observations will be useful for future investigations of timing variations caused by additional perturbing planets and/or stellar spots and/or moons.</p>

The planet orbits the nearby 11th magnitude G0 V main-sequence dwarf GSC 03549-02811 every ∼2.5 days. From high-resolution spectra, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sozzetti et al. (2007)</ref> derived accurate values of the stellar atmospheric parameters of the TrES-2 parent star such as effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity. With the help of detailed analysis of high precision z-band photometry and light curve modeling of the 1.4% deep transit by the Transit Light Curve (TLC) Project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holman et al. 2007</ref>), estimates of the planetary parameters could also be determined. One goal of the TLC project is to measure variations in the transit times and light curve shapes that would be caused by the influence of additional bodies in the system (Agol et ⋆ Based on observations obtained with telescopes of the University Observatory Jena, which is operated by the Astrophysical Institute of the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and the 80cm telescope of the Wendelstein Observatory of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. ⋆⋆ Corresponding author: e-mail: straetz@astro.uni-jena.de <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Holman &amp; Murray 2005;</ref>. The large impact parameter of TrES-2 makes the duration more sensitive to any changes. Hence, TrES-2 is an excellent target for the detection of long-term changes in transit characteristics induced by orbital precession <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Miralda- Escudé 2002)</ref>. We have started high precision photometric observations at the University Observatory Jena in fall 2006. In this work we use the transit method to observe the transiting planet TrES-2. We paid special attention to the accurate determination of transit times in order to identify precise transit timing variations that would be indicative of perturbations from additional bodies and to refine the orbital parameters of the system. First results were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raetz et al. (2009a)</ref>. TrES-2 lies within the field of view of the NASA Kepler mission (Borucki et al 2003; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basri et al 2005)</ref>. During the four year mission, Kepler will observe nearly 600 transits of TrES-2 (O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2006</ref>). The precision of Kepler will be extremely sensitive to search for additional planets in the TrES-2 system through their dynamical perturbations. In this paper, we describe the observations, the data reduction and the analysis procedures. Furthermore, we present results for TrES-2 that we obtained from our observations at the University Observatory Jena.</p></div>

Our transit observations are carried out with the CTK (Cassegrain Teleskop Kamera), the CCD imager operated at the 25 cm auxiliary telescope of the University Observatory Jena.

All TrES-2 observations were taken in I-band with 60 s exposure time. We achieve a mean cadence of the data points of 1.4 min (readout time of the CTK around 24 s). The mean photometric precision of the V ≈ 11 mag bright TrES-2 host star is 0.007 mag. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the field of view of the CTK around the TrES-2 host star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Additional Photometry</head><p>In 2007 July and September, we observed two transit events at the Wendelstein Observatory of the university of Munich.  <ref type="formula">(2006)</ref> showed, amateur astronomers can produce photometry with sufficient quality to detect a transit. With an 8-inch (∼ 20 cm) Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (f/D = 10) and a ST-6 CCD camera (field of view 13.6 ′ × 10.2 ′ ) without filter (white-light observations) located in Herges-Hallenberg, Germany, we reached a photometric precision of 0.01 mag. With this observation we have three independent measurements of the transit from 2007 September 16 (epoch 163 according to eq. 1), see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">In general</head><p>We calibrate the images of our target field using the standard IRAF 2 procedures darkcombine, flatcombine and ccdproc. We did not correct for bad pixel (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Raetz et al. 2009b</ref>).</p><p>First we perform aperture photometry by using the IRAF task chphot (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Raetz et al. 2009b</ref>  stars). To compute the best possible artificial comparison star we successively sort out all stars with low weights (stars that are not on every image, stars with low S/N and variable stars). As result, we get an artificial comparison star made of the most constant stars with the best S/N in the field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Broeg et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Raetz et al. 2009b</ref>).</p><p>In the third step we correct for systematic effects by using the Sys-Rem detrending algorithm which was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tamuz et al. (2005)</ref> and implemented by Johannes Koppenhoefer, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. We showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Raetz et al. (2009b)</ref> that the usage of Sys-Rem is not possible in every case of observations at the University Observatory Jena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The case of TrES-2</head><p>After calibrating all images, we perform aperture photometry on all available field stars. We found 1294 stars -the TrES-2 host star and 1293 comparison stars -in the CTK field of view. We used an aperture of 5 pixels (11.03 ′′ ) radius and an annulus for sky subtraction ranging in radius from 15 to 20 pixels, centered on each star. To get the best possible result for the transit light curves, we reject all comparison stars that could not be measured on every image, faint stars with low S/N and variable stars which could introduce disturbing signals to the data. We have done this analysis individually for every night. To get comparable values for every night, we search for those comparison stars that belong always to the most constant stars. Finally we use for every night the same 10 constant comparison stars to calculate the artificial comparison stars (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). With this method we could improve the preliminary results given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raetz et al. (2009a)</ref>. For the Wendelstein observations we chose an aperture size of 10 pixels (5 ′′ ). And for sky subtraction we use a ringshaped annulus having an inner/outer radius of 15/20 pixels, respectively. We were not able to use the same 10 comparison stas as in the case of observations at the University Observatory Jena because they do not lie within the 8.5 ′ × 8.5 ′ field of view of MONICA. From 225 objects in this field we could calculate the artificial comparison star for both nights using the seven most constant stars. For the amateur observations only 147 stars could be measured within an aperture of 5 pixels (11.8 ′′ ) and an annulus for sky substraction similar to observations at the University Observatory Jena and on Wendelstein. Again it was not possible to use the 10 best comparison stars froUniversity Observatory Jena observations or the seven comparison stars from Wendelstein observations. In this case the artificial comparison star consists of the 15 most contant stars in the ST-6 field. Finally the TrES-2 host star is compared to the artificial comparison star to get the differential magnitudes for ev-  In the resulting light curves of the TrES-2 host star and the comparison stars we used Sys-Rem. The algorithm works without any prior knowledge of the effects. The number of effects that should be removed from the light curves is selectable and can be set as a parameter. As mentioned in section 3.1 it was not possible to use Sys-Rem for every night.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we summarize how many effects we removed from the light curves by using Sys-Rem before the transit itself is identified as systematic effect. Zero means that we could not apply Sys-Rem. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows for example the effect of Sys-Rem for two different transits of TrES-2.</p><p>The resulting light curves from the University Observatory Jena observations can be found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> and 4a, the Wendelstein observations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4b</ref> and 5 and the amateur observations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4c</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Determination of the midtransit time</head><p>Because the output of the IRAF task phot are magnitudes we convert our data to relative flux. We then calculate a weighted average of the pre-ingress and post-egress data and divided all data points by this value, in order to normalize the flux.  To get the best fit we compare the analytic light curve with the observed light curve until the χ 2 is minimal. The best fits of the analytic light curve to our observed data are shown as crosses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2, 3</ref>, 4 and 5. With the help of the χ 2 -test we could determine the time of the midtransit even in the case of partial transits. We summarize the observed midtransit times in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> marked with "This work". We give the 1-σ error bars.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Ephemeris</head><p>In addition to the transits observed by us we could find 34 transit times from 2006-2008 in the literature. The altogether 44 transits are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>. We used the ephemeris of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holman et al. (2007)</ref> to compute "observed minus calculated" (O-C) residuals for all 44 transit times. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Absolute photometry</head><p>To derive absolute photometric V , R and I magnitudes we observed the TrES-2 parent star on 2008 July 28, a photometric night. In order to perform the transformation to the standard system we observed standard star field #1 defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Galadí-Enríquez et al. (2000)</ref> which is located around the two Landolt standard stars SA 44 28 and SA 44 113 <ref type="bibr">(Lan- dolt 1983)</ref>. Altogether we took four images of the standard star field at different airmasses and a sequence of 32 TrES-2 parent star images in each filter. We measured the instrumental magnitudes of 6 standard stars -the two Landolt stars and four secondary standard stars (U BV RI photometry given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, indentification chart shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>) -in each frame and calculated the zero point correction c and the first order extinction coefficient k. The results for each filter are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. During the analysis it turned out, that there is a faint object near the TrES-2 host star. We chose a larger aperture for the absolute photometry than for differential photometry (10 pixels instead of 5 pixels) to include this faint star in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. The two Landold stars SA 44 28 and SA 44 113 are labelled with "A" and "B", respectively. North is up; east is to the left. our measurements. With the help of the flux ratio of the two stars we could calculate the individual brightnesses. We finally derive the Bessell V , R and I magnitudes of the TrES-2 parent star obtained from the average of all 32 individual measurements. The errors given correspond to the standard deviation of these measurements: 7 The second dip</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Detection of a second dip</head><p>In our first observation of a transit of TrES-2 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> a.) the light curve shows an interesting behavior in the last part of the observations. After the transit is completed, the flux again decreases for a short time (about 30 min). The depth of this event amounts to 0.8 %, which is about half the depth of the transit. To check whether the dip is a real, 1.80 32 a Time between center of the transit and center of the dip b calculated for published distance of the TrES-2 host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sozzetti et al. 2007</ref>) and semi major axis of TrES-2 (O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2006)</ref> reproducible event and no measuring error, we scheduled TrES-2 for our regular monitoring program. An indication of the existence of the dip is published by O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. (2006</ref>) in a TELAST R-band light curve in their <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, where one can clearly recognize a brightness drop. On 2007 May 3 we succeeded a second time to observe a complete transit of TrES-2 (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 2 c.)</ref>. Again the dip is clearly visible after the transit is finished.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Further observations</head><p>As shown in section 2 we observed ten different transits. We could detect the second dip only after our first two transit observations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2 a. and c.</ref>). Detailed analysis of the midtime of the dip showed that the dip moved away from the center of the transit (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>). However, this does not follow a linear relationship. After using Sys-Rem for the light curves the results change. For the observations from 2007 March 13 the dip disappeared after removing systematic effects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2 b.</ref>) while it became stronger for the transit of 2007 May 3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2 d.</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Possible explanations</head><p>We develop some ideas which may explain the existence of the dip. Altogether, we construct four hypotheses. At the present time we cannot confirm a definitive solution. We point out that from the available data it is not possible to rule out that the second dip is photometric false alarm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">A nearby variable star</head><p>On the CTK images we could identify another object close to the TrES-2 parent star due to elongation of the PSF. Because of the large pixel scale of the CTK this object and the TrES-2 parent star cannot be resolved independently. This faint object is within the aperture when doing the photometry. If this star is variable, it could produce a dip. Again there are two explanations why the dip vanished. Because of the proper motion (2.9 mas yr in right ascension and −3. all our further observations no eclipse happened. We checked this hypothesis by using a camera with better pixel scale. Obervations on the Wendelstein Observatory showed constant light for the nearby star. A R-band image of the Wendelstein observations and the corresponding light curve are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>. However, this result does not disprove the hypothesis of the blended eclipsing binary or another variable background star.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2">An additional planet</head><p>Another idea is the existence of a larger outer planet. The known planet TrES-2 shows a grazing transit in front of its parent star. If the inclination of an outer planet is only minimally different from the orbit of TrES-2, the second planet could be much more grazing and could show a shorter duration. This situation is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>: The farther out the planet the less the inclination difference, so that such a transit is observable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 10</head><p>TrES-2 with a second outer planet whose inclination is only minimally different to the inclination of the orbit of TrES-2.</p><p>Because the dip is always 1 -2 h after the center of the transit, both planets would have to be in mean-motion resonances. Because the outer planet needs much longer for one orbit then TrES-2, that would be an explanation for the nondetection of the dip in some observations. The dip was detected after the transit events corresponding to epochs 0, 87 and 108 according to eq. 3. We could not find a mean-motion resonance that fits to all three times. But if the dip on 2007 March 13 (epoch 87) is only a systematic effect, but is real in the other two light curves as shown is section 7.2, an outer planet in mean-motion resonance could again be possible. For example, the 4:1 and 9:1 resonances are consistent with all other light curves. A similar situation arises if a faster inner planet shows a strong grazing transit. If the planets are in mean-motion resonance, the inner planet has to complete several orbits while TrES-2 orbits its star once. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Freistetter et al. (2009)</ref> show that in the region between the star and TrES-2 up to 0.03 AU an additional planet can exist. They performed a detailed study of the stability inside the mean-motion resonances. All resonances from 0.011 AU (6:1) to 0.026 AU (5:3) are stable, all resonances close to the planet, from 0.028 AU (3:2) to 0.032 AU (5:4), are unstable. To check whether such a resonance can be found in our data, we tried to observe a complete orbital period in order to detect further dips for example in the half, one third or two thirds of the phase. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 11</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 11</ref> More than 3000 individual observations shownphase-folded according to the ephemeris given in eq. 3. The arrow marks a possible second dip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.3">Background star</head><p>As another explanation for the dip, we assume a background giant with a very low projected separation to the TrES-2 parent star. Both stars cannot be separated visually. The orbit of TrES-2 slips over the background star so that TrES-2 eclipses the background star after the actual transit is finished. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 12 illustrates</ref> this situation. However, because of the proper motion, the TrES-2 parent star has moved 3.27 mas in the time between epochs 0 to 108. If the background star hypothesis is correct, the dip would have disappeared after a short amount of time. One can of course assume a non-stationary background star with corresponding proper motion to explain the dip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.4">Companion</head><p>One of the most likely explanations for the dip at the moment is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref>. Like in section 7.3.3 we assume that TrES-2 transits another star along its orbit. However, it is no longer a background star, but a wide companion of the TrES-2 parent star. This companion can be very small (short transit) or the transit can be grazing. The small movement of the dips of 13 µas in 266 d can be explained with little orbital motion of the companion. The absence of the dip in some light curves is explainable, too. Because of gravitational influence of the companion the planet's orbit precesses. Hence, sometimes TrES-2 transits the companion and sometimes not. The non-detection of the dip in any light curve after May 2007 could mean that the companion has moved so far on its orbit that TrES-2 can no longer transit it. First hint for the validity of this hypotheses gave <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref>. Using high-resolution ,,Lucky Imaging" with AstraLux at the 2.2 m Calar Alto telescope they found a companion candidate (physical association needs to be confirmed by second epoch observations) close to the TrES-2 host star. They gave a projected separation between the TrES-2 host star and the companion candidate of (1.089 ± 0.008) ′′ . Our values for the projected separation of the dip relative to the center of the transit (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>) is five orders of magnitude lower than the projected separation of the companion candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> found. Thus, this companion candidate can not be the origin of the second dip in our light curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>With the Cassegrain-Teleskop-CCD-Kamera of the University Observatory Jena we observed several transit events and almost a complete orbital period of the known exoplanet TrES-2. We determined the orbital period to be slightly smaller (∼ 0.6 s) than previously expected. The mean photometric precision of the V = 11.4 mag star is 0.007 mag and the precision in the determination of the transit times is ≈ 0.0017 d. This allows us to register transit time variations of around 150 s. We did not find any indication of timing anomalies caused by additional planets or moons.</p><p>From our observations in one photometric night we were able to derive absolute photometric Bessell V , R and I magnitudes. Our estimates are in good agreement with previous published values (O' <ref type="bibr">Donavan et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Droege et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>In our first observations of a transit of TrES-2 we could detect a second dip after the end of the transit. We tried to explain its existence. Four different theories have been created: a nearby variable star or a blended eclipsing binary, an additional planet in the system, a transit over a background star or a transit over a wide companion of the TrES-2 host star after the actual transit is finished. Up to now none of these theories could be rejected or confirmed as a definitive solution. Still there is also the possibility of a photometric false alarm. We will continue observing TrES-2 to confirm the existence of the dip and search for transit time variations for the next few years to decades. We are also working on methods to improve the precision of our transit times.</p><p>The transit observations at the University Observatory Jena provide anchors for future searches for transit time variations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Two different transits of TrES-2 before and after using Sys-Rem. a.)
