			<abstract>
				<p>Context. HgMn Chemically Peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of the main-sequence. However, according to theoretical predictions, these stars could have pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peak elements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. Such pulsations have never been detected from ground based observations. Aims. Our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in HgMn stars using the high quality lightcurves provided by the CoRoT satellite. Methods. We identified three faint stars (V &gt; 12), from VLT-GIRAFFE multiobject spectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by CoRoT. They present the typical characteristics of HgMn stars. They were observed by the CoRoT satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th of October 2007, with the exoplanets CCD&apos;s (Additional Programme). In the present work, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three stars and the analysis of the corresponding CoRoT lightcurves. Results. Two of these three HgMn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag) periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which are compatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>HgMn stars are known to form a group among the Chemically Peculiar stars of the main-sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Preston, 1974)</ref>. Their photosphere is characterized by strong abundance anomalies of many metals (see for instance <ref type="bibr">Castelli&amp;Hubrig 2004)</ref>. Overabundances with respect to solar ones can be about two orders of magnitude and even larger. For instance, Mn can be enhanced by more a factor of 200, and Hg by a factor up to 10 6 . These stars are found in the range of effective temperature between about 10000K and 16000K (Pop I, B7-A0 IV-V), they are slow rotators, often binaries, and no magnetic fields has been yet detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shorlin et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Wade et al. 2006</ref>). These stars, which are supposed to have no convective motions in their atmosphere, which do not show any indication of activity, are possibly among the quietest stars of the main sequence.</p><p>The trends of abundance peculiarities observed in HgMn stars are usually well understood in the framework of the atomic diffusion (first proposed by <ref type="bibr">Michaud, 1970)</ref>. As stated by the classical model, diffusion process builds up abundance stratifications in the stable atmosphere (and envelope) of HgMn stars, according to the balance between radiative accelerations and gravSend offprint requests to: G. Alecian ⋆ The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain. ity. Theoretical predictions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alecian &amp; Michaud, (1981)</ref> for Mn were in excellent agreement with observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Smith &amp; Dworetsky, 1993)</ref>. However, modelling is not yet able to deal with the large variety of peculiarities observed in these stars. On another hand, detailed studies of stratification build up remain to be done, because of the heaviness of numerical computations for optically thin media (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alecian &amp; Stift, 2007)</ref>. Modelling of atomic diffusion in stellar interior (optically thick case) is more advanced ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Richard et al. 2001)</ref>. Even if these studies of stellar interiors cannot address the problem of atmospheric peculiarities, they allow to precise the evolution of these stars. A recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turcotte &amp; Richard (2003)</ref> predicts that, due to iron accumulation in the upper layers of their envelopes, these stars should at least be slow pulsators (as the Slow Pulsating B stars). Presently, there is no observational evidence of pulsation in HgMn stars, and CoRoT satellite offers an exceptional opportunity to constrain the models.</p><p>A detailed description of the CoRoT mission can be found in the CoRoT book <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baglin, 2006</ref>). Beside the two CCD's devoted to asteroseismology 1 , the exoplanet CCDs photometrically monitor thousands of stars in the magnitude range 10.5 ≤ m R ≤ 16 . This monitoring is designed to detect planet transits but it has also a high interest for studies of stellar photometric variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>Please give a shorter version with: \authorrunning and/or \titilerunning prior to \maketitle Stellar science outside the CoRoT core programme have been then allowed to access the data of exoplanet channel through the Additional Programme procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Weiss, 2006</ref>).</p><p>In Sect. 2 we present our strategy to find, through ground based observations (discussed in Sect. 3), faint HgMn stars in fields observed by CoRoT. In Sect. 4, we present the analysis of the CoRoT data for the targets we identified as HgMn candidates. Finally, we describe theoretical models for HgMn stars, followed by a discussion in view of our observational results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observational strategy</head><p>According to our knowledge of the solar neighborhood, one can estimate that about 8% of main-sequence AV-BV stars are HgMn stars. Therefore, applying this rate to the density of mainsequence AV-BV stars predicted by the "Besançon" model of stellar population synthesis of the Galaxy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Robin et al. 2003)</ref>, in the anticenter direction, only about 0.3% of Pop I stars of any type may be HgMn. Then, one can expect to have about 35 HgMn stars in a field containing 11400 stars, which is approximately the number of stars monitored by exoplanet CCD's. The problem is that there is not any available catalog of such faint HgMn stars, since the MK classification with the dispersion sufficient to recognize the HgMn signature was carried out only for relatively bright stars.</p><p>We have then decided to realize prior to the launch of CoRoT 2 , a survey in fields pre-selected for exoplanets search in the direction of the galactic anticenter, and using VLT-FLAMES/GIRAFFE (ESO) multiobject spectrograph.</p><p>The VLT-GIRAFFE 25' field towards the anticenter direction contains about 490 IV-V stars 11.5 ≤ m V ≤ 16, according to the "Besançon" model. The instrument can provide spectra of 110-120 objects in each field, with good enough resolution and S/N to identify abundance peculiarities (see next section). If stars were selected at random, the probability to find HgMn stars were extremely weak. To overcome this difficulty, we used a preliminary version of the Exo-Dat catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deleuil et al. 2008)</ref>, where the stellar types in our fields were roughly determined in view of the CoRoT mission, through multicolor broad band photometric observations by CoRoT-Exoplanet team. The Exo-Dat catalog consists in 10.6 millions of stars over an area of 220 deg 2 , observed with the Wide Field Camera (WFC) at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at Roque Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Canary Islands. Harris B and V filters and r' and i' ones from the Sloan-Gunn system, were used (the limiting magnitude is about r' = 20.0). The spectral type, luminosity class and the mean reddening were obtained by fitting models atmosphere to the observed fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deleuil et al. 2008</ref> and M. Deleuil private communication). All stars classified as B0-A0 (IV-V), with low contamination 3 , were systematically included in our programme, ensuring about 2 HgMn stars per set of targets. This programme was part of a larger one involving other teams concerned by this survey 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Ground data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">VLT-FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations</head><p>Observations were done during the period 74A (0.5 night, <ref type="bibr">30-31 January 2005)</ref>, in the framework of the Paris Observatory GTO. In the present work, we use the data obtained in MEDUSA mode with setup LR02 (396.4-456.7nm, R=6400). Observational conditions were rather good with an average seeing of 0.6"-0.9". Two exposures of 30 minutes were done for each field and an average S/N of about 70 was reached for brightest targets. The spectra we use in this work were obtained after data reduction performed with the dedicated software GIRBLDRS developed at the Geneva Observatory <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Several tasks of the IRAF package for extraction, calibration, and sky correction of the spectra were also used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Looking for HgMn stars</head><p>About 240 stars were observed in this run, and about 60 of them were classified in Exo-Dat as B0-A0 (IV-V) stars. To find HgMn candidates among these 60 stars, we searched for the characteristic pattern formed by two MnII lines (420.53nm and 460.637nm). This pattern is clearly visible in the spectra of HD175640 (a high S/N UVES spectrum of this star was kindly communicated by S. Hubrig, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Castelli &amp; Hubrig 2004</ref>), and remains well recognizable after degrading the S/N to 100. After a close examination of the spectra of these 60 stars, one star (S1) was found to show the MnII lines pattern very similarly to HD175640 (degraded spectrum), and two other stars (S2 and S3) were found with the same pattern, but less clearly. The characteristics of these three stars are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>: their number in USNO-A2 catalog, the visual magnitude from Exo-Dat, and the fundamental parameters discussed in Section 3.3. A rough estimate of various lines strength for usual abundances in HgMn stars was done using the COSSAM code <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Stift, 2000</ref>), and we checked the consistency of our selection of HgMn candidates by considering the spectra at other wavelengths. These three stars were then proposed to be included in the target allocated to the APs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Weiss, 2006</ref>).</p><p>The detailed abundance analysis of these three stars, in the next subsections, have confirmed their identification as good HgMn candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Fundamental parameters</head><p>The effective temperatures (T eff ) and surface gravities (log g) of the stars were derived by adjusting a grid of theoretical Balmer lines to the observed one. With a lack in photometric data, fundamental parameters can only be determined spectroscopically. By varying simultaneously T eff and log g, we select the profile that fits best Balmer lines. LTE model atmospheres were calculated using Kurucz's ATLAS12 code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kurucz, 2005)</ref>, assuming a plane parallel geometry, a gas in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium and a depth-independent microturbulence. Abundances can be adjusted individually in ATLAS12 which uses the Opacity Sampling technique for line opacity. The increment in T eff and log g were 500 K and 0.5 dex respectively. We have used SYNSPEC code <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hubeny &amp; Lanz 1992)</ref> to compute the synthetic Balmer profiles in the wavelength range of GIRAFFE spectra (λ3950-4550 Å). H γ and H δ were generated using the line broadening functions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vidal et al. (1973)</ref>. The Observed spectrum S1 13000-3.5 13000-4.0 13000-4.5 13500-3.5 13500-4.0 13500-4.5 14000-3.5 14000-4.0 14000-4.5 <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The effect of changing T eff by 500K and log g by 0.50 dex on the spectrum around H δ . The adopted temperature and gravity for S1 are 13500 K and 4.0 dex solar abundances used in SYNSPEC and ATLAS12 are those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grevesse &amp; Sauval (1998)</ref>. These Balmer lines are computed using a non solar ATLAS12 model. After that we select a model atmosphere, we determine the abundances of the elements and these abundances are included in the new computed model atmosphere for the same star and the final models have the abundances displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. For stars hotter than 8000 K, Balmer lines are more sensitive to gravity than to temperature. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>-a shows the effects of increasing and decreasing the effective temperature by about 500 K around 13500 K on the profile of H δ . This variation of ±500 K corresponds to the estimated error on the effective temperature. In the same manner, we have tested the effects of changing the surface gravity by about ±0.50 dex which is the estimation of the error bar on log g . These tests were done for the three stars and for both H γ and H δ profiles. For stars earlier than mid-A type, hydrogen lines are relatively free from metal lines and thus an appropriate normalization to the continuum can be done. The adopted fundamental parameters are those of the model that best fit the overall shapes of Balmer lines. The adopted effective temperatures, surface gravities and rotational velocities are collected in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for S1, S2 and S3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Abundance analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Input data</head><p>Once the fundamental parameters were fixed, the same ATLAS12 model atmospheres were used as an input in the synthetic spectra calculations. We have compiled a line list in the optical domain with the most accurate atomic parameters. For MgII, SiII, TiII, CrII, FeII, SrII and YII, we have selected lines <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2</ref>) from the atomic transitions list of <ref type="bibr">Gebran et al.'s (2008)</ref> online table after we have checked that these lines are good enough for abundances determination in case of late B-type stars (ie. no blending and not so weak). These authors have used Kurucz's gfall.dat <ref type="bibr">6</ref> as an initial line list, and they have modified the atomic parameters of the investigated chemical elements (wavelengths, excitation potential, oscillator strength and damping constants) by checking for more recent laboratory determinations (as in NIST and VALD databases). For HeI, CII, PII, MnII and HgII, we have used Kurucz's data list. The helium abundances were derived using two lines of HeI at λ4143.8 and λ4471.5 using the broadening table of <ref type="bibr">Barnar et al. (1969)</ref>. We have also included data for hyperfine splitting for the selected transitions when relevant, in particular for MnII. The spectral resolution of the spectra and the effect of rotational broadening prevent us from detecting the signature of hyperfine splitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Please give a shorter version with: \authorrunning and/or \titilerunning prior to \maketitle Mercury abundance was derived using the line of HgII at 398.39 nm with the oscillator strength from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sansonetti &amp; Reader (2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">The method</head><p>Our main interest in the abundance determination is to detect HgMn features because we cannot derive accurate chemical abundances using low resolution spectroscopy and low signalto-noise spectra. We have derived individual chemical abundance of He, C, Mg, Si, P, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Sr and Y by iteratively adjusting synthetic spectra to the observed normalized spectra. The synthetic spectra were computed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Takeda's (1995)</ref> code. Takeda's procedure minimizes iteratively the chisquare statistic between the synthetic spectrum and the observed one (See Takeda's paper for a full description of the method). Apparent rotational velocity (v e sin i) and microturbulent velocity (ξ t ) were derived using the strong MgII triplet at 4480 Å and a set of neighboring unblended weak and moderately strong FeII lines between 4490 and 4530 Å as described in sec 3.2.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gebran et al. 2008</ref>. Allowing small variations around solar abundances of Mg and Fe, we iteratively fitted these lines leaving v e sin iand ξ t as free parameters. The weak Fe II lines are sensitive to rotational velocity and not microturbulent velocity, the moderately strong FeII lines are sensitive to the microturbulent velocity changes. The MgII lines are sensitive to both v e sin iand ξ t . Each of the Mg and Fe lines yielded a set of values for log ǫ, v e sin iand ξ t , which were in good agreement.</p><p>Once v e sin i and ξ t are fixed, abundances have been derived for each line of each chemical element in our sample stars. With a resolving power of about 6500, errors on rotational velocities are more or less of the order of ∼15%. Microturbulent velocities were found to be very small, which is common in HgMn stars (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smith &amp; Dworetsky 1993)</ref>, thus we decided to fix them to zero for S1, S2 and S3. The found apparent rotational velocities (v e sin i) are displayed in column 7 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The derived chemical abundances relative to the sun 7 for each lines used for this analysis are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The final abundances for each star, and their respective errors are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. The abundance [X/H] does not include the rescaling of the H abundance in order to account for the He deficiency. We have assumed that the abundances derived from several lines for a chemical element, follow a Gaussian distribution. The errors on the element abundances are thus standard deviations. If the abundance is derived from only one line, we assign to it an error of 0.20 dex. We have also tested the effect of changing the atmospheric parameters on the derived abundance. Changing the effective temperature by an amount of ± 500 K affect the mean derived abundances by an amount of ∼0.1-0.3 dex depending on the element and of course the HgMn trends are not affected. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> displays an example of the iterative fitting of the MnII line at ∼4519 Å for S1. The synthetic spectrum with solar abundances is in dotted line and the manganese enhanced spectrum is in dashed line. In case of S1, manganese is about 300 times higher than solar. We have displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.3</ref> the overall fit of the three star between 4000 and 4400 Å. In this region, we have the two Balmer lines (H γ and H δ ) and a large number of MnII lines. In <ref type="figure">Fig.4</ref>, we show some examples of line fitting for S1, S2 and S3 and for several chemical elements as He, Hg, Fe and Mg. Due to the low signal-to-noise, some of the weak lines couldn't be analyzed as the titanium in S1 or nickel in S2 and   is based on low resolution and low signal-to-noise spectra, but the important result is that the HgMn pattern is clearly displayed in all three stars.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">7 ([ X H ] = log( X H ) ⋆ − log( X H ) ⊙ )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CoRoT Observations</head><p>Stars S1, S2 and S3 were observed by CoRoT during the first long run towards the galactic anticenter (LRa01  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">&amp; Breger, 2005</ref>) for the analysis of frequencies.</p><p>In this section, for the sake of conciseness, we will present in details the treatment of data for the star S1 only. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data preparation</head><p>A detailed presentation of the CoRoT data is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Auvergne et al. 2009</ref>. For each of our three stars, CoRoT provided chromatic lightcurves, in the oversampled mode (32 sec.) <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . These <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Chromatic and oversampled data are available only for a limited number of targets of the exoplanet channel. chromatic lightcurves are not provided to give color informations on targets, because the separation between the colors (which is realised by the ground based data processing) is arbitrary. The color separation was implemented to help in transit detection of exoplanets, but does not give workable information on star's properties, at least at the present stage of data treatment. The colored fluxes are strongly sensitive to depointing fluctuations and consequently the jitter corrections on colors are not very efficient. The white light flux is less sensitive to jitter because on the aperture edges the PSF slope is small. So it is recommended to work first for detection on white lightcurves.</p><p>The original set of N2 lightcurves (red, green, and blue) for S1 consists in 338729 points of measurement (electrons vs. CoRoT-Julian days), corrected for main instrumental effects. We have first selected the points flagged as "valid" (status = 0) by the N2 pipe-line. Other points are generally affected by the socalled SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly) and/or other instrumental effects. However, some abnormal points survive this selection and need to be suppressed manually. At the end of this selection, one has 300029 points of measurement (over 131 days). Most of them (98%) are spaced by 32 sec, but this whole selection process introduces some gaps, often smaller than about 1100 sec due to SAA. The SAA is crossed by the satellite 8 time per day, and lasts about 10 mn. There are also gaps due to various interruptions (normal and abnormal) of data acquisition. The largest gap is 13.7 hours from JD=2861.23 due to missing data. The next step consisted in correcting the monotonic longterm variation of each curve by a parabolic fitting. This variation is partly due to a pointing shift, and partly due to instrumental drift. After this correction we ended with three lightcurves summarized by the following values (average level, standard deviation): Red (391.373 kE, σ = 1.293 kE), Green (107.826 kE, σ = 0.435 kE), Blue (242.617 kE, σ = 1.056 kE). Finally, for analysis of frequencies (Sect. 4.2), we have built the white lightcurve by simply summing the three chromatic lightcurves, and we achieved a binning of 512 sec to reduce the noise (hereafter, all the presented plots and results are based on data with a binning of 512 sec). A similar treatment was done for stars S2 and S3.</p></div>

The solid line is the fit obtained with Period04, using the frequencies listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. This list of frequencies corresponds to frequencies with the highest amplitudes, from which the well-known CoRoT-  orbital ones and its harmonics were removed. The full spectrum is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.7</ref>. The CoRoT orbital frequency at 13.97 c/d (161.7µHz) and its harmonics are clearly visible. The low frequencies around 0.01 c/d are related to the long-term variation noticeable in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.6</ref>. We cannot interpret safely these longterm variations which have periods comparable to the run duration. They do not correspond to known instrumental effect. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> presents the detailed spectrum around 0.23 c/d. The feature around the peaks are due to the spectral window. In our opinion, the period P ≈ 4.3 days, with two harmonics (P/2, P/3) is an intrinsic variation of star S1 and its amplitude (∆m/m) can be estimated to be about 1.6 mmag. There is not any known CoRoTperiods around P, P/2 and P/3. It is easily visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.6</ref> (the "high" frequency variation).</p></div>

Again, the CoRoT orbital frequency (and harmonics) dominates at 13.97 c/d (and above). The only other significant peak is for 0.337 ± 0.01 c/d, very close to a period of 3 days, which may be related to the 1 day period often present in CoRoT data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Theoretical models for HgMn stars</head><p>The models for this paper are calculated with atomic diffusion that is known from first principles. In radiative zones this implies taking into account atomic diffusion including gravitational settling, thermal diffusion and radiative accelerations, in addition to the purely diffusive term. The interactions between different diffusing species are also taken into account. Convection and semiconvection are modeled as diffusion processes as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Richer et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Richard et al. (2001)</ref>. The detailed treatment of atomic diffusion is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Turcotte et al. (1998)</ref>. In these models the Rosseland opacity and radiative accelerations are computed at each time step in each layer for the exact local chemical composition using monochromatic opacities of the OPAL group <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iglesias &amp; Rogers (1996)</ref>. The radiative acceleration for each element is from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Richer et al. (1998)</ref> with correction for redistribution of momentum to electrons and others ions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gonzalez et al. (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">LeBlanc et al. (2000)</ref>. All models have an initially homogeneous solar composition.</p><p>For this preliminary study we include mixing in all the models in an ad-hoc parametric way as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Richer et al. (2000)</ref> where the parameters specifying effective transport coefficients are defined. All our models were computed with a effective transport coefficient, D T , 50 times larger than the He atomic diffusion coefficient at log T = 5.3 and varying as ρ −3 deeper in the star (for temperature below log T = 5.3 we assume a complete mixing). The choice of the layer with log T = 5.3 as lower boundary of the mixed zone is justified by the fact that the iron accumulation (due to diffusion process) around that layers, leads to the appearance of a convection zone. The existence of HgMn phenomenon shows that full mixing cannot extend deeper, otherwise superficial abundance anomalies would not appear. According to the diffusion model, this lack of deeper mixing may be due to the slow rotation of HgMn stars. To better model HgMn stars one would like to compute atomic diffusion in higher layers (with lower temperature, including the atmosphere). But the monochromatic opacities available to us are not sufficiently accurate to compute reliable radiative accelerations at low temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">LeBlanc et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Richer et al., 1998</ref>) and also, moving the boundary of the fully mixed zone to lower temperature leads to numerical difficulties in the present version of our code. Therefore, in our models, mixing impedes atomic diffusion in layers with log T &lt; 5.3. Notice that we have not adjusted the mixing depth to fit the surface abundances of our observed stars, because these anomalies are expected to be due to atomic diffusion in the atmosphere. For layers deeper in the star, where log T ≥ 5.3, the effective transport coefficient is adjusted to rapidly decrease the efficiency of the mixing so in these layers the effect of atomic diffusion leads to chemical stratification and to an accumulation of iron which affect the opacities and the pulsational properties of the models.</p><p>We have computed models of 3.0M ⊙ and 4.0M ⊙ which are in the mass range of S1 and S3 stars (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 13</ref> these models have a important bump in the opacity profile around log T = 5.3, at this temperature radiative accelerations lead to an iron overabundance. In this region, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 14</ref>, oscillation could be driven by κ-mechanism as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d dr (κ T + κ ρ Γ 3 −1 ) &gt; 0, where κ T = (∂ ln κ/∂ ln T ) ρ and κ ρ = (∂ ln κ/∂ ln ρ) T .</formula><p>The seismic properties of the models were studied with the help of the nadrot code <ref type="bibr">(Dziembowski, 1977)</ref>. Both the 3.0M ⊙ and the 4.0M ⊙ models show positive growth rates for non radial gravity modes, and all p-modes are stable. In the 4.0M ⊙ model, the periods can be as short as 16 hours and as long as 2 days for young models, whereas no mode under 33 hours is overstable   at the end of the main-sequence. The upper limit for the period, when the 4.0M ⊙ leave the main-sequence, is hard to define as the number of modes identified by the pulsation code is limited, but we find modes with period as long as 4.4 days to be overstable while modes with period above 6.5 days are stable. The 3.0M ⊙ model have a similar range in periods for young models but show a smaller shift to longer periods during evolution with no overstable modes with period longer than 2.5 days until all modes become stable around 250 Myr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The variations we find for stars S1 and S3 can be reasonably considered as intrinsic to these stars.</p><p>The VLT/GIRAFFE spectra used in this work are medium resolution spectra, then the v.sini <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> we obtained are not very accurate and can be rather considered as upper limits of the values one could expect to determine from higher resolution spectra. Since v.sini fixes a lower limit of equatorial velocity, it gives an indication about the upper limit of rotational period. The upper limits of rotational period which can be inferred from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, appear to be in the same ranges as the periods we find for S1 and S3. Therefore, one cannot exclude at this stage that the variations found in our lightcurves are due to rotational modulations (see for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lanza et al. 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Rotational modulation hypothesis</head><p>According to the discussion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clarke (2003)</ref>, surface inhomogeneities like spots or patches can produce photometric variations, but only the fundamental and the second harmonic could be present and not the third harmonic as we observe in S1. However, it is difficult to assert that high degree harmonics cannot be found in Fourier analysis in case of complex superficial structures. Magnetic Ap stars are known to have large scale and organized strong magnetic fields, with abundance patches of many metals. These anomalies are qualitatively well understood in the framework of atomic diffusion but the detailed quantitative modelling of that process is difficult, and sometimes strongly suggests that diffusion has to work with other processes like inhomogeneous winds <ref type="bibr">(Babel 1992)</ref>. One notes also that a complete discussion should also consider light-induced drift and ambipolar diffusion. Such superficial structures have been studied from several decades from line shape variations (for recent studies, see for instance observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kochukhov et al. 2004, and</ref><ref type="bibr">modelling by Alecian &amp; Stift 2007)</ref>, and one would not be surprised if such complex structures cause photometric variations (in addition to those due to the roAp phenomenon for cool magnetic Ap stars). If our stars were not HgMn, but magnetic Ap stars, one would consider attentively rotational modulations to explain lightcurve variations.</p><p>Considering that the 3 stars discussed in this work are likely to belong to the HgMn group, is the hypothesis of abundance patches or spots relevant in explaining the photometric variations we observe? Observational facts are that there is not yet any confirmed detection of magnetic fields ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shorlin et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Wade et al. 2006</ref>) nor any detection of photometric variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adelman et al. 2002</ref>) in HgMn stars from ground based observations. There are some possible cases of few hundred Gauss detections (Hubrig et al 2006a), but they need to be confirmed, and they are not typical for the HgMn group. Following these constraints, standard diffusion modelling of HgMn stars consists in estimating the diffusion velocities and the resulting vertical stratifications of elements (equilibrium approximation), assuming stable atmospheres without magnetic fields. This modelling produced encouraging results by explaining main trends of metal overabundances in these stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Smith &amp; Dworetsky, 1993)</ref>, but cannot yet reproduce the large variety of detailed observations of individual stars. An important reason of the difficulty in modelling individual stars is that diffusion is a slow 11 (and then fragile) time-dependent process which, at a given time, has built up abundance stratifications which are different from those computed assuming equilibrium (the finale stage of an ideal unperturbed time-dependent process).</p><p>Because, in the standard model, atomic diffusion is supposed to work alone, any perturbation, as it could exist in a real HgMn star, can modify the picture of the stratification build-up process. For instance, effects induced by binarity, slow matter circulation, weak turbulence or wind can exist in HgMn stars. If so, they could be undetectable but strong enough to affect the stratification process. Among possible theoretical scenarios, one can consider the existence of weak, unorganized magnetic fields (hardly detectable). In magnetic Ap stars, where magnetic fields strengths can be larger than several kG, the component of ion's diffusion velocities orthogonal to the field lines is significantly reduced above log τ ≈ 0 and vanishes as matter density decreases. This leads to the formation of non-uniform (horizontally) clouds of metals, anchored in the usual line-forming region (just above log τ ≈ 0). In HgMn stars, if weak fields exist, the effect on diffusion velocities will be the same as in magnetic stars, but much higher in the atmosphere (for instance, above log τ ≈ −4.0 for fields ≤ 1 kG, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alecian &amp; Stift 2006</ref>). This is due to the fact that the diffusion velocity of an ion in a magnetic field is slowed down by a factor which varies more or less as the square of the proton number density (see the detailed formulae in Sec. 4.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alecian &amp; Stift 2006</ref>). So, a weak magnetic field which will have no noticeable effect in usual line-forming region could, however, force elements to remain bound to the star. In that case, one could expect that there may be high altitude additional clouds for some elements, forming abundance patches (related to the magnetic field orientation, possibly unorganized) and superimposed to the uniform stratifications predicted by the standard diffusion models.</p><p>Recent works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adelman et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Kochukhov et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hubrig et al., 2006b</ref>) have detected in some HgMn stars variations in some sparse line profiles and interpreted them in terms of abundance spots. As discussed just before, these observations are not necessarily in contradiction with the diffusion model. Moreover, one can note that these variations of line profiles are essentially found for elements having low cosmic abundances (Hg, Y, Pt, Zr), which bring an additional support to the diffusion model. Indeed, according to what one knows about radiative accelerations, these kind of elements are generally strongly pushed up by the radiation field 12 and can more easily accumulate than abundant elements in the upper atmosphere (in addition to deeper stratifications), where a weak magnetic field becomes able to impede atomic diffusion to expel that element toward the circumstellar medium.</p><p>According to the published profile variations mentioned above (papers do not give any estimation of the photometric variations that can be induced by these profile variations), one can hardly consider that, even if our stars would have same kind of line profile variations, they could produce the 1.6 mmag photometric variations we observed in CoRoT lightcurves. Remember that the CoRoT lightcurves are integrated photon flux from about 400nm to 1000nm. To have regular photometric variations (as the ones we observed) from abundance spots, equivalent width of lines should have to vary more or less in phase. This is not ob-served and this is not consistent with abundance patches which will be distributed differently according to elements. It does not mean that line profile variations could not coexist with photometric variations. We just say that these two types of variations are related to two different mechanisms.</p><p>Our conclusion is that the variations observed recently in some sparse line profiles for some HgMn stars remain consistent with the diffusion model, but could hardly explain the photometric variations we observed in CoRoT lightcurves. Nevertheless, even if our feeling is that these variations are not rotational modulations, more precise measurements of v.sini are clearly needed to discriminate pulsations and rotational modulations, and check whether these stars are multiple or not. This is planned for the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Pulsation hypothesis</head><p>In the hypothesis of pulsations, we have a significant 4.3 days period in S1, and 2.53 days period for S3. They are compatible with periods of non-radial g-modes predicted by models presented in Sec.5. According to these models and the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turcotte &amp; Richard (2003)</ref>, these pulsations should be of the same type as those of SPB stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dziembowski et al. 1993</ref>). However, one cannot consider these stars as belonging to the SPB class, since stars of this latter class have more or less solar abundances. In average SPB stars are hotter than HgMn stars, and have higher gravity. But, the boundary at the cool edge and at the low gravity edge of SPB's <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Cat, 2007</ref>) overlaps respectively the hot/large ones of HgMn group. In the same way, the periods we find for S1 and S3 are little bit longer and with smaller amplitudes (less than or around 1.6 mmag) than what is generally found for SPB's, but here again these variations are compatible with those observed for some modes of SPB's. If pulsations were confirmed in the future in HgMn stars, differences could come from the lack of superficial convection zone which leads to strong metal stratifications in outer layers in HgMn stars(including the atmospheres). One can speculate that could cause stronger damping of those modes compared to SPB stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we first identified from multiobject spectroscopy with moderate resolution (using VLT-GIRAFFE spectrograph), 3 faint stars presenting the characteristic features of HgMn types, and eligible for observation with the exo-CCD's of the CoRoT satellite. The analysis of their lightcurves, obtained during the run LRa01 of CoRoT, shows periodic variations for at least two of theses stars. The periods of these variations are compatible with theoretical predictions. This could be the first detection of pulsations in HgMn stars. However, further ground based high resolution spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the HgMn nature of these stars and that these variations are pulsations and not rotational modulations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
