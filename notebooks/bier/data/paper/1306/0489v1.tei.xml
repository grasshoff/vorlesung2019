			<abstract>
				<p>We report twelve new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-4b from the Transit Monitoring in the South Project (TraMoS) project. These transits are combined with all previously published transit data for this planet to provide an improved radius measurement of R p = 1.395 ± 0.022 R jup and improved transit ephemerides. In a new homogeneous analysis in search for Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) we find no evidence of those with RMS amplitudes larger than 20 seconds over a 4-year time span. This lack of TTVs rules out the presence of additional planets in the system with masses larger than about 2.5 M ⊕ , 2.0 M ⊕ and 1.0 M ⊕ around the 1:2, 5:3 and 2:1 orbital resonances. Our search for the variation of other parameters, such as orbital inclination and transit depth also yields negative results over the total time span of the transit observations. Finally we perform a simple study of stellar spots configurations of the system and conclude that the star rotational period is about 34 days.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around the Sun-like star 51-Peg via radial velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>, a number of systematic extrasolar planet searches have spread adopting a wide variety of techniques, of which the radial velocity method is still the most prolific approach. The transit technique is currently the second most successful, with the detection of over 290 systems with confirmed planet detection 1 . Of these, most are Hot-Jupiters (Jupiter-mass objects with orbital periods of a few days). Just recently, space missions such as Kepler and Corot have started to expand transit discoveries to planets smaller than 50 M ⊕ .</p><p>Transiting planets provide a wealth of information about their systems. For instance, transits are currently the only tool to measure the planet-to-star radius ratio and orbital inclination. Com- <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The extrasolar planet encyclopaedia: http://www.exoplanet.eu bined with radial velocity results, those parameters allow the determination of the absolute mass of the planet and its mean density. Another type of study that can be conducted via transiting planets is the search of unseen companions in the system. Those companions introduce variations in the orbital period of the transiting planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miralda-Escudé 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holman &amp; Murray 2005)</ref>, which can be detected by monitoring the systems in search for Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). This TTV technique has the potential of finding planets in the Earth-mass regime and even exomoons <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kipping 2009</ref>).</p><p>In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Silva-Valio (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2011)</ref> have pointed out that observations of star-spot occultations during closely-spaced transits can be used to not only estimate the rotation period of the host star, but also to measure alignment differences between the rotation axis of the star and the orbital axis of the planet.</p><p>As part of the Transit Monitoring in the South (TraMoS) project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoyer et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. , 2012</ref>, we are conducting a photometric monitoring survey of transits observable from the Southern Hemisphere. The aim of this project is to perform a careful and homogeneous monitoring of exoplanet transits trying to minimize systematics and reduce uncertainties in the transit parameters, such as the transit mid-time, following the approach of using high-cadence observations and the same instruments and setups.</p><p>In the framework of the TraMoS project we present twelve new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-4b. This was the first exoplanet detected by the WASP-South survey in 2008. A that time, <ref type="bibr">Wilson et al. (2008, hereafter W08</ref>) reported a Hot-Jupiter (P = 1.34 days) with a mass of MP = 1.22 +0.09 −0.08 MJ and a planetary radius of Rp = 1.42 +0.07 −0.04 RJ orbiting a G7V southern star. This discovery paper included WASP photometry, two additional transit epochs (observed in <ref type="bibr">September 2007)</ref>, and radial velocities measurements. <ref type="bibr">Gillon et al. (2009, hereafter G09)</ref>, added to the follow-up of this exoplanet a VLT/FORS2 light curve observed in October 2007 with a z-GUNN filter. Using a reanalysis of the W08 data they found no evidence of period variability. <ref type="bibr">Winn et al. (2009, hereafter W09)</ref>, presented two new high-quality transits observed in 2008 with the Baade Telescope (one of the twin 6.5-m Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory) using a z-band filter. Four new transit epochs were reported shortly after by <ref type="bibr">Southworth et al. (2009, hereafter S09)</ref>, with the 1.54-m Danish Telescope at La Silla Observatory using a Cousins-R filter during 2008. <ref type="bibr">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2011, hereafter S011)</ref>, using four new transit light curves observed during 2009, interpreted two anomalies in the photometry as starspot occultations by the planet and concluded from that result that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the planet's orbital axis. This result agrees with the observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for this system by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Triaud et al. (2010)</ref>. Later, two new transits of WASP-4b were reported by <ref type="bibr">Dragomir et al. (2011, hereafter D11)</ref>, with data from the 1-m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (V-band and R-band filter). Most recently, <ref type="bibr">Nikolov et al. (2012, hereafter N12</ref>) observed three transits simultaneously in the Sloan g', r', i' and z' filters with the Gamma Ray burst Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the MPG/ESO-2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory.</p><p>In this work we present twelve new transits observations. We combined these new light curves with all the previously available light curves (twenty-six additional light curves) and reanalyzed them to provide a new homogeneous timing analysis of the transits of WASP-4b and to place stronger constraints to the mass of potential perturbers in the main orbital resonances with this planet. We also search the entire dataset for signs of stellar spots that would help improve the conclusions of S011.</p><p>In Section 2 and 3 we describe the new observations and the data reduction. Section 4 details the modelling of the light curves and in Section 5 we present the timing analysis and discuss the mass limits for unseen perturbers. In section 6 we discuss the occultations of stellar spots by the planet. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The instruments</head><p>As mentioned before, the TraMoS project has undertaken a photometric campaign to follow-up transiting planets observable from the Southern Hemisphere. Our goal is to use high cadence observations minimizing change of instruments to reduce systematics and therefore, based on an homogeneous analysis, obtain the most precise values of the light curve parameters, such as the central time of the transit, the orbital inclination and the planet radius, among others.</p><p>The observations we present in this work were performed with the Y4KCam on the SMARTS 1-m Telecope at Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory (CTIO) and with the SOAR Optical Imager (SOI) at the 4.2-m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope in Cerro Pachón. The epochs of four of the transits we present here coincide with previous published data (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We have taken advantage of the 20 × 20 squared arcminute of Field of View (FoV) of the Y4KCam, which is a 4064 × 4064 CCD camera with a pixel scale of 0.289 arcsec pixel −1 , which despite its large dimensions allows to use a readout time of only ∼ 16/5 sec when using the 2x2/4x4 binning mode (compared with the 46 sec of the unbinned readout time). The SOI detector is composed of two E2V mosaics of 4096 × 2048 pixels with a scale of 0.077 arcsec pixel −1 . The SOI has a FoV of 5.2 × 5.2 squared arcminutes and allows a readout time of only ∼ 11 sec after binning 2x2 (20.6 sec is its standard readout time).</p><p>As part of the TraMoS project we have observed a total of 12 transits of WASP-4b, between August 2008 and September 2011 2 . Three transits were observed with the SOI at the SOAR telescope and the remaining nine were observed with the Y4KCAM at the 1-m CTIO telescope. The first ten transits were observed using a Bessell I or Cousins I filter. For the 2011 transit observations we use the 4x4 binning mode of the Y4KCam and a Cousins R filter. The observing log is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>All the transits were fully covered by our observations except for some portions of the E = 754, 482 and −62 transits that were lost due to technical failures (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The before-transit and ingress portions of the E = −71 transit were not observed, but after phase = −0.034 (where phase = 0 is defined as the phase of the mid-transit) the observation of the transit was done without interruption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA REDUCTION</head><p>The trimming, bias and flatfield correction of all the collected data was performed using custom-made pipelines specifically developed for each instrument.</p><p>The Modified Julian Day (JD-2400000.5) value was recorded at the start of each exposure in the image headers. In the SMARTS telescope, the time stamp recorded in the header of each frame is generated by a IRIG-B GPS time synchronization protocol connected to the computers that control the instrument. The SOAR telescope data use the time values provided by a time service connected to the instrument. We confirmed that these times coincide with the time of the Universal Time (UT) reference clock within 1 second. The time stamp assigned to each frame corresponds to the Julian Day at the start of the exposure plus 1/2 of the integration time of each image.</p><p>For the photometry and light curve generation we used the  same procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. (2012)</ref>. That is, we performed a standard aperture photometry where the optimal skyaperture combination was chosen based on the RMS minimization of the differential light curves of the target and the reference stars. For this analysis we excluded the ingress and egress portions of the light curves, i.e. we used only the out-of transit and in-transit data. The final light curves were generated computing the ratio between the target flux and the average flux of the best 1 to 3 comparison stars.</p><p>In order to detrend the light curves, we searched for correlations of the out-of-transit flux (FOOT ) with the X-Y CCD coordinates of the target, airmass and/or time. Trends are identified as such when the correlation coefficient values are larger than the RMS of the out-of-transit points. To remove the trends, we applied linear or quadratic regressions fits, which were subtracted from the light curve only when we detect that RMS of the FOOT is improved. Otherwise no subtraction is applied. The RMS after detrending are 3 − 22% lower than on the raw light curves. A posteriori we have checked that doing this detrending previous to modelling our light curves does not introduce any bias or differences in the estimated parameters and its uncertainties. In the last two columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref> we show which detrending was applied and the value KRMS , which corresponds to the ratio of the FOOT RMS after and before removing the trends to illustrate the improvement in the RMS by the detrending. Therefore, the values of KRMS indicate how much the dispersion of the light curves changes after detrending. When no numerical values of KRMS is shown means that no significant systematic trend with any of the parameters searched was found. Also, to illustrate the amount of detrending applied for each light curve in left panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we show the detrended over the raw light curves and in the right-side of the same figure we also show the differences in flux (magnified by 100 times) between the light curves before and after detrending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">LIGHT CURVE MODELLING</head><p>In a first step we performed a modelling of the 12 new light curves we present in this work and the 26 available light curves of the WASP-4 system from other authors. The goal of this first analysis is to determine transit parameters single values from each light curve. With these values we search for variations in 4 years time span in parameters such as the central time of the transits, the orbital inclination and/or the transit's depth. Variations in these parameters can be indicative of the presence of a perturbing body in the system. In a second step, we take advantage of the information contained in all the light curves by fitting simultaneously the transit parameters. With this global analysis we determined the properties of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Individual Analysis: searching for parameter variations</head><p>We used the TAP package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gazak et al. 2011</ref>) to fit all the available light curves of WASP-4. This package allows to fit the analytical models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which have proved to give the most reliable results compared with other approaches, particularly in the case of uncertainty estimations of the fitted parameters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. 2012</ref>, section 3.1 and 3.2). This point is critical especially for the timing analysis of the transits. TAP also implements a wavelet-based method  to account for the red-noise in the light curve fitting. This method helps impose more conservative uncertainty estimates compared to other red noise calculations such as the 'time averaging' or 'residual permutation' methods, in cases where the noise has a power spectral density (PSD) that varies as 1/f γ (where f is the frequency and γ is a spectral index &gt; 0). For all other types of noise the  method gives uncertainty estimations as good as the other methods (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoyer et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. , 2012</ref>.</p><p>We fitted the twelve new transit light curves presented in this work and the other 26 available light curves from W08, G09, W09, S09, D11, SO11 and N12 3 . To perform the modelling we grouped all the light curves observed with the same filter in a given telescope (we treated all our light curves as observed with the same filter/telescope). As we described below, this allows us to fit for the linear limb-darkening coefficient (µ1) using all the light curves simultaneously as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. (2012)</ref>. Therefore, the first group is composed by our ten I-band light curves (from 2008 to 2010) and the second by our two Cousins-R light curves (the 2011's transits). A third group is formed by the six SO11 z-band light curves (which includes the two transits observed by W09) and the S09 light curves form the fourth group (Cousins-R). We fit the V-and R-light curves of D11 separately. Finally, we fit the twelve light curves of N12 in four groups (three light curves for each of the four filters).</p><p>We fit each group independently, leaving as free parameters for each light curve the orbital inclination (i), the planet-to-star radius ratio (Rp/Rs) and the central time of the transit (Tc). The orbital period, the eccentricity, and the longitude of the periastron were fixed to the values P = 1.33823326 days (from D11), e = 0 and ω = 0. We searched for possible linear trend residuals in the light curves by fitting for the out-of-transit flux (FOOT ) and for a flux slope (F slope ), but did not find any. The ratio between the semi-major axis and the star radius, a/Rs, usually presents strong correlations with i and Rp/Rs. To break those correlations and their effects in our results (and because we are searching for relative variations in i and Rp/Rs), we fixed a/Rs in all the light curves to 5.53 (from D11). We checked that doing this we are not introducing any bias/effect on the rest of the parameters fitted and its errors (for details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. 2012</ref>). In particular we are not affecting the mid-times of the transits due to its weak correlation with a/Rs. We also fit for a white and red noise parameter, σw and σr, respectively, as defined by .</p><p>The coefficients of a quadratic limb-darkening law (µ1 and µ2) in our light curves are strongly correlated, therefore we fixed µ2 to 0.32 (based in the tabulated values by Claret 2000) and let µ1 as free parameter on each group of light curves.</p><p>Therefore, for each light curve fit we obtained a value of i, Rp/Rs, σw, σr and Tc and a single value of µ1 for each group.</p><p>To fit the transits and derive errorbars for all parameters we ran 10 MCMC chains of 10 5 links each, discarding the first 10% of the results from each chain to minimize any bias introduced by the parameter initial values. The resulting values for each parameter of the thirty-eight light curves together with their 1σ errors are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> and 3. The data and the best models fits for all twelve light curves presented in this work are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The same is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for the twenty-six light curves from the literature.</p><p>Variations in transit parameters, in particular in i and Rp/Rs, can be attributed to the perturbations produced by an additional body in the system. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, we plot Rp/Rs and i as a function of the transit epoch, based in the results of the 38 transit fits. We do not find any significant variations in those parameters. As reference, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> the weighted average values and the ±1σ errors of i and Rp/Rs based on all the light curves results are represented by the solid and dashed horizontal lines, respectively. Our analysis of the transit timing is described in detail in section 5.</p><p>Is worthy to noticing that including the detrending parameters in the MCMC during the modelling is the most appropriate approach to estimate uncertainties of the transit parameters. We have checked that in our data there is no significant differences by doing the detrending before the MCMC fitting. The TAP version we use (v2.104) does not allow to detrend against airmass or X-Y position of the centroid or neither perform quadratic regression fits of the flux against the time, that is why we decided to check for correlations against these parameters before modelling with TAP. Also, most of the literature light curves we used to search for variations in transit parameters have been already detrended and therefore the uncertainties we estimate from them can be compared with those obtained from our data when we detrended it before the MCMC modelling. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Global Analysis</head><p>Since we find no evidence of significant variations in the parameters fitted for each individual light curve, we can model all light curves simultaneously to improve the determination of i, Rp/Rs and a/Rs. For this, we fitted simulaneausly these parameters in the 38 light curves, while letting to vary on each light curve the transit mid-times, F slope , FOOT , σW and σ red . We fixed P and the linear and quadratic limb-darkening coefficients for each filter to the values obtained in the previous section. We used 10 chains of 10 5 links each in the MCMC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">TIMING ANALYSIS AND LIMITS TO ADDITIONAL PLANETS</head><p>The times of our twelve transits and the D11 transits were initially computed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and then con- . If we removed the D11's transit with the largest uncertainties (E=196, which corresponds to an incomplete transit observation) and re-calculated the linear trend, the RMS of the residuals is only 20 seconds after updated the ephemerides (χ 2 red = 1.18, χ 2 = 41.3 for 35 degrees of freedom).</p><p>Once the linear trend is removed (using the linear regression with χ 2 red = 1.18) the updated ephemeris equation is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Tc = 2454823.591924(28)[BJ DT T ] + 1.33823204(16) × E, (1)</formula><p>where Tc is the central time of a transit in the epoch E since the reference time T0. The errors of the last digits are shown in parenthesis. Panel C in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> shows the resulting O − C values of all available transits using the updated ephemeris equation. Almost all the Tc coincide with it within the ±1 σ errors represented by the point-dashed lines. Despite there is still non negligible residuals in the timing of E = 751, 754 transits (panel C) those epochs do not deviate from the updated ephemeris equation by more than 2.5σ. These points have relative large uncertainties compare with other epochs and therefore have less weight in the calculated linear regression. We found no evidence of a quadratic function in the O−C values. We show in panels D and E a close-up of the O − C diagram around the -70 and 200 epochs, were the transit observations  are more clustered. All the Tc of the common transits analyzed in this work are in excellent agreement within the errors. This newly obtained precision permits to place strong constraints in the mass of an hypothetical companion, particularly in MMR's, as we discuss below.</p><p>We used the Mercury N-body simulator (Chambers 1999) to place upper limits to the mass of a potential perturber in the WASP-4 system, based on our timing analysis of the transits. A detailed description of the setup we used for running the dynamical simulations can be found in Hoyer et al. (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoyer et al. (2012)</ref>. As a summary, for the simulated perturber bodies we used circular (e = 0) and coplanar orbits with WASP-4b. We explored a wide range of perturber masses (0.1M ⊕ ≤ Mpert ≤ 5000M ⊕ ) and distances between 0.1 AU and 0.06 AU in steps of 0.001 AU . The semi-major axis steps were reduced to 0.0005 AU near MMRs with the respective transiting body. The density of the perturber body corresponds to the mean density of the Earth (for Mpert ≤ 1M ⊕ ) or Jupiter (for ≥ 300M ⊕ ). The density was obtained from a linear function that varies from Earth's to Jupiter's density for all the other Mpert.</p><p>We identified a region of unstable orbits where any orbital companion experimented close encounters with the transiting body in the time of the integrations we studied (10 years). For all the other stable orbits we recorded the central times of the transits, which were compared with predicted times assuming an average constant orbital period for each system. This period did not deviate by more than 3σ from the derived period of each transiting body. When the calculated TTV RMS approached to 60 seconds we reduced the mass sampling in order to obtain high precision values (≤ 1 M ⊕ ) in the mass of the perturber.</p><p>The results of our model simulations are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref>, where we show the perturber mass, Mpert (M ⊕ ), versus orbital semi-major axis, a (AU ), diagram that places the mass limits to potential perturbers in the system. The solid line in the diagram indicates the derived upper limits to the mass of the perturbers that would produce TTV RMS of 20 seconds at different orbital separation. The dashed line shows the perturber mass upper limits imposed by the most recent RV observations of the WASP-4 system, for which we have adopted a precision of 15 m s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Triaud et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>In the same <ref type="figure">figure,</ref> we also show the result of calculating the MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits) factor Y ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cincotta &amp; Simó 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cincotta et al. 2003</ref>) which measures the degree of chaotic dynamics of the potential perturber. This technique found widespread application within dynamical astronomy in studies of stability and orbital evolution, in particular in extrasolar planetary systems and Solar system bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hinse et al. 2010</ref>). Here we use MEGNO to identity phase space regions of orbital instability in the WASP-4 system. We calculated Y on a grid considering 450x400 initial conditions with the perturber initially placed on a e = 0 orbit in all integrations. The tran- siting planet is located at a = 0.02312 AU from the host star. Each test orbit was integrated for 10 6 days. For quasi-periodic orbits Y → 2.0 for t → ∞ and for chaotic orbits Y = 2 (represented by the gray region in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. In theses cases Y usually diverges quickly away from 2.0 in the beginning of the orbit integration. The region close to the transiting planets is highly chaotic due to strong gravitational interactions resulting in collisions and/or escape scenarios and coincides with the unstable region we have identified with Mercury code. We identify the locations of MMRs by the chaotic time evolution at certain distances from the host star. These coincide with the TTV sensitivity for smaller masses of the perturber.</p><p>For WASP-4b, we found that the upper limits in the mass of an unseen orbital companion are 2.5, 2.0 and 1.0 M ⊕ in the 1:2, 5:3 and 2:1 MMRs respectively (vertical lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). These limits are more strict than the radial velocities constraints, specially in the MMRs, although by using our approach we can not reproduce the mass limits derived by N12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">STARSPOT OCCULTATIONS</head><p>As SO11 previously noted, in some of the light curves during the transit there are bump-like features or anomalies that can be interpreted as star-spot occultations by the exoplanet while it crosses in Upper mass limits as function of the orbital semi-major axis of an hypothetical perturber of the exoplanet WASP-4b, based on dynamical simulations done with the Mercury N-body simulator ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chambers et al. 1999</ref>).</p><p>The solid line corresponds to perturber masses which produce TTVs RMS of ∼ 20 as we measure in our timing analysis (see section 5). The pointdashed line shows the limits imposed by the radial velocity measurements. Vertical lines mark the locations of MMRs with WASP-4b and the gray region indicates MEGNO factor Y = 2, i.e. the region of chaotic orbits in the system. We confirm the detection of the occultation with our -91 epoch's data but in our -68 transit we found no evidence of occultation due the low SNR of the data.</p><p>front the star's disk. SO11 detected evidence of these occultations in two of the light curves they presented and in the two light curves of S09. Depending on the SNR and the sampling of the data, we also identified these bumps in four of our light curves (during three different epochs).</p><p>Using the residuals of the detrended light curves after modelling the transits (see section 4), we fit a gaussian function around each bump feature, initially identified by eye and which we assume are caused by spots. In particular we fit for the amplitude (Aocc), central time of the spot occultation (Tocc) and the width (σ) of the Gaussian which can be used to described the duration of the occultation event. To estimate the uncertainties of these values, before fitting we added to the observational points an amount of random noise proportional to the RMS of the residuals (without bumps). We repeated this procedure 10 000 times for each light curve and calculated the errors from the width of the resulting distributions. In <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Results of the fitting of the star-spots occultations. For each light curve, the amplitude (Aocc), the central time of the occultation (Tocc) relative to midtime of the transit (Tc) and the width of the fitted Gaussian function (σ) are shown. The errors were obtained from Monte-Carlo   shows no sign of spots and we cannot confirm the spot in that epoch in the S09 light curve. This can be attributed to the worse SNR of our light curve, but notice also that the amplitude of the spot occultation that we obtain in the S09 data is Aocc = 0.0021 ± 0.0020. Therefore that detection could render spurious. Among our new data we also detect two new spots during transit epochs 163 and 204.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Epoch RMS Aocc (ppm) Tc − Tocc (days) σ<label>(</label></formula><p>In <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> we show the results of the gaussian fits. Taking into account the values obtained for Aocc and the RMS values of the residuals, no starspot occultations were detected in the light curves of the epochs: -88, -71, 166 and 169. These non-detections (especially the transits closer to those with positive detections) can be used to constrain the spot's location and/or lifetime. For example, it can be argued that during those transits the spot is located in the non-visible hemisphere of the star, or that the spot have migrated to different latitudes that those occulted by the exoplanet's path.</p><p>SO11 found two possible values for the rotation period of the star, 22.2 days (based on the spots of their new light curves), and 25.5 days, based on the S09 light curves. Both results are consistent with the constraint of the radial velocities measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Triaud et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>We used a simple linear model to estimate the rotational period of WASP-4 relying only in the timing of the occultations. We assumed an aligned system (an assumption consistent with the RM effect observations and with the SO11's previous analysis of the spots) since this geometry increases the probability of detecting occultations of the same spots by the exoplanet. We assigned angular coordinates for the location of the spots, such that at ingress (first contact) and at egress (fourth contact) of the transit a spot will have a relative angle of 0 • and 180 • , respectively. Relative angles in the non-visible hemisphere will extent between 180 • and 360 • . For the epochs where no spot occultations were detected we assigned an aleatory angle for the location of the spot between 180 and 360 degrees and assumed larger errors in its timing (∼ 0.05 days) to compensate for the non-detection during transit. Later, as explained below, we checked if the rotational period we obtained is consistent with the corresponding nondetections.</p><p>Then, we fit the following linear function for the displacement of the spots:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δΘ = Θ0 + Ω · (T − T0),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Θ0 is the relative angle of the spot in an arbitrary reference time T0, and Ω is the displacement rate of the spots due to stellar rotation (assuming no migration), in degrees per days. To test our model we fit the same spot pairs analyzed by SO11 (E=172,207), using our newly computed Tocc and obtain a stellar rotation period Prot = 22.7 ± 0.2 days, consistent with the 22.2 days period derived by SO11 but inconsistent with the non-detections of E=166,169. Our new occultation central times for the S09 spots (E=-91,-68) give a Prot of 27.5 ± 0.5 days, slightly longer than the 25.5 days period obtained by SO11 but consistent with the nodetections in E=-62,-56. We conclude that, to first order approximation, our linear model provides a good estimate of the star's rotational period, given the available data.</p><p>Next we tried to improve the Prot of the star by adding, first, the new 204 transit epoch to the 172 and 207 epochs (we assumed the spot was the same in the 47 days covered by those epochs). The first minimum of the fit to those three epochs gives a Prot of 44 ± 1 days (χ 2 = 10 2 ). That period is almost twice the value derived by SO11 and their value of the RV constraints estimated to be ∼ (21.5 ± 4.3 days) × sin(is), where is is the inclination of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the line of sight. The second minimum of the fit gives a Prot of 22.4 ± 0.2 days but with a χ 2 ∼ 10 3 . This high values of the χ 2 mean that none of the obtained values of Prot are consistent with the the locations of the spot in the three epochs. Both solutions deviate by more than 10 • in the location of the spot in E=204 event. The second minimun is also inconsistent with the location of the spot in E=207 while the <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Results of the fitting of the rotational period of WASP-4 using different spot occultation events (indicated with bold numbers) and nodetection of occultations during transit. As reference, in the second column we indicate the time span between the first and last epoch used in the minimization. In the last column is indicated if the fitted Prot is consistent with the no-detections (No-D). first minimum is consistent with it within the errors. Furthemore, these solutions are inconsistent with the no-detection of the spot during E=166,169. Probably this is an indication that the events occurring in the 172 and 204-207 epoch do not correspond to occultations of same star-spot and therefore this is a constraint for the lifetime of the spot. Using only the spot Tocc of the 204 and 207 epochs we obtained a Prot of 34 ± 2 days. However, this period do not match the occultation of the 172 epoch event, supporting the idea that the occultations in E=172 and E=204,207 are over different spots (∼ 43 days have elapse between the E=204 and E=172 transits). Nevertheless, is very likely that WASP-4b have occulted the same spot in E=204,207 due to time span between this events is only of ∼ 4 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epochs time span</head><p>To explain why the Prot = 34 days is above the limits of the RV's measurements we can use the observed decrease in the amplitude and duration of spots between the 204 and 207 epochs. One possibility is that we are evidencing a change in the rotational speed of the spots over the average rotation of the star. The spot can be migrating to higher latitudes in the star surface, decreasing by this way the projected area that is being occulted by the planet, and if WASP-4 presents differential rotation (like the observed in the Sun), the relative displacement rate of the spot over the stellar surface could vary. Therefore the increment in the rotation period we observed compared with the values of the RV's constraints and the rotational period we estimated using -91 and -68 data, can be indicative of the spot migration to latitudes with lower rotational periods. To fully support this argument we would need a more dense sample of transit observations using the same filters and observing configurations. A summary of the results of this section is presented in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>With the same analysis, if we fit the 163 and 172 epoch's occultations, the minimum we found corresponds to a rotational period of ∼ 13 ± 0.2 days (also consistent with the no-detections of the 166 and 169 epochs) but again this period is far below the range indicated by the RV's measurements and is a evidence that those occultation events are over different spots.</p><p>Of course, a more detailed model is necessary to constrain strictly the rotation period of the star. This model has to take into account other parameters such the amplitude and duration of the spot occultations, the relative angle between spin axis of the star axis and the orbital axis of the planet, the lifetime of the spots, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">SUMMARY</head><p>We present twelve new transit epoch observations of the WASP-4b exoplanet. These new transits observed by the TraMoS project were combined with all the light curves available in the literature for this exoplanet. It is worth noticing that the analysis and modelling we perform in Section 4 was done over detrended light curves (both for the TraMoS and literature data). This does not significantly affect the results in this paper because the system does not show TTVs. However, the light curve analysis should be done, whenever possible, including detrending coefficients as part of a global parameter fit. Therefore, we encourage authors to provide the raw light curves data in the publications to allow future homogeneous analyses of different datasets of a given planet. With an homogeneous modelling of all this data (the new presented here and the previously published) we performed a timing analysis of the transits. Based in the RMS of the O − C diagram of about 20 seconds we confirmed that WASP-4b orbits its host star with a linear orbital period. We updated the ephemeris equation of this planet and also refined the values of the inclination of the orbit and the planet-to-star radii ratio. Also, during the transits we detected small anomalies in the relative flux of four of the transits (of three different epochs) presented in this work. As Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2011) previously noted we identified these anomalies as stellar spot occultations by the planet. With a simple modelling using the timing of these occultations we estimated the rotational period of the star. With the timing of the events we are more confident correspond to occultations of a same spot allowed to propose the rotational period is about 34 days. Since this value deviates from the limits imposed by the radial velocities measurements a further modelling that include spot migration and star differential rotation is needed. A monitoring of more consecutive transits will be necessary to allow for new spots detections and to do a better constrain in the rotational period of WASP-4. High cadence light curves with relative small dispersion are critical on this matter, as can be seen in our SOAR light curves.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

(2010) online calculator 4 . The time stamps of the S09 light curves were initially expressed in HJD(UT) and have also been converted to BJD(TT). The same was done with the transit midtimes obtained from W08 and G09 light curves. No conversion was necessary for the light curves reported by SO11 (which includes the two transits of W09) and the ones reported by N12, since they are already expressed in BJD(TT). Fi- nally, we did not include the Tc derived from the 2006 and 2007 WASP data since that value is based on the folded transits of the entire WASP observational seasons, and therefore lacks the preci- sion required for our timing analysis. We used the D11 ephemeris equation to calculate the resid- uals of the mid-times of the 38 transits of WASP-4b analyzed in this work. Panel A in Figure 6 shows the Observed minus Calculated (O − C) diagram of the times for our twelve tran- sits.

A linear trend is ev- ident in the residuals of all the transits (represented by a dashed line in panel B). That trend is caused by the accumulated error over time in the transit ephemerides. Once those ephemerides are up- dated, that trend is removed (panel C), and the RMS of the transit times residuals is only of 29 seconds.

No spots were apparent in the remaining light curves. Our data of the -91 transit epoch confirms the detection of a spot occultation in the S09 light curve by SO11. Given the better sampling and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of our SOAR light curve, we can improve the central timing of the spot by a factor of three, as illustrated by the gray vertical bands in Figure 8, which indicate the error obtained in the central timings of each spots. However, our CTIO light curve of the transit epoch -68 shows no sign of spots and we cannot confirm the spot in that epoch in the S09 light curve. This can be attributed to the worse SNR of our light curve, but notice also that the amplitude of the spot occultation that we obtain in the S09 data is Aocc = 0.0021 ± 0.0020. Therefore that detection could render spurious. Among our new data we also detect two new spots during transit epochs 163 and 204. In Table 5 we show the results of the gaussian fits. Taking into account the values obtained for Aocc and the RMS values of the residuals, no starspot occultations were detected in the light curves of the epochs: -88, -71, 166 and 169. These non-detections (especially the transits closer to those with positive detections) can be used to constrain the spot's location and/or lifetime. For example, it can be argued that during those transits the spot is located in the non-visible hemisphere of the star, or that the spot have migrated to different latitudes that those occulted by the exoplanet's path. SO11 found two possible values for the rotation period of the star, 22.2 days (based on the spots of their new light curves), and 25.5 days, based on the S09 light curves. Both results are consistent with the constraint of the radial velocities measurements (Triaud et al. 2010). We used a simple linear model to estimate the rotational pe-</figDesc></figure>
