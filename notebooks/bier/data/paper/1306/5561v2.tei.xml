				<p>Context. Direct imaging of exoplanets requires very high contrast levels, which are obtained using coronagraphs. But residual quasi-static aberrations create speckles in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph which mask the planet. This problem appears in ground-based instruments as well as in space-based telescopes. Aims. An active correction of these wavefront errors using a deformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory , but conventional adaptive optics are limited by differential path aberrations. Dedicated techniques have to be implemented to measure phase and amplitude errors directly in the science focal plane. Methods. First, we propose a method for estimating phase and amplitude aberrations upstream of a coronagraph from the speckle complex field in the downstream focal plane. Then, we present the self-coherent camera, which uses the coherence of light to spatially encode the focal plane speckles and retrieve the associated complex field. This enable us to estimate and compensate in a closed loop for the aberrations upstream of the coronagraph. We conducted numerical simulations as well as laboratory tests using a four-quadrant phase mask and a 32x32 actuator deformable mirror. Results. We demonstrated in the laboratory our capability to achieve a stable closed loop and compensate for phase and amplitude quasi-static aberrations. We determined the best-suited parameter values to implement our technique. Contrasts better than 10 −6 between 2 and 12 λ/D and even 3.10 −7 (RMS) between 7 and 11 λ/D were reached in the focal plane. It seems that the contrast level is mainly limited by amplitude defects created by the surface of the deformable mirror and by the dynamic of the detector. Conclusions. These results are promising for a future application to a dedicated space mission for exoplanet characterization. A number of possible improvements have been identified.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Direct imaging is crucial to increase our knowledge of extrasolar planetary systems. On the one hand, it can detect long-orbit planets that are inaccessible for other methods (transits, radial velocities). On the other hand, it allows the full spectroscopic characterization of the surface and atmosphere of exoplanets. In a few favorable cases, direct imaging has already enabled the detection of exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kalas et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref>) and even of planetary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Marois et al. , 2010</ref>. However, the main difficulties of this method are the high contrast and small separation between the star and its planet. Indeed, a contrast level of 10 −10 has to be reached within a separation of ∼ 0.1 or lower to allow the detection of rocky planets.</p><p>To reduce the star light in the focal plane of a telescope, several coronagraphs have been developed, such as the fourquadrant phase mask (FQPM) coronograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rouan et al. 2000)</ref>, the vortex coronograph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mawet et al. 2005</ref>) and the phase-induced amplitude apodization coronograph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guyon et al. 2005</ref>). However, the performance of these instruments is drastically limited by phase and amplitude errors. Indeed, these wavefront aberrations induce stellar speckles in the image, which are leaks of the star light in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph. When classical adaptive optics (AO) systems correct for most of the dynamic wavefront errors that are caused by to atmosphere, they use a dedicated optical channel for the wavefront sensing. Thus, they cannot detect quasi-static non-common path aberrations (NCPA) created in the differential optical paths by the instrument optics themselves. These NCPA have to be compensated for using dedicated techniques, for groundbased telescopes as well as for space-based instruments.</p><p>Two strategies have been implemented to overcome the quasi-static speckle limitation. First, one can use differential imaging techniques to calibrate the speckle noise in the focal plane. Theses methods can use either the spectral signature and polarization state of the planet or differential rotation in the image ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marois et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Marois et al. , 2006</ref>). Second, even before applying these post-processing techniques, an active suppression of speckles ( <ref type="bibr">Malbet et al. 1995</ref>) has to be implemented to reach very high contrasts. It uses a deformable mirror (DM) controlled by a specific wavefront sensor that is immune against NCPA. The techniques developed for this purpose include dedicated instrumental designs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guyon et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wallace et al. 2010)</ref>, or creating of known phases on the DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bordé &amp; Traub 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Give'on et al. 2007</ref>) to estimate the complex speckle field.</p><p>Ground-based instruments that combine these two strategies are currently being developed, such as SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>) and GPI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Macintosh et al. 2008)</ref>, to detect young Jupiter-like planets with an expected contrast performance of 10 −6 at 0.5 . Better contrasts might be achieved to reach the rocky planet level with instruments using dedicated active correction techniques embedded in space telescopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Trauger &amp; Traub 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, we study a technique of wavefront sensing in the focal plane that allows an active correction in a closed loop. This paper has two main objectives. First we give an overview of how the amplitude and phase errors upstream of a coronagraph can be retrieved from the complex amplitude of the speckle field (Section 2) and how they can be compensated for using a DM (Section 3). In Section 4, we introduce the self-coherent camera ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baudoz et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Galicher et al. 2008</ref>). This instrument uses the coherence of the stellar light to generate Fizeau fringes in the focal plane and spatially encode the speckles. Using both the aberration estimator and the self-coherent camera (SCC), we are able to correct phase and amplitude aberrations. The second objective of the paper is a laboratory demonstration of the active correction and an experimental parametric study of the SCC (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Wavefront estimator in the focal plane of a coronagraph</head><p>In this section, we aim to prove that one can retrieve the wavefront upstream of the coronagraph using the measured complex amplitude of the electric field in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph. We assume in the whole section that we can measure this complex amplitude without error using an undetermined method. We describe one type of this method (the SCC) in Section 4. In Section 2.1, we express the complex electric field that is associated to the speckles as a function of the wavefront errors in the pupil upstream of a phase mask coronagraph. From this expression, we propose an estimator of the wavefront errors from the speckle electric field (Section 2.2) and analyze its accuracy for an FQPM (Section 2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Expression of the complex amplitude of speckles in the focal plane as a function of the initial wavefront</head><p>We consider here a model of a phase mask coronagraph using Fourier optics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (top) presents the principle of a coronagraph. We assume that the star is a spatially unresolved monochromatic source centered on the optical axis. The stellar light moves through the entrance pupil P . Behind this pupil, the beam is focused on the mask M in the focal plane, which diffracts the light. Hence, the non aberrated part of the stellar light is rejected outside of the imaged pupil in the next pupil plane and is stopped by the Lyot stop diaphragm L. The aberrated part of the beam goes through the Lyot stop, producing speckles on the detector in the final focal plane <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, bottom)</ref>. We note whith α and φ the amplitude and phase aberrations in the entrance pupil plane and define the complex wavefront aberrations Φ as The complex amplitude of the star in the entrance pupil plane ψ S can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Φ = φ + iα.<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">ψ S (ξ, λ) = ψ 0 P (ξ) exp (iΦ(ξ)) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ψ 0 is the mean amplitude of the field over the pupil P, ξ the coordinate in the pupil plane and λ the wavelength. We assume that the aberrations are small and defined in the pupil P (P Φ = Φ), thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ψ S (ξ, λ) ψ 0 P (ξ) + iΦ(ξ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The complex amplitude of the electric field A S behind the coronagraphic mask M in the first focal plane is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A S = F[ψ S ] M,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where F is the Fourier transform. Using Equation 3, we can write the electric field F −1 (A S ) before the Lyot stop</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F −1 [A S ] ψ 0 = P * F −1 [M ] + iΦ * F −1 [M ],<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where * is the convolution product. We call Φ M the aberrated part of the field after the coronagraph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Φ M = φ M + iα M = Φ * F −1 [M ].<label>(6)</label></formula><p>After the Lyot stop L, the electric field ψ S is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ψ S ψ 0 = (P * F −1 [M ]) .L + iΦ M .L.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We assume a coronagraph for which the non aberrated part of the electric field is null inside the imaged pupil. This property of the perfect coronagraph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cavarroc et al. 2006</ref>) has also been demonstrated analytically for several phase coronagraphs such as FQPM coronagraphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abe et al. 2003</ref>) and vortex coronagraphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mawet et al. 2005</ref>). The remaining part Φ L of the normalized electric field after the Lyot stop reads <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Simulations of an aberrated phase in the entrance pupil plane (φ), and the real part of the field in the next pupil plane before (φ M ) or after (φ L ) the Lyot pupil. We also show the estimate (φ est ) and the difference between φ est and φ. L = P in this case.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Φ L = φ L + iα L = Φ M .L = (Φ * F −1 [M ]) .L.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>In the final focal plane, the complex amplitude A S is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A S = ψ 0 F[iΦ L ], A S = ψ 0 F[i(Φ * F −1 [M ]) .L], A S = iψ 0 (F[Φ] .M ) * F[L].<label>(9)</label></formula><p>This complex amplitude is directly related to the wavefront aberrations in the entrance pupil. If one can measure A S , we can invert Equation 9 and retrieve the complex wavefront errors Φ in the entrance pupil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Wavefront estimator</head><p>We still assume in this section that an undefined method provides access to A S . Using this complex amplitude A S as the measurement, we therefore propose the following estimator Φ est for the wavefront:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Φ est = iF −1 A S M ψ 0 .P.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>This estimator can be used for any phase mask coronograph (for which M is nonzero over the full focal plane). To justify the pertinence of this estimator, we can re-write it using the variables of our model. Using Equation 9, in a noise-free measurement case, this estimator reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Φ est = ((Φ * F −1 [M ]) .L) * F −1 1 M .P.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Theoretically, if no Lyot stop is applied (L = 1), Equation 11 becomes Φ est = P Φ = Φ. We propose this estimator based on the assumption that most of the information about the aberrations is not diffracted outside of the imaged pupil by the coronagraphic mask. Therefore, using this assumption, we intuit that for L P , we still have Φ est Φ. This assumption is verified by the simulation in Section 2.3, and by the experiment described in Section 5.</p><p>For a symmetrical phase mask such as the FQPM, either</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F −1 [M ] and F −1 1 M</formula><p>are real. Thus, in the estimator we can separate the real (φ est ) and imaginary part (α est ) of the estimator in Equation 11:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">φ est = ((φ * F −1 [M ]).L) * F −1 1 M .P α est = ((α * F −1 [M ]).L) * F −1 1 M .P.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This relation ensures that within the limits of our model, this estimator independently provides estimates of the phase and amplitude aberrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Performance of the estimation</head><p>In this section we test the accuracy of the estimation φ est for a phase aberration φ and no amplitude aberrations (α = 0). In the following numerical simulations, we assumed an FQPM coronagraph. It induces a phase shift of π in two quadrants with respect to the two others quadrants. We simulated FQPM coronagraphs in this paper using the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mas et al. (2012)</ref>. This coronagraph is completely insensitive to some aberrations, for instance to one of the astigmatism aberrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Galicher 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. 2010</ref>). Because these aberrations introduce no aberration inside the Lyot pupil, we are unable to estimate them. We assumed an initial phase with aberrations of 30 nm root mean square (RMS) over the pupil at λ = 635nm, with a power spectral density (PSD) in f −2 , where f is the spatial frequency.</p><p>In these simulations, we studied two cases. First, we used a Lyot pupil of the same diameter as the entrance pupil (L = P ). Then, we studied the case of a reduced Lyot (D L &lt; D P , where D L and D P are the diameters of the Lyot and entrance pupil, respectively).</p><p>2.3.1. Case L = P <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the effect of phase-only aberrations φ in different planes of the coronagraph. Starting from the left, we represent the initial phase φ, the real part of the amplitude due to the aberrations φ M (φ L ) before the Lyot stop (after the Lyot stop), derived from Equation 6 (Equation 8) for phase-only aberrations. The last two images are the estimator φ est and the difference between the estimate and the entrance phase aberrations (φ − φ est ).</p><p>The estimate φ est is very close to the initial phase φ. For initial phase aberrations of 30 nm RMS, the difference φ − φ est presents a level of 10 nm RMS in the entire pupil. The vertical and horizontal structures in this difference are due to the cut-off by the Lyot stop of the light diffracted by the FQPM (the light removed between φ M and φ L ), which leads to an imperfect estimate of the defects on the pupil edges. Aberrations to which the FQPM coronagraph is not sensitive (such as astigmatism) are also present in this difference.</p><p>Assuming a perfect DM, we can directly subtract φ est from φ in the entrance pupil. Then, we can estimate the residual error once again, and iterate the process. The aberrations in the Lyot pupil φ L converge toward zero (0.2 nm in ten iterations). This is important because these aberrations are directly linked to the speckle intensity in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph. However, the difference φ − φ est does not converge toward zero in the entrance pupil. The fact that φ L converges toward zero proves that the residual phase is only composed of aberrations unseen by the FQPM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Case D L &lt; D P</head><p>In a more realistic case, we aim to remove all the light diffracted by the coronagraphic mask, even for unavoidable misalignments of the Lyot stop. For this reason, the Lyot stop is often chosen to be slightly smaller than the imaged pupil. We consider here a Lyot stop pupil L 95% whose diameter is D L = 95%D P . In a first part, we show below that phase defects at the edge of the entrance pupil can be <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>. Simulations of an aberrated phase with a localized default in the entrance pupil plane (φ), and in the next pupil plane (φ M , φ L ). We represent the entrance pupil size by a dark ring around φ L . We show the estimate (φ est ) and the difference between φ est and φ in the last two images. D L = 95%D P in this case.</p><p>partially retrieved, then we study the convergence of the estimator in this case.</p><p>As in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> corresponds to the simulation of the consecutive steps of the model (φ, φ M before Lyot stops, φ L after Lyot stop, then estimated phase φ est and difference with initial phase). We added a small localized phase default, indicated by the black arrow, inside the entrance pupil P , but outside of the Lyot stop L 95% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 3, left)</ref>. Around φ L , the complex amplitude after the Lyot stop, we drew a circle corresponding to the entrance pupil, slightly larger than L 95% . For an FQPM, the additional defect is diffracted in the Lyot stop plane (φ M ). After applying the Lyot stop of 95% (φ L ), most of the default disappears, but we can still see its signature. As the estimator φ est deconvolves by the phase mask, it partially retrieves the default, as seen in the estimate (indicated by the black arrow). In the error (φ−φ est ), we notice a remarkable cross issued from this defect, which is due to the information lost during the filtering by the Lyot stop.</p><p>The wavefront estimation is limited when compared to the D L = D P case. Because of the light filtered by the Lyot stop, some information about the wavefront aberrations close to the border of the entrance pupil is inevitably lost. Due to these unseen aberrations, φ − φ est does not converge toward zero. However, the residual aberrations in the Lyot pupil φ L still converge toward zero, practically as quick as in the L = P case.</p><p>By this first rough analysis, we see that we can estimate phase aberrations upstream of a coronagraph using the complex amplitude A S of the speckle field and Equation 10. The same conclusion can be drawn for amplitude aberrations and, because the estimation is linear, for a complex entrance wavefront. In the next section, we demonstrate that one can compensate for the wavefront errors in the entrance pupil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Entrance pupil wavefront correction</head><p>In this section, we use the estimator Φ est to numerically simulate the correction of phase and amplitude aberrations in a closed loop. In the loop, we can remove constant factors in the estimator, which can be adjusted with a gain g</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Φ est = giF −1 A S M .P.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>We still assume that we have a perfect sensor that measures the complex amplitude A S in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph. We used a deformable mirror (DM) of NxN actuators upstream of the coronagraph, in the entrance pupil plane. We started with phase-only correction. We explain how to correct for the effects of phase and amplitude aberrations with only one DM in Section 3.3. We define the correction iterative loop by the expression of the residual phase φ j+1 at iteration j + 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">φ j+1 = φ − φ j+1 DM = φ − [φ j DM + N 2 −1 i=0 k j+1 i f i ],<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where φ j DM is the shape of the DM at iteration j, k j+1 i is the incremental command of the DM actuator i at iteration j + 1, and f i is the DM influence function, i.e., the WF deformation when only poking the actuator i. Note that φ j is the phase to be estimated at iteration j +1. The objective is now to determine the command vector {k j+1 i } from the phase estimator φ j+1 est .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Wavefront aberration minimization</head><p>To derivate the command vector {k j+1 i }, we minimize the distance between the measurements and the measurements that accounts for the parameters to be estimated. Ideally, we would like to find the {k i } minimizing the distance d j {ki} between the residual phase and the DM shape:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d j {ki} = φ j − N 2 −1 i=0 k j+1 i f i 2 . (15)</formula><p>As presented in the previous section, a possible estimator of φ j is given by Equation 13, allowing us to compute Φ j+1 est from A j S (directly related to φ j ). So we minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d j {ki} = Φ j+1 est − D{k j+1 i }} 2 ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where D is the interaction matrix because we are using a linear model. This matrix is calibrated off-line directly using the wavefront sensor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyer et al. 1990</ref>). As in the conventional least-squares approach, we derived the pseudo inverse of D, denoted D † , by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Therefore, the command vector solution of Equation 16 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">{k j+1 i } = D † Φ j+1 est .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Equation 17 is applicable for different estimators (only D † changes). To create the interaction matrix, we poked one by one the actuators while the others remain flat, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Each estimated phase vector obtained hence gives the column of the interaction matrix corresponding to the moved actuator. The influence function (which we simulated as a Gaussian function) is at the left, the estimator given by Equation 13 at the right. At the center, we also plot another estimator of the wavefront that does not include the deconvolution by the coronagraph mask. It is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Φ est,2 = giF −1 [A S ] .P.<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The chosen estimator applied to the influence function must be as spatially localized as possible: we have to filter the noise and it is far more efficient if the relevant information <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Simulations of the influence function f i in the pupil plane (left), and the effect using the two different estimators: we deconvolve by the mask (Φ est , right) or not (Φ est,2 , center)</p><p>is gathered around one point. For this reason, it is preferable to use Φ est <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>, right) instead of Φ est,2 <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>, center). We notice in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> that even after deconvolution by the FQPM, the estimate (right) shows a negative cross centered on the poked actuator, whereas it is not present in the initial phase (left). This artifact is generated to the transitions of the quadrants, which diffract the light outside of the Lyot stop. This cross can be a problem for two reasons. First, it is difficult to properly retrieve it in a noisy image. Then, because it enhances the cross-talk between the actuator estimates, it may lead to unstable corrections (see Section 4.4). For these reasons, we chose to create a synthetic interaction matrix, i.e., use a slightly different model for the estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Synthetic interaction matrix</head><p>One interest of interaction matrices is to calibrate the misregistration between the DM and the wavefront sensor when considering a complex optical system. It also allows us to calibrate the shape and magnitude of each actuator response. Since the cross in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> (right) is 40 times less intense than the poke actuator in the center, it may be only partially retrieved in noisy images, which may lead to an unstable loop. To avoid this problem, we decided to build a synthetic interaction matrix based on the measured position and shape of each actuator. Because we considered an iterative measurement and correction loop, we finally discarded the magnitude calibration of each actuator, which lead to a slight increase of the required iteration number for convergence. We decided to only adjust the mis-registration and estimation shape of the actuator set in the output pupil on the measured interaction matrix, as seen by the sensor.</p><p>Out of the NxN actuators of the square array in the DM, we chose to limit the response adjustment on the 12x12 actuators centered on the entrance pupil. These actuators were alternately pushed and pulled using known electrical voltages and we recorded A S for both positions. Assuming the complex amplitude A S is a linear function of the wavefront errors in the entrance pupil plane and that other aberrations of the optical path remain unchanged between two consecutive movements (the same pushed and pulled actuator), the difference between these two movements leads to the estimatê f i of the influence function of a single poked actuator using Equation 13. For each estimate, we adjusted a Gaussian function defined by its width and position in the output pupil. From these 144 Gaussian fits, we can build the actuator grid as observed in the plane, where aberrations are estimated and determine the inter-actuator distance in each direction and the orientation of this grid. We also determined the median width of the adjusted Gaussian functions and computed a synthetic Gaussian function, which was translated onto the adjusted actuator grid to create a new set of NxN synthetic estimatesˆfestimatesˆ estimatesˆf i synth .</p><p>From these synthetic estimates, we built the synthetic interaction matrix D synth .

We added a small pupil R, called reference pupil, in the Lyot stop plane of a classical coronagraph. R selects part of the stellar light that is diffracted by the focal coronagraphic mask. The two beams are recombined in the focal plane, forming Fizeau fringes, which spatially modulate the speckles. In the following, we call the SCC image the image of the encoded speckles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5, bottom)</ref>.

The influence of the reference pupil size is detailed in Section 5.5. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> summarizes the steps followed to estimate the phase and amplitude aberrations with the SCC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Correction loop</head><p>We can use this wavefront estimator to control a DM and correct for the speckle field in the focal plane as explained in Section 3.

Under this assumption, Equation 28 becomes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Optical path difference</head><p>Between the Lyot stop and the detector, the beam is split into two paths (image and reference), which encounter different areas in the optics. Thus, differential aberrations exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. (2010)</ref>. However, because the reference pupil is small (γ 1), the main aberration is an optical path difference (OPD) between the two channels. In this section we study how this OPD impacts the SCC performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">Influence of an OPD on the correction</head><p>Given an OPD d op , we can define phase difference φ op = 2πd op /λ.

In this section, we make two assumptions. First, that the DM is perfect and we can correct for any desired phase in the pupil plane. Second, that the only error in the estimator is due to the OPD: if d op = 0, the estimator retrieves the exact phase and amplitude (Φ est = φ + iα).</p><p>We started the loop with a phase φ 0 and an amplitude α. After j iterations the phase in the pupil plane φ j is the difference between the previous phase φ j−1 , and the estimate of this previous phase φ j−1 est,op .

This sequence converges if |1 − cos(φ op )| &lt; 1. This assumption (−π/2 &lt; φ op &lt; π/2) is always satisfied in real cases. Its limit φ end satisfies the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">φ end = φ end (1 − cos(φ op )) + α sin(φ op ) φ end = α tan(φ op ).<label>(35)</label></formula><p>Therefore, for a nonzero OPD and a phase-only correction, the SCC correction converges, but the errors on the final phase depend on the uncorrected amplitude aberrations α.</p><p>To estimate the OPD effect on the level of the focal plane intensity, we considered the complex amplitude in the focal plane as a linear function of the phase and amplitude aberrations in the entrance pupil plane. We can thus evaluate the energy in the focal plane as a linear function of |φ| 2 + |α| 2 . Without an OPD, a perfect phase-only correction would leave a level of speckles only dependent on the entrance amplitude aberrations |α| 2 . With an OPD, this level is slightly higher: |α| 2 (1 + tan(φ op ) 2 ). For a realistic phase difference of 0.1 radians, the difference in intensity in the speckle field between the case with and without an OPD would be 1%. The impact on the correction is only weak.</p><p>The problem occurs when we try to correct phase and amplitude at the same time with one DM. We explained how to do this in Section 3.3. For φ op = 0, numerical simulations as well as tests on an optical bench show that the correction is unstable: at each iteration, we raised the phase aberrations by trying to correct for the amplitude aberrations and vice versa. Thus, we need an estimate of the OPD to stabilize the correction.</p></div>

Because the DM is in the pupil plane, the estimator applied to this difference is real for of an OPD equal to zero. However, for a nonzero OPD d op and using Equation 31 with α = 0, we deduce Φ i est,op = Φ i est (sin(d op ) + i cos(d op )). For each of the 12x12 actuators used to build the synthetic matrix, the arctangent of the ratio of the imaginary part on the real part of Φ i est,op leads to an estimate of the OPD. Due to the noise in the image, small differences in the OPD estimate can appear from one actuator to another. Calculating the median of the estimated OPDs, we obtain the measured phase difference φ mes op .

For a given diameter D L of the Lyot pupil, the highest frequency attainable for a NxN actuators DM (N actuators across the pupil diameter) is N λ/(2D L ) in one of the principal directions of the mirror and √ 2N λ/(2D L ) in the diagonal. The largest correction zone, called dark hole (DH) in <ref type="bibr">Malbet et al. (1995)</ref> is the zone DH max = [−N λ/(2D P ), N λ/(2D P )] × [−N λ/(2D P ), N λ/(2D P )] in the image plane. During the numerical process of the SCC image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 7)</ref>, we can decide to reduce the correction to a smaller zone than the one allowed by the number of actuators of the DM. This can be implemented in the SCC correction by multiplying I− by a square mask S q .

We used a square zone to restrain the correction zone to 24.5λ/D L to optimize the correction of the DM. We built a synthetic interaction matrix as described in Section 3.2. The pseudo inverse of D synth was used to control the DM in a closed loop using Equation 14. The correction loop was closed at 20 Hz for the laboratory conditions and ran for a number of iterations large enough (j &gt; 10) for the DM to converge to a stable shape. We recorded focal plane images during the control loop.

A specific study of the size of the correction zone is made in Section 5.4. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>, dark zones represent low intensities. The eight bright peaks at the edges are caused by high spatial frequencies due to the print-through of the actuators on the DM surface.

The amplitude defect level is estimated to be about 10% RMS in intensity. The period of the actuator pitch clearly appears in this pupil image. Due to vignetting effects by the focal coronagraphic mask, these high-frequency structures of the DM surface create illumination variations across the pupil. The first effect of these high-frequency aberrations are bright speckles outside the corrected zone (mostly on the eight bright peaks). The second effect is more critical for our purpose. Because the level of high-frequency amplitude errors varies across the pupil, it creates low-frequency amplitude aberrations, which induce bright speckles in the center of the correction zone.</p><p>To compare the level of the recorded speckles with the one expected using amplitude and phase errors, we simulated the expected focal plane image. We used the amplitude aberrations deduced from the intensity measurement on the laboratory bench ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). From these amplitude aberrations, we first simulated the the focal plane without phase errors (just amplitude errors). The profile of this focal plane is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> with a black dot-dashed line.

This is confirmed by the last images of the loop which show speckle levels below the readout noise between 8 and 12 λ/D L : the speckles beyond the readout noise are not visible and thus beyond correction. However, this problem can be solved by using a detector with a better dynamic range.</p><p>The number of incoming photons from the observed source is a critical problem of any speckle-correction technique: the speckles can only be corrected for to a certain level of contrast if the source is bright enough for them to be detected above photon and detector noise at these levels.

As explained in Section 5.2, for this number of actuators, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">DH max = [−26.6λ/(2D L ), 26.6λ/(2D L )] × [−26.6λ/(2D L ), 26.6λ/(2D L )] (as D L /D P = 8/8</formula><p>.1). We tested the case (K Sq = ∞) and three others: K Sq = 26.4λ/D L , which is only slightly smaller than size of the largest DH and two smaller square zones (K Sq = 20.8λ/D L and K Sq = 24.5λ/D L ). The images obtained in the last two cases can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> presents the radial profiles of the focal planes obtained on the laboratory bench, normalized by the highest value of the PSF obtained without coronagraphic mask.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">K Sq = 20.8λ/D L (left) and K Sq = 24.5λ/D L (center).</formula><p>The red, solid curve shows the result for K Sq = ∞, without square zone. The blue dotted line represents the result of a square mask of size K Sq = 26.4λ/D L , which is only slightly smaller than the actual cut-off frequency of the DM. In this case, we prevented the correction of speckles outside of the DH and obtained a great improvement inside the DH (0 to 13.5 λ/D L ) and a small depreciation Going from K Sq = ∞ to K Sq = 24.5λ/D L , the contrast in the DH progressively deepens. This is because correcting fewer of the highest frequencies with a constant number of actuators, we free degrees of freedom. However, for K Sq &lt; 25.5λ/D L , the contrast level does not improve because we reach the level of the speckles created by the amplitude aberrations. Additional shrinking would only reduce the size of the DH. Thus, the reduction of the corrected zone in the wavefront estimation greatly improves the correction performance (up to a factor 10) with only a small reduction of the DH size. This effect was described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bordé &amp; Traub (2006)</ref> using 1D simulations.</p><p>It is important to note that this improvement does not come from the phenomenon of aliasing in the estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Poyneer &amp; Macintosh 2004</ref>). Indeed, only the correction is enhanced by this process, because the estimation remained unchanged. The wavefront estimation with the SCC is only limited in frequency by the size of the reference PSF: we can estimate speckles as long as the reference flux is not null, i.e., as long as the speckles are fringed. In most cases (see next section), the first dark ring of the reference PSF is larger than the correction zone and the frequencies inside the PSF's first dark ring are well estimated. </p><formula xml:id="formula_45">√ 2N λ/(2D L ))</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Size of the reference pupil</head><p>In this section, we study the effect of the size of the reference pupil on the performance of the SCC. In the previous sections, we used two assumptions on the size of the reference pupil. First, in Section 4.2, we assumed a reference pupil small enough to consider that the influence of the aberrations inside such a reference pupil is negligible. Simulations showed that even for small γ, the level of aberrations in the reference pupil is very low and uncorrelated to the level of aberrations in the entrance pupil. Second, in Section 4, we assumed a reference pupil small enough to consider A * R constant over the correction zone in the focal plane. As previously mentioned, the highest frequency attainable by the DM is</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">√ 2N λ/(2D L ). Using the first assumption, |A * R | 2 is a perfect PSF whose first dark ring is located at 1.22λγ/D L . Thus, A * R is roughly constant over the DH if 1.22γ &gt; N/ √ 2.<label>(40)</label></formula><p>For N = 27 actuators in the entrance pupil, Equation 40 reads γ &gt; 15.6. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, we plot the radial profiles of |A R | 2 recorded on the optical bench for γ from 10 to 22.8. We observe a wide range of intensity levels for different reference pupils (from 10 −6 for γ = 10 to 3.10 −8 for γ = 22.8). A reference pupil with γ = 10 (blue, solid) does not satisfy Equation 40, and the first ring of its PSF is inside the correction zone (vertical orange dashed line). We test this case independently in Section 5.5.2. The other reference pupils are studied in Section 5.5.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1.">Impact of small reference pupils</head><p>The size of the reference pupil can influence the correction in two different ways: it changes the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) on the fringes and modifies the flatness of the reference PSF over the correction zone. We develop these effects in this order in this section. The S/N on the fringes is critical, because I − can only be retrieved with well-contrasted fringes. The S/N is directly related to the reference pupil size. Using Equation 23, we deduce that the peak-to-peak amplitude of the fringes in the focal plane is 2|A S ||A R |. Thus, if |A S | and |A R | are expressed in photons, and assuming only photon and read-out noise, the S/N can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">S/N 2|A S ||A R | |A S | 2 + |A R | 2 + σ 2 cam ,<label>(41)</label></formula><p>where σ cam is the standard deviation of the detector noise in photons. A higher S/N allows a better estimate of the speckle complex amplitude and thus, a better correction of the aberrations. One can notice that this S/N can be simplified depending on the relative values of its different terms. We quickly study the following cases:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">-if |A S | ≈ |A R | | σ cam , S/N → 0.</formula><p>In this case, the correction is limited by the dynamic range. -if σ cam |A S | and |A R | |A S |, S/N ∼ 2|A R |. Initial case, at the beginning of the correction, when the Lyot pupil is a lot brighter than the reference pupil. The S/N is only a function of |A R |.</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">-if σ cam |A R | and |A S | | |A R |, S/N ∼ 2|A S |.</formula><p>The S/N is decreasing with deepening correction. The reference brightness is not important.</p><p>Equation 41 shows that this S/N is an increasing function of |A R |, but for deep corrections (|A S | | |A R |), the impact of the size of the reference is probably very weak. The second effect is due to the assumption of a constant reference PSF over the correction zone. Variations of A * R in the correction zone distort the wavefront estimation. This effect advocates for small reference pupils (large γ): a reference pupil of γ = 16 generates an A * R that varies from 1 to 0.03 inside a correction zone of 27x27λ/D L . For this reference pupil, the fringe intensity is weaker at the edges of the DH. Therefore, the estimate is less accurate at these locations.</p><p>Using simulation tools, where we can change the camera and photon noise easily, we were able to isolate these two different effects and analyzed their influence on the performance of the instrument separately. A more detailed study has previously been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazoyer et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we experimentally tested the influence of the reference size. We used 27 actuators across the pupil diameter and K Sq = 24.5λ/D L with phase-only correction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows the radial profiles of the SCC image in RMS obtained on the laboratory bench for different reference pupils (γ = 16 and γ = 22.8), normalized by the highest value of the PSF obtained without coronagraphic mask. These results show that a large reference pupil (γ = 16) is preferable, even at the edge of the DH, where the reference PSF for γ = 16 is fainter than the reference PSF for γ = 22.8. Comparing the contrast levels obtained in this figure with those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> for all reference pupils, we deduce that we are still in the case |A R | | |A S |. Deeper corrections would normally depend less on the size of the reference pupil.</p><p>When we use the SCC as a planet finder there is another impact to consider: detection is possible only if the planet intensity is higher than the photon noise of the reference pupil. This effect advocates for small reference pupils. A trade-off study of the reference size is needed depending on expected planet intensity and the actual contrast that can be achieved. A more complete study of the noise in the SCC estimation is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. (2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.2.">Effect of large reference pupils</head><p>In this section, we experimentally prove that we can still achieve a correction inside the DH using a reference pupil that does not satisfy Equation 40 by modifying the phase estimator. This correction has previously been simulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. (2010)</ref>. A * R is still considered as the complex amplitude of a perfect PSF, but we cannot consider it uniform anymore over the DH. First, the speckles in the first dark ring of this PSF are not fringed, because the reference PSF intensity is null at this location. The wavefront errors that produce these speckles are not estimated and are thus not corrected for. Second, the sign of [A * R ] and <ref type="bibr">[A * R ]</ref> changes between the first and the second dark ring (i.e., between 1.22 and 2.23λ/D L ). These speckles are fringed and we can estimate the wavefront errors that produce them when we consider the sign change. Hence, when Equation 40 is not satisfied, instead of A * R constant, we assume |A * R | constant and change the sign of A * R over the correction zone. We now estimate In practice, to achieve the correction with this reference pupil, we multiplied I − by the mask in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16 (center)</ref>, where the white zones (the black zones) are constant and equal to 1 (−1). To build this mask, we recorded the reference PSF <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 16, left)</ref>. From this PSF, we were able to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>. PSF of the 0.8mm reference pupil (γ = 10) (right). From this PSF we constructed the sign mask (center). The white zones are uniform and equal to 1 and the black zones are equal to -1. Multiplying I − by this mask, the correction can be achieved (right) for this reference pupil.</p><p>find the dark rings of the complex amplitude. We were able to build the sign of the real part of the complex amplitude.</p><p>The tests on the optical bench were conducted using the 0.8mm reference pupil (γ = 10) and the process described in Section 5.3. We used no square zone. The resulting DH is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> (right). We distinctly see the first reference ring at 1.22λ/D R . As expected, the speckles on this ring are not corrected for, because they are not fringed. Nevertheless, apart from this ring, the whole DH is corrected. Although correction with a large reference pupil is possible, the level of speckle suppression is much lower (better contrast) than with smaller reference pupils (higher γ), because the speckles of the uncorrected dark ring diffract their light into the corrected zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Give'on et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>We showed in Section 5.5.1 that the SCC used with a reference pupil that obeys Equation 40 shows a better performance. However, some cases (many aberrations due to an unknown initial position of the DM, for example) may require the use of large reference pupils that produce highly contrasted fringes even with very aberrated wavefronts. The correction can then be initiated by correcting for low spatial frequencies (usually dominating the wavefront errors). Finally, the large reference is replaced with a smaller reference (which satisfies Equation 40) to correct higher frequencies and reach better contrast levels. that the contrast is limited by high amplitude aberrations (10% RMS in intensity) induced by the DM. When correcting for the phase and amplitude aberrations using one DM, we obtained contrast level better than 10 −6 between 2 λ/D L and 12 λ/D L , and better than 3.10 −7 between 7 λ/D L and 11 λ/D L . The simulation performance was limited by the diffraction of the speckles of the uncorrected area in the focal plane created by the amplitude defects. In addition, in laboratory tests, the contrast is currently limited by the camera dynamics in the aberration estimation.</p><p>We experimentally proved that a small shrinking of the size of the correction zone can improve the contrast the contrast up to a factor 10. We analyzed the influence of the reference pupil radius on the performance of the SCC and proved that the reference of γ = 16 (the larger reference pupil possible with a nonzero reference flux inside the correction zone) provides the best correction in our case.</p><p>To enhance the performance of the self-coherent camera even more, we plan several improvements. First, one can directly minimize A S , the speckle complex field measured by the SCC and not the phase estimated in the pupil plane. This approach has started to show good results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baudoz et al. 2012</ref>) for the simultaneous correction of amplitude and phase. The correction for the amplitude errors can probably also be improved by the use of two DMs. Moreover, solutions are considered to use the SCC with wider spectral bandwidths. First tests in polychromatic light have already been conducted and show promising results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baudoz et al. 2012)</ref>. A preliminary study of these effects has been published ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galicher et al. 2010)</ref>. A forthcoming paper will present a new version of the SCC that will probably overcome the current chromatic limitation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In Section2.1, we used Fourier optics to model the propagation of light through a coronagraph. We then proposed a method for estimating phase and amplitude aberrations in the entrance pupil from the complex electric field measured in the focal plane after a four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph. We used this model to correct phase and amplitude aberrations in a closed loop using a DM in the pupil plane, even for a Lyot pupil smaller than the entrance pupil.</p><p>We implemented this technique, associated with a selfcoherent camera as a focal plane wavefront sensor. We corrected for phase and amplitude aberrations in a closed loop which led to speckle suppression in the central area of the focal plane (called dark hole).</p><p>We tested these methods on a laboratory bench where we were able to close the loop and obtain a stable correction at 20 Hz. When correcting for phase aberrations only , we obtained contrast levels (RMS) better than 10 −6 between 6 and 12 λ/D L and 3.10 −7 at 11 λ/D L . We proved that we corrected for most phase aberrations in the dark hole and Acknowledgements. J.
