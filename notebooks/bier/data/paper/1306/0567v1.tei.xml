				<p>Tidal transfer of angular momentum is expected to cause hot Jupiters to spiral into their host stars. Although the timescale for orbital decay is very uncertain, it should be faster for systems with larger and more evolved stars. Indeed, it is well established that hot Jupiters are found less frequently around subgiant stars than around main-sequence stars. However, the interpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants are also thought to be more massive than the F-and G-type stars that dominate the main-sequence sample. Consequently it has been unclear whether the absence of hot Jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of those planets around massive stars. Here we show that the Galactic space motions of the planet-hosting subgiant stars demand that on average they be similar in mass to the planet-hosting main-sequence F-and G-type stars. Therefore the two samples are likely to differ only in age, and provide a glimpse of the same exoplanet population both before and after tidal evolution. As a result, the lack of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants is clear evidence for their tidal destruction. Questions remain, though, about the interpretation of other reported differences between the planet populations around subgiants and main-sequence stars, such as their period and eccentricity distributions and overall occurrence rates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Although radial velocity planet surveys have mainly targeted main-sequence FGKM stars, there have also been numerous discoveries of Jupiter-mass giant planets around evolved stars. These include moderately evolved subgiant stars, as well as very evolved giant stars. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This work has provided evidence that the giant planet population around evolved stars differs from the population orbiting solar-type main-sequence stars, in at least three respects. First, there are fewer close-in giant planets ("hot Jupiters") around evolved stars than main-sequence stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowler et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson et al. 2010a</ref>). Second, the orbital eccentricities of long-period giant planets are typically lower when the host star is evolved. Third, a larger fraction of evolved stars appear to host long-period giant planets, although this comparison is more complicated because of the possibility of systematic metallicity differences between the samples of evolved stars and main-sequence stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. 2010b</ref>).</p><p>The work described here was motivated by the desire to understand the first finding, the scarcity of hot Jupiters around evolved stars. <ref type="bibr">Two</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hatzes et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Robinson et al. (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al.

(2010a,c)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. (2011a,b)</ref>. For giant stars, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hatzes &amp; Cochran (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frink et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sato et al.

(2012).</ref> sibility is that tidal evolution has destroyed the hot Jupiters that once orbited the evolved stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rasio et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Villaver &amp; Livio 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kunitomo et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adamów et al. 2012</ref>). The second possibility is that the evolved stars are on average more massive than the main-sequence stars, and the differences in the planet populations are linked to the enhanced stellar mass (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burkert &amp; Ida 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kretke et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Currie 2009)</ref>. In this picture, hot Jupiters may occur less commonly around massive stars due to differences in (for example) the structure of the protoplanetary disk, or the disk dissipation timescale.</p><p>The latter scenario, attributing the differences to stellar mass, is generally favored in the literature. It is supported by the results of fitting stellar-evolutionary models to the observable properties of the evolved stars (their luminosities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures), which confirm that the evolved stars are relatively massive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. (2007)</ref> referred to their sample of evolved stars as "retired A stars," because the evolutionary models assign these stars the same masses as main-sequence A5-A9 stars (2.0-1.6 M ⊙ ). Recently, though, the fidelity of those evolutionary models was called into question by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lloyd (2011)</ref>. He argued that the selection criteria that were used to define samples of evolved stars should have resulted in a sample dominated by lower-mass stars, with F-and G-type progenitors rather than A-type. The debate over this claim continues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Johnson et al. 2013</ref>). In the meantime, it would be helpful to have a model-independent method for comparing the masses of the evolved stars and the mainsequence stars that have been included in radial velocity surveys.</p><p>The observed Galactic space motions (kinematics) of the stars can provide such a comparison. All of the stars under discussion are members of the thin disk of the Milky Way, and empirically it is known that the velocity dispersion of a thin-disk population increases with age (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Binney et al. 2000)</ref>. This is understood as follows. Thin disk stars form from dense, turbulent gas in the Galactic plane. Because that process is highly dissipative, stellar populations are formed with a very cold velocity distribution. Over time, the velocity distribution is heated due to interactions between the stars and molecular clouds (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Spitzer &amp; Schwarzschild 1951)</ref> and transient spiral waves (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barbanis &amp; Woltjer 1967)</ref>. Massive stars spend only a short time on the main sequence, and there is very little time for collisions to kinematically heat a population of massive stars. On the other hand, solar-mass stars spend a long time on the main sequence, leaving plenty of time for collisions to kinematically heat a population of solar-mass stars. One would therefore expect a main-sequence thin-disk stellar population's space velocity dispersion to decrease with increasing stellar mass. The same is true even for evolved stars, because a star spends such a small fraction of its life as a subgiant or giant relative to its main-sequence lifetime.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the Galactic velocity dispersion of the population of evolved planet-hosting stars. The kinematic evidence shows that these stars are similar in mass to F5-G5 main-sequence stars. Consequently, the lack of host Jupiters around evolved stars cannot be attributed to mass. The most plausible explanation is that the hot Jupiters have been destroyed, after losing orbital angular momentum to their host stars. We describe our sample of planet-hosting stars in Section 2, we detail our analysis procedures in Section 3, we outline scaling relations for tidal evolution timescales in Section 4, we discuss the results and implications in Section 5, and we summarize our findings in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SAMPLE DEFINITION</head><p>We first extract a list of exoplanet host stars identified with the Doppler technique, using the online database exoplanets.org ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wright et al. 2011</ref>). We cross-match those stars with the Hipparcos catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(van Leeuwen 2007)</ref> to obtain parallaxes and B −V colors, and with the Tycho-2 catalog <ref type="bibr">(Høg et al. 2000</ref>) to obtain apparent Vband magnitudes. We transform the Tycho-2 B T and V T magnitudes into approximate Johnson-Cousins V -band magnitudes using the relation V = V T −0.090 (B T − V T ). Photometry for some of the brightest planet-hosting stars is missing from the <ref type="bibr">Høg et al. (2000)</ref> catalog. For those cases we use the original Tycho photometry given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Perryman &amp; ESA (1997)</ref>. We remove from the list all planet-hosting stars with imprecise parallaxes (fractional uncertainty exceeding 20%). We also obtain the nominal parameters of the host stars and their planets from exoplanets.org.</p><p>We then define three samples of the planet-hosting stars. The sample of subgiants is defined as those stars with 0.85 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 1.1 and 1.6 &lt; M V &lt; 3.1. The sample of giants consists of stars with M V &lt; 1.6. Finally, a sample of main-sequence F5-G5 planet-hosting stars is defined by the criteria 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1, taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield (1998)</ref>. We will show later, based on kinematic evidence, that the typical mass of stars in the main-sequence F5-G5 sample is similar to the typical mass of the stars in the subgiant and giant star samples. 4 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is a HertzsprungRussell (HR) diagram of planet-hosting stars identified with the radial velocity technique, with our three subsamples highlighted.</p><p>Our samples are defined according to observable criteria in color and absolute magnitude, as opposed to model-dependent stellar masses (i.e., masses determined by comparing the observable properties with the outputs of theoretical stellar-evolutionary models). This is because the planet surveyors often define samples according to color and absolute magnitude, and because of the questionable reliability of the model-dependent stellar masses for the subgiants (Lloyd 2011). Nevertheless, one may wonder about the model-dependent masses that have been determined for the stars in our samples. For the subgiants, the model-dependent masses reported in the literature are in the range 0.92-2.0 M ⊙ , with all but six stars having M * &gt; 1.4 M ⊙ . <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The giant stars have model-dependent masses reported to be in the range 0.92-2.7 M ⊙ , with all but 6 stars having M * &gt; 1.4 M ⊙ . The reported model-dependent masses of the main-sequence F5-G5 stars are in the range 0.8-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1.4 M ⊙ .</formula><p>We also define two samples of main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood (not necessarily planet-hosting stars) using the Hipparcos catalog, requiring as before that the parallax uncertainty be smaller than 20%. The first sample consists of main-sequence stars with 0.15 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.30 and 1.9 &lt; M V &lt; 2.7, corresponding to A5-F0 stars (2-1.5 M ⊙ ) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield (1998)</ref>. Our intention with this sample is to provide a control sample that will allow a test of the hypothesis that the population of subgiant planet hosts is dominated by "retired A stars". The second sample consists of main-sequence stars with 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1, corresponding to F5-G5 stars (1.3-0.9 M ⊙ ) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield (1998)</ref>.</p><p>We compute Galactic U V W velocities for all stars for which the systemic radial velocities are available in the catalogs of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gontcharov (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Massarotti et al. (2008)</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chubak et al. (2012)</ref>. In addition to radial velocities, as inputs we use Hipparcos astrometry, parallaxes, and proper motions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(van Leeuwen 2007)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SAMPLE COMPARISONS</head><p>3.1. Kinematics <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> compares the U V W velocities of the subgiant planet-hosting stars, the solar-neighborhood A5-F0 stars, and the solar-neighborhood F5-G5 stars. As expected, the F5-G5 stars have a much larger velocity dispersion than the A5-F0 stars; they are kinematically hotter. The subgiant planet-hosting stars are also seen to be kinematically hotter than the main-sequence A5-F0 stars, with many stars outside of the 95% ellipse defined by the A5-F0 population. On the other hand, the velocity dispersion of the subgiant planet-hosting stars is comparable to the velocity dispersion of the main-sequence F5-G5 sample.</p><p>We quantify the significance of these observations in the following way. First, we calculate the mean U V W velocities of the solar neighborhood main-sequence A5-F0 and F5-G5 samples. We denote these mean velocities by ¯ U , ¯ V , and ¯ W . We then compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δ i = U i − ¯ U 2 + V i − ¯ V 2 + W i − ¯ W 2 1/2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where U i , V i , and W i are the individual U V W velocity coordinates of a single star. We calculate δ for each star in the subgiant sample and δ ′ for each star in the so- Galactic U V W kinematics of subgiant stars that host exoplanets discovered with the radial-velocity technique. In each panel, we plot the U V W space motions of the subgiant sample as blue points and the density of points in a control sample selected from the Hipparcos catalog as the background shading. We plot outliers in the control sample as gray points. In panels a, b, and c the control sample consists of main-sequence A5-F0 Hipparcos stars with 0.15 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.30 and 1.9 &lt; M V &lt; 2.7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>).</p><p>In panels d, e, and f the control sample consists of main-sequence Hipparcos F5-G5 stars with 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>). In each panel, the light (heavy) ellipse is the 68% (95%) velocity ellipsoid of the control sample in that panel. The U V W velocity distribution of the subgiant sample is kinematically much hotter than the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence A5-F0 sample. However, it is well matched by the U V W velocity distribution of the main sequence F5-G5 stars. We quantify these observations in Section 3.1. The velocity dispersion of a thin disk stellar population increases with age (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Binney et al. 2000</ref>). Since the post-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution is much shorter than the main-sequence phase, the velocity dispersion of a post-main-sequence stellar population depends on the main-sequence lifetimes of its constituent stars. As a result, the large velocity dispersion of subgiant exoplanet host sample relative to the main-sequence A5-F0 population indicates that subgiants spent more time on the main sequence than the A5-F0 stars. Therefore the subgiants are on average lower in mass than the A5-F0 sample, and likely to be similar in mass to the F5-G5 sample.</p><p>lar neighborhood A5-F0 sample. We use the AndersonDarling test (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hou et al. 2009</ref>) to compare the sample of subgiant δ i values to the sample of A5-F0 δ ′ i values. We find the probability that the subgiant planethosting stars are drawn from the same parent distribution as solar-neighborhood A5-F0 stars to be less than 10 −6 . Then we repeat the same calculation after computing δ ′ for each star in the solar neighborhood F5-G5 sample. The result is that there is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the subgiant planet hosts and the F5-G5 stars are drawn from the same population (AndersonDarling p-value = 0.48).</p><p>The U V W space motions of the subgiant planethosting stars are incompatible with the hypothesis of recent evolution from a population of A5-F0 mainsequence stars. Their larger velocity dispersion requires that they experienced longer main-sequence lifetimes than the stars in the solar-neighborhood mainsequence A5-F0 sample. This in turn implies that the subgiant planet-hosting stars are less massive than the main-sequence A5-F0 stars. The agreement between the velocity dispersions of the subgiants and the solar-neighborhood main-sequence F5-G5 sample indicates that these two samples likely have similar stellar masses. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> This is at odds with the model-dependent masses for the subgiants, which are generally reported to be larger than than the masses of main-sequence F5-G5 stars. While our sample-based test cannot be used to establish the mass of any particular star, we note that there is only a very weak negative correlation (≈−0.1) between δ and the model-dependent mass. This correlation is not significantly different from zero given the sample size (N = 35). The correlation would have needed to be 0.3 or larger in absolute value to have established a genuine correlation at the p = 0.05 level. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> compares the U V W velocities of the giant planet-hosting stars with the solar-neighborhood mainsequence stars. The U V W velocity dispersion of the giants is also inconsistent with solar-neighborhood mainsequence A5-F0 sample (Anderson-Darling p &lt; 10 −6 ). And just as with the subgiants, their velocity dispersion <ref type="bibr">7</ref> When we use a control sample of F0-F5 stars rather than F5-G5 stars, the Anderson-Darling test indicates that the F0-F5 sample and the subgiant planet host sample have a probability p = 0.00033 of being drawn from the same parent distribution. Thus the typical mass of the subgiant planet hosts is also likely to be smaller than that of the F0-F5 stars. In each panel, we plot the U V W space motions of the giant sample as green points and the density of points in a control sample selected from the Hipparcos catalog as the background shading. We plot outliers in the control sample as gray points. In panels a, b, and c the control sample consists of main-sequence A5-F0 Hipparcos stars with 0.15 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.30 and 1.9 &lt; M V &lt; 2.7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>). In panels d, e, and f the control sample consists of main-sequence Hipparcos F5-G5 stars with 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>). In each panel, the light (heavy) ellipse is the 68% (95%) velocity ellipsoid of the control sample in that panel. The U V W velocity distribution of the giant sample is kinematically much hotter than the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence A5-F0 sample. However, it is well matched by the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence F5-G5 stars. We quantify these observation in Section 3.1. As a result, the typical mass of a star in the giant population is more likely to be similar in mass to a F5-G5 star than an A5-F0 star.</p><p>is indistinguishable from the solar-neighborhood mainsequence F5-G5 sample (Anderson-Darling p = 0.62). We conclude that the planet-hosting giant stars, like the subgiants, are on average similar in mass to the mainsequence F5-G5 planet hosts. One of the planet-hosting giants, β Geminorum (Pollux) happens to have a asteroseismic mass determination placing it firmly in the "retired A star" category, with M * = 1.91 ± 0.09 M ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hatzes et al. 2012</ref>). Reassuringly, we find that this star has a U V W velocity of (−16, 5, −26) km s −1 , placing it just outside of the 68% contour of the solar-neighborhood main-sequence A5-F0 sample. Therefore this particular star has a low space velocity as expected, and does not call into question the overall result that the sample of planet-hosting giants is dominated by lower-mass stars. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> compares the U V W velocities of the planethosting F5-G5 stars, and of the solar-neighborhood samples. As expected, we find that the main-sequence F5-G5 planet-hosting stars are kinematically hotter than the solar-neighborhood A5-F0 stars, and they are kinematically indistinguishable from the solar-neighborhood main-sequence F5-G5 sample. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 2, 3</ref>, and 4 indicate that on average the subgiant planet-hosting stars are similar in mass to the mainsequence F5-G5 planet hosts. However it is possible that some fraction of the subgiant planet hosts stars are indeed more massive than the F5-G5 planet hosts. To quantify the maximum fraction of massive stars that could be present in the subgiant sample, we use a Monte Carlo simulation. We create many random mixed control samples composed of both solar neighborhood mainsequence A5-F0 and F5-G5 stars. We vary the fraction of main-sequence A5-F0 stars and then compare the velocity dispersion of the subgiant sample to the resultant mixed control samples. We find that control samples including less than ≈40% main sequence A5-F0 stars are generally consistent with the subgiant sample. Consequently, we expect that no more than 40% of the subgiant planet hosts were once A5-F0 stars. 8 Based on a similar calculation, we also find that no more than 40% of the stars in the giant sample were once A5-F0 stars.</p><p>We perform a few additional tests of the claim that the subgiants that were selected for the Doppler planet surveys have a typical mass similar to that of F5-G5 stars. First, we repeated the comparisons after swapping the subgiant planet-hosting sample for the sample of southern sky subgiants from the Pan-Pacific Planet Search presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wittenmyer et al. (2011)</ref>. These are not necessarily planet-hosting stars, but they were selected for Doppler surveillance in a similar fashion as the other subgiant planet hosts. We obtain quantitatively similar In each panel, we plot the U V W space motions of the main-sequence F5-G5 sample as light blue points and the density of points in a control sample selected from the Hipparcos catalog as the background shading. We plot outliers in the control sample as gray points. In panels a, b, and c the control sample consists of main-sequence A5-F0 Hipparcos stars with 0.15 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.30 and 1.9 &lt; M V &lt; 2.7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>). In panels d, e, and f the control sample consists of main-sequence Hipparcos F5-G5 stars with 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998</ref>). In each panel, the light (heavy) ellipse is the 68% (95%) velocity ellipsoid of the control sample in that panel. As expected, the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence F5-G5 sample is kinematically much hotter than the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence A5-F0 sample but well matched by the U V W velocity distribution of the larger Hipparcos main-sequence F5-G5 star sample. We quantify these observations in Section 3.1.</p><p>results; the Pan-Pacific search targets are kinematically better matched to F5-G5 stars than to more massive stars. Second, we select subgiant stars from the Hipparcos catalog using the same color and magnitude criteria that we applied to select the planet-hosting subgiant sample. This is intended to mimic the parent population of subgiants from which the planet-hosting stars were identified by the Doppler surveyors. We find that their kinematics are indistinguishable from the kinematics of the planet-hosting subgiants (Anderson-Darling p-value = 0.30). We also find the Hipparcos subgiant sample to be kinematically incompatible with an origin in the same parent population as the Hipparcos main sequence A5-F0 sample (Anderson-Darling p-value &lt; 10 −6 ). In contrast, the subgiant planet hosts and the main-sequence F5-G5 planet hosts are kinematically consistent with an origin in the same parent population (Anderson-Darling p-value = 0.5).</p></div>

One may wonder, though, if there are systematic differences in other stellar parameters that may have affected their planet populations.</p><p>A key parameter is metallicity, which is well known to have a major influence on the properties of giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Santos et al. 2004;</ref>). Thus it is important to compare the metallicities of the two samples. Based on the metallicity determinations reported in the literature, we find the average metallicity of the main-sequence sample ([Fe/H] = 0.05 ± 0.03) to overlap with the average metallicity of the subgiant sample ([Fe/H] = 0.03 ± 0.03). Their distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same parent distribution (Anderson-Darling p-value = 0.3). Thus at face value the metallicity distributions appear to be equivalent, although in Section 5.3 we discuss the possibility of systematic biases in the reported metallicity values.</p></div>

The eccentricity distributions for planets around subgiants, and for planets around giants, are consistent with each other (Anderson-Darling p-value = 0.3).

The probability that the K distributions of planets around subgiants and main-sequence stars are drawn from the same parent distribution is less than 10 −6 .</p><p>One finding that is not illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> is that the evolved stars are more likely than the main-sequence stars to show evidence for additional longer-period companions, in the form of a long-term radial-velocity trend. At P &gt; 100 days, long-term radial-velocity trends occur around 9 of 34 subgiants. In contrast, long-term trends occur in only 2 of 33 main-sequence stars (with giant planets in the complete region of parameter space) and in only 1 out of 24 giant stars. If the distribution of long-term trends were the same for subgiants as for mainsequence stars, the chance of reproducing these numbers would be less than 1 in 40,000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TIDAL TIMESCALES</head><p>If the subgiant planet-hosting stars and the mainsequence F5-G5 planet-hosting stars have similar kinematics and metallicities, the differences between their planet populations are not easily attributed to differences in mass or composition. Instead, the observed differences in planet populations are likely to be related to age or stellar radius (which are, of course, correlated). A mechanism for altering planetary systems that is known to depend sensitively on stellar radius is tidal dissipation. Theoretical rates of energy dissipation due to star-planet tidal interactions scale as high powers of the stellar radius (∝ R 5 * in the works cited below). In this section we develop approximate formulas for tidal dissipation rates, to support the discussion in the next section.</p><p>Tidal interactions between a star and an orbiting planet allow for the exchange of angular momentum between the bodies while steadily draining energy from the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Counselman 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hut 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hut , 1981</ref>. If the star's rotation period is longer than the planet's orbital period, the star spins up and the orbit shrinks. If the total angular momentum of the system exceeds a critical value, the orbit eventually circularizes and the bodies' spins are synchronized and aligned. If however the total angular momentum is too small, then there is no stable equilibrium: the orbit keeps shrinking until the planet is destroyed. It is not yet possible to compute accurate dissipation timescales from first principles. The best that can be done is to establish plausible scaling relationships that are calibrated using observations, as we attempt here.</p><p>Eccentricity damping (orbit circularization) can occur either due to dissipation inside of the planet or inside of the star.

The timescale for orbit circularization in the shorterperiod systems must be significantly shorter than the ages of the systems. We will therefore assume that the circularization timescale τ e,p at P = 5 days for a solarmass star with Q * /k * ∼ 10 6 and a planet with the mass and radius of Jupiter and Q p /k p ∼ 10 5 is τ e,p = 1 Gyr.</p><p>When the host star is a subgiant with R * = 4 R ⊙ , then t e, * /t e,p ∼ 0.01 and circularization should be mainly due to dissipation inside of the star (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rasio et al. 1996</ref>).

The stellar radii are based on the empirical calibration given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Torres et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>There are two other criteria that must be satisfied for tidal decay. First, since tides only cause orbital decay if the stellar rotation period is longer than the orbital period, we indicate in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> the maximum stellar rotation period that would be expected for stars in the different samples.

Then, the median of these upper limits was computed for each sample, and plotted in the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Second, the total angular momentum of the system L tot must be lower than the critical value L crit necessary for a stable equilibrium (in which the star and planet have achieved spin-orbit synchronization and alignment). The total angular momentum can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L tot = L orb + L rot, * + L rot,p ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">L orb = µ GM tot a(1 − e 2 ) 1/2 ,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">L rot, * = g 2 * M * R 2 * ω * ,<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">L rot,p = g 2 p M * R 2 p ω p ,<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">where µ = (M * M p )/(M * + M p )</formula><p>is the reduced mass and M tot = M * + M p is the total mass of the system.

Likewise, ω * and ω p are the angular velocities of star and planet. The rotational angular momentum of the planet is negligible. The value of L crit is (e.g., Hut 1980; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Matsumura et al. 2010</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">L crit = 4 G 2 27 M 3 * M 3 p M * + M p (I * + I p ) 1/4 ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">I * = g 2 * M * R 2 * and I p = g 2 p M p R 2 p .

Such planets will ultimately be engulfed, if the host star's rotational angular momentum was initially comparable to the current solar value.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Tidal timescales as a function of period and stellar radius. Left: Timescale ta for semimajor axis evolution (orbital decay) for planets inside the corotation radius (marked approximately by the white line). Right: Timescale te for orbit circularization. The timescales were computed as described in the text, assuming M * = 1 M ⊙ , Mp = 1 M Jup , Rp = 1 R Jup , Q * /k * = 10 6 , and Qp/kp = 10 5 . For planets to the left of the white diagonal band, the calculated tidal timescale is short compared to the duration over which a solar-mass, solar-metallicity star exists as a subgiant or at the base of the giant branch (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dotter et al. 2008</ref>). The left-hand figure shows that the scarcity of P &lt; 10 day planets around subgiants is a seemingly inevitable consequence of tidal decay. The right-hand figure shows that the tendency for planets around subgiants to have nearly circular orbits all the way out to P ≈ 200 days can only be explained if stars become much more dissipative as they evolve off of the main sequence (Q * /k * ∼ 10 2 ). Such a scenario would also imply enhanced rates for tidal decay, and could explain the scarcity of planets around subgiants all the way out to P ≈ 100 days.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Hot Jupiters</head><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows that there is no difficulty explaining the lack of hot Jupiters around subgiants with periods between 1 and 10 days. Although such planets' orbits may be stable for a Hubble time around a main-sequence stars, once the host star evolves and reaches a radius of 4 R ⊙ , tidal dissipation rates increase by a factor of ∼10 2 . Those same planets would experience orbital decay in a few 100 Myr, comparable to the time that their host stars spend as subgiants (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dotter et al. 2008</ref>). Tidal destruction has already been noted as a theoretical possibility by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Villaver &amp; Livio (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kunitomo et al. (2011)</ref>, at least for giant stars with R * 20 R ⊙ . It has also been suggested by Lloyd (2011), among others. Now that the subgiants are seen to have similar masses as the main-sequence sample, tidal destruction seems to be the inevitable explanation for the lack of close-in giant planets orbiting subgiants relative to main-sequence stars.</p><p>One might wonder if it is possible to find additional supporting evidence for tidal destruction of hot Jupiters based on the observed rotation rates of subgiants, since the accretion of angular momentum from a disrupted giant planet could affect the rotation rate. Suppose a star with mass 1.3 M ⊙ , radius 1.1 R ⊙ , radius of gyration I/M R 2 = 0.06 (the solar value), and rotation period P rot = 10 d accretes a 1 M Jup planet initially orbiting at 0.1 AU, and absorbs all of its orbital angular momentum. The final rotation period of that star when it reaches R * = 4 R ⊙ would be 24 days. Had it not absorbed its planet's orbital angular momentum, then its rotational period would have been 130 days. This seems like a significant difference. However, the radii of subgiants are generally uncertain by a factor of two or more. If instead the subgiant had a radius of R * = 8 R ⊙ , then its rotation period after absorbing its planet's orbital angular momentum would be 94 days. Consequently, identifying angular momentum enhancement in evolved stars will be difficult without accurate stellar radii.</p><p>The accretion of metal-enriched material from a disrupted giant planet could also affect the observed chemical abundances of an evolved star. Indeed, the accretion of solid material was initially considered as one possible explanation for the enhanced metallicity of the solartype stars identified as giant planet hosts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Laughlin 2000)</ref>. Following the calculation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Laughlin (2000)</ref>, the accretion of a Jupiter-mass planet with Z ≈ 0.1 into the 0.5 M ⊙ convective envelope of an evolved solar metallicity star will only increase the star's observed metallicity by 0.01 dex -an imperceptibly small increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Intermediate-period Giant Planets</head><p>Although tidal destruction is a natural explanation for the lack of hot Jupiters around subgiants, the relative scarcity of giant planets with periods between 10 and 100 days cannot be explained as the consequence of tidal destruction unless the tidal dissipation rate for subgiants is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than estimated in the previous section (and plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). One possibility is that dissipation becomes faster not only because of an enlarged stellar radius, but also a decrease in Q * /k * due to the changing stellar structure. This could also explain the observation that the shortest-period planets seen around subgiants (P ≈ 200 days) tend to have circular orbits: such planets would be undergoing tidal eccentricity damping due to dissipation within the host star. This is in contrast to the hot Jupiters observed around main-sequence stars, for which dissipation within the planet is likely to be the primary cause of eccentricity damping. Furthermore it would not be surprising for a subgiant to have a lower Q * /k * than a mainsequence star. The strength of tidal evolution in evolved stars is thought to depend on the mass of their convective envelopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rasio et al. 1996)</ref>, and the mass in the convective envelope of a solar-type star increases by an order of magnitude as a subgiant between the main sequence turnoff and the base of the red giant branch ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sackmann et al. 1993)</ref>.</p><p>We digress momentarily to point out that <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> reveals that most of the giant planet-hosting stars (as opposed to subgiants) are concentrated in the so-called "red clump" -a region of the HR diagram where the red giant branch overlaps with the horizontal branch for a solar-metallicity stellar population. Without asteroseismic observations, we cannot confidently assign individual stars to one or the other of those two populations. Unfortunately this means the giants are less useful than the subgiants in understanding the tidal evolution of planetary systems, for the following reason. The stars on the horizontal branch are currently burning helium in their cores after an initial ascent up the giant branch. They very likely had larger radii at the tip of the red giant branch than they currently possess. Since tidal effects depend strongly on stellar radius, the tidal evolution of any close-in exoplanets depends strongly on the sizes of the giant stars at the tip of the red giant branch -which are unobserved and poorly constrained. The subgiants invite a more straightforward interpretation, since they are presently as large as they have ever been since the planet-formation epoch.</p><p>Putting these pieces together, a scenario that explains many of our observations is as follows. Stars become more dissipative as they evolve off of the main sequence, both because the stellar radius increases and also because Q * /k * decreases by 3-4 orders of magnitude. Consequently, planets orbiting inside of the corotation radius (P 100 days) lose angular momentum relatively quickly through tidal interactions. Planets just outside of corotation are pushed out and pile up at P ≈ 200 days, while also undergoing eccentricity damping. Extending this scenario to the giant stars is also possible. As the host stars continue to move up the red giant branch, they expand and their rotation slows. As a consequence, the corotation radius is enlarged. Those planets that were previously secure at P ≈ 200 days now find themselves losing orbital angular momentum. These planets are not necessarily destroyed, though, because the host stars' trip up the red giant branch is brief. The orbital distances may shrink only modestly before the host stars start burning helium in their cores, contract, and settle onto the horizontal branch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Occurrence Rates of Giant Planets</head><p>Some of the observed differences between the planet populations around subgiants and main-sequence stars have no obvious interpretation in terms of tidal interactions. First, there is no simple explanation for the higher occurrence rate of long-period giant planets around subgiant stars. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowler et al. (2010)</ref>, the occurrence rate of giant planets with a &lt; 3 AU is 26 +9 −8 % as compared to 5-10% for main-sequence stars. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. (2010b)</ref> accounted for the effect of metallicity on planet occurrence and determined that the occurrence rate of giant planets with a 2.5 AU is 11±2% for subgiants, as compared to 6.5±0.7% for mainsequence stars. In either case, these offsets represent a 2-3σ difference.</p><p>A second and related point is that tides cannot explain the higher incidence of velocity trends noted at the end of Section 3.3. Tides are too weak to affect planets with such long periods that they are observed only as linear trends in a subgiant's radial velocity curve.</p><p>Third, and most puzzling, is the clustering of K values between 10-50 m s −1 for the subgiants, as compared to the broader distributions 10-300 m s −1 for planets in the same period range around both main-sequence stars and giants. The timescale for tidal evolution is proportional to planet mass, raising the possibility that only low-mass planets (small K values) persist once a star evolves off of the main sequence. But any tidal explanation would struggle to explain why the giant stars (which are even more evolved than subgiants) still harbor more massive planets. Future work is needed to understand these three differences.</p><p>One possibility is that the average metallicity of the stars in the subgiant sample is higher than that of the main-sequence sample, despite the comparison made in Section 3.2 suggesting that the metallicities are similar. Giant planet occurrence rates are known to be strongly dependent on host star metallicity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Santos et al. 2004;</ref>. In particular  found that the probability of giant planet occurrence P p scales as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P p ∝ 10 2 Fe/H .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>In that case, the increased planet occurrence rate for subgiants reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. (2010b</ref> Such an offset does not seem out of the question. The metallicities of the subgiants and many FG planet host stars in the control sample have been measured with the Spectroscopy Made Easy package (SME; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996</ref>) and other similar spectralfitting codes. The metallicity values returned by SME are known to have systematic biases depending on effective temperature T eff (e.g., Section 6.4 of . Although  attempt to correct for this bias, perhaps there still exists a residual offset of 0.1 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> when comparing the mainsequence F5-G5 sample (T eff ≈ 6000 K) to the subgiant sample (≈5000 K). Indeed, strong correlations between the values of T eff and [Fe/H] generated by SME were recently identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Torres et al. (2012)</ref>, who demonstrated that SME reports cooler temperatures (100 K) and higher metallicities (0.1 dex) than a line-by-line MOOG-like analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sneden 1973)</ref>. A homogeneous MOOG-like line-by-line stellar parameter analysis of a large sample of both FGK dwarf and subgiant planethost stars might help to resolve this issue.</p><p>We also note that in calculating the dependence of giant planet occurrence rates on stellar mass and metallicity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. (2010b)</ref> assumed that the effects of mass and metallicity were separable, even though there is a significant positive correlation between the reported stellar masses and metallicities (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). As we have shown, the subgiant stars are not likely to be especially massive. As a result, some of the increased planet occurrence signal in the subgiant sample was likely misattributed to mass instead of metallicity. For that reason, the metallicity corrections necessary to directly compare the giant planet incidence rate of main-sequence FGK dwarfs and subgiants may have been underestimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. (2010b)</ref>.</p><p>More speculative is the possibility raised by Lloyd (2011) that some of the radial-velocity signals detected for subgiant stars do not represent planets, but rather stellar oscillations. The oscillations would need to be nonradial to avoid producing large brightness variations in contradiction with the observations. Nonradial oscillations can produce low-amplitude, sinusoidal radial velocity variations (e.g., Hatzes 1996), though usually with smaller amplitudes and shorter periods. To our knowledge nonradial oscillations of subgiants producing signals as large as tens of m s −1 with periods of hundreds of days have never been empirically established, nor have they been theoretically predicted. We note, though, that the literature does contain examples of similar quasisinusoidal variations that are at least suspected to be the result of nonradial oscillations, in both more evolved and less evolved stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hatzes &amp; Cochran 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Desort et al. 2009</ref>). Perhaps the intense scrutiny of the subgiants by the Doppler surveyors has revealed a new mode of stellar pulsation. In addition to bringing the occurrence rate of giant planets around subgiants into better agreement with the main-sequence stars, this might help to explain the clustering of K values. The physics of the hypothetical pulsations might naturally select a particular range of velocities, whereas the planet-induced velocity amplitudes would depend on three different independent variables (M p , i, and P ) and should combine to produce a wide range of K values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Stellar Mass Loss</head><p>One might also wonder if stellar mass loss contributes to the orbital evolution of planets around subgiant stars, in addition to tidal effects. Mass loss on the red giant branch is frequently parametrized using the Reimers relation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kudritzki &amp; Reimers 1978)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_24">dM * dt = η 4 × 10 −13 L * (t)R * (t) M * M ⊙ yr ,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where L * , R * , and M * are the stellar luminosity, radius, and mass in solar units. The dimensionless parameter η is in the range 0.4 η 0.8 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sackmann et al. 1993)</ref> and frequently set to η = 0.5 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kudritzki &amp; Reimers 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hurley et al. 2000)</ref>. Taking the median luminosity, radius, and isochrone mass of our subgiant planet host sample L * = 9.5 L ⊙ , R * = 3.8 R ⊙ , and M * = 1.6 M ⊙ , the expected mass loss is rate is dM * /dt ≈ 5 × 10 −12 M ⊙ yr −1 . Over the 500 Myr a solar-type star spends as a subgiant, the total mass lost is only M loss 0.01 M ⊙ . Thus, mass loss is unlikely to affect the orbital evolution of close-in giant planets orbiting subgiants or stars at the base of the red giant branch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Subgiant stars are observed to host fewer close-in giant planets than main-sequence stars, but have a systematically higher giant planet occurrence rate when integrated over all periods. These differences have been attributed to the increased mass of the subgiant planet hosts relative to main-sequence planet hosts. We find that the Galactic kinematics of subgiant stars that host giant planets demand that on average they be similar in mass to solartype main-sequence planet-hosting stars. Therefore, the best explanation for the lack of hot Jupiters around evolved stars is tidal destruction of the hot Jupiters they once possessed. If tidal dissipation inside their host stars is also responsible for circularizing the orbits of the giant planets orbiting subgiants at P ≈ 200 days, then tides should also have been strong enough to destroy any giant planets inside of corotation (P 100 days). Planets outside of corotation may have extracted angular momentum from their host stars and moved to longer orbital periods, explaining the sudden appearance of planets around subgiant stars at P ≈ 200 days. The apparent 2-3σ increase in the incidence of long-period giant planets around subgiant stars relative to main-sequence stars is difficult to explain. It may be the result of systematic underestimates of the metallicities of subgiant stars or (more speculatively) hitherto unknown modes of stellar pulsation among the subgiants that masquerade as long-period giant planets.</p><p>It is also important to note that the kinematic equivalence of the subgiant and main-sequence samples suggests that the theoretical stellar-evolutionary models that were used to infer larger masses for the subgiants need to be re-evaluated. In particular, as suggested by Lloyd (2011) it may be necessary to reassess the applicability of a mixing-length model of convection that is calibrated for the Sun to low surface gravity stars that are not even quasi-stationary and that are developing shells of superadiabatic convection (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Robinson et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cassisi 2012)</ref>.</p><p>There are also potentially important implications of our suggestion that stars become much more dissipative as they evolve off of the main sequence, such that Q * /k * ∼ 10 2−3 . If this is so, then the Earth will very likely be destroyed as the Sun expands to nearly 100 times its current size near the tip of the red giant branch. Previously it was thought that the orbital evolution of the Earth could not even be predicted qualitatively as it seemed to depend on the details of the Sun's mass loss on the giant branch (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sackmann et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rasio et al. 1996</ref>). Thus the subgiant planet searches may havequite unexpectedly-clarified the Earth's ultimate fate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2. Galactic U V W kinematics of subgiant stars that host exoplanets discovered with the radial-velocity technique. In each panel, we plot the U V W space motions of the subgiant sample as blue points and the density of points in a control sample selected from the Hipparcos catalog as the background shading. We plot outliers in the control sample as gray points. In panels a, b, and c the control sample consists of main-sequence A5-F0 Hipparcos stars with 0.15 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.30 and 1.9 &lt; M V &lt; 2.7 (e.g., Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998). In panels d, e, and f the control sample consists of main-sequence Hipparcos F5-G5 stars with 0.44 &lt; (B − V ) &lt; 0.68 and 3.5 &lt; M V &lt; 5.1 (e.g., Binney &amp; Merrifield 1998). In each panel, the light (heavy) ellipse is the 68% (95%) velocity ellipsoid of the control sample in that panel. The U V W velocity distribution of the subgiant sample is kinematically much hotter than the U V W velocity distribution of the main-sequence A5-F0 sample. However, it is well matched by the U V W velocity distribution of the main sequence F5-G5 stars. We quantify these observations in Section 3.1. The velocity dispersion of a thin disk stellar population increases with age (e.g., Binney et al. 2000). Since the post-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution is much shorter than the main-sequence phase, the velocity dispersion of a post-main-sequence stellar population depends on the main-sequence lifetimes of its constituent stars. As a result, the large velocity dispersion of subgiant exoplanet host sample relative to the main-sequence A5-F0 population indicates that subgiants spent more time on the main sequence than the A5-F0 stars. Therefore the subgiants are on average lower in mass than the A5-F0 sample, and likely to be similar in mass to the F5-G5 sample.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We also constructed samples corresponding to F0-F5, F5-G0, and G0-G5 stars. We settled on F5-G5 for the analysis presented here, because this sample gave the best match to the kinematics of the subgiant planet hosts; see Section 3.1. 5 If we remove the six stars with model-dependent masses smaller than 1.4 M ⊙ from this sample, none of the subsequent analyses are substantially affected. 6 www.pas.rochester.edu/˜emamajek/HIP2008 UVW SpT Mv.dat</note>
