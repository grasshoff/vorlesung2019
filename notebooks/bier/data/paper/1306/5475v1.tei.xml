				<p>Context. Since the first exoplanetary atmosphere detection using the Hubble Space Telescope, characterization of exoplanet atmospheres from the ground have been playing an increasingly important role in the analysis of such atmospheres thanks to the enhancement of telluric correction techniques. At present, several species have been discovered in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, all of them consistent with theoretical models. Aims. Data acquired using the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope are re-analysed. We expect to discover new species in the atmosphere of the exoplanet HD 209458b. In addition to shed light on the atmospheric composition, we will derive the radial extension of the absorbents present in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. Methods. We present an alternative method to correct the telluric effects through the analysis of variations in spectral lines with the airmass. To search absorptions due to an exoplanetary atmosphere we implemented an algorithm to automatically search for all the features presenting an atmospheric signature in the transmission spectrum and through the wavelength range in the data. In order to estimate uncertainties we perform a bootstrapping analysis. Results. Absorption excess due to the transitions of Calcium at 6162.17 Å and 6493.78 Å, Scandium at 5526.79 Å, Hydrogen at 6562.8 Å and Sodium doublet are detected in the transmission spectrum at a level of −0.079 ± 0.012%, −0.138 ± 0.013%, −0.059 ± 0.012%, −0.123 ± 0.012%, −0.071 ± 0.016% using pass-bands of 0.5 Å, 0.4 Å, 0.5 Å, 1.1 Å and 0.6 Å, respectively. Conclusions. Models predict strong absorption in the Sodium resonance doublet which was previously detected, also in this analysis. However, this is the first report of Calcium and possibly Scandium in HD 209458b, including the possible ground-based detection of Hydrogen. Calcium is expected to condense out in the atmosphere of this exoplanet; therefore, confirmation of these results will certainly imply a review of theoretical models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the first detection of an extrasolar planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995</ref>) radial velocities and transits monitoring have allowed the measurement of dynamics and bulk properties of hundreds of exoplanets. The former method is responsible of the majority of known planets and give us the minimum mass msin(i), among other parameters. The latter allowed 1/3 of known planets, adds thousand of candidates and provides the planet radius and inclination. Both methods are complementary, e.g. letting us to know the true planet mass. Moreover, transits present an unique opportunity to characterize exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy allows to measure the absorption of radiation passing through the optically thin exoplanet atmosphere and decode the composition and physical parameters of the outer atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref>, thereafter C2002).</p><p>Absorption from exoplanetary atmospheres are expected to be of the order of 10 −3 for a hot-Jupiter planet orbiting a Sun-like star. Therefore high signal-to-noise data are needed to measure such absorption. Regarding photon collecting capacity, ground-based telescopes takes advantage over space-based. However, data acquired using ground-based instruments must be corrected in order to deal with variations introduced by Earth's atmosphere. In previous work, these corrections are mainly done by observation of a reference star (simultaneously or not) or the creation of a synthetic telluric spectrum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bean et al. (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Redfield et al. (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Langland-Shula et al. (2009)</ref>, thereafter R2008 and L2009 respectively.)</p><p>Traditionally, theoretical models have been used to predict which transitions are prominent enough to be easily distinguishable from noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burrows et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fortney et al. 2010</ref>). Detected components in the transiting HD 209458b's atmosphere agree with these models (C2002, Vidal-Madjar et al. <ref type="bibr">(2003,</ref><ref type="bibr">2004</ref>); <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beaulieu et al. (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2008)</ref>). We note that previous detections were reported in a single spectral line (or doublet) or photometric detection instead of a suite of transitions of a particular specie. Although much work has been done to date, more studies need to be conducted to confirm some of the previous results and observation-models agreements, as well as improve techniques for precise constraining of abundances.</p><p>The purpose of present study was to perform a "blind search" in the whole transmission spectrum of HD 209458b to automatically detect strong and missed absorption produced in the <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Local normalization around a spectral line. First (left plot), we obtain a median filtered array (middle blue line), the filter width was chosen to be 1.25 times the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) -typically FWHM ∼ 0.4 Å -which corresponds to 50 pixels given the instrument resolution. Pixels within 3 × FWHM and which intensity are beyond 3 Poisson-statistics sigmas from the median filter (red curves) are discarded. Middle plot shows a zoom to the median filter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations, data reduction and analysis</head><p>Science archive SMOKA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baba et al. 2002)</ref> was used to obtain data collected with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on the Subaru telescope. These HD209458 data have been described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Winn et al. (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Narita et al. (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Snellen et al. (2008)</ref>, thereafter W2004, N2005 and S2008 respectively. The entrance slit was 0.8 and the resolution was R ∼ 45000.</p><p>After applying the S2008 correction 1 for the CCD nonlinearity effects we followed the HDS IRAF Reduction Manual available on the NAOJ website 2 . We used 29 spectra frames each with a total exposure time of 500s. The resulting signal to noise ratio (SNR) varies between 300 and 450 per pixel in the continuum. We concentrated in the red CCD that contains 21 orders covering from 5500Å to 6800Å. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref> ephemeris was used to select the intransit and out-of-transit frames. We independently and automatically analyzed the region around each of the transitions indexed in The Interactive Database of Spectral Standard Star Atlases 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lobel 2008)</ref>. This database lists the line parameters, including rest wavelength, oscillator strength (g i f i j ), expected line depth, and responsible element for telluric and stellar transitions for a subset of template standard stars. For HD 209458 (G0 V) we use the solar spectrum template because is the closest spectral type. Using this database limit our study to transitions present in the host star, i.e. we are restricted to exoplanet elements that are also present in the parent star atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data preparation</head><p>A Doppler correction for each Echelle order was applied in order to locate observable transitions from the database. We used 4 to 8 transitions to obtain the linear dependence between the 1 F cor = F raw − 3.0 × 10 −6 × F 2 raw 2 http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HDS/ 3 http://spectra.freeshell.org/spectroweb.html rest and observed wavelength difference as a function of the observed wavelength. This procedure was less accurate than calculate the radial velocities by the correlation-cross-function but precise enough to find the Doppler-shifted transitions from the database.</p><p>We do not follow the method used in W2004, N2005 and S2008 to correct the variations in the systematic blaze function. Instead, we normalized locally 4 around each analyzed transition by implementing a median filter, sigma clipping, and using a third order polynomial (details in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Then, we applied the following automated selection criteria to each spectral line in order to identify those with the best conditions for the further analysis.</p><p>-Since faint transitions are more difficult to detect, we selected those stellar lines having a minimum line depth of 10% in the database (i.e. at the solar spectrum). -Zones with bad automatic normalization were discarded by obtain pixel by pixel the residuals from the normalized continuum and its median. These values were sorted. Selected transitions have 70% of sorted residuals below the empirical value of 0.009. -To discard blended lines we calculated the difference in wavelength and normalized flux between the pixel with the lowest value (line core) and the center of a Voigtian fit. Such difference for selected lines were less than the empirical value of 0.06Å (∼3 pixels) in wavelength and less than 0.06 in normalized flux. -Stronger transitions are easier to detect in the transmission spectrum. Therefore, we use the oscillator strength as a proxy. We selected those transitions having an oscillator strength value greater than the value of Na D (log(g i f i j ) = −0.184) which was detected in HD 209458b using this data set (S2008). The transitions strength of Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na and Sc indeed empirically correlate with oscillator strength.</p><p>Finally, we note that most of the lines present an "s" shape in the transmission spectrum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jensen et al. (2012)</ref> report the same "s" shape for Hα and gives some possible interpretations. However, in our analysis we found that this unusual feature is not planetary phase-correlated because it also appears when comparing only out-of-transit data. To correct these relative shifts between spectra we calculate the centre of each stellar line by the Voigtian fit. This centre was used to obtain the difference in wavelength between the absorption in a reference exposure and the rest of frames. Then, we align the spectral line for each exposure to a common centre using a cubic spline re-sampling. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> summarizes the selection criteria by examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Telluric corrections</head><p>Spectra recorded using ground-based instruments suffers from the imprints of Earth's atmosphere which could vary in time due to different reasons. Therefore, those data must be corrected from telluric features producing spurious signals in the transmission spectrum. A powerful method to recognise telluric lines was implemented using the airmass in the radiative transfer equation. The solution of this equation assuming only absorption is ln (I/I 0 ) = Nk λ s; where I is the intensity at certain wavelength λ, I 0 is the source intensity, Nk λ is the optical depth at zenith and s is the airmass. We ignore slit-losses as first trial.</p><p>We derived Nk λ and its error through a linear regression to ln(I) as a function of the airmass s at a mid-exposure. This procedure was done only using out-of-transit spectra because while the transit starts a relatively abrupt variation in F λ is expected if a detectable element is present in the exoplanetary atmosphere blocking photons at λ. This method yields a telluric spectrum (e.g. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 top)</ref> which is clearly consistent with the telluric spectrum shown in Figures 1 from L2009 or S2008. Any slit-losses were thus empirically shown of second order.</p><p>Each spectrum was divided by e Nk λ (s i −s Re f ) , where s Re f is the average airmass of in-transit spectra. We note that some strong tellurics are not fully corrected as features appears in telluric lines positions in the transmission spectrum. We attribute this to short timescale variations in telluric species content or secondorder deviations from the linear dependence ln(I) ∝ s, like slitlosses. We paid special attention when a feature is present in both the transmission and the telluric spectrum, like in Na D vicinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Features in the transmission spectrum</head><p>For each transition, we created a central (C) pass-band centred in the interest line and two adjacent -blue (B), red (R) -control pass-bands. <ref type="bibr">From R2008, and Jensen et al. (2011</ref> we note that features in the transmission spectrum falls within stellar lines profiles because even if spectral lines are broader in atmospheres such as HD 209458b the strongest absorption occurs at the core. This fact suggested to select pass-band sizes proportional to the stellar line width. Pass-band sizes were given by ×3, ×4.5 and ×6 the width of the Voigtian fit to each stellar transition. We note that originally C2002 used three central band-passes because they did not know the precise width of the sought feature.</p><p>To automatically detect features in the transmission spectrum we calculate the relative flux based both with R2008 and S2008 methods. The depth of the light curve should be consistent in both cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">R2008 based analysis.</head><p>This analysis visualises the transmission spectrum along wavelength. In-transit F In and out-of-transit F Out spectra were stacked separately reaching a S NR ∼ 1600 and S NR ∼ 1200, respectively. F In (λ) and F Out (λ) errors were obtained with the standard deviation of normalized flux by pixel across in-transit and out-of-transit frames. The relative flux F Rel (λ) = F In /F Out was <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Example of telluric absorptions in HDS spectra around the Na I D.

(1) An out-out comparison where a randomly selected subset of out-of-transit data (7 frames) were used like intransit data and the non-selected out-of-transit (4 frames) were used like out-of-transit exposures, each data subset was then used to calculate the transmitted signal. Since there should be no difference among the transmitted signal for these population, the resulting distribution is expected to be centred at zero. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> Similarly, an in-in comparison where a randomly selected subset of in-transit exposures (11 frames) were compared to the rest of in-transit data. The resulting distribution is also expected to be centred at zero. (3) An in-out comparison where an increasing number of spectra (up to half of the sample) were removed from the in-transit sample and the remaining were compared with the out-of-transit data set. The resulting distribution is expected to be centred at the measured value of the transmitted signal using all data set.</p><p>The number of iterations was selected 3000 because approximately over this number the width of distributions in the in-in, out-out and in-out scenarios do not increase significantly. We considered 1σ of the in-out scenario as the uncertainties for our later results.</p></div>

Instead, we measure the absorption as the difference between the in-transit and out-of-transit averages. Stellar limb darkening is not expected to significantly affect the transmitted signal since we used narrow band-passes and spectra were normalized by the local continuum. As demonstrated by R2008 using stellar models, and depending on the spectral line, the error for not considering limb-darkening accounts to a negligible 10 −5 . On the other hand, using the wrong limb-darkening law can be misleading (see Sect. 3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and analysis</head><p>Previous Sodium and Hydrogen detections were confirmed and new Calcium and possibly Scandium features resulted in significant absorption in the transmission spectrum from 29 transitions satisfying our selection criteria described in Sect. 2.1 and over 2200 transitions automatically analysed in the twenty-nine spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Na I</head><p>As it is expected from the previously analysed data set (S2008), absorption excess in Na I D was measured at a level of −0.071 ± 0.016% (×3 band), −0.043 ± 0.012% (×4.5 band) and −0.045 ± 0.010% (×6 band).

Selecting the same pass-bands used in S2008, our detection level was −0.072 ± 0.015% (0.75 Å). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4 top panel'</ref>s shows the light curve derived for Na I D absorption excess using the 0.75 Å pass-band while bottom panel shows the associated bootstrap distributions (top) where we specify its central values and 1σ uncertainties (bottom). We note that almost all our light curve points are within S2008's 1σ values. In fact, using our same transit-fitting modeling on S2008's data (average-in minus average-out) we obtain a difference between their depth and ours of 0.016%, which is in agreement with the errors. The disagreement with their published Na D absorption (−0.135 ± 0.017%) therefore seems to come primarily from their choice of fitting a model with a limb darkening law adapted from a broadband observation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We present the first ground-based detection of Calcium and possibly Scandium and Hydrogen in the transmission spectrum of HD 209458b. Ca I at 6162.17 Å and 6493.78 Å, Sc II transition at 5526.79 Å, and Hα presents an absorption excess of (−7.9 ± 1.2) × 10 −4 , (−13.8 ± 1.3) × 10 −4 , (−5.9 ± 1.2) × 10 −4 , and (−12.3 ± 1.2) × 10 −4 in the ×3, ×3, ×4.5, and ×1.5 pass-band, respectively. Na D and Ca I show the expected rise of observed altitudes toward smaller pass-bands, while the Sc does not present 7 P Vap = P Vap,0 exp − ∆H</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R 1 T − 1 T 0</formula><p>, where P Vap is the vapour pressure, ∆H is the latent heat of the phase transition, R is the specific gas constant and T the temperature.</p><p>8 P = P 0 exp − z S c,Ca −z min H , where P is the pressure and H es the scale height such a behaviour. Although the Hα signal is clear and shows stability through bootstrap analysis, the origin of such feature in the transmission spectrum is not completely clear. HD 209458b is highly irradiated exoplanet where atmospheric conditions allow Ca to be in the gaseous state given observed conditions in <ref type="bibr">Vidal-Madjar et al. (2011b,a)</ref> and our observed altitudes. According to Clausius-Clapeyron analysis Sc could condensate forming clouds or hazes.</p><p>We note that even if models expect the weakening and vanishing of Ca, TiO, VO, and O -e.g. via CaTiO 3 , see section 3.3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jensen et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allard &amp; Homeier (2012)</ref> -the atmosphere of HD 209458b present <ref type="bibr">TiO, VO, and O (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Désert et al. 2008</ref>) and here we present Ca detection.</p><p>We demonstrated the potential of automatic and "blind" search of exoplanetary atmospheres evidences in the transmission spectrum resulting in the detection of species that, at the present time, have been not predicted by theoretical models.</p><p>Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fossati et al. (2010)</ref> detected metals in the atmosphere of WASP-12b, Sc among them. These results put in concordance the fact that HD 209458b and WASP-12b are highly irradiated hot-Jupiters and they may present a similar photochemistry.</p><p>We also validate a method to perform telluric correction using science data itself, without the need of a reference star or models. We rely on the validity of such method is limited to data acquired in one stable single night as it involves a minimum of variation in the contents of Earth's atmospheric components.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
