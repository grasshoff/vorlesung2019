				<p>The general relativistic precession rate of periastra in close-in exoplanets can be orders of magnitude larger than the magnitude of the same effect for Mercury. The realization that some of the close-in exoplanets have significant eccentricities raises the possibility that this precession might be detectable. We explore in this work the observability of the periastra precession using radial velocity and transit light curve observations. Our analysis is independent of the source of precession, which can also have significant contributions due to additional planets and tidal deformations. We find that precession of the periastra of the magnitude expected from general relativity can be detectable in timescales of 10 years with current observational capabilities by measuring the change in the primary transit duration or in the time difference between primary and secondary transits. Radial velocity curves alone would be able to detect this precession for super-massive, close-in exoplanets orbiting inactive stars if they have ∼ 100 datapoints at each of two epochs separated by ∼ 20 years. We show that the contribution to the precession by tidal deformations may dominate the total precession in cases where the relativistic precession is detectable. Studies of transit durations with Kepler might need to take into account effects arising from the general relativistic and tidal induced precession of periastra for systems containing close-in, eccentric exoplanets. Such studies may be able to detect additional planets with masses comparable to that of Earth by detecting secular variations in the transit duration induced by the changing longitude of periastron.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Following the discovery of an extra-solar planet around the solar type star 51 Pegasi <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref> there has been rapid progress in the detection and characterization of extra-solar planetary systems. The very early discoveries have shattered our view on planetary systems, as certain systems exhibited short periods (51 Peg), high eccentricities (e.g. 70 Virginis b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marcy &amp; Butler 1996)</ref>, and massive planetary companions (e.g. Tau Boo b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Butler et al. 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, systems with all these properties combined (i.e. massive planets with short periods, small semi-major axes, high eccentricities) have been also discovered (e.g., HAT-P-2b, XO-3b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johns-Krull et al. 2008</ref>). The high eccentricities are somewhat surprising, as hot Jupiters with short periods are generally expected to be circularized in timescales shorter than the lifetime of the system if the parameter Q, inversely proportional to the planet's tidal dissipation rate, is assumed to be similar to that inferred for Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rasio et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>By virtue of their small semi-major axes and high eccentricities, the longitude of periastron ω of some of the newly discovered systems are expected to precess due to General Relativistic (GR) effects at rates of degrees per century. This is orders of magnitude larger than the same effect observed in Mercury in our Solar System (43 ′′ /century), which offered one of the cornerstone tests of GR. Furthermore, the massive, close-in eccentric planets induce significant reflex motion of the host star, therefore enhancing the detectability of the precession directly via radial velocities.</p><p>In this work we explore the observability of the precession of the longitude of periastron with the magnitude expected from GR in exoplanets using radial velocity and transit timing observations. We also consider in this work the periastra precession due to planetary perturbers and tidal deformations, which can have contributions comparable or greater than that of GR. Previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Miralda-Escudé 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman 2007</ref>) have explored some aspects of the work presented here in the context of using timing observations to detect terrestrial mass planets. We refer the reader to independent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pál &amp; Kocsis (2008)</ref> that also explores the measurable effects of the periastra precession induced by GR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPECTED PRECESSION OF PERIASTRA</head><p>Before continuing let us fix our notation. In what follows a will denote the semi-major axis of the Keplerian orbit of the planet-star separation, e its eccentricity, P its period, ω its longitude of periastron, M ⋆ and R ⋆ the mass and radius of the host star, respectively, and n ≡ (GM tot /a 3 ) 1/2 is the Keplerian mean motion (orbital angular frequency), 1 where G is Newton's gravitational constant and M tot = M ⋆ + M p with M p the mass of the planet. The reflex motion of the host star is characterized in a similar manner. In this section we detail the expected mechanisms that will cause a precession in the value of ω.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">General Relativistic Precession</head><p>One of the most well-known consequences of General Relativity is that orbits in a Schwarzschild metric are no longer closed as is the case for the Kepler problem in Newtonian mechanics. The rate of precession of the longitude of periastron due to GR is given to leading post-Newtonian order by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">˙ ω GR = 3GM ⋆ ac 2 (1 − e 2 ) n<label>(1)</label></formula><p>(see any general relativity textbook, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Misner et al. 1973</ref>, for a derivation). With a expressed in astronomical units, P in days and the mass of the host star M * in solar units, ˙ ω GR is given in units of degrees per century by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">˙ ω GR = 7.78 (1 − e 2 ) M ⋆ M ⊙ a 0.05AU −1 P day −1 [ • /century].<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We use equation 2 to estimate the expected precession for currently known exoplanets as listed in the online California &amp; Carnegie Catalog of Exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">, version Nov 7 2007</ref>). We list in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> all exoplanets that have e &gt; 0.1 and that have ˙ ω GR &gt; 1 • /century 5 . From left to right, the columns in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> record the name of the exoplanet, its semi-major axis, its eccentricity, the mass M ⋆ of the host star, the period, the velocity amplitude 6 , the longitude of periastron ω, the calculated ˙ ω GR and finally a flag that is 1 if the planet is transiting its host star and 0 otherwise. The condition on e is in order to consider only systems where GR effects can be constrained with sufficient confidence. Additionally, we restrict ourselves to stars which have evidence currently for a single exoplanet in order to avoid the complications arising from the precession of ω induced by other planets (see below) <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . We have added to the exoplanets listed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. (2006)</ref> the recently discovered XO-3b (Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krull et al. 2008)</ref>, which has the largest predicted ˙ ω GR of all exoplanets listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, seven systems have ˙ ω GR &gt; 1 • /century, with 3 of them being transiting systems. In timescales of a few tens of years, the longitude of periastron of the systems is expected to shift in these systems by δω 0.5 • , a change that, as we will show below, may produce detectable effects. GR effects are not the only mechanisms that can cause a shift in ω though, so we now turn our attention to additional mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stellar Quadrupole, Tides and Additional Planets</head><p>Besides the GR precession discussed above, ω can precess due to the presence of additional effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miralda-Escudé (2002)</ref> discussed the observability, using the duration of transits and the period between transits, of changes in ω caused by a stellar quadrupole moment and perturbations from other planets. These effects, some of which were discussed using more accurate calculations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref>, may additionally cause a precession of the orbital plane. Additionally, tidal deformations induced on the star and the planet can also produce a secular change on ω, an effect not considered in the studies mentioned above. The effect of apsidal motions induced by tidal deformations is a well known effect in eclipsing binaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sterne 1939;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Quataert et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smeyers &amp; Willems 2001)</ref>, and was included in <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The magnitude of all the effects discussed in what follows where ˙ ω GR would manifest itself are increasing functions of e. Systems with low e are therefore not relevant from the point of view of detecting GR effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref> presents in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> an estimate of ˙ ω GR for all systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. (2006)</ref> and note the four systems with higher values. None of those are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> because they all have e &lt; 0.03.</p><p>6 This is often referred to as the semi-amplitude in the exoplanet literature. We choose to use simply amplitude in this paper in order to agree with the widespread usage in the physical sciences for the multiplicative factor in a simple harmonic oscillator. <ref type="bibr">7 Adams &amp; Laughlin (2006a,b</ref>) studied the effects of secular interactions in multiple-planet systems including the effects of GR. They show that GR can have significant effects on secular perturbations for systems with favorable characteristics. the analysis of the planetary system around HD 83443 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wu &amp; Goldreich (2002)</ref>. Tidal deformations can produce a significant amount of precession in close-in exoplanets and should therefore be taken into account.</p><p>The precession caused by a stellar quadrupole moment is given to second order in e and first order in (R * /a) 2 by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">˙ ω quad ≈ 3J 2 R 2 ⋆ 2a 2 n,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where J 2 is the quadrupole moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Murray &amp; Dermott 1999</ref>).

We will therefore assume in what follows that ˙ ω quad is always negligible in comparison with ˙ ω GR . The tidal deformations induced on the star and the planet by each other will lead to a change in the longitude of periastron which is given, under the approximation that the objects can instantaneously adjust their equilibrium shapes to the tidal force and considering up to second order harmonic distortions, by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">˙ ω tide ≈ 15f (e) a 5 k 2,s M p R 5 ⋆ M ⋆ + k 2,p M ⋆ R 5 p M p n,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f (e) ≡ (1 − e 2 ) −5 [1 + (3/2)e 2 + (1/8)e 4 ]</formula><p>, and k 2,s , k 2,p are the apsidal motion constants for the star and planet respectively, which depend on the mass concentration of the tidally deformed bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sterne 1939</ref>). For stars we expect k 2,s 0.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Claret &amp; Gimenez 1992)</ref>, while for giant planets we expect k 2,p ≈ 0.25 if we assume that their structure can be roughly described by a polytrope of index n ≈ 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hubbard 1984)</ref>. For the extreme case of a sphere of uniform mass density, the apsidal motion constant takes the value k 2 = 0.75 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smeyers &amp; Willems 2001)</ref>. We see from Equation 5 that for close-in hot Jupiters the term containing k 2,p will dominate, and that the effect of tides on ω increases very rapidly with decreasing a. In units of degree/century equation 5 gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">˙ ω tide ≈ 1.6f (e)T P day −1 k 2,p 0.1 a 0.05AU −5 R p R J 5 M J M p M ⋆ M ⊙ [ • /century],<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where we have introduced</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T ≡ 1 + (R ⋆ /R p ) 5 (M p /M ⋆ ) 2 (k 2,s /k 2,p )</formula><p>, which is ≈ 1 for the case of a close-in Jupiter.</p><p>Assuming that k 2,p ∼ 0.1, e 0.5, M p ∼ M J , M ⋆ ∼ M ⊙ , R ⋆ ∼ R ⊙ and R p ∼ R J it follows that ˙ ω tide is of comparable magnitude as ˙ ω GR . The precession of the periastra caused by a second planet, which we dub a "perturber", is given to first order in e and lowest order in (a/a 2 ) by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˙ ω perturber ≈ 3M 2 a 3 4M ⋆ a 3 2 n<label>(7)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Murray &amp; Dermott 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miralda-Escudé 2002)</ref>, where M 2 is the mass of the second planet and a 2 the semi-major axis of its orbit. In terms of deg/century this expression reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">˙ ω perturber ≈ 29.6 P day −1 a a 2 3 M ⋆ M ⊙ −1 M 2 M ⊕ [ • /century].<label>(8)</label></formula><p>For a perturber with a 2 = 2a and and a mass similar to Earth orbiting a solar-mass star, we get that ˙ ω perturber ∼ 3 × 10 −7 n or ˙ ω perturber ∼ 0.7 deg/century for a P = 5 days planet. This is comparable to the precession expected from GR and therefore any detected precession of the longitude of periastron will be that of GR plus the possible addition of any perturber planet present in the system and the effects of tidal deformations (and generally a negligible contribution from the stellar quadrupole).</p><p>In what follows we will discuss the observability of changes in ω using radial velocity and transit observations. As just shown, any precession is expected to arise by GR, the effect of additional planets or tidal deformations. The discussion that follows addresses the detectability of changes in ω independent of their origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">OBSERVABILITY OF PERIASTRA PRECESSION IN EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS</head><p>3.1. Radial Velocities The radial velocity of a star including the reflex motion due to a planetary component is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">v r (t) = v 0 + K[cos(ω + f (t − t 0 )) + e cos(ω)],<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where v 0 is the systemic velocity, t 0 the time coordinate zeropoint, f the true anomaly and K is the velocity amplitude which is related to the orbital elements and the masses by where i is the orbit inclination. Fitting for the observed radial velocities of a star will give then direct estimates of v 0 , t 0 , K, e, P and ω.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">K = 2πG P 1/3 M p sin i M tot ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Our aim in this section is to determine if ω can be constrained tightly enough in timescales of tens of years or less in order to detect changes in ω of the magnitude produced by GR in those time-spans. In order to do this we have simulated data and then fit it with a model of the form given by equation 9 a total of 1000 times. We then recover the best-fit values of ω in all simulations and use that to estimate the probability distribution φ(ω) expected under given assumptions.</p><p>The systemic velocity v 0 and t 0 are just zero-points that we set to 0 in all our simulations, where we also set the time units such that P = 1 (note though that we do fit for all these quantities so that their effect on the fit propagates to the uncertainties of ω). By trying several values of ω we have verified that the probability distributions recovered do not depend strongly on the particular value of ω, which we therefore fix for all simulations at an arbitrary value ω 0 = 135 • . This leaves us with just two parameters to vary, namely e and K.</p><p>Given e and K we generate N obs data-points with times t i uniformly distributed 8 within a period and then we add to each time a random number of periods between 0 and 20. For transiting exoplanets the observations would have to be taken uniformly in time intervals excluding the transit. We then get the observed radial velocity from equation 9 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">v r (t i ) = K[cos(ω 0 + f (t i )) + e cos(ω 0 )] + G(0, σ tot ) (11)</formula><p>where G(0, σ tot ) is a random Gaussian deviate with mean 0 and standard deviation σ tot . The latter quantity is obtained as σ 2 tot = σ 2 obs + σ 2 jitter , where σ obs is the random uncertainty for each measurement and σ jitter is the noise arising from stellar jitter. Given the form of equation 9 a Fisher matrix analysis implies that the uncertainty in the longitude of periastron, σ ω satisfies the following scaling</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">σ ω ∝ N −1/2 obs σ tot K −1 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This scaling allows us to perform a set of fiducial simulations for several values of e and use the results to scale to parameters relevant to a given situation of interest. We note that the simulations we performed verify that the scaling inferred from a Fisher matrix analysis is accurate. In order to measure the longitude of periastron ω with a reasonable degree of certainty the system clearly needs to have a significant amount of eccentricity. We restrict ourselves to systems with e ≥ 0.1 and we simulate systems with e = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6.</p><p>For σ obs we assume a typical high-precision measurement with σ obs = 2 m sec −1 . For the stellar jitter, we perform our fiducial simulations for a typical jitter of σ jitter = 4 m sec −1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wright 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. 2006</ref>). The limitations imposed by active stars and/or different precision on the radial velocity measurements on the recovery of ˙ ω GR can be explored by using the scaling of σ ω with higher assumed values of σ jitter and/or σ obs . Even though Equation 12 renders multiple values of K redundant, we choose to present results for two values of K for illustrative purposes, namely K = 100 m sec −1 and K = 1000 m sec −1 . The former corresponds roughly to Jupiter-mass exoplanets and is fairly representative of currently known systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. 2006</ref>) 9 , while the latter corresponds to super-massive planets which as we will see are the class of systems which would allow the detection of ˙ ω GR with radial velocities. Finally, we do our fiducial simulations for N obs = 100, a value not atypical for well-sampled radial velocity curves available today.</p><p>The results of the simulations are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. From left to right, the columns in this Table record the assumed radial velocity amplitude K, the system eccentricity e, the expected uncertainty in the longitude of periastron σ ω for the simulated system, and finally α 20 , which we define to be the value of ˙ ω that would be necessary in order to achieve a 3σ detection in the simulated systems in a time-span of 20 years when measuring ω in two epochs, each having N obs observations. We note that we have performed Shapiro-Wilk normality tests in the recovered ω distributions. We found that all of them are consistent with normality and thus we are justified in using the dispersion σ w to derive confidence levels.</p><p>As an example, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> the distributions of recovered ω for the case with N obs = 100, K = 1000 m sec −1 and σ j = 4 m sec −1 for eccentricities e = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5. In the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> we show the radial velocity curve for a system with K = 1000 m sec −1 , e = 0.5 and ω = 135 • , while in the lower panel we show the difference between that curve and a radial velocity curve having ω = 136 • . The simulations presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> show that this difference can be detected at the 10-σ level (σ ω ∼ 0.1 • ) when using N obs = 100 observations, each having an uncertainty of ∼ 2 m sec −1 . The high level of significance can be achieved in this case thanks to the assumed low-level of jitter and the super-massive nature of a system with that semi-velocity amplitude.</p><p>In order to validate our simulations against uncertainty estimates obtained with real data, we have run a simulation with N obs = 20, e = 0.517, K = 1011 m sec −1 , ω = 179.3 • and σ j = 60 m sec −1 . These observational conditions and orbital parameters are appropriate for the observations of HAT-P-2 b reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref>. Our simulations for this case return σ w = 3.8 • , while <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> report ω HAT−P−2b = 179.3 ± 3.6 • , in very good agreement with our estimate. We conclude that our simulations return realistic estimates of the uncertainties in ω.</p><p>The simulations presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> show that in some cases the precession of periastron detectable in 20 years, α 20 , is comparable to the values ˙ ω GR of currently known systems listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. For close-in, eccentric, super-massive planets (K ∼ 1000 m sec −1 ) about 100 observations per epoch are sufficient, while for Jupiter-mass exoplanets (K ∼ 100 m sec −1 ) an unrealistically large number of radial velocity observations, N obs = 10000 per epoch, would be needed. Therefore, observations of different epochs of radial velocities with a time-span of ∼ 20 years would detect the variations in the precession of exoplanet periastra induced by GR in some currently known super-masive systems. The estimates above assume a typical level of stellar jitter. For active stars the number of observations have to be increased in proportion to the dispersion characterizing the jitter (see Equation 12). Stellar activity is therefore an important limitation to detect changes in ω using radial velocities. All in all, radial velocity studies of exoplanets will be generally able to ignore the effects of GR precession as they will usually be well below a detectable level.</p><p>We note in closing that <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miralda-Escudé (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref> consider using radial velocities and transit timing observations in order to measure the small difference between the period observed in the radial velocities and the period between primary transits. Both works conclude that this is not a competitive method and so we will not consider it further here and refer the reader to those works for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Duration of Transits</head><p>As the planetary orbit acquires a significant eccentricity e, the duration of the primary and secondary transits are no longer equal and acquire a dependence on the longitude of periastron of the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Time Between Primary and Secondary Transit</head><p>In the case where the exoplanet is transiting it may be possible to observe not only the primary transit, i.e. the transit where the exoplanet obscures the host star, but also the occultation, when the host star blocks thermal emission and reflected light from the exoplanet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref>). If the time of the primary eclipse is given by t 1 and that of the secondary by t 2 , the time difference between the two as compared to half a period P , ∆t ≡ t 2 − t 1 − 0.5P , depends mostly on the eccentricity e and the angle of periastron ω. Indeed, an accurate expression that neglects terms proportional to cot 2 i where i is the inclination angle and is therefore exact for central transits, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">∆t = P π e cos(ω) √ 1 − e 2 (1 − (e sin ω) 2 ) + arctan e cos ω √ 1 − e 2<label>(18)</label></formula><p>(Sterne 1940). Combined with radial velocities this time difference offers an additional constrain on e and ω, and in principle a measurement of ∆t combined with a measurement of the difference in the duration of the secondary and primary eclipses can be used to solve for e and ω directly (see discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref>). We note that Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007, their §4.2) also consider secondary transit timings as a means to measure changes in ω. While their discussion is based on first order expansions in e instead of using the exact expression above and is phrased in different terms, it is based ultimately on the same measurable quantity we discuss here. 13 Equation 18 does not include light travel time contributions, i.e. it neglects the time it takes for light to travel accross the system. This time is given for a central transit by</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">∆ t,LT = 2a(1 − e 2 ) c[1 − (e cos f t ) 2 ] ,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where f t is the true anomaly at the time of primary transit. In this section we will be interested in changes in ∆t due to changes in ω. It is easy to see from the expressions above that d∆ t,LT /dω ≪ d∆t/dω (ignoring the points where they are both zero). Therefore, changes in the time difference between primary and secondary transits will be dominated by changes in ∆t and we can safely ignore light travel time effects in what follows. The precession of periastra caused by GR will change ω systematically, while leaving e unchanged. Therefore ∆t has the potential of offering a direct measurement of changes in ω. We use Equation 18 to calculate (1/P )d∆t/dω as a function of ω. The result is shown in in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> for e = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, with higher e yielding larger extrema of |(1/P )d∆t/dω|. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The scaling N −3/2 follows from describing the central transit times as t i = t 0 + P i, with i = 1, . . . , Ntr and determining P using a χ 2 fit.

This difference can be expressed as ∆t 0 − ∆tπ ≈ −(d∆t/dω)δω, where ∆t is the quantity defined in Equation 18 and δω is the change in ω in one orbit. If ω ≈ π/2 or ≈ 3π/2, the changes ∆t in a system with P = 4 days for 0.2 degrees of precession would be large, on the order of 8 min for e ∼ 0.5. Published observations of secondary eclipses with Spitzer constrain t 2 to within ∼ 80 sec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Deming et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harrington et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>). Uncertainties in t 2 will dominate the uncertainty in ∆ t , so we assume σ ∆t ≈ σ t2 ∼ 80N −3/2 tr sec, where N tr is the number of secondary transits observed. Determing ∆t at two epochs separated by 10 years and observing N tr ∼ 1 at each epoch with a facility like Spitzer would detect the changes in ∆t due to GR with a significance 4σ in an eccentric system that precesses 0.2 deg in a decade if they have ω around π/2 or 3π/2. While Spitzer is now entering the end of its cryogenic lifetime, future facilities might be able to achieve similar precision. Moreover, as new suitable systems are discovered with very hot atmospheres (pM class planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fortney et al. 2007</ref>) observations of secondary transits might be feasible from the ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(López-Morales &amp; Seager 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we note that since f t = ±π/2 when ω = 0 or π, measuring the change in ∆t complements measurements of changes in primary transit duration D, in the sense that when one effect is not operating the other one generally is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ASSESSING THE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ˙</head><p>ω If a change in ω is detected using any of the methods described above it would be interesting to determine its likely cause. As mentioned in § 2, the contribution to ˙ ω from a second planet or tidal deformations can be of comparable magnitude to that caused by GR, making the origin of a potential detection of a change in ω unclear unless the presence of a perturber and the magnitude of tidal effects can be assessed. In this section we address three points. First, we discuss how may one assess if part of a detected change in ω comes from a perturber. Secondly, we show that the a terrestrial mass (M ⊕ M 10) perturber may be detectable through the induced secular changes in ω over the value expected from GR and tidal deformations by using transit and radial velocity observations. Finally, we assess the relative contributions of GR and tidal deformations for the case where perturbers do not contribute significantly to ˙ ω.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Constraining Potential</head><p>Contributions to ˙ ω from ˙ ω perturber . First, we note that using a precise radial velocity curve with N obs ∼ 100 we can probe the presence of companions with M 15M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Narayan et al. 2005</ref>). As shown in § 2, lower mass companions can still contribute significantly to ˙ ω, so it would be useful to have further information about possible companions in order to better interpret a measured ˙ ω. The presence of a second exoplanet in the system will not only cause secular changes in ω as discussed in § 2 (equation 7), but it may cause significant transit-time variations even for perturbers with masses comparable to the earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>). The transit-time variations will be on the order of seconds to minutes, depending on the orbital parameters and mass of the perturber. Constant monitoring of transiting exoplanets such as will be performed by Kepler will allow to identify systems that show significant transit time variations.</p><p>We note that the presence of a perturber will not only change ω but it may also affect other orbital elements such as the orbit inclination <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Miralda-Escudé 2002)</ref>. These small changes in inclination have indeed been proposed as a method of detecting terrestrial mass companions in near-grazing transit systems which are especially sensitive to them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ribas et al. 2008)</ref>. Following the formalism presented in §6 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Murray &amp; Dermott (1999)</ref> we expect that secular changes to e by a perturber satisfy |de/dt| (3/16)n(a/a 2 ) 3 (M 2 /M ⋆ )e 2 , where a 2 , e 2 and M 2 are the orbital semi-major axies, eccentricity and mass of the perturber respectively. For e 2 = 0.1, a 2 = 2a and M 2 = 3 × 10 −6 M ⋆ we have that de/dt 4 × 10 −6 yr −1 for a system with P = 4 days. This is too small for changes in e to be detected with radial velocities in scales of tens of years and so we conclude that secular changes in eccentricities induced by perturbers will in general not be useful to infer the presence of perturbers.</p><p>Summarizing, the best way to try to constrain contributions of ˙ ω perturber to a detected change in ω is to consider transiting systems posessing extensive photometric monitoring, allowing to probe the existence of transit time variations. For near-grazing systems, the same photometric monitoring would additionally allow to probe for small changes in i due to a perturber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Using Secular Variations in ω to Detect Terrestrial Mass Planets.</head><p>A very interesting possibility raised by the secular variation in ω induced by a "perturber" is to use these variations in order to infer the presence of terrestrial mass planets. This possibility was studied by Miralda-Escudé (2002) and then followed-up by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref>. Secular variations in ω, especially through their effect on transit durations ( § 3.2), can offer an interesting complement to transit time variations as a means of detecting terrestrial mass planets in the upcoming Kepler mission.</p><p>As we have seen in § 2, the precession due to GR and tidal deformations can be of comparable magnitude to that induced by a terrestrial mass perturber. It is germane to ask then to what extent will the uncertainty in the expected value of ˙ ω GR and ˙ ω tide limit the detectability of a perturber. We start by considering ˙ ω GR . The fractional uncertainty in ˙ ω GR is given by (σ( <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , where we have ignored correlations. The fractional uncertainty in P is generally negligible, while the other quantities can be typically of the order of a few percent. We will therefore assume that σ( ˙ ω GR )/ ˙ ω GR ∼ 10%. It follows that to detect an excess precession caused by a perturber we need at least that ˙ ω perturber − ˙ ω GR 0.3 ˙ ω GR . It is easy to see that if ˙ ω perturber ˙ ω GR and ˙ ω perturber is itself detectable, i.e. ˙ ω perturber &gt; 3σ ˙ ω , where σ ˙ ω is the uncertainty in the measured ˙ ω, then the uncertainty in the expected ˙ ω GR will not spoil the significance of the detection. Using the equations presented in § 2 we get that</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">˙ ω GR )/ ˙ ω GR ) 2 = (σ(M ⋆ )/M ⋆ ) 2 + (σ(a)/a) 2 + (σ(P )/P ) 2 + 4e 2 (σ(e)/(1 − e 2 ))</formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">˙ ω perturber ˙ ω GR = 3.8 (1 − e 2 ) M ⊙ M ⋆ 2 a a 2 3 a 0.05AU M 2 M ⊕ .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>It is clear from this expression that for typical values of M ⋆ ∼ M ⊙ , a ∼ 0.05 AU, e 0.5 there will be values of a 2 for which we have ˙ ω perturber &gt; ˙ ω GR and for which the uncertainty in the expected precession from GR will not be a limiting factor in detecting terrestrial mass perturbers.</p><p>We consider now ˙ ω tide .

As was the case above, the uncertainties in the variables can be typically a few percent and we therefore assume that σ( ˙ ω tide )/ ˙ ω tide ∼ 10%. Using the equations presented in § 2 we get that</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">˙ ω perturber ˙ ω tide = 1.85 T f (e)k 2,p M ⊙ M ⋆ 2 a a 2 3 a 0.05AU 5 R J R p 5 M p M J M 2 M ⊕ .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>In the case of ˙ ω tide we cannot measure the apsidal motion constant k 2 . As discussed in § 2, the value of k 2 for a giant planet is expected to be close to the extreme value of a uniform sphere, so we can conservatively assume k 2,p = 0.75, a value that maximizes the expected ˙ ω tide . For a close-in Jupiter we have T ≈ 1. Using these values and following the same reasoning as for ˙ ω GR , it is clear from the expression above that for typical values of M ⋆ ∼ M ⊙ , a ∼ 0.05 AU, e 0.5, R p ∼ R J , M p ∼ M J , there will be values of a 2 for which we have ˙ ω perturber &gt; ˙ ω tide and for which the uncertainty in the expected precession arising from tidal deformations will not be a limiting factor in detecting terrestrial mass perturbers. Note that due to the strong dependence on a, tides may become a limiting factor for very close-in systems.</p><p>We consider now the detectability of ˙ ω perturber with Kepler using the change in the transit duration D. As discussed in § 3.2, a 1-minute sampling of a Jupiter-mass system with Kepler for a P = 5 days planet orbiting a V = 12 solar-type star will achieve a precision of σ D ∼ 1.5 sec for a 0.15 days transit duration. We therefore set a change of 6 sec over 4 years to constitute a detectable δD for this system, which translates into a detectable ˙ ω of ˙  ω GR for the same eccentricity, while the dash-dot-dot line marks 0.3 ˙ ω tide . Finally, the dot-dashed line marks the lower values of ˙ ω that would be detectable with 100 radial velocities at each of two epochs separated by 5 years, for a perturber to a super-massive M 1 = 10M J primary planet orbiting an inactive solar-mass star (see text for more details).</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">ω detect = 6/(D∆t( ˙ ω −1 d ln D/dt)),</formula><p>Finally, we consider the detectability of ˙ ω perturber using radial velocities alone. We assume the primary planet is a super-massive system of M p = 10M J , with the rest of the star and orbital parameters as assumed above. The results of § 3.1 show that with 100 radial velocity observations at each epoch a precession of ∼ 8 deg/century could be detected (at 3σ) in 5 years if the system has e = 0.4 and orbits an inactive star. We mark the detectable level in this case with radial velocities as dot-dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>. From this Figure we can see that if enough observations are in hand, perturbing planets with masses ∼ 10M ⊕ may be detectable with radial velocities alone for the case of super-massive systems orbiting inactive stars. We conclude that measuring the precession of ω caused by a perturber above the value predicted by GR and tidal effects may lead to detection of additional planets with both transit and radial velocity observations (for transits, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miralda-Escudé (2002)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref>).

Note that there is a very strong dependence on a. For smaller values of a, a regime where the precession due to GR would offer better chances of being observable for eccentric systems, the contribution from tidal deformations may quickly become the dominant source of precession. The fact that the tidal contributions to the precession are expected to be generally significant limits the ability to directly extract the precession due to GR. The magnitude of the precession caused by tidal deformations is uncertain due to the need to know the planetary structure. Given that the expected precession due to GR is unambigous, in systems where the precession due to tidal deformations is expected to be dominant and detectable, we might be able to learn about the tidally driven precession of ω by subtracting the effects of GR from a measured ˙ ω.</p><p>5. ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC SUPER-MASSIVE SYSTEMS As illustration of the material discussed above, we analyze now in some detail two currently known systems that due to their large measured velocity amplitudes have the potential to have a measurable ˙ ω using all the techniques presented above: HAT-P-2 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Loeillet et al. 2008</ref>) and XO-3 b (Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krull et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>5.1. HAT-P-2 b HAT-P-2 b is an especially interesting system due to its very high eccentricity, high mass of ≈ 9M J and close orbit (a = 0.0677 AU) to its host star. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> its value of ˙ ω GR is ∼ 2 • /century, while the expected value of ˙ ω tide is ∼ 0.25 deg/century assuming k 2,p = 0.25. Unfortunately it has a high level of stellar jitter, with estimates ranging from 17 m sec −1 to 60 m sec −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Loeillet et al. 2008</ref>). So even though this system has K ∼ 1000 m sec −1 it would require an unrealistically large number of observations (∼ 10 4 ) per epoch in order to make its expected ˙ ω GR detectable with radial velocities. The value of ω derived for HAT-P-2 b is 1.05π and we therefore would not expect to see significant variations in the time between primary and secondary transits in case the secondary transit was observed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>). With ω = 1.05π the true anomaly at the time of transit will be f t ≈ 0.45π, or 1.55π. Given that the impact parameter is b ≈ 0 we get from Equation 15 that |d ln D/dt| ∼ 1.67 × 10 −2 century −1 . Using the fact that D = 0.15 days we expect then a change of ∼ 21 sec in D over 10 years due to GR. This difference could be readily detected with high precision photometric observations that determine D to within a few seconds such as is possible with HST. The observations currently available constrain D only to within ∼ 3 mins ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2007)</ref>, and so no first epoch suitable to measuring changes in D is yet in hand.</p></div>

Based on the spectral type F5V and v sin i = 18.5 ± 0.2 km sec −1 of XO-3 b (Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krull et al. 2008</ref>) we can expect it to have a rather high value of stellar jitter σ jitter 30 m sec −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Saar et al. 1998</ref>). Therefore, and just as is the case for HAT-P-2 b, we do not expect ˙ ω to be detectable with radial velocity observations due to the expected jitter.</p><p>The value of ω derived for XO-3 b is consistent with 0 and we therefore would not expect to see variations in the time between primary and secondary transits in case the secondary transit was observed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>). As ω ≈ 0, the true anomaly at the time of transit will be f t ≈ π/2 or 3π/2. Given that the impact parameter is b ≈ 0.8 we get from Equation 15 that |d ln D/dt| ∼ 3.56 × 10 −2 century −1 . Using the fact that D = 0.14 days we expect then a change of ∼ 43 sec in D over 10 years. Just as is the case for HAT-P-2 b, this could be detectable with determinations of D to within a few seconds and there is no suitable first epoch yet in hand.</p><p>6. CONCLUSIONS In this work we have studied the observability of the precession of periastra caused by general relativity in exoplanets. We additionally consider the precession caused by tidal deformations and planetary perturbers, which can produce a precession of comparable or greater magnitude. We consider radial velocities and transit light curve observations and conclude that for some methods precessions of the magnitude expected from GR will be detectable in timescales of ∼ 10 years or less for some close-in, eccentric systems. In more detail, we find that:</p><p>1. For transiting systems, precession of periastra of the magnitude expected from GR will manifest itself through detectable changes in the duration of primary transit ( §3.2) or through the change in the time between primary and secondary transits ( §3.4) in timescales of 10 years. The two methods are most effective at different values of the true anomaly. A determination of the primary transit duration time to ∼ a few seconds and that of the secondary to ∼ a minute will lead to measurable effects. The effects of GR and tidal deformations might need to be included in the analysis of Kepler data for eccentric, close-in systems. The transit duration of near-grazing systems will be particulary sensitive to changes in ω.</p><p>2. Radial velocity observations alone would be able to detect changes in the longitude of periastron of the magnitude expected from GR effects only for eccentric super-massive (K ∼ 1000 m sec −1 ) exoplanets orbiting close to a host star with a low-level of stellar jitter ( §3.1). For the detection to be statistically significant, on the order of 100 precise radial velocity observations are needed at each of two epochs separated by ∼ 20 years.</p><p>3. Measurements of the change over time of the period between primary transits is not currently a method that will lead to a detection of changes in ω of the magnitude expected from GR ( §3.3). Previous works have shown that measuring the small difference between the radial velocity period and that of transits are not sensitive enough to lead to detectable changes due to GR.</p><p>In order to contrast any detected change in the transit duration ( §3.2) or the time between primary and secondary ( §3.4) to the predictions of a given mechanism one needs to know the eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the systems, for which radial velocities are needed (although not necessarily of the precision required to directly detect changes in ω with them 14 ). Conversely, photometric monitoring of primary transits are useful in order to elucidate the nature of a detected change in ω by probing for the presence of transit time variations. The presence of the latter would imply that at least part of any observed changes in ω could have been produced by additional planetary companions ( §4).</p><p>Precession of periastra caused by planetary perturbers and the effects of tidal deformations can be of comparable magnitude to that caused by GR ( §2.2). The effects of tidal deformations on the precession of periastra in particular may be of the same magnitude or dominate the total ˙ ω in the regime where the GR effects are detectable ( §4.3). While this limits the ability to directly extract the precession due to GR given the uncertainty in the expected precession from tides, it might allow to study the tidally induced precession by considering the residual precession after subtracting the effects of GR. The latter possibility is particularly attractive in systems where the tidally induced precession may dominate the signal. We note that even without considering the confusing effects of tidal contributions to the precession, a measurement of ˙ ω GR as described in this work would not be competitive in terms of precision with binary pulsar studies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Will 2006</ref>, for a review ) and would therefore not offer new tests of GR.</p><p>The upcoming Kepler mission expects to find a large number of massive planets transiting close to their host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borucki et al. 2003</ref>), some of which will certainly have significant eccentricities. Furthermore, systems observed by Kepler will be extensively monitored for variations in their transiting time periods in order to search for terrestrialmass planets using transit-time variations. We have shown that modeling of the transit time durations and further characterization of close-in, eccentric systems might need to take into account the effects of GR and tidal deformations as they will become detectable on timescales comparable to the 4-year lifetime of the mission, and certainly on followup studies after the mission ends. We have also shown that planetary companions with super-Earth masses may be detectable by Kepler by the change in transit durations they induce ( § 4.2). Additionally, well sampled radial velocity curves spanning 5 years may also be able to detect companions with super-earth massses by measuring a change in ω over the expected GR value for the case of super-massive, close-in systems orbiting inactive stars ( § 4.2).</p><p>We would like to thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions and Dan Fabrycky and András Pál for useful discussions.
