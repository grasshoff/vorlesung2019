			<abstract>
				<p>The presence of certain elements within a star, and by extension its planet, strongly impacts the formation and evolution of the planetary system. The positive correlation between a host star&apos;s iron-content and the presence of an orbiting giant exoplanet has been confirmed (e.g. Valenti &amp; Fischer 2005). However, the importance of other elements in predicting giant planet occurrence is less certain despite their central role in shaping internal planetary structure. In order to understand the subtle, yet crucial way that non-iron elements may influence the formation of giant planets, we apply advances in data-driven research to the Hypatia Catalog (Hinkel et al. 2014) of stellar abundances. We designed a machine learning algorithm to analyze stellar abundance patterns of known host stars, similar to how online streaming services use viewer history to recommend movies, to determine those elements important in identifying potential giant exoplanet host stars. We analyzed a variety of scenarios involving different groups of elements, namely volatiles (C, O), lithophiles (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y), siderophiles (Cr, Co, Ni), and Fe. Here we show that oxygen, carbon, and sodium, besides iron, are influential indicators of a giant planet and we present a list of ∼350 stars that have a ≥90% probability of hosting a giant exoplanet. We anticipate that our findings will revolutionize the determination of interior structure models for both giant and terrestrial planets. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how this planet-finding algorithm can be used to guide future target lists, such as the TESS, CHEOPS, JWST, and WFIRST missions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gonzalez (1997)</ref>, it was reported that four stars with orbiting giant planets were enriched in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. Since that time, there have been many studies that confirmed that stars with super-solar iron ratios are more likely to host giant planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Laws et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bond et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gilli et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sousa et al. 2011</ref>). This trend has been called the "planet-metallicity correlation," as popularized by . However, in all of these studies, the <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> ratio has been used as a proxy for the star's overall metallicity, or the abundance of elements heavier than H or He. In other words, it has been assumed that the abundance of other elements are consistent with the trends found in Fe relative to H.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> is the most commonly measured elemental abundance, a variety of different literature sources measured non-Fe elements within giant planet-hosting stars. These elemental ratios were not found to follow follow the <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> trend, and were not consistent between studies. For example, α-element enrichment was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuhrmann &amp; Bernkopf (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adibekyan et al. (2012)</ref> for giant planet host stars, however, <ref type="bibr">Mishen- ina et al. (2016)</ref> found only an overabundance only in Al. Indeed, while some groups find that there is possible enrichment in certain elements (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gilli et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robinson et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bond et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brugamyer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adibekyan et al. 2012</ref>), many find that abundances in stars with planets are similar to stars without detected planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Takeda et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Neves et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Delgado Mena et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hogg et al. (2016)</ref> noted that accurate measurements from a variety of elements were important to decipher unique chemical signature between stars while <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hinkel &amp; Unterborn (2018)</ref> argued a similar point but with respect to determining planetary interior structure. Therefore, we find there is a need to uncover more subtle correlations, that were perhaps hidden from less statistically advanced methods, within stellar abundance data as it relates to planet occurrence.</p><p>For this study, we draw upon machine learning techniques (described in Section 3) to formulate a method to predict which stars in the solar neighborhood are likely to host to-date undetected giant exoplanets. Part of the problem in planetary detection is that there is inherent observation bias (e.g. towards more massive or larger planets) that cannot be overcome at this time. All of the current detection techniques, namely microlensing, radial velocity, transit, and imaging, have detection thresholds that only allow a planet to be excluded down to some limit. While some of the main results from Kepler have shown that planets are nearly ubiquitous and that multi-planet systems may be fairly common <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013)</ref>, these results are dependent on a relatively small number of observations. Therefore, in order to transform and broaden target selection for exoplanet surveys, it is possible to establish the chemical interplay between planet formation and the composition of the host star. In this way, the field need not rely on large, all-sky surveys in order to determine candidate giant exoplanet host stars-instead only a single high-resolution spectrum would be needed to determine probable nearby giant exoplanet hosts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mack et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In this paper we will use the Hypatia Catalog of stellar abundances in order to sample a large set of abundances for stars that do and do not host giant exoplanets. We produce a target list of probable giant planet hosting stars using a variety of element ensembles. In Section 2 we discuss the Hypatia Catalog and how stars were selected. In Section 3, we describe the recommendation algorithm that we employed and the ensembles of elements that we utilized. In Section 4 we discuss the results of the algorithm, especially when using different ensembles of elements. We give a list of stars that are likely to host giant exoplanets based on our algorithm in Section 5. And, finally, we discuss our results in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SAMPLE SELECTION</head><p>The Hypatia Catalog is a database of amalgamate stellar abundance data that currently spans 72 unique elements and species in ∼6000 stars within 150 pc of the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hinkel et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hinkel et al. , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hinkel et al. , 2017</ref>), shown 4 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Hypatia is composed of FKG-type stars, which are ideal for understanding the solar neighborhood, since they are numerous and intrinsically bright <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Freeman &amp; Bland- Hawthorn 2002)</ref>. Hypatia was compiled from +150 literature source abundance measurements that were renormalized to the same solar scale, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lodders et al. (2009)</ref>, so that all values were on a common baseline. In those instances where multiple groups measure the same element within the same star, the median value of those measurements was utilized. The Hypatia Catalog was specifically chosen as the sample for this study because it offers both the breadth (number of stars) and depth (number of elements) required by data-driven techniques.</p><p>In order to focus on stars that have similar compositional trends, we removed all Hypatia stars that likely originated from the thick disk or halo using the kinematic prescription in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bensby et al. (2003)</ref>. Additionally, we require a sample as large as possible that is also densely populated, i.e. with few null or "missing" measurements (discussed more in Section 4.2). Therefore, we included only those <ref type="bibr">[X/H]</ref> elements that were often measured in nearby stars, or within &gt;50% of the total stellar sample, as demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Note that the total number of stars with Zn measurements was &lt;50% once probable thick disk stars were removed; also, we chose to use Sc as opposed to Sc II for simplicity within the model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hinkel et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Within the final sample, 319 stars are known to host giant exoplanets per the NASA Exoplanet Archive 5 . To better understand our biases with respect to planet detection, we found that 1 planet was discovered by direct imaging, 2 planets via the transit method, and the remainder were observed via radial velocity. Therefore, we removed those stars (and planets) that were discovered by any method that wasn't radial velocity. In this way, our total dataset consists of +4200 main sequence stars not known to host planets, 316 confirmed giant exoplanet host stars discovered via the radial velocity method, dis-4 All data can be found online at www.hypatiacatalog.com. 5 https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/ cussed more in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM</head><p>Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field, combining elements from statistics, computer science, and pure mathematics, with the aim of extracting meaningful information from existing empirical observations. A "supervised classifier" concerns itself with the derivation of a generalized relationship that maps existing data (input "features") in order to make predictions on new observations (output "targets"). Here we use decision trees to split a larger set into smaller subsets based on the similarity of properties, in this case whether a star is likely to host a planet or not likely. We use an ensemble of trees, or "gradient boosted trees," to build a series (as opposed to parallel) set of trees. The trees are trained such that they are able to correct the mistakes of the previous tree in the series, thereby creating a more powerful model for classification.</p><p>An excellent example of a supervised classifier is the movie prediction algorithm used by an online streaming service (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Netflix 6</ref> ). Namely, after watching a variety of movies (or "features") on the service, and rating them as liked or disliked (the "decision tree"), the software is "trained" to determine the overall relationship between those movies that you like, i.e. they are goofy 90's comedies. It then takes that relationship and searches within its back catalog to find movies that are similar (or "targets"). Finally, it makes suggestions that the viewer watch movies that are analogous to goofy 90s comedies, with a certain percentage likelihood that they match the overall trend. The decision trees are then improved upon when you watch the recommended movies, thereby building off of (or "boosting") the previous training models.</p><p>We examine the stellar abundances between stars with and without detected giant planets using the XGBoost (or Extreme Gradient Boosting) supervised classifier per <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen &amp; Guestrin (2016)</ref>. As mentioned in Section 2, there are 316 planet hosting stars and +4200 stars not currently known to host either giant or terrestrial planets. Because of the disparity in size between the two populations, we take a random sub-sample of 200 stars from both sets. Then, we train the algorithm to determine the stellar abundance trends for the subset of stars with confirmed giant planets and apply that trend to the subset of stars not known to host planets. The algorithm then classifies those stars without detected planets as either likely to host a giant planet ("1") or unlikely to host a giant planet ("0"). This process is run for 3000 iterations, choosing a new sub-sample of 200 stars during each iteration, or until our model scores no longer changed per iteration of reshuffling. In this way, we are able to produce an overall probability percentage that a star not currently known to have a planet is predicted to host a giant exoplanet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Code Availability</head><p>All Python code needed to reproduce the analyses and results is given in the following repository: https:// github.com/nhinkel/planetPrediction.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-Number of stars in the Hypatia Catalog that have measurements for each element along the x-axis. The total number of stars in Hypatia is 5986, or the number of iron measurements since <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> is a requirement to be included in Hypatia. In order to utilize as complete a sample as possible for this study, we analyzed only those elements that were measured within &gt;50% of the Hypatia stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Ensembles of Elements</head><p>A benefit of employing a machine learning algorithm is that it enables us to examine elements within ensembles, instead of on an individual basis. We find that this method of investigation is more meaningful in the context of stars that host planets, since a number of chemical factors must be taken into account during planet formation. Additionally, given the variety of elements within the Hypatia Catalog, we not only wanted to examine a variety of elements, but also how those elements were influenced by the presence (or lack thereof) of Fe as a predicting feature. Therefore, we tested our algorithm using a variety of element combinations, where the total number of elements is given in parenthesis at the end of each list: Our elements were grouped by the geological Goldschmidt classification (Goldschmidt 1937) according to their preferred host phases, namely volatiles (Vol: C and O), lithophiles that combine to form oxide minerals characteristic of mantle and crustal rocks (Litho: Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y), and siderophiles that for Earth-like conditions alloy with iron and present in planetary cores (Sidero: Cr, Co, Ni). Despite Fe being a siderophile, we include or disclude it individually within the ensembles. And while these classifications are generally used for rocky planets, they are important to giant planets as well. The volatile elements are the most abundant by mole in the protoplanetary disk, followed by the lithophile elements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lodders et al. 2009</ref>). Before a giant planet can begin accreting volatile species, it must form a large rock and iron "core" containing the lithophile elements and Fe. We will describe how these different elemental ensembles influenced the models within the algorithm in Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS FROM THE ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we describe the results of the algorithm in a top-down approach. We will first discuss verification of the algorithm via confusion matrices and the golden set probabilities. We will then relate the varying results when using different ensembles of elements. Finally, we offer a closer examination of the Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe ensemble, which utilized the most number of elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Algorithm Verification</head><p>Since we know which stars have been observed to host giant planets, we can determine a confusion or error matrix in order to gauge the performance of our supervised classifier. A confusion matrix allows us to quantify the instances of true positives (when the model states that a star has a planet when it does have a planet) and false negatives (when a star is not predicted to host a planet but it does have a planet). The most striking score for our model is the true positive rate, or when our model correctly predicted the existence of a giant exoplanet, which was +90% of the time for all runs, regardless of the element ensemble. To ensure that we weren't inadvertently biasing our data, we ran the algorithm using a training set where the known and unknown planet host stars were mixed together. This process allowed us to check that when we put in "noise," we got out "noise."</p><p>The resulting confusion matrix gave a 50%/50% score for both the true positive and false negative case, meaning that it could not associate between the two groups -as expected.</p><p>The false positive rate, namely where a giant exoplanet is predicted but the presence of one has been observationally excluded, cannot be adequately determined from our analysis. The issue is that while we have star systems with detected or confirmed exoplanets, it is not possible to confirm a null-detection. In other words, we do not know if stars without detected planets are due to physical or chemical reasons or because of observational and/or technological biases. Therefore, in order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the accuracy of our algorithm that was separate from the confusion matrix, we created a "golden set" of data that was not trained upon, such that it could be predicted upon. In other words, we instructed the algorithm to choose 10 random exoplanet host stars, the "golden set," and hide them within the sample of target stars not known to host planets. We then allowed the algorithm to predict whether the golden set stars were likely to host planets, knowing that they have currently confirmed giant planets. In this way, we are able to test the prediction model to see whether it was able to positively identify stars that we know have planets, thereby testing the "true positives" without biasing the model. We made use of the "golden sets" when analyzing each of the elemental ensembles, as an additional means to determine if specific element groupings influence the algorithm in different ways. For each ensemble, we determined the average prediction likelihood of the known giant exoplanet host stars, as well as the fraction of the "golden set" that had a probability of hosting a planet which was greater than 90%:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Lithophiles + Siderophile:</formula><p>Golden Set: Average = 74%, Above 90% = 43%</p><p>Lithophiles + Siderophile + Fe: Golden Set: Average = 73%, Above 90% = 49%</p><p>Volatiles + Lithophiles + Fe: Golden Set: Average = 76%, Above 90% = 58%</p><p>Volatiles + Lithophiles + Siderophile: Golden Set: Average = 77%, Above 90% = 53%</p><p>Volatiles + Lithophiles + Siderophile + Fe: Golden Set: Average = 75%, Above 90% = 54%</p><p>Overall, we find that the algorithm gives a ∼75% prediction score to known giant exoplanet hosts, with little variation between the ensembles. To continue with the movie metaphors, this is similar to the scores for the movie and television recommendation website "Rotten Tomatoes" 7 . Namely, if the percentage score is high, it is likely that the star hosts a giant planet (or that the movie is good), but a low score does not rule out that a star may host a yet undetected giant planet (since sometimes critically "bad" movies can be good). As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tamayo et al. (2016)</ref>, there is a threshold probability which balances the usefulness of the results (precision) with respect to the completeness of the results (recall or sensitivity). In other words, if the detection threshold is too low the contamination fraction will be significant, but if the threshold is too high many true positives will be missed. Given our models' significant true positive fraction for all ensembles, we choose to adopt a conservative threshold of 90%. In this way, we are able to increase the likelihood that a star from our target list with a probability above this value will actually have a yet-undetected giant planet, to be observationally confirmed at a later date. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> www.rottentomatoes.com/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Variation Between Ensembles</head><p>When beginning with a large dataset, the features of the data can be described as being somewhat random. For example, the Gaia dataset has RA, Dec, parallax, and proper motions for millions of stars (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016), but these stars have a huge variety of stellar types, ages, rotations, etc. that make them different from one another. Because of these different properties, the dataset can be considered to have high entropy. It is by splitting the larger dataset into smaller ones, with similar properties, that the overall entropy can be lowered until you have groupings of like-stars. The usefulness of a property, or feature, in making a decision (for example, proper motion would be more useful than parallax in determining whether a star originated from the thin or thick disk) is indicated by its feature importance score. The more a feature is used to make pivotal choices within the decision tree that ultimately lower the entropy, the higher its importance score.</p><p>For this paper, the important features are those elements that are influential in splitting the overall sample into stars likely to host a giant exoplanet or not. As mentioned in Section 3.2, we examine multiple ensembles of elements in order to better understand the overall correlation of their presence on each other and on their decisions. With that in mind, we have two caveats when determining the feature importance scores: (1) When present, Fe must have a high feature importance score -since its influence on giant planet detections has been consistently seen in observations; and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The presence of a null element abundance measurement for a star should not impact the decision tree. While the latter point seems obvious, the assumption within XGBoost is that the decision goes in the "default" direction, in this case, towards the population of stars predicted to host a giant exoplanet. It was therefore necessary to include a weighting function which would remove the impact of the null values on the feature importance score without overcorrecting the problem. This was done by testing the weighting function on more complete datasets (i.e. with fewer elements that were more commonly measured in nearby stars) and slowly including less populated data (i.e. less frequently measured elements) until we saw noticeable change in the behavior of the output which signified an overcorrection. 8 . Finally, the features were normalized such that the highest feature always had a score of 1.0.</p><p>The weighted feature importance scores for the five ensembles are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, where the titles at the top of each subfigure indicate the ensemble being represented. Error bars are given on the right edge of each bar in the horizontal histograms, which were calculated by taking the standard error of the mean. Moving from those ensembles with the most number of elements to the fewest (namely, from bottom to top of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref>, we see that, when present, the volatile elements C and O along with Fe are ranked as the most important features for determining whether a star is likely to host a giant planet. When the volatile elements are not within the ensemble (the two top subfigures), Na is the most important fea-ture. Additionally, Na is consistently clustered near the top of the ranked features when C and O are present. The only instance where Na is not ranked directly below C, O, and Fe (when present) is during the Vol+Litho+Sidero ensemble, when it is supplanted by both Mg and Mn. To a lesser extent, Al and Mg are typically ranked at a medium to medium-high importance, although, their variation in importance between ensembles precludes a clear interpretation of their overall impact.</p><p>Given the variation in order of C, O, and Fe as the most important features within the latter three ensembles, we wanted to better understand their relationship and influence on one another. Therefore, we ran the algorithm using only those three elements within the ensemble. The resulting feature importance scores yielded Fe as definitively more important (maximum score = 1.0) while C had a weighted score of 0.53 and O had a score of 0.39. This implies that the presence of the other elements within the ensembles (e.g. the lithophiles and siderophiles) had an impact on how the decision tree behaved with respect to both C and O. However, we also see a significant overlap of stars with a high probability (≥90%) between both the Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe and Vol+Litho+Sidero ensembles (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, discussed in Section 5). We interpret this to mean that, while the exact ordering of C, O, and Fe may be influenced by other elements, the three elements (as well as Na) are notably significant in predicting whether a star is likely to host a giant planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Closer Examination of Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe</head><p>We focus now on exploring the specific results produced after running the prediction algorithm for a single ensemble of elements, namely, the Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe ensemble which contained all of the elements utilized in this paper. Having shown the weighted feature importance score for this ensemble at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, we have also plotted the individual [X/H] vs [Fe/H] plots for all elements as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 3 and 4</ref>. In each subplot, we show the training sample of the 316 known planet host stars in purple. The target sample of the +4200 stars not known to host planets are broken into two groups: those stars with a ≥90% probability of hosting a giant planet in black and stars with a less likely probability (&lt;90%) of hosting a giant planet in orange (see Section 5 for more discussion). Each of the scatter plots has a corresponding [X/H] relative frequency histogram located on the right, while the [Fe/H] histogram (which is the same for all scatter plots) is seen at the top of both columns in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 3 and 4</ref>. The bins of all histograms have a width of 0.1 dex.</p><p>When analyzing the scatter plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 3 and 4</ref>, it is not our intention to imply that planet-and predictedplanet-hosting stars are all enriched with respect to these elements. Instead, our purpose is to compare the overall distributions of the stellar populations, especially between the known and predicted planet host stars. We see that the known and predicted planet host stars (purple and black, respectively) lie within the same region of parameter space for all of the elements within this ensemble, to within typical, respective error for each element ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hinkel et al. 2014</ref>). The strong overlap offers a visual confirmation that the trends in stars predicted to host planets match the trends of stars known to host giant planets, even when analyzed on an element-by-element basis. The same cannot be said when comparing the stars less likely to host a planet (orange) to the other two populations. In terms of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> content, the stars without a high (≥90%) probability of hosting a planet have, in general, a lower [Fe/H] content than stars known or predicted to host giant exoplanets -a variation which is greater than the typical ±0.05 dex error for <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> as confirmed in literature. We also see a strong variation between the less likely to host population and the known/predicted planet hosts when looking at [C/H], <ref type="bibr">[Sc/H]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[Ni/H]</ref>. For C, the differences were important in deciding which stars were likely to host giant exoplanets, as discussed in Section 4.2. However, for Sc and Ni the dispersions between the populations may have made some difference in determining which stars were predicted to host planets, although the two elements were often in the lower half of the feature importance scores, see particularly Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe. Additionally, there is a somewhat bimodal trend in [Co/H] between the stars known to host planets and the stars predicted to have planets, which likely resulted in its having the lowest or second lowest (for Vol+Litho+Sidero+Fe) feature importance score in every instance where it was included within the ensemble (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>In </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">PREDICTING POTENTIAL GIANT EXOPLANET HOSTS</head><p>As a result of our recommendation algorithm to predict stars that are likely to host giant planets, we have compiled a table of the +4200 target stars which were predicted upon, a stub of which is located in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> (the full version can be found via the online journal or Vizier). We have included all of the prediction probabilities determined by each of the five ensembles we tested, such that the number of times each star was sampled (Samp), positively predicted to host a giant planet (Pred), and the overall probability (Samp/Pred) is given in the table. The table is ordered and sorted with preference towards those ensembles which contained a higher number of elements, since the results of the ensembles with fewer  elements were mirrored in those with more features (per <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref>. Additionally, we have included the RA/Dec, spectral type, and V magnitude in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> in anticipation of potential future observations to detect giant exoplanets orbiting these stars.</p><p>We note that we have removed ∼30 stars that were deemed unlikely to host giant planets per the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fischer et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard &amp; Fulton (2016)</ref> on the Lick and Keck Planet Searches. While the current limits of giant planet detectability can be best described as a gradient (rather than a binary, since it could be argued that giant planets on a wide orbit have not been ruled out), we recognize that their work is a significant step towards actual "true negatives." <ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</p><p>Since there is a tendency for smaller stars to not host giant planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al. 2010)</ref>, we look at the spectral type distribution for the stars with a high probability (≥90%) of hosting a giant planet. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We found that 37 stars (10%) were F-types, where 1 was a giant and 5 were subgiants. A total of 225 stars (62%) were G-types, such that 9 were giants and 37 were subgiants. The remaining 104 stars (28%) were K-types, where 46 were giants and 13 were subgiants. As a comparison, the full sample of target stars contained 22% F-types, 50% are going to have similar detectability biases toward the radial velocity methods. The elements that were used as features for the model are elements that are often measured within stars because they have a relatively large number of clean, unblended lines in the optical band. Consequently, there may be "interdisciplinary elements," such as S for giant exoplanets (P and K for rocky planets), that are important to the formation and evolution of planets but have been overlooked because they are difficult to measure in stellar spectra. Additionally, all of the stars that were given a ≥90% probability prediction were within 100 pc of the Sun, which may be correlated with the fact that it is easier to measure high resolution stellar abundances for nearby stars. Overall, it is our hope and intention to observe the stars with a high probability of hosting a giant planet. However, we recognize that there are significant caveats within our algorithm and models, such that a null detection of a giant planet constitutes a reflection of the data for the currently known planet hosts and their abundances, as opposed to the algorithm and generated models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY</head><p>It is apparent from the major giant planet formation theory, namely core-accretion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ida &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mordasini et al. 2009)</ref>, that heavy elements are a fundamental component to the formation process. And while there is clear, empirical evidence of the influence of Fe, it hasn't been established that Fe is more strongly correlated with giant planet occurrence than any of the other elements-even though it theoretically follows that other elements would be necessary for forming both massive gaseous planets and active, geochemical planets. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adibekyan et al. (2012)</ref>, a pressing problem in the stellar abundance field is that many of the stellar abundance studies are limited to small samples of stars with and without planets, which can be contradictory, such that the broader picture is very difficult to understand. It is with this in mind that we set out to explore the role of stellar composition, especially for non-Fe elements, and the presence of an orbiting giant exoplanet using a novel technique.</p><p>We have utilized a data-driven approach in order to recommend which solar neighborhood stars may be hosting yet-undetected giant planets based on their stellar elemental abundances. We used the stars and abundances within the Hypatia Catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hinkel et al. 2014</ref>) as a way to achieve a large number of features (elements) and targets (stars that aren't known to host planets). We chose a supervised classifier, specifically the XGBoost algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen &amp; Guestrin 2016)</ref>, that would allow us to train the models on the stellar abundances of stars with confirmed giant exoplanets, as determined by the NASA Exoplanet Archive. We utilized the algorithm to predict the likelihood that +4200 FGK-type stars host a giant exoplanet, implementing five different ensembles of elements composed of volatiles, lithophiles, siderophiles, and Fe. Between the ensembles we found that C, O, and Fe, as well as Na although to a lesser extent, are the most important features for predicting giant exoplanet host stars.</p><p>In order to test the accuracy of our recommendation algorithm, and without the availability of stars that are definitively without an orbiting giant planet or "true neg-ative" cases, we implemented a "golden set" of stars. Namely, we segregated a group of stars with planets such that the models were not trained using their properties and then "hid" those stars in the target sample. We allowed the algorithm to predict on the "golden set" of stars and found that they had an average of ∼75% probability, where more than half of the "golden set" had a prediction probability ≥90%. We conclude that those stars with a high prediction probability are therefore likely to host a giant planet, although those with a low score should not be entirely ruled out.</p><p>While we have thoroughly vetted the recommendation algorithm for biases and systematics, it cannot be denied that the data on which we are training is significantly biased. Namely, we are partial towards radial velocity detected giant planets that are orbiting close to nearby stars with easy to measure elemental abundances. And until such time as we are able to detect smaller planets at wider orbits and measure abundances for a variety of important "interdisciplinary elements," the biases for predicted exoplanet host stars will be unchanged. With that in mind, these biases have important implications for upcoming missions like TESS, CHEOPS, JWST, and WFIRST who will help expand the parameter space of known exoplanet systems. Furthermore, we find the "interdisciplinary elements" worthy of exploration in upcoming stellar abundance proposals and observations.</p><p>There are other considerations that we acknowledge in the interpretation of the results presented here, but which may be better addressed in future work. For example, the influence of C and O in the prediction of potential giant exoplanets hosts may be linked to their constituting a larger portion of the mass fraction in the solar composition relative to other elements we have considered. The implication is then that the occurrence of giants planets correlates with the total amount of metals, not necessarily with the specific element. However, our discovered correlation of host star C/O with the likelihood that it hosts a giant planet is consistent with the correlation of giant planet occurrence and host metallicity (or ironcontent). Stars with higher <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> metallicity are more likely to host giant planets  as well as have a relatively lower abundance of <ref type="bibr">[O/H]</ref> compared to <ref type="bibr">[C/H]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Delgado Mena et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Teske et al. 2014</ref>). As such, one expects that as the metallicity of the host star increases, it's molar ratio of C/O also increases. To this point, we also acknowledge that C and O measurements are more strongly dependent on the specific lines used to determine the total abundances than many of the other elements discussed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ecuvillon et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fortney 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Teske et al. 2014</ref>), which may also play a role in their significance. Regardless, the planetmetallicity relation is more than a simple correlation with <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> -with perhaps other elemental abundances displaying a similar trend, thus expanding the ensemble of elements we must consider when predicting giant planets. While no correlation has been found of stellar composition and rocky planet occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wang &amp; Fischer 2015)</ref>, this data-driven and ensemble-based approach may help elucidate any relationship between disk chemistry and the likelihood of a star's ability to host sub-Neptune mass planets.</p><p>In the future, we hope to analyze not only stars with and without planets, but also the chemical distinctions between stars that host rocky versus giant gaseous planets. Despite previous results, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buchhave et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Buchhave &amp; Latham (2015)</ref>, suggesting that there are no trends in overall metallicity for stars with terrestrial planets, we hope that a more data-driven abundance analysis will reveal subtle underlying trends in non-Fe elements given the wealth of stellar abundance data in Hypatia. The connection between stellar abundances and the presence of a rocky planet would reveal those elements that are significantly important to terrestrial planet formation and would allow considerably more targeted searches for solar system analogs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y, Cr, Co, Ni (13) Lithophiles + Siderophile + Fe: Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y, Cr, Co, Ni, Fe (14) Volatiles + Lithophiles + Fe: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y, Fe (13) Volatiles + Lithophiles + Siderophile: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y, Cr, Co, Ni (15) Volatiles + Lithophiles + Siderophile + Fe: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y, Cr, Co, Ni, Fe (16)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 5 ,</head><label>5</label><figDesc>we analyze the gradient of stars predicted to host a giant exoplanet with respect to C, O, Na, and Fe. In the top panel, there is more scatter with respect to [C/H], especially at sub-solar values, as the probability of hosting a planet increases. In the second panel, there are a handful of stars with extremely low [O/H] (&lt; -0.3 dex) that have a high probability of hosting a giant planet. Additionally, stars with high [Fe/H] content (in red) are preferentially found at higher probabilities, as opposed to a variety of probabilities seen in the third panel (i.e. the strong, red-to-orange banding at higher [Na/H] val- ues). In the third panel, stars with high [Fe/H] content and [Na/H] are seen more consistently scattered across all predicted hosting probabilities. Finally, the last panel shows the molar fraction C/O with respect to the solar (Lodders et al. 2009) normalized [Fe/H], colored accord- ing to probability of the star hosting a giant planet. From this plot we see that stars have a preferentially higher probability of hosting a giant planet if both C/O and [Fe/H] are high. This is not an unexpected correlation as those planets with higher metallicity are observed to have lower [O/H] abundances (Delgado Mena et al. 2010; Teske et al. 2014), and thus will have a positive correla- tion with C/O.</figDesc></figure>
