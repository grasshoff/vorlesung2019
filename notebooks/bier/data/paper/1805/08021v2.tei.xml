			<abstract>
				<p>The characterization of planetary atmospheres is a daunting task, pushing current observing facilities to their limits. The next generation of high-resolution spectrographs mounted on large telescopes-such as ESPRESSO@VLT and HIRES@ELT-will allow us to probe and characterize exoplanetary atmospheres in greater detail than possible to this point. We present a method that permits the recovery of the colour-dependent reflectivity of exoplanets from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Determining the wavelength-dependent albedo will provide insight into the chemical properties and weather of the exoplanet atmospheres. For this work, we simulated ESPRESSO@VLT and HIRES@ELT high-resolution observations of known planetary systems with several albedo configurations. We demonstrate how the cross correlation technique applied to theses simulated observations can be used to successfully recover the geometric albedo of exoplanets over a range of wavelengths. In all cases, we were able to recover the wavelength dependent albedo of the simulated exoplanets and distinguish between several atmospheric models representing different atmospheric configurations. In brief, we demonstrate that the cross correlation technique allows for the recovery of exoplanetary albedo functions from optical observations with the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs that will be mounted on large telescopes with reasonable exposure times. Its recovery will permit the characterization of exoplan-etary atmospheres in terms of composition and dynamics and consolidates the cross correlation technique as a powerful tool for exoplanet characterization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The detection of what turned out to be the prototypical hot Jupiter planet around the solar twin 51 Pegasi <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref> paved the way for one of the most prolific fields in current Astronomy. Currently over 3700 planets in around 2800 planetary systems have been discovered 1 , with more than 2600 additional candidates from the Kepler ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) and K2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howell et al. 2014</ref>) missions still awaiting confirmation.</p><p>E-mail: Jorge.Martins@astro.up.pt 1 From the http://exoplanet.eu/ database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>), as of March 2018.</p><p>Nowadays, one of the main research paths of exoplanetology is the study and characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. Atmospheric characterization of exoplanets is a formidable task, at the limit of the capabilities of current generation observing facilities. However, in-depth knowledge of exoplanetary atmospheres is fundamental towards our understanding of the planet's chemistry, physics, origin and ultimately its capacity for sustaining life (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Seager et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>A major challenge in for the study of exoplanetary atmospheres is how to detect the minute signal due to the extreme planet-to-star contrast ratio required for the detection of even a hot Jupiter class planet. At infrared wavelengths, the planet-to-star flux ratio for a hot Jupiter at opposition can reach 10 −3 (Demory et al. 2011), mainly due to the thermal emission of the planet -which peaks at these wavelengths -and the lower stellar infrared flux. At optical wavelengths, the planet-to-star flux ratio at opposition is expected to reach up to 10 −4 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charbonneau et al. 1999</ref>) for giant planets in close-in orbits and is usually dominated by the reflected light component 2 . ! the Earth-to-Sun flux ratio is much lower, around 5 × 10 −10 (computed from Equation 2, assuming R p = 6371km, a = 1AU and A g = 0.3). These extreme contrast ratios make the detection of the optical reflected signal from exoplanets a challenging task with current generation facilities.</p><p>To overcome the low contrast problem, the most diverse -yet complementary -techniques have been developed. Phase curve measurements (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Knutson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steven- son et al. 2017</ref>) rely on the variation of the star+planet flux as the planet orbits the star. Transit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Charbonneau et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sedaghati et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sing et al. 2016</ref>) and occultation spectroscopy (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deming et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alonso et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Stevenson et al. 2014</ref>) techniques measure the wavelength dependent variation in flux of the system as the planet partially occults and is occulted by the star, respectively.</p><p>Since both the planet and its host star orbit the system's centre of mass, their spectra will appear Doppler-shifted relative to each other, typically ∼100 km/s for a hot Jupiter. This separation in the radial velocity space allowed highresolution spectroscopy techniques to spectroscopically resolve the planetary signature of the planet from the stellar one (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Snellen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mar- tins et al. 2015</ref>) and to identify the contribution from individual molecules on the atmosphere of exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rodler et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">de Kok et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Birkby et al. 2017</ref>). In some cases -young giant planets on long periods -it has already been possible to spatially resolve the planet from the host star, and to obtain planetary spectra with negligible stellar light contamination (e.g., β Pictoris b with CRIRES - <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Snellen et al. 2014</ref>). For smaller planets and/or in close-in orbits, new techniques are being developed (e.g., for Proxima b <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lovis et al. 2017</ref>). The combination of highresolution spectroscopy with polarimetry provides added value to brightness-only measurements in the characterization of the atmospheres and orbits of exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Garcia- Muñoz &amp; Cabrera 2018)</ref>.For a more in-depth review of the available techniques and their results, the reader is referred to e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming &amp; Seager (2017)</ref>.</p><p>As done in the past with the planets in our Solar System, the direct detection of reflected light from exoplanets can be used as a tool towards the comprehension of their atmospheres. When the light from a star is reflected on a planet's atmosphere, it will be modulated by the planet's reflectance or albedo which are highly dependent on the atmospheric chemical and physical characteristics. Different gases and condensates will scatter (and absorb) light at different wavelengths with different intensities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garcia-Muñoz &amp; Isaak 2015)</ref>. The detection of absorption features in an atmosphere depends greatly on the presence of clouds and hazes for a variety of planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sing et al. 2016</ref>). Thus, the recov-ery of the colour dependence of exoplanet albedos provides unique insight into the atmospheric properties of the planet. At optical wavelengths, the reflected spectrum from exoplanets is expected to be a copy -albeit scaled-down by several orders of magnitude -of the stellar spectrum modulated by the planetary albedo plus the contribution of absorption bands by the gases in the exoplanet atmosphere.</p><p>The first attempts to detect reflected optical light from exoplanets -such as the pioneering works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charbonneau et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cameron et al. (1999)</ref> -were unfruitful and only yielded upper limits for the planetary albedo of some exoplanets -e.g., υ And b with A g &lt; 0.39 (at a 99.9% confidence level - <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cameron et al. 2002)</ref> or HD 75289A b with A g &lt; 0.46 (at a 99.9% confidence level assuming R p = 1.2 R Jup - <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rodler et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, the number of exoplanets with measured albedos is still low. Demory (2014) presents constrains on the albedo of 27 Super-Earth class Kepler planet candidates. In terms of larger planets, only about 20 hot Jupiters (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Angerhausen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schwartz &amp; Cowan 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Es- teves et al. 2015</ref>) have had their albedo constrained, which is quite a small sample. The general trend seems to be that hot Jupiters are dark in the optical, with a few exceptions such as Kepler-7b. The disparity of results in terms of measured albedos does not offer an unifying picture on the properties of exoplanet atmospheres, with values ranging from 0.0253 ± 0.0072 for TrES2-b <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kipping &amp; Spiegel 2011</ref>) to 0.35 ± 0.02 for Kepler-7b <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demory et al. 2013</ref>). Therefore, the statistics of exoplanetary albedos are still a field with much to explore.</p><p>Using a technique that cross-correlates high-resolution (R &gt;100 000) spectral observations of planetary systems with a numerical spectral mask, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. (2015)</ref> presented the first direct detection of the reflected spectrum of 51 Pegasi on its orbiting planet. Simply put, the crosscorrelation technique sums up all spectral features that are present in both the spectrum and the numerical mask, effectively merging them into one single average line. This process enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra, thereby making the planetary reflected spectrum to stand above the spectral noise. With this detection, they inferred that this planet is most likely a highly-inflated hot-Jupiter type planet with a high albedo (A g = 0.5 for R p = 1.9R Jup ).</p><p>The work described herein focuses on the direct detection of the high-resolution optical spectrum from the host star reflected on an orbiting planet with the next generation of observing facilities, using the cross-correlation technique presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. (2015)</ref>. Next generation observing facilities (e.g ESPRESSO@VLT, HIRES@ELT) will permit to increase the expected number of photon counts at the detector, and consequently move our observations into a higher S/N domain. This increase is accomplished both from an increased sensitivity of the whole optical systems (e.g., from ∼4 per cent for HARPS 3 to ∼10 per cent for ESPRESSO 4 ) and increased collecting areas (from a 3.6-m telescope for HARPS@ESO3.6 to up to 4 × 8.4-m with ESPRESSO@VLT and to a 39-m telescope for HIRES@ELT).</p><p>With these observing facilities in mind, we expanded the cross-correlation function technique presented in <ref type="bibr">Mar- tins et al. (2015)</ref> to allow it to recover not only the reflected light signal from the planet, but also its colour dependency. This should make it a powerful tool for exoplanet characterization as the colour dependency of a planetary reflected signal is highly modulated by the gases and condensates in its atmosphere (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garcia-Muñoz &amp; Isaak 2015)</ref>. In this work, we apply the proposed technique to simulated star+planet observations with both ESPRESSO@VLT and HIRES@ELT. Our main goals are to estimate to which level we can: a) recover the colour dependency of the reflected light spectrum from selected exoplanets and b) distinguish between possible albedo function models.</p><p>In Section 2, we describe the cross-correlation technique in detail. How the simulated observations were created is the object of Section 3. The results from our simulations are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. We summarize our conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE CROSS CORRELATION FUNCTION TECHNIQUE</head><p>In this work, we propose and test on simulated observations (see Section 3 for details on the creation of the simulated observations) a modified version of the cross correlation Function Technique used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Martins et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. ( , 2015</ref> to recover the reflected spectrum from exoplanets and infer their albedo functions. The CCF of high-resolution spectra with binary masks has been used very successfully for many years to determine with high-precision the radial velocity of astronomical objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zinn &amp; West 1984)</ref>. In particular for exoplanets, astronomers cross-correlate high-resolution spectra of stellar systems with numerical masks over a range around the host's radial velocity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baranne et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayor et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>These numerical masks are fundamentally lists of spectral lines identified on the particular spectral type of the host. Each spectral line on the mask is represented by a theoretical initial and final wavelengths, as well as the weight for each line (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pepe et al. 2002)</ref>. These parameters are computed assuming that the line can be represented by a rectangle with the same area as the real spectral line, with the continuum normalized to one and the weight corresponding to the relative depth of the line, centred at the rest wavelength of the spectral line. A detailed description of the CCF is beyond the scope of this work and as such we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baranne et al. (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pepe et al. (2000)</ref> for the detailed mathematical formulation.</p><p>By cross-correlating high-resolution spectra obtained with instruments such as HARPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pepe et al. 2000</ref>) with these numerical masks, researchers are effectively constructing an average spectral line of the spectrum. This average line will be centred at the radial velocity of the object being observed and will benefit of a signal-to noise ratio (S/N) increase given approximately by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S/N cc f ≈ N lines × S/N sp (1)</formula><p>where S/N cc f and S/N sp are respectively the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the resulting CCF and of the original spectrum, and N lines is the number of spectral lines used in the cross-correlation. Since a typical spectral line mask for a solar type star has several thousands of spectral lines (e.g. the HARPS G2 mask has around 4000 lines), the CCF provides an increase in S/N of one to two orders of magnitude (for example, in the case of the standard HARPS G2 mask, this yields an increase in S/N over of 60 times). Also, moving the observed spectrum into a much higher S/N domain allows to greatly increase the precision at which the radial velocity of the object is measured. When searching for the reflected signal of a planet, we expect that the planetary signal will, to a large extend, mimic the stellar spectrum, but at a different radial velocity and scaled-down by several orders of magnitude. The exoplanet will also contribute through absorption by the gases in its atmosphere. For a given orbital phase φ and wavelength λ, the fraction of stellar light reaching the planetary disk that will be reflected back to us is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F p (λ, φ) F * (λ) = A g (λ) g(α) R p a 2 (2)</formula><p>where A g is the geometric albedo, R p the planetary radius, g(α) the phase function and a the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit. By cross-correlating the star+planet spectrum with a numerical mask representing the star will produce a CCF with two peaks with different amplitudes at different radial velocities, one representing the star and the other -with a much lower amplitude -representing the planet. In brief, the spectrum will resemble the one of a spectroscopic binary, with one component several orders of magnitude fainter. Inverting Eq. 2, we can use the ratio between both signals to recover the planetary albedo function (times the square of the planet radius if the planet size is not known). Note that albeit powerful, this technique is limited in terms of planetary characterization by the photon noise from the star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Recovery of the planetary albedo</head><p>To recover the albedo from our simulated observations, we implemented a modified version of the cross correlation recovery technique from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. (2015)</ref> as a Python tool which can be downloaded at https://github.com/ jorgehumberto/albedo_recovery_tool.git. We will now proceed by summarizing each step of the albedo recovery process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computation of the CCFs</head><p>Since HARPS data was used as the spectral template and standard type of our simulations, for simplicity we used the HARPS Data Reduction Software (DRS) vs 3.6. to compute the CCF for each spectral order of each simulated observation. This recipe cross-correlates high-resolution spectra with a numerical mask that contains the spectral information for thousands of spectral lines that where identified for each stellar spectral type. Since each spectral order will have different S/N levels due to the wavelength dependency of the instrumental setup transmission, the recipe uses an optimally weighted cross-correlation function which accounts for the individual S/N of each individual spectral line 5 . The parameters for each spectral line of the mask (initial and final wavelength, and line depth) are computed assuming that the line can be represented by a rectangle with the same area as the real spectral line, with the continuum normalized to one and the weight corresponding the relative depth of the line, centred at the theoretical wavelength line if the radial velocity was equal to zero. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baranne et al. (1996)</ref> for a detailed description of the computation of the CCF and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pepe et al. (2002)</ref> for details on the spectral mask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wavelength binning of the CCFs</head><p>We intend to determine the exoplanet reflectivity over a number of bins spanning the entire spectral range available to the spectrograph. Thus, the wavelength coverage of the spectrograph is broken into N bins wavelength bins of equal size, where N bins is the desired sampling for the recovered albedo function. Then, the CCFs of the orders covered by the wavelength range of each bin are merged together, effectively re-sampling them for the wavelengths defined by each bin as the wavelength region of each individual bin can span several spectral orders. This can be done as it is mathematically equivalent to compute the CCF for a wavelength bin or merge the CCFs of the orders covered by the same bin 6 . Note that in most orders, there is an overlap in wavelength between adjacent orders (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Removal of the stellar signal</head><p>For each wavelength bin, the stellar CCF template is constructed by stacking together the CCFs corresponding to each wavelength bin on all individual observations, after correction of the stellar radial velocity drift that results from the reflex motion of the star (i.e., the CCFs of all individual observations are re-centered to the rest frame of the star). This dilutes the planetary signal amidst the stellar noise, while increasing the strength of the stellar signal. Once the stellar template has been constructed, we divide the CCF of each individual observation by it, effectively removing the stellar signature. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of a: i) the CCF for one of the simulated observations (Top Panel ) ii) the stellar template for one of the simulated observing runs (Middle Panel ) and iii) the same CCF presented in the Top Panel, but after removal of the stellar signal (Bottom Panel ). Note that as a rule of thumb, the S/N of the stellar template should be at least over 10 times that of the individual CCFs to avoid the introduction of non-negligible noise onto the planetary CCF (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Martins et al. 2013</ref>, Appendix A) during the removal process.

In MR mode, ESPRESSO will be able to combine incoherently the light from up to all 4 VLT Unit Telescopes (UT), effectively increasing the collecting area up to the equivalent of a 16-m telescope. In both HR and UHR modes, it will only be able to receive the light from one of the four UT telescopes.. For both MR and HR modes, ESPRESSO will be fed by a 1 arc sec fibre, while on UHR mode, the fibre diameter drops to 0.5 arc sec. While allowing for a large increase in the resolution for the UHR mode, it comes at the cost of a lower photon collecting power. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the efficiency curve of all 3 resolution modes of ESPRESSO (Pepe, Lovis and Sosnowska -private communication), as well as the efficiency curve of HARPS (from HARPS ETC). Both HARPS and ESPRESSO (all 3 modes) efficiency curves were computed for a seeing of 0.65 arc sec and air mass of 1.0 (i.e. pointing towards the zenith). For all of them, the efficiency includes the transmission factors of the atmosphere, telescope, and spectrograph, as well as slit losses.</p><p>HIRES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maiolino et al. 2013</ref>) is a high-resolution spectrograph proposed for ESO's ELT that will operate simultaneously at visible and infrared wavelengths. Recently, the HIRES@ELT consortium has successfully published the phase A study ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maiolino et al. 2013</ref>), where a technical solution and a clear science case is proposed. The detection of exoplanet atmospheres is considered the top science driver of the instrument. Since the instrument is still in the planning phase and the baseline design was not finalised at the time this paper was conceived, we considered for our simulations a high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT which is a scaled up version of HARPS. Therefore, we assumed a HARPS-like profile with a resolving power of around 110 000 and a HARPS-like efficiency.</p><p>HARPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pepe et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayor et al. 2003</ref>) is a fibrefed and cross-dispersed high-resolution echelle spectrograph installed on ESO's 3.6-m telescope at the LaSilla-Paranal observatory. The main scientific goal that led to its development was the detection of exoplanets from extremely precise radial velocity measurements. The combination of its resolving power (R ≈ 115000) with precise wavelength calibrations allows it to achieve a long term radial velocity precision better than 80 cm s -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lo Curto et al. 2012</ref>). For more details, we refer you to HARPS User Manual 8 Issue 2.1, October 1st 2011.</p><p>Throughout this work we used HARPS as the spectral template for both ESPRESSO and HIRES as these instruments are still not available. First of all, we restricted the spectral coverage for both ESPRESSO and HIRES to the same wavelength range as HARPS (378-691 nm). The reason behind this choice is that this is also the spectral range covered by the spectral masks used by the HARPS cross correlation recipe, the same we apply in this work. Note that ESPRESSO will have a larger spectral coverage than HARPS, and as such we should be able to cover a broader wavelength region of the planetary atmospheres. A broader wavelength coverage in principle also implies a larger amount of spectral lines to construct the CCF and consequently a larger increase in S/N. Additionally, the collected flux and S/N for both instruments was extrapolated from the values estimated with HARPS ETC 9 version 100.2. Since we are looking at bright targets, to avoid saturation and ensure linearity of the instrument, we set for all targets the individual exposure time in the ETC to 300s. E.g., for our brightest star -51 Pegasi with mag V = 5.49 -in 300s we only reach about 65 per cent of the detector's saturation limit per pixel, a regime where the detector is still linear. The stellar parameters for each target were obtained from the exoplanet.eu database. The target independent parameters are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Note that for all observations we assumed the Moon to be far from our simulated targets. In this case, the sky brightness has a visual magnitude in the range 20.0 &lt; mag V arcsec 2 &lt; 21.8 (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cunha et al. 2013</ref>). Therefore the Moon phase can be ignored for our simulations and was left at its default value in the ETC.</p><p>To extrapolate the S/N that can be obtained with either ESPRESSO or HIRES we used</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">SN ins (λ, t) = A × E (λ) SN H ARPS (λ, t)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where SN ins (λ) and SN H ARPS (λ) are respectively the expected wavelength dependent S/N for the simulated instrument and for HARPS. A is the ratio of the collecting areas for the selected instrument and HARPS 3.6-m telescope (A ≈ 5.4 for ESPRESSO@VLT,assuming observations done with one single UT, and A ≈ 117.4 for HIRES@ELT). E (λ) is a scaling factor to account for the different wavelength dependent efficiencies between the ESPRESSO/HIRES and HARPS. For ESPRESSO, this scaling factor is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E (λ) = E f f mode (λ) E f f H ARPS (λ)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where E f f mode (λ) and E f f H ARPS (λ) are respectively the efficiency of the selected ESPRESSO mode (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>) and of the HARPS spectrograph.

As such, E f f H ARPS (λ) was computed for the same seeing of 0.65 arcsec, independently of SN H ARPS (λ, t).</p><p>As discussed above, for the case of HIRES we assumed a HARPS-like efficiency and thus E = 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Target selection</head><p>As test targets we selected known exoplanets representative of three different planet categories: i) hot Jupiters, ii) hot Neptunes and iii) short-period super-Earths. Our initial sample included all planets from the exoplanet.eu database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>) that i) orbit FGK dwarfs with mag V ≤ 10, ii) have orbital periods shorter than 14 days and iii) have measured radii. This choice ensures that i) high-S/N data can be obtained within reasonable exposure times <ref type="bibr">11</ref> , ii) the planet-to-star flux ratio will not be too low for detection and iii) we can break the A g R 2 p degeneracy coming from Eq. 2 and recover the albedo directly.</p><p>For all the planets in our initial sample, we estimated the required exposure time (see Section 3.3 for a detailed description on how this was computed) to recover the albedo function from the planet assuming a grey albedo -i.e. wavelength independent -with A g = 0.2. This value is somewhat arbitrary and was selected as it corresponds to about 70 per cent of the lowest mean albedo for the albedo functions we simulated (see Section 3.5) over HARPS wavelength coverage. Furthermore, to claim a detection, the albedo function should be recovered for N bins wavelength bins over the whole spectral range of the selected instrument with a 3σ confidence per bin. Note that the number of wavelength bins selected for each planet type needs to balance the required exposure time and level of precision on the recovered albedo function. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows on the top panel the estimated required times to recover the albedo function of a prototypical hot Jupiter (p = 3days; R p = 1.2 R Jup ; grey albedo with A g = 0.2) with ESPRESSO (HR mode), as a function of N bins and different visual magnitudes of the host star. The bottom panel shows the same, but from HIRES observations. Note that N bins = 1 corresponds to the work presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. (2015)</ref>. A high number for N bins and the exposure time cost will be prohibitively high (e.g., for N bins = 25 the required S/N to recover the reflected light spectrum is close to 800 000. For a mag V = 8 star this requires over 100 hours of ESPRESSO time. Too low a value for N bins and the level of detail of the recovered albedo function will be too low to distinguish between albedo models as no spectral features can be recovered (e.g., the sodium doublet at 589-nm). As such, for simulated observations of hot Jupiters with ESPRESSO we settled on 15 wavelength bins for the recovered albedo function. For simulated observations with HIRES we selected i) 70 wavelength bins for hot Jupiters; ii) 6 wavelength bins for hot Neptunes and iii) 5 wavelength bins for Super-Earths. We believe these values to yield a good balance between exposure time and the level of detail in the recovered albedo function. Note that the values we propose for N bins were arbitrarily selected for this exploratory work. For real observations we would attempt different values for N bins as a trade-off between the level of detail of the recovered albedo function and the associated uncertainty. Once the signal of an exoplanet is detected at 3σ, we passed the detection threshold, and the significance for a detection on a different N bins value or integration time can be calculated by scaling from the presented values.</p><p>Of the resulting planet sample we selected a few targets which we consider representative of the different exoplanet types: i) two hot Jupiters -51 Pegasi b, HD 209458 b -to be observed with both instruments 12 ; ii) two hot Neptunes -HD 109749 b, HD 76700 b -to be observed with HIRES and iii) one Super-Earth -55 Cnc e -to be observed with HIRES. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the selected sample of target planetary systems and their relevant parameters, where: i) M p and M * are respectively the planet and stellar mass, ii) R p and R * are respectively the planet and stellar radii, iii) P is the orbital period, iv) a is the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit, v) k p and k are respectively the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the planetary and stellar orbits, vi) i is the inclination of the orbit relatively to the plane of the sky, vii) T E f f is the effective temperature of the star and viii) mag V is the visual magnitude of the star. The parameters for the simulated observations of our sample are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Simulated atmospheric models</head><p>The main purpose of this exercise is to test our method to recover the colour dependence of the reflected optical spectrum from an exoplanet. In particular, we are interested in the ability of the CCF technique to distinguish between possible atmospheric models and thus hint at the composition of the simulated planetary atmosphere. Thus, for this study, we decided to simulate our observations assuming albedo function models with real physical meaning.</p><p>As stated before, the reflectivity of a planet is highly dependent on its atmospheric composition and physics, and in particular cloud coverage. Unlike their gas giant Solar System counterparts (with albedos of about 0.5 due to the presence of ices in the atmosphere), close-in giant exoplanets were expected to be dark at optical wavelengths, due to heavy absorption from TiO and VO and/or alkali metals (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sudarsky et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012</ref>). In particular, atmospheric models predict a strong absorption feature at 589-nm due to the presence of Na in exoplanetary atmospheres which has already been identified in several planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Redfield et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wyt- tenbach et al. 2015</ref>).

These would present flat reflection spectra as the clouds/hazes would mask the deeper absorbing molecules. However, the recovered albedos should allow to infer the particle size and density of the clouds/hazes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garcia-Muñoz &amp; Isaak 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Webber et al. 2015</ref>) For this particular exploratory study, for both the hot Jupiter and hot Neptune type planets, the atmospheric models we used were produced by solving the problem of multiple scattering of starlight in the planet atmosphere. For integration over the planetary disk, we utilized the algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Horak (1950)</ref>. Partial solutions at the integration points were obtained with a discrete-ordinate method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stamnes et al. 1988</ref>). The line lists for molecular absorption were taken from HITEMP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rothman et al. 2010</ref>). For the absorption by the alkalis, we incorporated the parameterization given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Iro et al. (2005)</ref>. The albedo function for each planetary model was created at full illumination (zero phase angle and zero inclination), and then adapted to each simulated illumination configuration by assuming a Lambert phase function (see Eq. 16). Additional details on the model can be found in e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Garcia-Muñoz et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nielsen et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>We assumed hydrostatic balance in the atmosphere, and a temperature profile dictated by a planet equilibrium temperature of 1150 K. The temperature profile plays a second order effect in the scattering of reflected starlight. We also assumed that gas absorption at wavelengths shorter than 1 µm is dominated by water and alkalis (Na and K), thereby ignoring the potential contribution from other gases such as VO or TiO. In terms of composition, we selected somewhat arbitrary values for the altitude-independent Volume Mixing Ratios (VMR's) for water and the alkalis (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>For the 'Model A' family of atmospheric models we assumed VMR's of about half of the concentration in solar composition atmospheres. In the 'Model B' family of atmospheric models we assume the same VMR for water, but the alkali concentrations were reduced by a factor of 100. The rationale for these cases is to see if a more structured spectrum (diminishing the Na/K impact enhances the relative impact of H 2 O) may affect the recovery of the albedo function. The approximation of well-mixed gases is probably more realistic for water than for the alkalis. The alkalis potentially ionize high-up in the atmosphere, which will effectively result in the removal of their neutral forms at pressures less than 10 −4 bar according to photo-chemical models of hot Jupiters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lavvas et al. 2014</ref>). We include Rayleigh scattering by the H 2 /He background atmospheric gas. For each model family, we also consider different aerosol scattering configurations (×1, ×100) by adding extra scattering opacity. This extra opacity is equal to the gas opacity in our baseline ×1 configuration, and one hundred times larger in the ×100 configuration. The aerosols are assumed to scatter without absorbing, i.e. their single scattering albedo is identically one. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> shows the different planet geometric albedos obtained for each simulated configuration. In spectral regions away from the water and alkali bands, our treatment produces a geometric albedo of 0.75, as expected for a semi-infinite, conservative Rayleigh atmosphere. In the regions where gas absorption is significant (e.g around the 589-nm neutral sodium line), the planetary reflectivity depends strongly on the adopted aerosol and gas content.</p><p>For all targets, we also decided to simulate a grey albedo function with a conservative fixed albedo A g = 0.2 with the goal of testing whether the proposed technique allows to distinguish between grey albedo models (e.g., as caused by clouds/hazes) and the chromatic models described above.</p><p>In the case of 55 Cnc e, although an atmosphere has been detected around the planet (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tsiaras et al. 2015</ref>), there is no information about its composition. Thus, we simulate a grey albedo function with a fixed albedo of 0.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>We simulated ESPRESSO@VLT (in all 3 modes -resolutions: MHR=60 000, HR=130 000 and UHR=200 000) and HIRES@ELT (resolution=110 000) observational runs of the star+planet systems presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> shows the parameters for each observing run of all star+planet systems, as observed with both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The total exposure time for each star+planet system with ESPRESSO was set to be the same for all modes (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  3</ref>). For each instrument+star+planet+albedo configuration, we simulated 100 observing runs -each with the total exposure time presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> -of 100 observations each. In total, we simulated close to 12000 hours of ESPRESSO observations of 24 planet+albedo configurations, with an average S/N around 300 − 400. For HIRES, we created about 6000 hours of telescope time of 13 planet+albedo configurations, with an average S/N varying between 600 and 1800.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. Top Panel: Model A (×1, ×100 configurations); Bottom Panel: Model B (×1, ×100 configurations). The ×1, ×100 configurations correspond respectively to different scattering configurations, where the opacity in the ×100 configuration is 100 times larger that on the baseline configuration.</p><p>We attempted the recovery of the wavelength dependence of the planetary albedo function from all simulated observations. For each planet+albedo configuration we simulated 100 independent observational runs, for which we recovered the colour dependent albedo function independently. From the recovered value distribution, we estimate the 1σ error inherent to the method .</p><p>The results are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 10 to 15</ref>. The green diamonds represent the mean of the recovered albedos over all simulated observing runs with 1σ error bars, for each wavelength bin. The blue horizontal lines represent the mean albedo from the simulated model over each wavelength bin. The horizontal orange lines represent the superior detection limit with a 3σ confidence for the recovered albedo.</p><p>We defined the upper limit for non-detection (or minimum detectable albedo) on each wavelength bin as 3 times the average noise across all 100 observing runs simulated per instrument+star+planet+albedo configuration. For the bins where the mean albedo from the model is lower than the minimum detectable albedo, we assume the value for the recovered albedo for those bins as the upper detection limit. Those cases are represented in the plots by the orange arrows.</p><p>In all simulated cases, we tested our recovered albedo function against all atmospheric models presented in Section 3.5. To do so, we computed the reduced chi-squared ( χ 2 ν ) value for the recovered data against the albedo models for all planet+albedo configurations. χ 2 ν was computed from:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">χ 2 ν = N bi ns i=1 1 N bins &lt; A measur ed,i &gt; −&lt; A model,i &gt; 2 σ 2 i (18)</formula><p>where N bins is the number of wavelength bins for which the wavelength was recovered; &lt; A model,i &gt; represents the mean of the albedo function over the wavelength range covered by bin i; &lt; A measured,i &gt; is the average measured albedo for wavelength bin i over all independent runs; σ i is the standard deviation of the recovered albedos for all runs. In the sense of identifying the correct model, note that a different analysis using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) could have been used with no change in the results as we are assuming a constant number of degrees of freedom. The assumption of noncorrelated noise makes is that the distribution of the recovered values for the albedo follows a normal distribution and consequently so does the likelihood. Furthermore, each model has the same number of parameters (in this case zero). As a result the AIC/BIC values are only proportional to the likelihood and therefore to the χ 2 ν value. The χ 2 ν results are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 5 to 10</ref>. For each simulated configuration, the lowest reduced χ 2 ν value is represented in bold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Figures 10 to 15 show for each star+planet+albedo configuration the recovered (green points) versus the simulated (grey line) albedo functions. It can be seen that for each wavelength bin, the mean simulated albedo (horizontal blue lines) is within the 3σ error bars of the recovered albedo functions. In all cases, the recovered albedo function is close to the simulated one. Note the unusually large error bar on panel h of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>, which results from the low number of spectral lines (3) in the numerical mask for that particular order (order 103 of the HARPS spectrograph, with 590.7-nm &lt;λ&lt; 597.4-nm). Albeit not as evident, the same effect can be seen on panel a of the same figure for the same spectral order.</p><p>Furthermore, from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 5 to 10</ref>, it can be seen that for each star+planet+albedo configuration -regardless of the simulated instrument or atmosphere -the lowest reduced χ 2 value (highlighted with a red box) is obtained when comparing with the correct simulated albedo model for the configuration.</p><p>These results are a clear indication that the crosscorrelation function of high-resolution spectra with numerical masks can be used to not only recover the reflected optical signal from an exoplanet but also recover the colour dependency of the planetary albedo function. With HARPS, we were able to recover the optical reflected signature of 51 Pegasi b and infer the planetary albedo from about 2.5h worth of observing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Martins et al. 2015</ref>). From 2018 -due to the increased collecting power and higher efficiency of the spectrograph -ESPRESSO should permit us to recover the albedo function from hot Jupiters with just a few hours of observing time (e.g 1h for 51 Pegasi b and ∼ 8h for HD 209458 b assuming 20 wavelength bins). HIRES -and following similar stable high-resolution optical spectrographs to be mounted on 30m class telescopes (e.g G-CLEF@GMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Szentgyorgyi et al. 2014</ref>) -will be able to probe the same targets but with an increased number of wavelength bins, effectively increasing the level of detail of the albedo function.

Increasing the exposure time or decreasing the level of detail, ESPRESSO will surely be able to probe smaller planets, but for those HIRES will be much more efficient due to the sheer increase of collecting power that will allow it to reach much higher S/N domains.</p><p>In the study, for all cases except 51 Pegasi b (for which we assumed the radius proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al.

Given the total exposure times presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> and the time each planet spends at optimal phases 15 , it is clear that apart from the proposed observations of 55 Cnc e with HIRES all the proposed observations can be completed during the same orbit. However, it is important to consider that to remove the stellar signal, this technique relies on the construction of stellar template built from adding at least 100 observations. Should these observations be taken too close together in the RV domain, the template will also remove the planetary signal. To avoid this issue, three different approaches can be followed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">χ 2 value A g = 0.2 Model A (×1) Model A (×100) Model B (×1) Model B (×100) ESPRESSO (MHR mode -2UT) 51 Peg b A g = 0.2</formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">χ 2 value A g = 0.2 Model A (×1) Model A (×100) Model B (×1) Model B (×100) ESPRESSO (MHR mode -4UT)</formula><p>The most intuitive approach consists in acquiring 100+ additional spectra at orbital phases close to inferior conjunc-tion. In those cases, and assuming that the orbit is not too far from edge on, not only the planetary signal will be minimal (or close to zero for transiting planets), but also the planetary and stellar signals will be aligned in the RV domain. This should allow for the construction of the purest stellar template, with (almost) no planetary contamination. The downside of this approach is that it requires additional telescope time. While for bright targets such as 51 Peg b this might not be a problem, faint targets such as HD 209458 b could easily greatly increase the required exposure time or even double it.</p><p>Another approach is to divide the observations in two sets, defined by their orbital phases. Assuming that the orbital phase of superior conjunction is φ 0 , one set will have orbital phases in the optimal window (See Appendix A for details) before superior conjunction (φ 0 − 45 • &lt; φ &lt; φ 0 − 15 • ) and the other set will have orbital phases in the orbital windows after (φ 0 + 15 • &lt; φ &lt; φ 0 + 45 • ) superior conjunction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Identification of atmospheric spectral absorption features</head><p>One of the main goals of atmospheric characterization is the detection of spectral features in the recovered albedo functions. The feature that dominates the albedo functions from our models is the optical sodium doublet at 589-nm. In the best case scenario -where N bins is equal to the number of orders of the spectrograph -each wavelength bin will be over 4-nm wide, clearly insufficient to resolve both lines of the doublet. Yet, this feature is extremely wide -typically over 10-nm overall -and as such we should be able to sample it with over 2 wavelength bins and as such resolve this spectral feature. Note that the amount of aerosols will impact the width of the sodium doublet. The lower the amount of aerosols, the wider the line will be and the easier will be to resolve and sample it. On the other hand, a wider spectral feature will mean more absorption and as such a lower albedo.</p><p>Narrower spectral features -with widths smaller than the spectral range covered by 2-3 wavelength bins -will not be possible to resolve. However, in wavelengths regions where a significant number of absorption lines can be identified, the mean albedo will drop relatively to the 'continuum' of the albedo function and dips can be identified. This is clear where albedos from the Model B family were simulated. Due to the higher water to alkali metals ratio, these albedos are more structured, i.e. have 'forests' of water absorption lines. This causes the mean albedo in those regions to drop significantly relatively to the 'continuum' of the albedo function (see panels e and f of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 9 to 11</ref>, panel g, i, j and m of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>). This the equivalent of a water band as seen in a low-resolution spectrum.</p><p>An interesting feature from the model albedo functions presented in this work is the impact of aerosols on the spectral dependency of the albedo function. The higher the aerosol content of the simulated albedo function, the smaller the width of the dominating sodium doublet absorption line and the higher the average geometric albedo. In fact, higheraltitude aerosols prevent the access of the starlight to the lower altitudes responsible for the line broadening. In the simulated atmospheric scenarios, as the amount of aerosols diminishes, the average geometric albedo will drop because absorption by the alkalis becomes dominating. However, in the models presented here this drop is not colour independent: although the albedo towards lower wavelengths will remain almost unchanged, it will be quite significant towards longer wavelengths. As such, even in cases where only a small number of bins is possible, the ratio of the recovered albedo function between redder and bluer wavelengths should at least allow to estimate basic information on the aerosols such as the dependence of their cross sections and/or single scattering albedo with wavelength.</p><p>It is intuitive that atmospheres with high reflectivity/albedos will be easier to detect. Fundamentally, it means that atmospheres with a high content of poorly-absorbing and high-altitude aerosols will be easier to detect. Also, the detectability of an atmosphere will also depend on the alkali metal content. Atmospheres with low alkali content (e.g. the B family of models we present) will be much less difficult to detect than atmospheres with high alkali content (e.g. the A family of models we present). In particular, a high sodium content, will lead to an extremely large drop in the reflective of the planet due to the impact of the sodium doublet at 589-nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">ESPRESSO resolution dependence</head><p>One of the hypotheses we wanted to test was if the resolving power of the instrument can affect the results. To test for this, we constructed additional simulated observations of the HD209458 planet+star system by ESPRESSO in all 3 modes (resolving power: MHR=60 000, HR=130 000 and UHR=200 000). Furthermore, since the MHR mode of ESPRESSO allows to combine the light from up to 4 of the telescope's UTs, we simulated observations with 1, 2 and 4 UTs. For the sake of simplicity we assumed for all observations a grey albedo model with A g = 0.2. For each star+planet+mode configuration, we simulated 100 observing runs. Each observing run has a total exposure time of 10h -independent of the simulated resolution mode -split into 100 spectra (as before to allow for a good stellar template correction). This makes sure that in all cases we are working in a S/N domain much higher than the required for an individual 3σ recovery of the colour dependency of the reflected planetary signal -and consequently of the albedo functionover 10 wavelength bins. For the low resolving power mode of ESPRESSO, we only considered observations with one telescope UT. As stated before, both HR and MHR modes will have higher efficiency than the UHR mode (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  4</ref>) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows the relative error X A g,i on the geometric albedo A g,i recovered for each wavelength bin i, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">X A g,i = σ A g, i A g,i<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where A g,i is the mean measured geometric albedo for bin i and σ A g,i is the dispersion over all simulated runs of A g,i . For the UHR mode (R = 200000), it is clear that the error in the recovered albedos is significantly larger than with the two other modes. This can easily be explained if we consider that in this mode the instrument is being fed 400 450 500 550 600 650</p><p>Wavelength <ref type="bibr">[Å]</ref> 0.2% 0.5% 0.8%</p><p>1.0%</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">X ( A g, i)</formula><p>Resolutions:</p><p>60 000 (1 UT) 60 000 (2 UT) 60 000 <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(4 UT)</ref> 130 000 200 000 by a much smaller fiber (0.5 instead of 1 arcsec), leading to a much lower number of photons reaching the detector. As such, the observation will be conducted on a lower S/N domain. For the other two modes -HR (R = 130000) and MHR (R = 60000) -there is no evidence that might suggest an impact of the resolution on the error for the recovered albedos. However, an increased resolution is of great importance to be able to obtain precise orbital parameters for both host and planet. Thus, the choice of resolution needs to balance the required high spectral resolution, but not at the loss of collecting area (e.g. as with ESPRESSO's UHR mode).</p><p>It is also clear the effect of an increased collecting area. On the MHR mode observations, as we move from 1 UT to 2 and then 4 UTs, the error on the recovered albedo decreases. As such, should only one UT be available to ESPRESSO, HR mode is the best choice, as it combines the highest resolution for the same collecting area. However, should 2 or more UT be available to ESPRESSO, the sheer increase in collecting power will make MHR mode a better choice. Despite the highest resolution, the UHR mode of ESPRESSO does not present any advantage (for this technique) over the other modes due to the much lower collecting power.</p><p>An interesting case is the case of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, panel d. When we computed the total exposure times for each observing run, we assume ESPRESSO to be in the HR configuration. Since the fiber diameter for the UHR mode is half of the fiber for the other modes, the planetary CCFs will be significantly noisier. Therefore, in most wavelength bins, the S/N of the recovered planetary CCF is lower than the upper limit for the albedo with a 3σ confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Noise variation with wavelength</head><p>It can be seen from the red horizontal bars on Figures 10 to 15 that the noise on the recovered CCF is wavelength dependent. This dependence is the combination of several factors.</p><p>First, the efficiency of the instruments has a colour dependence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows respectively the efficiency curves of ESPRESSO (in all 3 resolution modes) and HARPS (used as a template for HIRES). Secondly, the distribution of spectral lines along the spectral coverage of the instrument is not uniform. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8 shows</ref>   the different number of wavelength bins simulated in this document (5, 6, 20 and 70 wavelength bins). The number of spectral lines per bins is indicated on each bar from the histogram, except for N bins = 70 as it would be unreadable. It can be seen that the number of spectral lines decreases towards redder wavelengths, yielding a lower increase in S/N due to the CCF technique in redder bins. For N bins = 70, each bin corresponds to a spectral order of the HARPS spectrograph. In that case several gaps can be seen. The gap around 530-nm corresponds to a missing order that falls between the two chips of the HARPS spectrograph. The other 3 gaps (around 590, 630 and 645 nm) correspond to orders where the number of spectral lines is inferior to 5. Those are orders known for a large telluric contamination and as such larges wavelength ranges are not considered for the CCF calculation. Those gaps do not show on lower numbers of bins as these orders will be merged with adjacent orders.</p><p>Finally, the spectral type of the star: different spectral types will have different spectral energy distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure  9</ref> shows the expected S/N from a 300s exposure with HARPS of mag V = 6.0 F0, G2 K2 and M2 spectral type stars as computed with HARPS ETC. As expected, the 3 curves are different: M stars will attain higher S/N towards redder wavelengths, while F stars will reach higher S/N than G to M stars towards bluer wavelengths, with G stars somewhere in the middle of both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Spectral Types</head><p>For this work, all the spectra we have simulated were constructed from a template G2 spectrum. A question that arises is if the spectral type of the star will affect the recovery of the albedo function from a planet. From Equation 2, it can be seen that the stellar type has no impact on the albedo function itself as we are dealing with the planet-tostar flux ratio and not the fluxes directly.</p><p>As discussed on the previous section, spectral type affects the S/N levels registered on the detectors -through the number of counts recorded by the detector -as well as the number of spectral lines over a specified spectral range. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref> shows the spectral energy distribution for F0, G2 K2 and M2 spectral type stars: M stars will attain higher S/N towards redder wavelengths, while F stars will reach higher S/N than G to M stars towards bluer wavelengths, with G stars somewhere in the middle of both. As a result, detectability levels will depend on the stellar type. Assuming the same magnitude and exposure times:</p><p>• for redder wavelengths, the detection limit for the albedo function will decrease from F to M stars;</p><p>• for bluer wavelengths, the detection limit for the albedo function will increase from F to M stars;</p><p>It is interesting to compare this result with the albedo models presented in this work (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>). These models show higher albedos for bluer wavelengths, with most of the absorption (depending on the alkali metal concentration) occurring for redder wavelengths. As such, it is realistic to assume that cooler spectral type stars will be better targets than warmer stars as lower albedo detection limits can be attained for the same exposure time. Note that this assumption is only valid for the models we present here (or similar) and is not universal. It is not unusual in the solar system planets that some absorber affects the ultraviolet wavelengths and diminishes the planet reflectivity towards bluer wavelengths (e.g. the case Venus - <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lee et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Perez-Hoyos et al. 2018</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Advantages of the method relative to transit spectroscopy</head><p>Currently, one of the most used and powerful techniques to characterize planetary atmospheres is transit spectroscopy. Albeit a powerful technique, transit spectroscopy is limited on the range of orbital parameters that can be accessed as it cannot be applied to non-transiting planets. With the technique we propose in this work, this restriction is lifted as it can access the same parameter range as the radial velocity detection method, i.e., most planets that do not have face-on (or close to) orbits. However, in those cases, since no radii measurements are available, the radius and albedo will be degenerate. An additional strong point from the CCF technique relatively to transit spectroscopy is that it detects reflected light from the planet. Transit spectroscopy is significantly affected by the presence of clouds and/or hazes that will flatten -totally or partially -the absorption features from the transmission spectrum of an exoplanet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). This is not the case when observing the light reflected on existing clouds, which may scatter the incident light and make a planet much brighter, if the scattering particles are poorly absorbing. Moreover, any absorption feature from the atmosphere above the clouds will be imprinted onto the reflected light spectrum, which can be used as a proxy to study the composition of cloudy and hazy planetary atmospheres (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Morley et al. 2015</ref>). In the absence of clouds, reflected light spectra probe deep into the atmosphere. In summary, reflected light studies complement the information gained from transit spectroscopy, and are an extremely powerful tool to understand the bulk composition of exoplanets, their energy budget and meteorology, in particular for cloudy and hazy atmospheres.</p><p>Furthermore, the technique we propose allows for the direct detection of the planet, and thus permits to break down the mass-inclination degeneracy resulting from using radial velocities as a detection method. Also, when compared to methods that involve a combination of high spectral and spatial resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lovis et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Snellen et al. 2015</ref>), this method is insensitive to the target distance from the observer as it is not required to spatially resolve the star and planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>For this work we simulated ESPRESSO@VLT (in all 3 modes) and HIRES@ELT observational runs of the star+planet systems presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, selected from the exoplanet.eu database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>) as discussed in Section 3. For each of the selected planets, we simulated three different atmospheric models.</p><p>We attempted the recovery of the wavelength dependence of the planetary albedo function from all simulated observations. On all cases we performed a reduced χ 2 comparison of the recovered colour dependent albedo functions against the atmospheric models presented Section 3.5 plus a grey/flat albedo model with A g = 0.2. The results for χ 2 are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 5 to 10</ref>. Regardless of the simulated instrument or atmosphere, the lowest reduced χ 2 value (in bold) corresponds to the simulated model, which confirms that the technique is viable.</p><p>The results we present of this work are encouraging, as they exemplify the power of the cross correlation function technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Martins et al. 2015</ref>) as a powerful tool to characterize exoplanetary atmospheres from the optical reflected spectra from exoplanets. The major results of this work can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• the CCF technique permits the recovery of the wavelength dependence of reflected spectra of exoplanets, and consequently their albedo function;</p><p>• the CCF technique is able to distinguish between possible albedo configurations and hint at the planetary atmosphere composition;</p><p>• it will be possible to probe at planetary atmospheres for planets in a vastly accessible orbital parameter range;</p><p>• even in cases where a low number of wavelength bins is possible, the ratio between the albedo at redder and bluer wavelengths should help constrain possible chemical and physical atmospheric configurations.</p><p>• as close as 2018, ESPRESSO should already be able to recover the albedo function from hot Jupiter class exoplanets with a few hours of exposure time (e.g. 51 Pegasi b with 1h);</p><p>• the advent of HIRES will allow to probe smaller planets (e.g. hot Neptunes and Super Earths) with just with a few hours of exposure time (e.g. HD 76700 b with around 5h and 55 Cnc e with about 4h) However, the albedo from an exoplanet is not the only factor that modulates the reflected spectrum from an exoplanet. An exciting prospect to further characterize the planet comes from the observation of the phase function of the planet and how it varies with wavelength. This function describes the light curve of a planet as a function of orbital phase. It depends not only on the fraction of the planet illuminated by the host star but also on the general scattering properties of the planet's atmosphere.</p><p>The detection of the reflected optical from exoplanets is a daunting task which requires a broad spectral coverage and a extremely high-resolution to achieve the level of S/N we require, as well as an extremely high PSF stability for long periods of time. This can be achieved with ESPRESSO@VLT, HIRES@ELT and similar observing facilities, which will lead the way towards a more detailed characterization of exoplanets and their atmospheres. The sheer collecting power of giant telescopes, combined with the precision and stability of next generation high-resolution spectrographs, will put researchers in a position to not only look at the reflected light from exoplanets, but use it to characterize their atmospheres in great detail. A very bright future awaits exoplanetology indeed.  Figure 13. Distribution of the recovered albedo functions from the simulated ESPRESSO (MHR mode -4UT) observations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: OPTIMAL OBSERVATION WINDOWS AND DETECTABILITY</head><p>The reflected signal of the planet is small, and to detect it it is essential to choose orbital phases where that signal is close to its maximum. As per equation Eq. 2, this occurs at superior conjunction (or opposition in case of a transiting planet). Unfortunately at that point of the orbit, both the planet and star will have matching radial velocities and thus be difficult -if not impossible -to separate. Even with the precise stellar template built with the CCF technique, fluctuations on the stellar flux will leave residuals in the radial velocity domain at the stellar radial velocity residuals with amplitudes comparable or superior to the planetary signal. Thus, to maximize detectability of the planetary signal, it is necessary to choose orbital phases where i) the flux from the planet is as close to maximum as possible; ii) the planetary and stellar signals can be separated. In this work we have defined that the minimum distance in the radial velocity domain to be of 20 km s −1 , which corresponds to about 3 times the FWHM of the stellar CCF. This value should be enough to avoid the region where the residuals from the removal of the stellar CCF are larger in amplitude than the planetary signal.</p><p>We define detectability of the reflected signal from the planet as the S/N of the recovered planetary CCF over the spectral range of the selected instrument:</p><p>where A CCF is the ratio of the amplitudes of the recovered planetary CCF by the stellar one (over the whole spectral range of the instrument) and σ noise the noise of the final CCF.</p><p>We computed the detectability of the planetary CCF from 51 Pegasi b after 10h worth of planetary observations with ESPRESSO in HR mode. Please note that although we are focusing on a single star+planet+instrument setup, the conclusions will be valid for all the simulations in this article. The top panel of <ref type="figure">figure A1</ref> represents the expected detectability as a function of the orbital phase, starting at inferior conjunction. We estimated A CCF from Eq. 2 using the planetary parameters defined in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and assuming a Lambert phase function. The radial velocity of both the planet and star were also computed using planetary parameters defined in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. σ noise was computed from the HARPS ETC for a 300s exposure with the stellar parameters <ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>. Detectability of the planetary signal from the 51 Pegasi system for 10h worth of observation of as a function: i) <ref type="bibr">[Top]</ref> of average orbital phase i) <ref type="bibr">[Bottom]</ref> the distance between the planet and its host in the radial velocity domain. defined in <ref type="table">Table 2 and settings from Table 3</ref> and extrapolated for 10h worth of observations, the telescope diameter and ESPRESSO's increase in sensitivity. The bottom panel of <ref type="figure">figure A1</ref> represents the expected detectability as a function of the distance between the planet and star in the radial velocity domain. The arrows represent the movement of the planetary signal along its orbit and located at orbital phases at 15 degrees intervals starting at inferior conjunction (φ = 0).</p><p>We have defined our optimal windows of observation as the orbital phases between 15 and 45 degrees on each side of superior conjunction (i.e., orbital phases with 0.37 φ 0.46 or 0.54 φ 0.63, assuming that the inferior conjunction/transit phase corresponds to φ = 0 and one full orbit corresponds to ∆φ = 1). These can be seen as the green areas in <ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>. In the case of 51 Pegasi b, this corresponds to orbital phases where the detectability of the planet varies between 75 per cent and 95 per cent of the maximum detectability (at superior conjunction). Please note that this is an ideal case where we assumed all observations to be at the same phase, hardly the case for real observation. However, these can be scheduled in to occur in the optimal windows defined above and as such the detectability should always be above 75 per cent of the maximum detectability. The red area represents the radial velocity range into which we assume the planetary and stellar CCF cannot be separated.</p><p>This paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.</p></div>			</div>
