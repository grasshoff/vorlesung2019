				<p>The Kepler survey provides a statistical census of planetary systems out to the habitable zone. Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of η ⊕ = 36 ± 14%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than ≈ 8% and ≈ 3% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler exoplanet survey has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems around other stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borucki 2017</ref>). During the first four years of the mission, hereafter Kepler , it discovered thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates, the majority of which are smaller than Neptune and orbit close to their hosts stars. Because transit surveys can detect only a small fraction of the exoplanets, a completeness correction is necessary to understand the true population of exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha 2014</ref>).</p><p>The planet occurrence rate, defined as the average number of planets per star, is typically found to be of order unity for planets in the orbital period and planet radius range detectabe with <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Youdin 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the survey detection efficiency of the Kepler mission (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Christiansen et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Christiansen et al. , 2016</ref>. While earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of sunlike stars are just below the detection limits of <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Thompson et al. 2018)</ref>, occurrence rates of earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, η ⊕ , can be estimated by considering smaller M and K dwarf stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, 2015</ref> or by extrapolating from shorter orbital periods and/or larger planet radii <ref type="bibr">(Pe- tigura et al. 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The exoplanet population discovered by the Kepler mission has been characterized in great detail. Key findings include that planet occurrence rates increase with decreasing planet size ( <ref type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</ref>) and remains roughly constant for planets smaller than 3 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Petigura et al. 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Morton &amp; Swift 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mulders et al. 2015b</ref>). Recently, a gap in the planet radius distribution has been identified around 1.5 − 2.0 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr">Fulton et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van Eylen et al. 2017</ref>). The occurrence of sub-Neptunes increases with distance from the host star up to an orbital period of ∼ 10 days, after which it remains roughly constant ( <ref type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a</ref>), in contrast to planets larger than Neptune whose occurrence increases with orbital period <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dong &amp; Zhu 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The presence of multiple transiting planets around the same star provides important additional constraints on planetary orbital architectures. The large number of observed systems with multiple transiting planets indicate that planets are preferentially located in systems with small mutual inclinations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lissauer et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Fang &amp; Margot 2012)</ref>. Their orbital spacings follow a peaked distribution without a clear preference for being in orbital resonances <ref type="bibr">(Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>). However, the majority of planets in multi-planet system are not transiting, and modifying planetary occurrence rates from those based on the observed planetary architectures to account for non-transiting or otherwise undetected planets is not straightforward. The true multiplicity of planetary systems can only be constrained from the observed multiplicity and making assumptions about their mutual inclination distribution <ref type="bibr">(Tremaine &amp; Dong 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, see also Brakensiek &amp; Ragozzine 2016</ref>. Ensemble populations of systems with six or more planets with mutual inclinations of a few degrees provide a good match to the observed population of multi-planet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fang &amp; Margot 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fab- rycky et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ballard &amp; Johnson 2016)</ref>. However, these simulations under-predict the number of single transiting systems by a factor 2, indicating that an additional populations of planets must be present that is either intrinsically single or has high mutual inclinations.</p><p>The occurrence rates and planetary architectures place strong constraints on planet formation models (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Hansen &amp; Murray 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dawson et al. 2016</ref>). However, the quantitative comparison of planet formation and orbital evolution models and the observed exoplanet population has been greatly complicated by observational biases. Therefore, published comparisons resorted to trying to explain the presence of specific planet sub-populations by identifying processes that can give rise to such planets. While these studies are essential, such qualitative comparisons can not make full use of the wealth of information represented by the overall exoplanet population statistics. To address this limitation we introduce EPOS 1 , the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, that provides a Python interface comparing planet population synthesis models to exoplanet survey data, taking into account the detection biases that skew the observed distributions of planet properties. EPOS uses a forward modeling approach to simulate observable exoplanet populations and constrain their properties via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation using emcee <ref type="bibr">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>), and has already been employed in two different studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kopparapu et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pascucci et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we verify this approach using parametric models of planet populations, that we compare to the final data release of the Kepler mission, DR25. From this, we are able to make a statistical evaluation of the properties of exoplanetary systems. Among other results we report on the location of the innermost planet in planetary systems to place our Solar System in the context of exoplanet systems. We examine how the in- nermost planets in most of the Kepler systems are located much closer in than Mercury and Venus. In an upcoming paper, we will use EPOS to make a direct comparison between planet formation models and exoplanet populations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CODE DESCRIPTION</head><p>The Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, EPOS, employs a forward modeling approach to constrain exoplanet populations through the following iterative procedure:</p><p>Step 1: Define a distribution of planetary systems from analytic forms for planet occurrence rates and planetary architectures or from a planet population synthesis model.</p><p>Step 2: From this derive a transiting planet population by assigning random orientations to each system and evaluating which planets transit their host stars.</p><p>Step 3: Determine which of the transiting planets would be detected by Kepler , accounting for detection efficiency.</p><p>Step 4: Compare the detectable planet population with exoplanet survey data using a summary statistic.</p><p>Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 until the simulated detectable planet population matches the observed planet population to constrain the intrinsic distribution of planetary systems.</p><p>In this section we will describe each step in greater detail. Steps 1-4 take less than a second to run on a singlecore CPU, allowing for an efficient sampling of the parameter space using MCMC methods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> summarizes these steps and their quantitative implementation in a flowchart. A description of all mathematical symbols used in this paper can be found in the Appendix, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Step 1: Planet Distributions</head><p>Planet populations are generated using a Monte Carlo simulation by random draws from a multi-dimensional probability distribution function, f , which represents the intrinsic distribution of planets and planetary systems. We simulate a planet survey equal in size to the Kepler survey, roughly 160, 000 stars. The parametric descriptions of f are based on studies of planet occurrence rate and planet multiplicity from Kepler . Distributions based on planet formation models will be described in an upcoming paper. Here we describe two parametric descriptions for the planet population f that correspond to two different modes in EPOS:</p><p>Occurrence rate mode: Simulates only the distribution of planet radius, R, and orbital period, P , as f = f pl (R, P ). This mode is similar to occurrence rate calculations that estimate the average number of planets per star, η, in a certain period and radius range. This mode can also be used to estimate the planet mass distribution for comparison with microlensing data, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pascucci et al. (2018)</ref> for details.</p><p>Multi-planet mode: Simulates multiple planets per system, taking into account their relative spacing and mutual inclination, ∆i, to estimate orbital architectures. The properties of each planet in the system are drawn from a distribution f = f k (R, P, i), where i is the planet's orbital inclination and k is an index for each planet in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Occurrence rate mode</head><p>The central assumption we use in this paper is that the planet occurrence rate distribution is a separable function in planet radius and orbital period,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f pl (P, R) ∝ f P (P )f R (R).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The distribution is normalized such that integral over the simulated period and planet radius range equals the number of planets per star, η:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η = P R f pl (P, R) dlogP dlogR<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The planet orbital period distribution is described by a broken power law</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f P (P ) =    (P/P break ) a P , if P &lt; P break (P/P break ) b P , otherwise (3)</formula><p>where the break reflects the observed flattening of subNeptune occurrence rates around an orbital period of ten days (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a</ref>). In this example we use a P = 1.5 for the power law index of the increase interior to P break = 10 days, and a flat occurrence rate b P = 0, at longer periods but we will refine these values later.</p><p>The planet radius distribution function is similarly described by a broken power law</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f R (R) =    (R/R break ) a R , if R &lt; R break (R/R break ) b R , otherwise (4)</formula><p>reflecting the observed increase of small planets with decreasing radius (b R = −4), and the "plateau" (a R = 0) of constant occurrence rates for planets smaller than R break = 3 R ⊕ (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Petigura et al. 2013b</ref>).</p><p>The probability distribution function of planet occurrence thus has 7 free parameters (η, P break , a P , b P , R break , a R , b R ). An example for η = 2 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Multi-planet mode</head><p>In its multi-planet mode EPOS simulates a planetary system for each star. Each planet in the system, denoted by subscript k, is characterized by its radius, orbital period, and orbital inclination with respect to the observer, i, and there are m planets per system. Because the properties of planets in multi-planet systems tend to be correlated, we draw a typical set of planet properties for each system (R s , P s , i s ) on which the properties of each planet in the system (R k , P k , i k ) are dependent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f pl,k (R, P, i|R s , P s , i s ) ∝f R,k (R|R s ) f P,k (P |P s ) f i,k (i|i s ). (5)</formula><p>where we make the assumption that distributions of planet size, period, and inclination are not interdependent. Previous studies have shown that planets in multiplanet systems tend to be more similar in size and more regularly spaced than random pairings from the overall distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Millholland et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weiss et al. 2018)</ref> and have low mutual inclinations of a few degrees (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>). This motivates our choice to not <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Illustration of the planetary system architecture. Pin denotes the orbital period of the innermost planet, while P denotes the period ratio between adjacent planets. The system is inclined with respect to the observer by an angle is, and each planet has a mutual inclination δi with respect to this system inclination. Note that each planet has a different mutual inclination and therefore a different inclination with respect to the line of sight. All orbits are assumed to be circular and the ellipiticity of the projected orbits are due to their respective inclinations. The probability distributions for is, δi, P, and Pin are described in the text.</p><p>draw the properties of each planet independently from a distribution f pl (R, P, i).</p><p>The system properties (R s , P s , i s ) are drawn from a distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g pl (R s , P s , i s ) ∝ g R (R s )g P (P s )g i (i s )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where once again we made the assumption that the distributions of planet size, period, and inclination are separable functions of each variable. The distribution of g is normalized such that the integral over the simulated parameter range is equal to the fraction of stars with planetary systems, η s :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">η s = P R i g pl (P, R, i) dlogP dlogR di (7)</formula><p>The parameterization of the system and planet properties are described below. The system architecture is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> Orbital Inclination -A planet's orbital inclination with the respect to the line of sight, i p , is dependent on the inclination of the system, i s , the mutual inclination of the planet with respect to that system, δi, and the longitude of the ascending node, δΩ. We assume that the planet mutual inclinations, δi, follow a Rayleigh distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f δi,k (δi) = δi/∆ie −δi 2 /(2∆i 2 ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ∆i is the mode of the mutual inclination distribution of planetary orbits, which is typically 1 − 3 • ( <ref type="bibr">Fab- rycky et al. 2014</ref>). The distribution of system inclinations with respect to the observer, i s , is proportionate to cos(i).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g i (i s ) ∝ cos(i s )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where i s = 0 is an edge-on orbit. The distribution of planet inclinations with respect to the observer is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f i,k (i|i s ) = |i s + f δi,k (δi) cos(πδΩ)| (10)</formula><p>where δΩ is the longitude of the ascending node with respect to the observer.</p><p>Orbital Period -We assume that the planets are regularly spaced in the logarithm of the orbital period, with the location of the first planet (k = 0) defining the location of additional planets (k = 1...m) in the system. The period ratio of adjacent planets is denoted by P k ≡ P k+1 /P k where P k+1 is always the planet with the larger orbital period.</p><p>The location of the first planet in the system, (P 0 ≡ P s ), is parameterized by the broken power-law distribution described by Equation 3, but with a steeper decline in planet occurrence with orbital period (b P 0) that we will constrain in the fitting process.</p><p>Observed orbital spacings follow a broad range in period ratios, and we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Malhotra (2015)</ref> in parameterizing the distribution of dimensionless spacings,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D k = 2 P 2/3 k −1 P 2/3 k</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+1</head><p>, as a log-normal distribution. The orbital period distribution of the k-th planet in the system is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f P,k (P |P k−1 ) = 1 √ 2πσ e (log D k −D) 2 2σ 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with respect to the orbital period of the previous planet, P k−1 . D and σ are free parameters that characterize the median and width of the distribution, with typical values of D ≈ −0.4 and σ ≈ 0.2.</p><p>Planet Radius -We assume all planets in the system are of equal size</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f R,k (R|R s ) = g R (R s )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where we assume the radius distribution follows Equation 4. We choose equal-sized planets over randomly assigned sizes because planets in multi-planet systems tend to be of similar size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mill- holland et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weiss et al. 2018</ref>). While there are observed trends of increasing planet size with orbital period, these trends are strongest at short orbital periods (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carrera et al. 2018</ref>) and for large planet sizes <ref type="bibr">(Cia- rdi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2016</ref>) that we will exclude from our observational comparison, see §2.4. Thus the number of free parameters describing the population of planetary systems is 11 (η, m, ∆i, P break ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a P , b P , D, σ, R break , a R , b R ).</formula></div>

In multi-planet mode, with η s ≈ 0.35 and m ≈ 6, the simulated sample {R, P, i} s consists of the same number of planets distributed across n s ≈ 40, 000 systems.

Next, the mutual inclination of the orbit of each planet in the system, δi p,k , is drawn from Equation 8. Then the longitude of the ascending node with respect to the observer, δΩ, is randomly drawn for each planet from a uniform distribution, δΩ = χ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Step 4: Observational Comparison</head><p>In this step we compare the simulated planet populations to the observed exoplanet properties to evaluate how well the simulated planet population reproduces the collection of observed planetary systems. We generate a set of summary statistics for both the simulated data and the Kepler survey. We evaluate the survey as a whole, and do not consider dependencies on stellar properties such as stellar mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a</ref>,b) or metallicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mulders et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Petigura et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>In occurrence rate mode, the summary statistics are the planet radius distribution, {R} d , the orbital period distribution {P } d , and the total number of planets, N . In multi-planet mode, additional summary statistics are calculated for the number of stars with k planets, N k , the period ratio distribution between adjacent planets, P, and the period of the innermost planet in the system, P in . We evaluate this summary statistic in the range of R = [0.5, 6]R ⊕ and P = [2, 400] days. These ranges exclude two regions where the assumptions of separability of parameters clearly breaks down. The maximum planet size of 6R ⊕ is chosen to exclude giant planets, which have a different distribution of orbital periods than sub-Neptunes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dong &amp; Zhu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Santerne et al. 2016</ref>), are less often part of multi-planet systems <ref type="bibr">(Stef- fen et al. 2012</ref>), or have very dissimilar sizes than other planets in the system ( <ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2016</ref>). The minimum orbital period of 2 days is chosen to exclude the photoevaporation desert (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lundkvist et al. 2016</ref>) where the planet-radius distribution deviates significantly from that at larger orbital periods. The other bounds are chosen because there are very few planet detection outside this range.</p><p>We then generate a summary statistic from the Kepler DR25 catalog. The planet candidate list is taken from <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. (2018)</ref>. We include only main sequence planet hosts by removing giant and sub-giant stars according to the effective temperature dependent surface gravity criterion in <ref type="bibr">(Huber et al. 2016</ref>). We also use a disposition score cut of 0.9 to select a more reliable sample of planet candidates (see <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2018</ref> for details). We account for the lower completeness of this high-reliability planet sample by explicitely taking into account the vetting completeness in the calculation of the survey detection efficiency.</p><p>The final list containing 3,041 planet candidates is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref>. The list contains 1,840 observed single systems and 324 double, 113 triple, 38 quadruple, 10 quintuples, and 2 sextuple systems within the region where the summary statistic is evaluated. Figure 10 shows how the summary statistics of planet radius and orbital period are generated from the detectable planet population (blue) and from the Kepler exoplanet population (orange). We compare the planet radius distributions and orbital period distributions separately. While this approach ignores any covariances between planet radius and orbital period that are present in the Kepler data, it is consistent with the assumption made in Eq. 1 that these functions are separable. We quantify the distance between the two distributions using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test and calculated the associated probabilities, p P and p R , that the observed and simulated distributions are drawn from the same data. We will minimize the differences between these distributions in the fitting step.</p></div>

As discussed in the previous section, the observed planet populations are subject to detection biases, and a proper comparison requires comparing the observed distribution to the simulated distribution, which is what EPOS does. All summary statistics are calculated in the same way for observed planets (orange lines) and simulated planets (blue histograms) from the set of orbital periods and host star IDs. We use 2-sample KS tests to calculate the probabilities that the distribution of inner planet orbital periods (p in ) and orbital period ratios (p P ) are drawn from the same distribution as the observations.

For comparison, the red line shows a simulation where planetary systems are not regularly spaced, which is constructed by ran-  domly drawing m = 7 planets from the period-radius distribution of Eq. 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>By using EPOS in parametric mode find that the planet occurrence rate of the Kepler mission are well described by a broken power-law in orbital period and planet radius in the region 2 &lt; P &lt; 400 days and 0.5 &lt; R ⊕ &lt; 6. We estimate the planet occurrence rate, the average number of planets per star, to be η = 2.4 +0.5 −0.5 in this regime and η = 4.9 +1.3 −1.2 in the simulated range (0.4 &lt; P &lt; 730 days and 0.3 &lt; R ⊕ &lt; 20). This number is higher than the occurrence rate calculated from inverse detection efficiencies (η inv = 1.40 ± 0.03), which underestimate the occurrence rates for small planets at long orbital periods.

The other half of planets appear as single-planet transiting systems, which we model as multi-planet systems with isotropically distributed orbital inclinations.

While the break in planet occurrence rate around 10 days has been previously connected to the disk inner edge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lee &amp; Chiang 2017)</ref>, this is the first time a peak in the occurrence rate distribution of sub-Neptunes has been identified. The posterior distribution of the innermost planet peaks at an orbital period of 12±2 days and decays towards shorter and longer orbital period with a power-law index of a P = 1.6 +0.4 −0.2 and b P = −0.9 +0.4 −0.5 , respectively. The decay towards long orbital periods is surprising, since planet occurrence rates are constant or slightly increasing in this range (green line). Planets exterior to the break are therefore mostly the 2nd, 3rd, etc., planet in the system. We also show that systems with inner planets at orbital periods of 100 days are intrinsically rare, and we discuss the implications for planet formation theories and the origins of the solar system below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">How rare is the solar system?</head><p>Our modeling analysis indicates that multi-planet systems without planets interior to P in ∼ 100 days are intrinsically rare. We estimate, based on parametric distributions of planet parameters, that 8 +10 −5 % of planetary systems have no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and 3 +5 −2 % have no planet interior to Venus. This implies that solar system may simply be in the tail of the distribution of exoplanet systems.</p><p>On the other hand, this comparison with the solar system is made under the assumption that planet or- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>. Marginalized orbital period distribution of the innermost planet in the system. The green line indicates the distribution of all planets in the system. bital architectures (inclinations, spacings, inner planet location) are independent of radius and orbital period. This assumption will need to be verified with additional data. The orbital architectures of the Kepler planetary systems are most constrained by planets that are larger and closer in, typically P ∼ 10 days and R ∼ 2 R ⊕ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref>. A solar system analogue, if detected, would most likely appear as a single transiting systems in the Kepler data due the low probability that multiple terrestrial planets transit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brakensiek &amp; Ragozzine 2016)</ref>. Hence, we can not rule out that the solar system may be part of a population of planetary systems with different orbital characteristics than those detected by the Kepler mission.</p><p>We make a direct estimate of how many planetary systems without planets interior to Mercury or Venus could be present in the Kepler data, without extrapolating the distribution of orbital periods from closer-in planets. We generate a population of planetary systems with similar orbital properties as the solar system where we place the innermost planet at the orbital period of mercury (or Venus) but otherwise keep the same parameters as in the best-fit model. Such a simulated planet population with η s = 67% and f iso = 0 matches planet occurrence rates exterior to P = 50 days for P in = 88 days. The simulated observations predict 30 multi-planet systems with an innermost planet exterior to P = 50 days, while only 4 are observed. This indicates that if a population of planetary systems without planets interior to Mercury existed it would be detectable in the Kepler data. We do note that most detectable planets in this range are larger than one earth radius, so the data do not directly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>. Best-fit distribution of planetary system properties from Kepler (blue) compared to the solar system terrestrial planets (red letters). The inclinations of the terrestrial planets are with respect to the invariable plane. The orbital periods, radii, inclinations, and period ratios of the terrestrial planets lie near the peak of the distribution of kepler systems. The only notable exception is the orbital period of the innermost planet, where Mercury (93th percentile) and Venus (97th percentile) lie in the tail of the distribution. constrain true solar system analogues. Using a mixture of co-planar systems and highly inclined systems (which appear as intrinsically single), we can rule out that more than 10% of systems (f iso = 0.9) have P in = 88 days and ∆i = 2.</p><p>We repeat this exercise for systems where the innermost planet shares the orbital period of Venus (P = 225 days). None of these simulated systems would be detectable as multi-planet systems, and no planetary systems with an orbital period larger than 150 days are detected with Kepler. Hence we can not rule out that the Kepler exoplanet population contains a significant population of multi-planet systems without planets interior to Venus, though we do not find evidence that such a population exists.</p><p>Overall, the solar system seems to be a typical planetary system in most diagnostics of orbital architectures (planetary radii, periods, period ratios, inclinations, and planets per system, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>). The only clear difference is in the period of the innermost planet where the solar system is an outlier. While the lack of superearths/mini-Neptunes in the solar system is also notable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Martin &amp; Livio 2015)</ref>, earth-sized planets are not intrinsically rare, and the size of the terrestrial planets does not make the solar system an outlier in the exoplanet distribution.</p></div>

Better observational constraints on the stellar properties are expected based on parallax measurments from the ESO Gaia mission. As a consistency check, we have repeated all calculations in this paper with the improved stellar radii and giant star classification from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berger et al. 2018</ref>). The best-fit parameteric distributions are consistent with those in table 1 within errors, and the habitable zone planet occurrence rate of η ⊕ = 40 +14 −14 % is not significantly different. The habitable zone planet occurrence rates we estimate is consistent with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> based on the Q1-Q16 catalog, but about a factor four higher than of the earliest estimate based on Kepler data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Petigura et al. (2013a)</ref>, which we attribute to an improved understanding of detection efficiency of Kepler . This rate is comparable to that of M dwarfs estimated with inverse detection efficiency methods <ref type="bibr">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>, though we leave a comparison between M dwarfs and FGK stars with consistent methodology for a future paper.</p><p>The majority of simulated planets at long orbital periods (P ∼ 100 days) are not intrinsically single, but are part of multi-planet systems where the innermost planets are typically at an orbital period of P ∼ 10 days. While the multi-planet statistics do not directly constrain planetary systems of earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars, the presence of planets on orbital periods of 10 days does provide a way to identify targets for future direct imaging missions, such as the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kipping &amp; Lam (2017)</ref> have shown that the presence of transiting planets at short orbital periods increases the chance of finding transiting planets at larger orbital periods. Our analysis indicates that, because most planets in multi-planet systems are not transiting, the probability of finding any planet (transiting or non-transiting) is even higher. For example, the detection of an earthmass planets at an orbital period of ten days with radial velocity measurements indicates a higher probability of finding a planet in the habitable zone. Depending on whether single-transiting planets are intrinsically single or highly-inclined multiples, 50 − 100% of systems with close-in planets may also have planets in the habitable zone.</p></div>

This location may reflect either the inner edge of the region where planets form <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lee &amp; Chiang 2017)</ref> or that of a planet trap where planet migration stalls <ref type="bibr">(Terquem &amp; Papaloizou 2007)</ref>. While the break in planet occurrence at ∼ 10 days has been attributed to the disk inner edge before ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mulders et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lee &amp; Chiang 2017)</ref>, the peak in the location of the innermost planet presents solid evidence that there is a preferred location for planet formation at 0.1 au, rather than a continuum of location between 0.1-1 au. In particular, this result is inconsistent with a wide regions between 0.1 and 1 au acting as a trap for individual planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dittkrist et al. 2014)</ref>, and is more reminiscent of inward migration of multiple planets where the first planet is trapped at the inner disk edge and halts the migration of other planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cossou et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coleman &amp; Nelson 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Izidoro et al. 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Do most stars have planets?</head><p>Our analysis confirms that the average number of planets per (sun-like) star is larger than one ( §2.1.1). However, this does not imply that most stars have planets, since planets can be unevenly distributed among stars. In ( §2.1.1) we show that η s = 67 +17 −12 % of stars can host multi-planet systems. An important assumption we made is that the apparent excess of single transits is because f iso = 38% of multi-planet systems have high mutual inclinations. The inclination distribution of exoplanets can not be uniquely constrained from transit survey data <ref type="bibr">(Tremaine &amp; Dong 2012)</ref>. Different assumptions on the mutual inclination distribution lead to different estimates of the fraction of stars with planets, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref>.</p><p>On the conservative end, the highly-inclined planets in otherwise coplanar multi-planet systems could contribute to the observed number of single transits ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  20</ref>, right panel). In this case, the dichotomy is an artifact of the assumption that mutual inclinations follow a Rayleigh distribution. A distribution with a larger tail towards higher inclinations could possibly fit the multiplanet statistics with a single population. In this case, the fraction of stars with planets drops to ∼ 41%. Alternatively, a population of intrinsically single planets could contribute to the observed single transiting systems ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref>, right panel). In this case, the estimated fraction of stars with planets increases to unity.</p><p>A way of discriminating between both scenarios may be the use of stellar obliquity. Transiting planets with high mutual inclinations or isotropic distributions have large obliquities with respect to the line of sight. There are indications that the stellar obliquity is larger for single-transit systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Morton &amp; Winn 2014</ref>), indicating that they may have highly inclined orbits. Several mechanisms have been proposed to disrupt initially coplanar systems, reducing their multiplicity and/or increasing their mutual inclinations, and giving rise to the population of single transiting systems. These mechanisms include dynamical instabilities within systems <ref type="bibr">(Volk &amp; Gladman 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pu &amp; Wu 2015)</ref>, external perturbations from giant planets or stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Johansen et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lai &amp; Pu 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hansen 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Izidoro et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cai et al. 2018</ref>) and host-star misalignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Spalding &amp; Batygin 2016)</ref>. Alternatively, planets may form as intrinsically single systems in half the cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Moriarty &amp; Ballard 2016)</ref>. Additional constraints on the single planet population are needed to constrain these scenarios. However, we stress that roughly half of the observed single transiting systems are part of multi-planet systems and have non-transiting or non-detected planets in the system, and hence the sample of "singles" is diluted with multi-planets, weakening any potential trends. Transit timing variations can also be used to detect additional non-transiting planets in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The Kepler mission only detects planets out to ∼ 1 au and down to ∼ 0.5R ⊕ . Hence, any estimate of the fraction of stars with planets is likely to be a lower limit. We do not see a clear indication that planet occurrence rate decreases towards the detection limits of Kepler. While planet occurrence rates calculated using the inverse detection efficiency seem to decrease for earth-size and smaller planets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig 15)</ref>, this is also the region where the Kepler exoplanet list becomes incomplete. The posterior planet size distribution does not show this trend and is almost flat in log R p , indicating that planets below the detection efficiency of Kepler could be extremely common. Since planetary systems tend to have planets of similar size <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Millholland et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weiss et al. 2018</ref>), planetary systems with only planets smaller than the detection limit would be missed. Extending the planet size distribution down to the size of Ceres (0.07 R ⊕ ) would increase the fraction of stars with planets to 100%.</p><p>We find that the orbital period distribution of subNeptunes is nearly flat in logarithm of orbital period. However, planets at long orbital periods are mostly members of systems with planets also at shorter orbital periods: there is no evidence for a large population of planetary systems with only long-period planets. Extrapolating the distribution of planetary systems to orbital periods larger than a year would add planets to existing systems, increasing the number of planets per star but not the fraction of stars with planets. Of course, such an extrapolation does not take into account the presence of additional populations of planets, which could be important, for example, if planets form more frequently at the snow line (exterior to 1 au). Giant planets orbit 10 − 20% of sun-like stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>), most of them beyond 1 au. Microlensing surveys hint at the existence of a population of Neptune-mass planets around a significant fraction of M dwarfs <ref type="bibr">(Cas- san et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Suzuki et al. 2016</ref>). Since these populations remain mostly undetected in the Kepler survey, it is not clear if they belong to the same stars, though there are some indications that they do ( <ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY</head><p>We present the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, EPOS, a Python code to constrain the properties of exoplanet populations from biased survey data. We showcase how planet occurrence rates and orbital architectures can be constrained from the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We find that:</p><p>• The Kepler exoplanet population between orbital periods of 2−400 days and planet radii of 0.5−6R ⊕ are well described by broken power-laws. The planet occurrence rate in this regime is η = 2.4 ± 0.5 consistent with previous works. The estimated planet occurrence rate in the habitable zone is η ⊕ = 36 ± 14%.</p><p>• The observed multi-planet frequencies are consistent with ensemble populations that are a mix of nearly co-planar systems and a population of planets whose orbital architectures are unconstrained, consistent with the previously reported Kepler dichotomy. 62 ± 8% of exoplanets are in systems with 6 or more planets, orbiting 42% of sun-like stars. The remaining 38 ± 8% of exoplanets could be intrinsically single planets or be part of multiplanet systems with high mutual inclinations, raising the fraction of stars with planets to somewhere between 45% and 100%.</p><p>• The mutual inclinations of planetary orbits can be described by a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of i = 2 ± 1 • . The spacing between adjacent planets follows a wide distribution with a peak at an orbital period ratio P = 1.8, though detection biases shift the peak of the observed distribution to shorter orbital period ratios.</p><p>• The distribution of the innermost planet in the system peaks at an orbital period of P ≈ 10 days. Planetary systems without planets interior to Mercury's and Venus' orbit are rare at 8% and 3%, respectively.</p><p>The EPOS code presented in this paper provides a first step in a larger effort to constrain planetary orbital architectures from exoplanet populations. The next step will be to use more complex models of planetary system architectures based on planet formation models. Future directions include incorporating additional exoplanet survey data from radial velocity, microlensing, and direct imaging, as well as from transit surveys such as K2 and TESS.</p><p>We thank an anonymous referee for a constructive review of the manuscript. We also thank Shannon Dulz   <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Coughlin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Coughlin 2017</ref>) was designed to discriminate between real transiting events and instrumental or astrophysical signals that mimic that of a transiting planet, a process called "vetting". For planets with few transits and a low signal-to-noise ratio, vetting is a trade-off between detecting planets (completeness) or removing false positives (reliability). A planet candidate sample with high completeness has a low reliability, and vice versa. The Robovetter was calibrated by evaluating the ability to identify the signals of a number of simulated transiting events to better quantify the efficiency and confidence with which planets can be detected.</p><p>Each planet candidate is assigned a disposition score between 0 and 1, which can be used to create a more reliable sample (fewer false positives classified as planet candidates) at the the costs of having a less complete sample (more planets classified as false positives), see <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. (2018)</ref> for details. For EPOS we opt to use a planet sample with high reliability by using a disposition score cut of 0.9, reducing the sample completeness which, however, can be quantified and corrected for as we discuss below. The score cut of 0.9 was chosen to eliminate the peak of false positives in the habitable zone that coincides with the orbital period of the spacecraft.</p><p>An empirical procedure for estimating the vetting completeness is described in <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. (2018)</ref>, based on injection of simulated transits into the Kepler data (Christiansen 2017) and analyzed by the Robovetter (Coughlin 2017). We downloaded the Robovetter results for simulated planet injections (group 1) from the Kepler simulated data page <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . We removed all injections not on main-sequence stars according to the prescription in <ref type="bibr">Huber et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>We only considered injections inside the orbital period and radius range where we use EPOS (P = [0.5, 730] days and R = [0.3, 20] R ⊕ ). There are 44981 injections, of which 77% (34558) are classified as planet candidates and 43% <ref type="bibr">(19247)</ref> have a disposition score &gt; 0.9.</p><p>The top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> shows the vetting completeness, the fraction of injections classified as planet candidates with a score larger than 0.9, binned to the same grid as the survey detection efficiency. Planet injections are not equally distributed across this parameter range, with the majority of injections around sub-Neptunes at long orbital periods, as shown in the top right panel. The vetting completeness is ∼ 75% at orbital periods less than roughly 50 days and decreases below 25% at the longest orbital periods. The completeness also drops below 25% for giant planets, though this is most likely an artifact of those planets only being injected around the most noisy stars, see <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. (2018)</ref>, and does not reflect a real decrease in detectability of giant planets in the Kepler pipeline.</p><p>We parametrize the vetting completeness to obtain a smooth distribution of radius and orbital period that covers all of the regions we are simulating with EPOS. We use a functional form for the vetting completenss, f vet , that is a double broken power-law:</p><p>f vet = c f vet,P (P ) f vet,R (R)</p><p>with f vet,P (P ) =    (P/P break ) a P , if P &lt; P break (P/P break ) b P , otherwise</p><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">f vet,P (R) =    (R/R break ) a R , if R &lt; R break (R/R break ) b R , otherwise.<label>(B3)</label></formula><p>We find the best-fit parameters using scipy.optimize.curve fit, where we minimize the difference between the measured and parametrized vetting completeness over all grid cells. The best-fit solution is shown in the bottom left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> and the bottom right panel shows the residuals per grid cell. The best-fit parameters are c = 0.88 ± 0.08, P break = 53 ± 8 days, a P = −0.07 ± 0.03, b P = −0.39 ± 0.02, R break = 5.7 ± 2.1 R ⊕ , a R = 0.19 ± 0.03, and b R = −2.7 ± 6.2. The break in the power-law with orbital period corresponds to the decreased detection efficiency at long orbital periods as documented in <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. (2018)</ref>; Coughlin (2017). The break in the power-law of planet radius corresponds to a decreased detection efficiency for giant planets. However, as mentioned above, this is likely an artifact of the way the injection tests were defined, and there is no reason to assume that the low vetting efficiency for giant planets is a real feature ( <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2018</ref>). Therefore, we do no include the power-law index radius break in EPOS. Instead, we assume the planet radius dependence of the detection is described by the power-law in planet radius that was fitted to the small planets. This yields a vetting efficiency of with P break = 53, which is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
