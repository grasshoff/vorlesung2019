			<abstract>
				<p>Several tens of white dwarfs are known to host circumstellar discs of dusty debris, thought to arise from the tidal disruption of rocky bodies originating in the star&apos;s remnant planetary system. This paper investigates the evolution of such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor was a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are physically thin and flat, like Saturn&apos;s rings, their evolution is governed by Poynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc&apos;s effective viscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses 10 26 g, located in the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates the evolution, and mass is transported both in-and outwards. When outwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into new (mi-nor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets at the outer edge of Saturn&apos;s rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards by exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects through mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc&apos;s Roche-limit overflow recycles tens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body near 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc&apos;s outer edge. Hence, the recycling of a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass planet on a ∼10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old white dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies just outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently postulated to orbit WD 1145+017.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Several tens of white dwarfs (WDs) are known to exhibit excess near-and mid-IR emission, revealing the presence of circumstellar dust (see Farihi 2016 for a recent review). A few of these systems also show double-peaked emission lines of metals, which indicate that metallic gas is present as well (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gänsicke et al. 2006</ref>). The estimated radial location of this circumstellar material (r 1 R ; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Melis et al. 2010</ref>) is well inside the maximum stellar radius reached by the host star during its asymptotic-giant-branch phase, meaning that the material must have emerged during the WD stage. More recently, the presence of circumstellar dust in the close vicinity of a WD was confirmed by the discovery of periodic, irregularly shaped dips in the light curve of WD 1145+017 that can be explained by transiting clouds of dust, orbiting the star at a distance of r ≈ 1 R ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>WDs that exhibit IR excess also show evidence of elements heavier than helium in their atmosphere. This atmospheric metal pollution is a much more common phenomenon than the IR excess, E-mail: lieshout@ast.cam.ac.uk <ref type="bibr">(RvL)</ref> present at detectable levels in 1/4 to 1/3 of WDs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zuckerman et al. 2010</ref>), most of which do not exhibit detectable IR excess. Given the short timescale on which metals sink out of the observable part of a WD's atmosphere (days to Myrs, depending on WD type and temperature; Koester 2009), their presence must be the result of ongoing or recent accretion. Spectroscopic analysis of polluted WDs can be used to quantify the mass accretion rates required to maintain the quickly sinking pollution and to obtain high-precision measurements of the elemental abundances of the accreted material. The latter has revealed that the composition of the accreted material in most polluted WDs broadly resembles that of the bulk Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gänsicke et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Jura &amp; Young 2014</ref>), although there are some interesting exceptions to this rule (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Farihi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Xu et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>Given these observational clues, the circumstellar material and atmospheric metal pollution are thought to originate from rocky bodies in the WD's remnant planetary system, which survives beyond the maximum asymptotic-giant-branch stellar radius (r 1 AU). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (top panel) summarises some of the current ideas on how mass may flow from this outer reservoir of large bodies to the WD's surface, traversing 5 orders of magnitude in radial distance and at least 12 in particle size. In the depicted scenario, rocky bodies are placed onto highly eccentric, star-grazing orbits, leading to their tidal disruption as they pass within the WD's Roche limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Jura 2003)</ref>. The debris produced in the tidal disruption is suggested to then spread along the orbit of the progenitor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Veras et al. 2014a</ref>), migrate towards the WD ( , and eventually form a compact circumstellar disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Jura 2003)</ref>, from which material accretes onto the WD. There are, however, still many unanswered questions regarding the exact nature of the bodies that undergo this process, the mechanism that places them on their extreme orbits, and the physics governing the subsequent steps of disc formation and accretion. In order to understand, for example, what the composition of WD pollution can tell us about exoplanetary materials, it is important to gain a better understanding of the processes governing the circumstellar environment of polluted WDs.</p><p>In the multistage process of transporting rocky material from a WD's remnant planetary system to its stellar surface, the debrisdisc phase offers a useful 'checkpoint' where theory can be compared with several sets of observations. Specifically, models of WD debris discs must be able to simultaneously explain the typical shape of the IR-excess spectral energy distribution and the mass accretion rates derived from the atmospheric metal pollution (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bonsor et al. 2017)</ref>. A popular disc model is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jura (2003)</ref>, who suggested that the discs are compact, opaque, and flat (much like Saturn's rings; see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, bottom panel, and Sect. 2.1.2), and showed that this model can reproduce the properties of the IR excess. Subsequent theoretical work on the behaviour of such discs has shown that the accretion of disc material due to PoyntingRobertson (PR) drag can explain the minimum mass accretion rates found for disc-bearing WDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Rafikov 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov 2011</ref>).</p><p>The global evolution of a WD debris disc depends critically on its total mass, but this quantity cannot be fully constrained from the observed IR excess, because the disc may be optically thick (as in the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jura 2003)</ref>. The discs are usually assumed to contain an amount of mass comparable to that of a Solar-System asteroid ( 10 23 g), based on the measured masses of atmospheric pollution, which reflect the amount of mass that was accreted within the last sinking timescale (see, e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> of Veras 2016, and references therein). Nonetheless, WD debris discs that are much more massive than 10 23 g may exist. For one, the distribution of pollution masses has a tail towards higher values, with the most polluted WD known, HE 0446-2531, possibly containing as much as 8 × 10 24 g (almost the mass of Pluto) of metals in its atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Friedrich et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Girven et al. 2012</ref>). Also, pollution masses only provide a lower limit on the potential disc mass, because (1) the accretion of metals onto the WD may have been going on for much longer than one sinking timescale and (2) additional mass may remain locked up in the circumstellar debris disc.</p><p>The evolution of very massive WD debris disc has not yet been investigated in detail and it is the subject of this paper. Specifically, we consider discs that have the flat geometry proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jura (2003)</ref>, but contain the mass equivalent of a dwarf planet, major moon, or terrestrial planet. A possible formation scenario for such discs may be the tidal disruption of a massive rocky body (see also Sect. 4.1), but our study is ambivalent to the processes that led to the formation of the disc, taking an already-formed disc as its starting point.</p><p>A physical process that we pay special attention to is viscous spreading. This process is insignificant for the evolution of lowmass WD debris discs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Farihi et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>, their Appendix A), but should be taken into account for the high-mass   <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

Note the break in the vertical axis; s denotes the typical radius of debris particles in the dusty disc.</p><p>discs that we consider here, because its effects become stronger at higher surface densities. From planetary-ring studies, it is known that the viscous spreading of a tidal disc can result in the formation of gravitationally bound objects at the disc's outer edge, specifically explaining the presence and properties of the small moons located close to the outer edge of Saturn's rings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Charnoz et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Crida &amp; Charnoz 2012, hereafter CC12)</ref>. We find that a similar process may occur in massive WD debris discs. Thus, a large rocky body (such as a planet) that undergoes a tidal disruption around a WD, forming a massive debris disc, can be partially 'recycled' into a set of second-generation (minor) planets (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bear &amp; Soker 2015)</ref>. This recycling mechanism may be the origin of the close-in, massive bodies that have been suggested to orbit WD 1145+017 to explain some aspects of this WD's peculiar transits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gänsicke et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al. 2016</ref>). The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we use analytical arguments to investigate the properties and evolution of massive WD debris discs, and of the second-generation (minor) planets they may produce. In Sect. 3, these findings are checked and expanded on using a numerical model adapted from studies of planetary ring systems. In Sect. 4, we discuss various aspects of the exoplanet-recycling scenario, including the prospects of testing its predictions observationally; whether the scenario can help explain some of the unresolved properties of the transits of WD 1145+017; and the potential of forming second-generation exoplanets in this manner around other astrophysical objects, such as pulsars, hot sub- dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We finish with a set of conclusions in Sect. 5. For reference, a list of symbol definitions used in this paper is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</head><p>In this section, we analytically investigate the evolution of massive WD debris discs and the second-generation planets that they may produce. We start by introducing key concepts and assumptions, and specifying a prescription for the disc (Sect. 2.1). Next, we assess the gravitational stability of WD debris discs, which is important because it affects the disc's effective viscosity (Sect. 2.2).</p><p>We then investigate the evolution of these discs under the effects of viscous spreading and Poynting-Robertson drag, and determine what discs are able to spawn a new generation of (minor) planets (Sect. 2.3). Lastly, we explore what the basic properties of these newly formed bodies might be (Sect. 2.4). A brief summary of our analytical findings is included at the end of the section (Sect. 2.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preliminaries</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">The Roche limit</head><p>A central concept in this study is the Roche limit: the distance within which self-gravity cannot hold together a low-mass body against the tidal forces and Keplerian shear caused by a large central mass. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For material with an internal density of ρ d , orbiting a WD of radius R , mass M , and mean density ρ , it is given by (e.g., Roche 1849; Chandrasekhar 1969)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r R = C R ρ ρ d 1/3 R = C R 3 4π M ρ d 1/3 ≈ 1.3 R C R 2.0 M 0.6 M 1/3 ρ d 3 g cm −3 −1/3 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, the prefactor C R is a constant between about 1.3 and 2.9, which depends on the strength, shape, orientation, and spin state of the low-mass body (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Harris 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Holsapple &amp; Michel 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, 2008</ref>. The classical value found by Roche (1849) is C R ≈ 2.456, valid for homogeneous, synchronously rotating, incompressible fluid bodies. We keep C R as a free parameter for most of our analysis, but when needed we take C R = 2.0 as a fiducial value. This value is valid for 'rubble piles' (i.e., particle aggregates held together solely by gravity) whose shape is such that they fill their Roche lobe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Porco et al. 2007</ref>; γ ≈ 1.6 in their notation). It can explain the observed densities of Saturn's innermost moonlets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Porco et al. 2007</ref>) and is roughly consistent with the observed architectures of the Saturnian and Uranian systems, where the Roche limit marks the boundary between quasi-continuous particle rings and discrete moons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tiscareno et al. 2013</ref>). Combining Eq. (1) with Kepler's third law gives the orbital period of a body located at the Roche limit</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P R = 3πC 3 R Gρ d ≈ 5.4 h C R 2.0 3/2 ρ d 3 g cm −3 −1/2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>It is worth noting that the dependence on the central mass has been eliminated here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Basic properties of the particle disc</head><p>We consider geometrically thin, flat, compact, axisymmetric discs, made up of solid debris particles, similar in many respects to Saturn's rings. With 'geometrically thin' we mean that the disc's thickness is considerably smaller than the WD's diameter, while 'flat' means that the thickness does not vary with radius. The disc may converge to this state through successive energy-dissipating collisions between the constituent particles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brahic 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cuzzi et al. 1979</ref>, but see Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2017a for a contrasting view). With 'compact' we mean that the disc is located within the Roche limit r R , as expected for a disc resulting from a tidal disruption followed by orbital shrinking and circularisation of the debris. Our study will concentrate mostly (but not exclusively) on discs located in the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone (0.5 r/r R &lt; 1). Debris discs may preferentially be found here, because the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone have a larger cross-section to incoming bodies than the inner parts. For simplicity, we assume that the particles making up the disc are all identical spheres with radius s, internal density ρ d , and mass m = 4πρ d s 3 /3. We will use ρ d = 3 g cm −3 as a fiducial value for the density, in line with the inferred rocky composition of WD atmospheric pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Jura &amp; Young 2014)</ref>. Regarding the typical sizes of particles in WD debris discs, there are only a few (relatively weak) observational constraints: Firstly, several WDs exhibit 10 µm silicate emission features, indicating the presence of (at least some) s ∼ 1 µm dust (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jura et al. 2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Jura et al. , 2009a</ref>). Secondly, <ref type="bibr">Gra- ham et al. (1990)</ref> put a rough upper limit of s 1 m on the size of the particles orbiting G29-38 based on their detection of IR pulsations (interpreted as the WD's optical pulsations that are reprocessed into the IR by the circumstellar dust, putting an upper limit on the thermal inertia of the dust grains). These two results bracket grain sizes of s ∼ 1 cm, which we will use as a fiducial value when one is needed. Additional motivation for using this value comes from the analogy with Saturn's rings, in which particles of a few cm are the most abundant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cuzzi et al. 2009</ref>). As we will see later, however, most of the conclusions made in this study ultimately turn out to be independent of grain size, as long as the particles are not too large (see Sects. 2.3.3 and 3.1.2).</p><p>Our study is focussed specifically on massive discs, with masses M disc roughly ranging from that of Ceres (∼ 10 24 g) to that of a super-Earth (10 28 to 10 29 g). Assuming that the disc initially constitutes a relatively narrow annulus at radius r, its surface mass density can be estimated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Σ = M disc 2πδr 2 ≈ 3 × 10 4 g cm −2 δ 0.1 −1 M disc 10 26 g r 1 R −2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where δ is a dimensionless factor that characterises the disc's width (i.e., the disc width is roughly δ × r). Using the assumption of equal-sized, spherical grains, we can write the vertical optical depth of the disc as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">τ ⊥ = 3 4 Σ ρ d s ≈ 3 × 10 3 ρ d 3 g cm −3 −1 s 1 cm −1 Σ 10 4 g cm −2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This also assumes that the grains can be treated using the geometrical-optics approximation, which is the case if the particles are much larger than the wavelength of the radiation under consideration. Since the disc is assumed to be vertically much smaller than the WD, but horizontally much larger, stellar radiation impinges on the disc at a shallow angle ζ. Following the 'lamp-post illumination model' of <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rafikov (2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Friedjung 1985)</ref>, this impinging angle is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ζ 4 3π R r ≈ 0.3 • R 0.0125 R r 1 R −1 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and the disc's optical depth to the impinging stellar radiation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">τ = τ ⊥ ζ 9π 16 Σ sρ d r R ≈ 5 × 10 5 R 0.0125 R ρ d 3 g cm −3 −1 × s 1 cm −1 Σ 10 4 g cm −2 r 1 R −1 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This shows that the massive discs considered in this study can be assumed to be opaque to the stellar radiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">The sublimation radius and the gaseous disc</head><p>Very close to the WD, disc temperatures will become high enough for the dust material to sublimate. The distance r subl at which this happens depends on the WD temperature, disc composition, and ambient gas pressure. For simplicity, we use a fixed value of r subl = 0.15 R , roughly consistent with theoretical expectations and observational estimates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jura et al. 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Rafikov &amp; Garmilla 2012)</ref>. Inside this sublimation radius, the solid debris quickly turns to gas, which is assumed to then rapidly accrete onto the WD via a gaseous viscous accretion disc (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In this work we mostly ignore the possible back-reaction of the gas that spreads outwards from r subl on the particle disc. Rafikov (2011a) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. (2012)</ref> have found that the drag due to this gas may cause a run-away accretion of the particle disc onto the WD. Whether this process happens, however, depends critically on the strength of the positive feedback of the gas on the solid disc <ref type="bibr">(called F by Rafikov 2011a and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>), which is highly uncertain because it is controlled by ill-constrained parameters of the gas disc such as its viscosity (α) and the critical Reynolds number above which the gas flow becomes fully turbulent (Re * ). Ignoring gas drag simply corresponds to assuming a low feedback (F &lt; 1). Furthermore, gas outside the sublimation radius is expected to rapidly condense onto the solid particle disc, which may hinder the run-away process. Nevertheless, we briefly discuss the possibility of disc destruction due to gas-drag-induced run-away accretion in Sect. 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gravitational stability of the disc</head><p>To evaluate the gravitational stability of massive WD debris discs, we follow the analyses of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Daisaka et al.

The evolution of discs whose viscosity is given by a double power-law function of radius and surface density (i.e., ν ∝ Σ α r β ) can usually be described analytically in terms of similarity solutions (Pringle 1991). Unfortunately, the power-law exponents in the present case (α = 2, β = 19/2) fall outside the regime in which these known solutions are valid. The approximate evolution of the disc, however, can still be understood by considering its viscous timescale, i.e., the characteristic timescale on which viscous spreading causes changes in the local surface density of the disc. For an initially narrow disc at radius r, the viscous timescale is given by (e.g., Pringle 1981; Hahn 2009)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">t visc ∼ r 2 12ν 3 7/3 104π 5/3 1 √ G M 19/6 ρ 5/3 d 1 Σ 2 r 15/2 .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Because the effective viscosity caused by gravitational instabilities increases rapidly with distance, the outer parts of the disc evolve much faster than the inner parts.

The combined effect of these different factors is that the disc develops a pile-up of material close to its inner edge. After some time, when the disc's initial radial distribution has faded, the surface density will roughly follow a profile of equal viscous timescale, with a radial dependence Σ visc ∝ r −15/4 .</p></div>

At the same time, this body moves away from the disc (through angular-momentum exchange via MMRs) at a rate that depends on its mass and distance to the disc's outer edge. As the body grows, its outward migration rate increases, but as it moves away from the disc, the migration rate rapidly decreases (d∆/dt ∝ q∆ −3 ; CC12).

A vertical grey line shows ∆ 2:1 , the outermost scaled distance for which the migration rates underpinning the mass-distance relations are applicable. In terms of dimensional quantities, the Roche-limit surface mass densities Σ R corresponding to the four lines are indicated in the legend, and absolute minor-planet masses and distances are given by the right-hand-side and top axes, respectively. For these dimensional versions (and for the Toomre masses), we use the stellar parameters T = 10,000 K, M = 0.6 M , R = 0.0125 R , a material density of ρ d = 3 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> , and a Roche prefactor of C R = 2.0. The top-left corner of parameter space (grey) is excluded, as this corresponds to bodies that are still in contact with the Roche limit (assuming their density equals that of the disc material).</p><p>Once a body migrates beyond ∆ c , the planet-formation process enters what is called the 'discrete regime'. Here, the further growth of the initial body happens via the transfer of small bodies that themselves accrete according to the continuous regime. On average, the mass-distance relation still follows Eq. (31), but the growth of the first-formed body will be discontinuous. The discrete regime ends when this object moves too far away to absorb additional newly formed continuous-regime bodies (two Hill radii from ∆ c ). The scaled distance ∆ d and mass-ratio q d at this point are given by (CC12)</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">∆ d 1 Z 3 0 3 T ≈ 5.45 √ T , q d 3 5/2 2 3 Z 6 0 T 3/2 ≈ 19.3 T 3/2 ,<label>(33)</label></formula><p>where Z 0 ≈ 0.682 is a numerical constant (specifically, the realvalued root of Z 3 + Z − 1). Given that the dimensionless disc-evolution timescale T is very large for the WD debris discs we consider, the continuous and discrete regimes end very close to the Roche limit, and correspond to relatively small bodies (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). In a WD debris disc that is forming planets, mass continuously flows through the region between the Roche limit and ∆ d , transported initially by continuous-regime bodies and subsequently by discrete-regime bodies. While the mass-ratios of these bodies and the extents of the regimes all change with time as the disc's Roche-limit surface density Σ R goes down, the rates at which bodies are created at {∆ c , q c } and {∆ d , q d } turn out to remain constant, independent of the properties of the disc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5">The pyramidal regime</head><p>Beyond scaled distance ∆ d , many minor planets can exist simultaneously, each one migrating outwards at a rate that depends on its mass and its distance to the disc's edge. The approximate minorplanet mass-distance relation in this domain can be found by considering an idealised scenario in which bodies of equal mass are formed at a given distance at regular intervals in time. In this case, later-formed bodies will gradually catch up with earlier-formed ones, because the rate of outward migration decreases with distance. When two bodies come to within two mutual Hill radii of one another, they are assumed to undergo a perfect-merger collision, creating a body of double the mass and angular momentum. This process of catch-up then repeats itself, but with bodies that are twice the mass of the original building blocks, and that are formed half as frequently, at the location of the first merger. In turn, this also repeats itself, and so on (see Sect. S6 of CC12 for a more detailed explanation). The resulting hierarchical pattern of mergers (giving this stage the name 'pyramidal regime') yields the massdistance relation 7 q 3 13/5 2 16/5 T 3/5 ∆ 9/5 .</p><p>Another prediction for the pyramidal regime is that the number of minor planets n follows the number-density-distance relation dn/d∆ ∝ 1/∆ (CC12), meaning that for higher ∆ the bodies are farther apart (specifically, they are equidistant in log(∆); see knotted lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). To find the normalisation for this relation, we note that, at any given time, there are either one or two bodies between two consecutive locations where mergers happen, or an average of 3/2 bodies per interval between merger locations. Because a merging event corresponds to a doubling of the planet mass, the ∆-values corresponding to two consecutive merger locations are a factor 2 5/9 apart (from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref>). Thus, the average number of pyramidal-regime bodies per unit of scaled distance is</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">dn d∆ 3 2 2 5/9 − 1 ∆ ≈ 3.19 ∆ ,<label>(37)</label></formula><p>and, on average, the bodies are a factor (3/2) 5/9 ≈ 1.25 apart in ∆.</p><p>Considering Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref> in the limit ∆ → 0 reveals that there is a scaled distance ∆ 0 inside of which the minor-planet number density is so high that bodies are spaced less than two mutual Hill radii r H from one another. Inside of this distance, the pyramidal-regime relations cannot hold, because bodies would already have merged earlier. Therefore, ∆ 0 and the corresponding mass-ratio q 0 mark the formal start of the pyramidal regime. These can be computed by solving dn/dr = (2r H ) −1 , using Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref>, as well as the approximation r r R (i.e., ∆ 0 1), which gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">∆ 0 3 23/6 2 11/6 2 5/9 − 1 5/2 √ T ≈ 125 √ T ,<label>(38)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">q 0 3 19/2 2 13/2 2 5/9 − 1 9/2 T 3/2 ≈ 1.13 × 10 4 T 3/2 .<label>(39)</label></formula><p>In the region between ∆ d and ∆ 0 , where formally the mass-distance relation is undefined, we expect the relation to follow a trend similar to Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref>. For this reason, the discrete and pyramidal regimes are connected with a dashed line in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Migration via disc torques operates as long as a body has firstorder MMRs overlapping with the disc (i.e., resonances for which the mean motions obey a ratio p + 1 : p, where p is a positive integer). The farthest-reaching first-order interior MMR is the 2:1 resonance. Hence, disc torques can at most move a planet out to the radius where the planet's 2:1 MMR coincides with the edge of the disc at the Roche limit.

In most planet-forming disc systems, there will thus be a point in time when M recyc exceeds M pyra . Once this happens, the excess material will naturally end up at r 2:1 .</p><p>Planets cannot migrate efficiently beyond r 2:1 via disc torques, because they would have no more first-order MMRs overlapping with the disc. Other mechanisms may be considered that might transport mass beyond r 2:1 . For planetary satellites, the planet's tides can push moons further outwards (if they are located outside the planet's corotation radius). However, because WDs are so compact, the newly formed planets that we consider here are not massive enough to generate significant tidal bulges on the WD. Another possible mechanism to consider is resonance capture between two planets, which might push the outer body beyond r 2:1 , while the inner one is still inside r 2:1 , migrating outwards due to disc torques. Studies looking into this effect in satellite systems, however, find that the additional outward migration that can be achieved in this way is modest at most ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Salmon &amp; Canup 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We conclude that the outward migration of second-generation planets beyond r 2:1 is likely to be very limited. Therefore, if a planet-forming disc is massive enough that the bodies forming out of it reach r 2:1 , most of the material flowing beyond the Roche limit will accumulate into a single large body stalled at r 2:1 . A rough estimate of the total mass in newly formed planets M recyc can now be made by considering angular-momentum conservation between the initial state and late times (ignoring the small angular-momentum losses due to PR drag).

These two modules are coupled by prescriptions for (a) how new bodies are spawned when disc material overflows the Roche limit and (b) the subsequent interaction of these bodies with the disc through angular momentum exchange at MMRs. The model can successfully reproduce the masses and locations of many of Saturn's regular satellites and has also been tested on the formation of Earth's Moon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Charnoz et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>The model's disc module solves the viscous diffusion equation with added external torques (e.g., Eq. (3) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Takeuchi et al. 1996</ref>) on a discretised radial grid using a second-order time-stepping method. The prescription used for the disc's effective kinetic viscosity is detailed in Sect. 2.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Salmon et al. (2010)</ref>. This includes the translational and collisional components of viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Shukhman 1984)</ref>, as well as the contribution from self-gravity wakes for Q T &lt; 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Daisaka et al. 2001</ref>). For gravitationally unstable discs in the outer part of the tidal disruption zone, the total effective kinetic viscosity equals the one given by Eq. <ref type="figure">(13)</ref>. Torques on the disc from first-order MMRs with external bodies are computed using the formalism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Meyer-Vernet &amp; Sicardy (1987)</ref>. For this study, PR drag was added as an additional torque on the disc, computed by integrating Eq. (A5) over each radial bin. The implementation of PR drag in the code was tested by reproducing the results of Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov (2011, specifically, their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7)</ref>. Any inwards-flowing disc material that passes through the sublimation radius r subl is removed from the simulation and its angular momentum is lost. This material is assumed to be converted  to gas, which is rapidly accreted onto the WD via a gaseous viscous accretion disc (not modelled here, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>).</p><note type="other">M 0.6 M WD radius R 0.0125 R sublimation radius r subl 0.15 R Roche limit r R 1.3 R grain radius s 1 cm material density ρ d 3 g cm −3 initial scaled disc width δ 0.1 initial disc radius r 0 0.</note><p>At each time step, any disc material that has spread beyond the Roche limit r R is converted into a new minor planet, which is subsequently tracked as a discrete body (fully described by its mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity). The semi-major axes of the bodies are modelled to evolve under the action of disc torques associated with first-order MMRs (already computed for the backreaction of the bodies on the disc; see above). Changes in the eccentricities of the bodies due to mutual perturbations are modelled using an instantaneous-close-encounter formalism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Charnoz et al. 2011</ref>). When two bodies come to within 2.2 mutual Hill radii from one another (Karjalainen 2007), they are assumed to merge into a new body whose mass is the combined mass of the two progenitors and whose orbital elements are dictated by the conservation of angular momentum. The code does not take into account resonant interactions between orbiting bodies (see discussion in Sect. S3.3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Charnoz et al. 2010</ref>) and the treatment of tidal interactions between the planets and the central object was switched off for the present study (see Sect. 2.4.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Setup of the model runs</head><p>One of the main goals of this work is to investigate which WD debris discs are able to form second-generation (minor) planets and what the properties of the newly formed bodies may be. To answer these questions using our numerical model, we ran a set of simulations with a different initial disc mass M disc and radius r 0 for each run, keeping all other parameters fixed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> lists the parameter values we adopted. Most of our choices are motivated in Sect. 2.1, but some additional details are provided below.</p><p>For the stellar parameters, we chose values that reflect a typical WD (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kleinman et al. 2013</ref>). By adopting a fixed effective temperature for the WD, we ignore its cooling, which will decrease the critical surface density over time. WD effective temperature roughly scales as T ∝ t −7/20 cool ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Althaus et al. 2010</ref>), where t cool is the WD's cooling age. Given that a 10,000 K WD has a cooling age of ∼0.6 Gyr, the timescale on which Σ crit ∝ T 4/3 ∝ t −7/15 cool will halve is about ∼2.6 Gyr.</p><p>While particle size needs to be specified in the model, and the particle size for WD debris discs is highly uncertain, the value of this parameter does not play a major role in the global evolution of the massive discs we consider (see Sect. 2.3.3). For the inwardsextending tail of material caused by PR drag (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov 2011</ref>), grain size determines the surface density but not the inward mass flow, which is the parameter that controls the disc's global evolution.</p><p>The radial grid used in the model contains 230 bins between r subl and r R of width 0.005 R ≈ 3480 km. This resolution also sets <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Three examples of the simulated evolution of a WD debris disc, using different initial masses, leading to evolution governed by different processes. The coloured lines show the surface-density profile of the discs at different points in time. The dashed black curve indicates the critical surface density Σ crit (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>), below which disc evolution is dominated by PR drag. The dotted black curve shows the minimum initial surface density for planet formation Σ form (i.e., the equivalent of M form , converted to a surface density using Eq. (3) with δ = 0.1). In the bottom panel, the coloured circles indicate the semi-major axes and masses of the (minor) planets that spawned from the disc, with larger symbols for more massive objects. The dash-dotted black curves show the mass-distance relation Eq. (36), scaled to roughly match the minor-planet population at different times (using, from top to bottom, T = 8 × 10 13 , 1.2 × 10 15 , and 1.8 × 10 16 ). Thick black dots in these curves indicate the typical spacing between individual objects predicted by Eq. (37). Vertical grey lines mark the sublimation radius r subl , the Roche limit r R , and the radial distance r 2:1 at which point a planet's 2:1 MMR coincides with the Roche limit. the distance beyond the Roche limit at which new bodies appear. Comparing the resolution with the distances marking the domains of the various regimes of planet formation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref> shows that only the pyramidal regime will be simulated in the vast majority of runs.</p><p>As initial radial surface-density distribution, we used a top-hat function centred at r 0 with a width given by δ (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>). We ran a small grid of models to investigate the effects of disc mass and radius. The initial central radius of the disc r 0 was varied between 0.2 R and 1.2 R in steps of 0.1 R . The initial disc mass M disc was varied between about 3 × 10 23 g and 3 × 10 28 g in logarithmic steps of a factor √ 10. Each simulation is continued long enough for the particle disc to fully disappear -i.e., until all material is either locked in (minor) planets or lost at the sublimation radius. While in many cases this means simulating times that are beyond the current age of the universe, we generally only present results from the first 10 Gyr of the simulations. Results beyond t = 10 Gyr are used only to assess the validity of the analytical disc-lifetime predictions made in Sect. 2.3.5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Three illustrative examples</head><p>Before discussing the properties of the set of simulations as a whole, we examine the detailed results of three individual runs (shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>) that serve as illustrative examples for the three main (qualitatively different) types of disc evolution seen in the simulations. These runs use the same initial disc radius (r 0 = 1 R ), but have different disc masses:</p><p>Low-mass disc: The top-left panel shows a disc of initial mass M disc = 10 24 g ∼ 1 Ceres mass, whose initial surface mass density is below Σ crit . The evolution of this disc is governed almost entirely by PR drag and can be described well by the results of <ref type="bibr">Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov (2011, see Sect. 2.3.2)</ref>.</p><p>Intermediate-mass disc: The top-right panel is for an initial mass M disc = 10 25 g ∼ 1 Pluto mass. The disc's initial surface density is above Σ crit , but its initial mass is still below M form . The disc initially spreads viscously (until about t = 1 Gyr), but before the outer edge has reached the Roche limit the surface density drops below the critical level and PR drag takes over the further evolution.</p><p>High-mass disc: The bottom panel is for a disc of initial mass M disc = 10 26 g ∼ 1 Io mass, which is above M form . Its evolution is dominated by viscous spreading for most of the simulation. At about t = 30 Myr, the disc spreads beyond the Roche limit and new minor planets start being formed. These migrate outwards and merge with one another, roughly following the pyramidal-regime mass-distance relationship (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref>). Eventually most of the minor planets coagulate into a Pluto-mass body orbiting at r 2:1 . Around t = 10 Gyr, the disc decouples from the Roche limit and the formation of new bodies stops. For some time after this point, however, the existing small bodies close to the Roche limit still migrate outwards through interaction with the retreating disc. This results in a deviation from the analytical mass-distance relation towards the end of the run (see also Sect. 3.2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Main results from the full set of simulations</head><p>A broad overview of the simulation results is given by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, in which several key quantities extracted from the simulations are mapped against the initial disc masses and radii of the runs. Based on these and other results from the simulations, we make the following observations and inferences:</p><p>(i) The analytical approximation for the minimum disc mass for planet formation M form <ref type="bibr">(Eq. (20)</ref>) closely matches the line separating systems with and without planets in the numerical results. The small discrepancy at r 0 &gt; 1 R can be explained by the non-zero initial width of the simulated discs: if the outer parts of a simulated disc start off close enough to the Roche limit, the disc can form (minor) planets despite having an initial mass below M form .</p><p>(ii) A large fraction of the initial disc mass can be converted into planets. For the highest initial disc masses we consider (M disc 10 28 g), this recycled mass fraction M recyc /M disc roughly converges to the values predicted by <ref type="bibr">Eq. (45)</ref>. A small discrepancy between the analytical and numerical results is caused by the fact that some angular momentum is lost in the simulations by material flowing inside the sublimation radius.</p><p>(iii) In almost all of the runs, most of the planet mass eventually accumulates in a single large body orbiting at r 2:1 . Only a few systems (all with initial disc masses close to M form ) have a largest body containing less than 90% of the total planet mass at the end of the run. In only two of these exceptions (the two empty cells in the top-right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7)</ref>, the largest body does not reach r 2:1 . These two systems populate only part of the pyramidal regime before PR drag terminates their planet formation.</p><p>(iv) The time at which the first bit of disc material reaches the Roche limit and planets start forming t start varies dramatically, from a fraction of a year (for the highest mass disc starting closest to the Roche limit), to several Gyr (for initially compact discs with masses close to M form ). Its scaling with initial disc mass and radius roughly resembles that of the viscous timescale <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The low values demonstrate that small bodies located just outside the Roche limit can form very quickly.</p><p>(v) The time at which the total mass in planets M recyc has reached half its final value (referred to as the planet-formation timescale in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>) is relatively short in most runs (compared with, e.g., the total length of time that planet formation can remain operating, which is often longer than the age of the universe; specifically, for massive discs it is roughly t crit (r R ) ≈ 39 Gyr; see Sect. 2.3.5). This shows that the final planet mass M recyc is dominated by the early stages of planet formation. The reason for this is that the planet-forming mass flow through r R is highest at time t start and subsequently declines (because Σ R goes down; see Sects. 2.4.1 and 2.4.6).</p><p>(vi) Disc lifetimes follow the predictions made in Sect. 2.3.5, converging to Eq. (23) for initial disc masses of M disc 10 28 g, and following Eq. (21) in simulations far enough below the dashed M crit line. Most planet-forming discs can survive viscous and PRdrag evolution for longer than the age of the universe.</p><p>(vii) For low-mass systems, the inward mass flow rate at the sublimation radius (which we assume to be approximately equal to the mass accretion rate onto the WD) are consistent with the PRdrag-induced mass flow given by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> and predicted in more detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov (2011)</ref>. In simulations with initial disc masses above M crit (dashed line), viscous spreading moves the disc's inner edge inwards, which increases the mass flow due to PR drag slightly. A strong enhancement of the mass accretion rate due to viscous spreading (reaching 10 9 g s −1 ) is only seen in discs with initial masses of M disc 10 27 g. In these cases, the mass flow at r subl is caused directly by viscous spreading. This confirms the conclusion of Metzger et al. (2012, their Appendix A) that, as an explanation for the highest accretion rates of polluted WDs, viscous spreading requires disc masses comparable to that of a terrestrial planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Minor planet properties</head><p>Finally, we review the detailed properties of the simulated minorplanet populations and compare them to the predictions of the analytical model presented in Sect. 2.4. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows this comparison for a representative subset of the runs. This shows that the numerical results generally match the analytical predictions for dimensionless disc evolution timescales of T ∼ 10 9 to 10 15 , as expected. In several instances, however, deviations occur where the numerical results follow a steeper slope than the analytical predictions and/or extend below the T = 10 15 line. Further inspection of the simulation results reveals that this happens when the outward mass flow is quenched, which can occur for two reasons. (1) When a strong MMR of a massive body is located in the outermost parts of the disc, the back-reaction of this body on the disc can push the outer edge away from the Roche limit (e.g., the orange circles for t = 10 4 yr in the top-right panel). (2) At late times, PR drag starts to reverse the mass flow at the Roche limit (e.g., the purple and pink circles for t = 10 9 and 10 10 yr in the bottom-right panel).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The occurrence of massive WD debris discs</head><p>In the preceding sections, we found that viscously spreading WD debris discs will produce new (minor) planets when they spread beyond the Roche limit, but that this only happens for very massive discs (roughly M disc 10 26 g; see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). This brings up the question whether discs that are sufficiently massive (to reach the Roche limit) actually exist. As mentioned in Sect. 1, WD debris discs are      usually assumed to have masses comparable to Solar-System asteroids (M disc 10 23 g), but the atmospheric-pollution masses on which this number is based only give lower limits on the disc mass. There are several reasons to believe that there could also be discs with masses in the range 10 26 to 10 28 g (i.e., the mass of a dwarf planet, major moon, or terrestrial planet):</p><p>(i) Some heavily polluted WDs with helium-dominated atmospheres also contain significant amounts of hydrogen (which does not sink down). In the case of one of these, GD 362, it has been shown that this pattern of pollution can be explained by the accretion of a terrestrial-planet-mass object containing some water ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Jura et al. 2009b</ref>). A similar scenario may account for other WDs exhibiting the combination of heavy atmospheric metal and hydrogen pollution, although the hydrogen may also have been accumulated through the accretion of multiple smaller water-rich bodies over an extended period of time (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Raddi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gentile Fusillo et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>(ii) Theoretical studies of planetary-system evolution show that in some cases planets have pericentre excursions below the Roche limit (∼ 0.1 of simulated systems; <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Mustill et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Veras et al. 2016a</ref>). Furthermore, in unstable planetary systems, massive moons can be liberated from their host planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Payne et al. 2016</ref>) and scattered into the Roche limit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Payne et al. 2017</ref>), although the efficiency of this process has yet to be quantified.</p><p>(iii) For WDs with binary companions, mechanisms have been proposed to drive small bodies from an outer planetesimal belt down to the WD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonsor &amp; Veras 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hamers &amp; Portegies Zwart 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Stephan et al. 2017</ref>). These mechanisms would apply equally to planets.</p><p>(iv) The tidal disruption of a planet-sized body around a WD might be necessary to explain the properties of the interstellar asteroid 1I/2017 'Oumuamua (Rafikov 2018). In such a tidal disruption event, only a minority ( 30%) of the debris is ejected to interstellar space, while the rest remains bound to the WD.</p><p>An important question following from these points is whether the tidal disruption of a massive body would result in a debris disc with the flat, compact geometry that we have used as the starting point of our analysis. Studies considering the formation of planetary rings from the tidal disruption of a comet or Kuiper Belt object argue that this is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dones 1991;</ref>), but recent studies focussing on WDs have brought forward problems with the flat disc geometry <ref type="bibr">(Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2017a,b)</ref>. The problem of disc formation and geometry is more general to the understanding of circumstellar dust around WDs and extends beyond the scope of this paper. We reiterate that our study does not presuppose any particular formation scenario for the disc. All conclusions regarding second-generation planets apply equally if the required discs form via a different pathway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Recycled planets with or without a remnant debris disc?</head><p>Given the long lifetime of massive WD debris discs (see Sect. 2.3.5), any second-generation exoplanets produced via the recycling mechanism are expected to be accompanied by (a remnant of) the disc that produced them. For this reason, WDs exhibiting IR excess may be the most promising targets to search for recycled planets. For the same reason, the recycling mechanism may be expected to not occur frequently, because the discs that produce planets would also give rise to prominent IR excesses, and the fraction of WDs with a detectable IR excess is fairly limited (1 to 3% for WDs with ages t cool 0.5 Gyr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Farihi et al. 2009</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bonsor et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, planets may occur without an accompanying remnant debris disc if, after the planets have already been formed, the disc is destroyed by some mechanism unaccounted for in our analysis. Possible examples of such mechanisms are the runaway accretion of the disc induced by gas drag (Rafikov 2011a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>) and a vaporising collision between the disc and a newly-inwards-scattered body from the star's original planetary system (Jura 2008). In the case of disc destruction by run-away accretion, second-generation planets may be expected to have formed before the disc is gone, because the delay time for run-away accretion is of the order of 0.1 to 10 Myr (although this estimate is highly uncertain; see Eq. (59) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Metzger et al. 2012</ref>), while the formation of planets starts earlier for many planet-producing discs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, middle-left panel).</p><p>If a massive disc is destroyed after some second-generation planets have already been formed, the planets may act as a longterm (Gyr-timescale) reservoir of mass, located just outside the Roche limit and available for future accretion onto the WD. Two possible Solar-System analogues of this situation are the Uranian and Neptunian satellite systems, both of which may have formed out of ancient massive planetary rings that have since disappeared (CC12). In a scenario in which WD debris discs are generally only created very early in a WD's life (possibly as a result of some aspect of post-main-sequence evolution) and then rapidly destroyed (e.g., by run-away accretion), the long-term storage of mass in secondgeneration planets could be the explanation for the occurrence of atmospheric metal pollution in older WDs. A testable prediction for this scenario is that a large fraction of WDs (at least as high as the fraction of WDs that show pollution; i.e., tens of per cent) should be orbited by (minor) planets just outside the Roche limit.</p></div>

If the recycling process studied in this paper occurs, however, it predicts the existence of low-mass (M p 1 M Jup ) planets in compact (r 1 AU) orbits around WDs.</p><p>Interestingly, the orbital radius that our model predicts for the largest planet, r 2:1 (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(40)</ref>; Sect. 2.4.6), is squarely in the middle of the WD 'continuously habitable zone' identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol (2011)</ref>. This is defined as the range of distances that remain habitable for an extended period of time (e.g., at least 3 Gyr). Specifically, for a planet orbiting a 0.6 M WD at r 2:1 ≈ 2.1 R , the habitable zone starts to coincide with the planet's location when the WD has cooled to an effective temperature of about T eff ≈ 6000 K, corresponding to a WD age of around 2 Gyr, and it has moved too far inwards at T eff ≈ 4000 K, at an age of about 10 Gyr (Agol 2011).</p><p>This situation raises further questions regarding the potential habitability of planets formed through the recycling mechanism: Would any volatiles survive the processing of material in the disc? If not, could enough water be delivered onto the planet from outside reservoirs later on? Although a detailed consideration of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper, we now briefly discuss the question of water delivery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Veras et al. (2014b)</ref> show that the trace amounts of hydrogen that are observed in the atmospheres of helium-dominated WDs can be explained by the accretion of water-rich comets from remnant Oort-cloud-type reservoirs. Over a timespan of ∼ 10 Gyr, this mechanism could provide 10 22 to 10 25 g in H onto the WD (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Raddi et al. 2015</ref>), corresponding to 10 23 to 10 26 g in H 2 O. Assuming the WD's catchment area corresponds to the cross-section of its tidal disruption sphere, a planet can accrete a fraction on the order of (R p /r R ) 2 of this mass, ignoring gravitational focussing. For an Earth-sized body, this would yield about 10 19 to 10 22 g in water (equivalent to 10 −5 to 10 −2 times the mass of Earth's oceans), some fraction of which will stay on the planet during the impact process, depending on the size and velocity of the impactors (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Shuvalov 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Schlichting &amp; Mukhopadhyay 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kral et al. 2018)</ref>. Whether this amount of water would be sufficient for the emergence of life is another question that remains to be answered.</p><p>Finally, if habitable planets around WDs exist and they can be studied in transit, they would make uniquely favourable targets for attempts to detect biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Loeb &amp; Maoz 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Observational constraints and prospects</head><p>The existence of planets in compact orbits around WDs is an interesting conjecture that warrants to be tested observationally. Given the small orbital radii and large planet-to-star size ratio of the predicted planets, transit surveys are likely to be a fruitful strategy for constraining how frequently they occur. The planets can cause very deep transits or even complete occultations of their host star, recurring at periods less than a day. Thus, even relatively low-precision surveys (like some present-day ground-based efforts) are capable of detecting them (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faedi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol 2011</ref>). Because the durations of WD planetary transits are relatively short (typically 1 to 3 min for the planets we consider; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faedi et al. 2011</ref>), the sensitivity of such surveys to small planets will depend critically on the exposure time and/or observational cadence used. Several transit surveys have been conducted so far to search for planets around WDs (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref> for some of their specifics), but no solid-body planetary companions have yet been found (irregular transits were discovered for WD 1145+017, probably caused by clouds of dust; see Sect. 4.5). Overall, the constraints on the occurrence rate of small planets around WDs are still relatively weak. While the presence of Mars-to-Earth-sized bodies in 10-h orbits around half of all WDs or more can be ruled out <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(van Sluijs &amp; Van Eylen 2018)</ref>, a high-cadence or high-precision transit survey with a larger sample size would be needed to put stronger limits on the occurrence rate of the smaller (R p &lt; 0.5 R ⊕ ) bodies predicted in this paper. Given that the geometric transit probability of these planets is of the order of 1% (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faedi et al. 2011</ref>), a detection would likely require a sample size of at least a few hundreds divided by the occurrence rate (see also Agol 2011).</p><p>To evaluate the prospects of future transit surveys to put meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of (or to detect) planets created via the recycling mechanism, we now make estimates of the transit properties of these bodies. For a planet of radius R p on a circular orbit with radius r, the geometric transit probability is</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">p tr = R p + R r .<label>(47)</label></formula><p>If, additionally, the planet's orbit is oriented edge-on (i.e., zero impact parameter), the transit depth δ tr and full duration D tr are given by (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faedi et al. 2011</ref>) <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.

The four coloured solid curves correspond to pyramidal-regime bodies for different disc properties, parametrised by the disc's dimensionless Roche-limit viscous evolution timescale T (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). Lines of constant geometric transit probability are shown by green dash-dotted curves <ref type="bibr">(Eq. (47)</ref>). Transit parameters were computed assuming a WD with mass M = 0.6 M and radius R = 0.0125 R , and planets on edge-on orbits (i.e., zero impact parameter). To convert planet masses to radii, we assume a mean density of 3 g cm −3 for all bodies. Several Solar-System bodies are indicated on the black curve, showing their transit properties if they orbited the WD at r 2:1 . The dashed grey lines show detection limits of some ongoing and future transit surveys to achieve a S/N of 10 for planets orbiting at r 2:1 (Eq.

For objects in more compact orbits, these lines overestimate the detection limits only slightly (see footnote 9). An ×-symbol marks the (possible) cadence of each survey. For transits with durations below the cadence, the detection limits will be somewhat higher because the transit signal will be diluted.</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">δ tr =              R p R 2 ≈ 0.54 R p 1 R ⊕ 2 R 0.0125 R −2 for R p &lt; R 1 for R p ≥ R<label>(48)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">D tr = 2 r GM R p + R ≈ 2.1 min M 0.6 M −1/2 r 2 R 1/2 R p + R 1 R ⊕ + 0.0125 R .<label>(49)</label></formula><p>The detectability of a planet using the transit method depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the transit signal, which can be estimated as (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">S/N = N in δ tr σ phot .<label>(50)</label></formula><p>Here, N in is the total number of in-transit measurements (i.e., summed over all observed transit events) and σ phot is the photometric precision on a single measurement.

Therefore, if small WD planets are rare, their detection via transits will likely remain elusive, even though the constraints on their occurrence rate will improve.

A wealth of observational data is now available for this star, but the comprehensive picture of what ultimately causes the transits remains unclear. Here, we briefly review the relevant observations of WD 1145+017 and discuss whether its curious properties can be explained by the model of second-generation planet formation presented in this paper.</p></div>

The dips are deep (up to 60%), long ( several minutes), irregular in shape, and occur at multiple longitudes along the orbit, sometimes collectively covering a large fraction of the orbital cycle. Their recurrence periods fall between about 4.5 and 5 h, corresponding to Keplerian orbital periods at and/or near the Roche limit (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>). The shapes and depths of the dips evolve on timescales of days and individual transit features seem to gradually appear and disappear over the course of several weeks or months ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gänsicke et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gary et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to its peculiar light curve, WD 1145+017 also exhibits excess IR emission from circumstellar dust ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Xu et al. 2018</ref>) and evolving spectral absorption features due to metallic circumstellar gas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Xu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Redfield et al. 2017</ref>). The WD itself has an effective temperature of 15,900±500 K, corresponding to a cooling age of 175±75 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>). Its atmospheric metal pollution constitutes about 6.6×10 23 g of material (almost the mass of Ceres), yielding an estimated steady-state mass accretion rate of 4.3×10 10 g s −1 over sinking timescales of 0.3 to 0.6 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Xu et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>The properties of the dips in the light curve of WD 1145+017 are inconsistent with transits of solid-body planets. Instead, the irregular, slowly evolving shapes and the transient nature of the dips suggest that they are caused by transiting clouds of dust <ref type="bibr">(Vander- burg et al. 2015</ref>). However, while individual transit features come and go, the most notable periodicity associated with the transits (about 4.5 h) has remained present in the light curve over a timespan of several years (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gary et al. 2017</ref>). Furthermore, the periods of some transit features were found to remain stable to within 20 ppm over several months ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rappaport et al. 2018</ref>). These properties seem to be incompatible with dust clouds, which are expected to disperse due to Keplerian shear within a few orbits.</p><p>The long-term stability of the transit recurrence periods can be explained by a scenario in which the dust that causes the dips is released quasi-continuously from massive bodies that carry enough angular momentum to have highly stable orbital periods <ref type="bibr">(Vander- burg et al. 2015</ref>). <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The release of short-lived dust from these muchlonger-lived objects may happen either through their direct disintegration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>) or via cratering erosion of larger bodies by somewhat smaller ones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gary et al. 2017</ref>). Tidaldisruption simulations show that an internally differentiated body orbiting at the Roche limit may indeed be able to sustain prolonged intermittent mass loss ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Veras et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Assuming the dust that causes the dips is indeed released from massive bodies, the observed pattern of transit periods may provide insight into the orbital configuration and nature of these objects. In the original K2 light curve (from which the peculiar nature of WD 1145+017 was discovered), six periodicities could be discerned, ranging from 4.499 to 4.858 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>). The two most prominent of these, at 4.499 and 4.605 h, have since been recovered in ground-based data that was taken several years later <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Rappaport et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gary et al. 2017)</ref>, suggesting that at least these two periods correspond to massive objects and lending some credibility to the other four. Most of the dips seen in the groundbased light curves, however, are associated with short-lived features and repeat at slightly (but statistically significantly) shorter periods, mostly between 4.490 and 4.495 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gänsicke et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rappaport et al. , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Croll et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gary et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To explain the observed pattern of transit periods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al.

In this scenario, the observed ratio of transit periods can be used to estimate the mass of the parent body, for which Rappaport et al. (2016) find 10 23 g (about 0.1 Ceres mass). Also regarding this scenario specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gurri et al. (2017)</ref> find that the parent body cannot be more massive than 10 23 g, else its perturbations of the fragments would cause period deviations violating the observational upper limits on their period stability (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Veras et al. 2016b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2">The origin of massive bodies just outside the Roche limit</head><p>It is clear that many of the properties of WD 1145+017's transits can be explained if the dust causing the dips is released from longlived, massive objects. An important unresolved issue for this scenario, however, is how these bodies came to be in 4.5-to-5-h-period orbits, which lie just outside the Roche limit, far inside the region that was cleared during earlier stages of the star's evolution. As an additional complication, the putative bodies likely need to be on low-eccentricity ( 0.1) orbits to avoid immediate tidal disruption, because the efficiency of this process quickly increases with decreasing pericentre distance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Veras et al. 2017</ref>). <ref type="bibr">11</ref> An alternative explanation for the period stability of the transits is that the transiting clouds of dust are trapped in the WD's magnetosphere and therefore corotate with the WD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Farihi et al. 2017</ref>). The magnetic field strength required for this scenario, however, seems to be far above the observational upper limits for WD 1145+017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Farihi et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rappaport et al. 2018</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Gänsicke et al. (2016)</ref> have suggested that the close-in bodies may be the result of the tidal circularisation of a (minor) planet that was previously on a highly eccentric orbit with its pericentre close to the Roche limit (see also Sect. 1.2 of . A potential problem with this scenario is that, because of angularmomentum conservation, the radius of the circularised orbit would come to be a factor √ 2 larger than the original orbit's pericentre distance. Since the latter would have to be outside the Roche limit to avoid immediate tidal disruption, it is difficult to intactly place a massive body on an orbit very close to the Roche limit (r/r R &lt; √ 2) through tidal circularisation. Radiative forces, such as PR drag or the Yarkovsky effect, can remove angular momentum, circularising orbits without increasing their pericentre distance, but over the lifetime of a WD this only works for smaller objects (i.e., dust, pebbles, and boulders; ). Alternatively, the circumstellar gas disc detected around WD 1145+017 may have helped in the circularisation process ( <ref type="bibr">Gänsicke et al. 2016)</ref>. It is still unclear, however, whether enough gas is available around WD 1145+017 for this to work and, if so, whether it can dissipate energy fast enough.</p><p>In short, it is challenging to explain the proposed massive bodies by invoking the migration of intact planetesimals from higheccentricity, AU-scale orbits to low-eccentricity, 4.5-to-5-h-period ones. In contrast, the recycling mechanism studied in this paper gives a natural explanation for massive bodies on circular orbits close to the Roche limit. In the region just outside the Roche limit, it predicts a large number of small bodies that orbit close to one another, which may explain the observed multitude of transit periods. Furthermore, it allows the formation of minor planets as massive as 0.1 Ceres mass (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al. 2016</ref>) within the 175-Myr age of the system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs. 6-8</ref>), although the occurrence of such massive objects very close to the Roche limit requires a very massive disc (e.g., the top-right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> shows 10 23 -g bodies at ∆ 0.01), unless the objects can somehow migrate inwards after being assembled further out (for instance through interaction with the gaseous disc). A remnant of the massive debris disc that produced the bodies could either still be present, or it may since have been destroyed (see Sects. 4.2 and 4.5.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3">Ongoing planet formation in the WD 1145+017 system?</head><p>In the scenario sketched above, the dust clouds that cause the dips in the light curve of WD 1145+017 are emitted by pre-existing massive bodies that are gradually destroyed. Our study brings forward another possibility: the dust clouds may be related to the ongoing formation of massive bodies from a disc that is currently overflowing the Roche limit. In this process of second-generation planet formation (one of the main topics of this paper), numerous collisions occur between rocky building blocks. So far, we have treated these collisions as idealised instantaneous perfect mergers, but in reality many of them likely cause at least some initial partial disruption of the bodies involved, after which the resulting debris gradually reagglomerates (cf. . The dust clouds transiting WD 1145+017 may be manifestations of such disruptive collisions.</p><p>In this scenario, the most prominent cluster of transit periods seen in the light curve (around 4.5 h) could be associated with the outer edge of the disc (at the Roche limit) and/or the region immediately beyond it, where frequent collisions occur between newly formed bodies. Dips that repeat at somewhat longer periods could then be due to collisions involving bodies that formed some time ago and have since migrated some distance away from the disc. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> gives an overview of the WD 1145+017 system in this scenario, specifically assuming that the Roche limit corresponds to an orbital period of P R = 4.490 h (i.e., the lower end of the observed range of transit periods). In the following sections, we discuss this model in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.4">The transit periods around 4.5 h</head><p>With the Roche limit at an orbital period of P R = 4.490 h, as we have assumed for <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>, the transit periods close to 4.490 h may correspond to dust clouds generated in the continuous and/or discrete regimes of planet formation (see Sect. 2.4.4). If this is the case, the days and weeks-to-months timescales on which these dips seem to vary (see, e.g., <ref type="figure">Figs. 3 and 4</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rappaport et al. 2018)</ref> could be related to the timescale on which new bodies gradually form (see Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(34)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(35)</ref>). Specifically regarding the formation of discrete-regime bodies, collisions (of continuous-regime building blocks onto a forming discrete-regime body) are expected to gradually become less frequent as the body grows and moves away from the Roche limit, because this allows the continuous-regime building blocks to build up to a larger size before they merge with the discrete-regime body (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. S1 of CC12)</ref>. This cycle would then repeat once the formation of one discrete-regime body is complete and the production of the next one starts -i.e., on a timescale of t d ≈ 1.5 months.</p><p>On the other hand, for plausible values of T (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref>), the continuous and discrete regimes end very close to the Roche limit (∆ d r R 100 km for T 10 9 ). At such small distance scales, certain implicit assumptions of our model may start to break down. Firstly, our model assumes the Roche limit is a sharp boundary. However, variations in material density ρ d of the order of 1%, for example, will move its location by a few thousand km (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>). Secondly, the vertical size of the dust clouds orbiting WD 1145+017 must be comparable to the size of the WD (in order to account for transit depths of 60%). If their radial extent is similar to this, then clouds on orbits with periods between 4.490 and 4.499 h will overlap, so they may interact in ways not accounted for. Finally, the dispersion of transit periods around 4.5 h may also be due to the effects of radiation pressure, which can affect the orbital periods of (clouds of) dust grains significantly. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This all goes to say that our simple analytical model (Sect. 2.4) may not include all the physics necessary to fully understand the cluster of periodicities around 4.5 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.5">Minor planets at longer periods</head><p>The middle panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> shows what our model means quantitatively for the longer periodicities seen in the K2 data. Because the disc needs to be younger than the age of the system (175 Myr), rough lower limits can be put on the masses of the bodies that presumably orbit at these periods. Our numerical simulations show that discs below this age generally do not produce minor planets with masses far below the purple T = 10 15 line (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>). In <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. Overview of a possible model for the WD 1145+017 system, which assumes that the main transit period seen in the star's light curve corresponds to the outer edge of a viscously spreading debris disc, located at the Roche limit (i.e., P R = 4.490 h). In addition, we have assumed a WD mass of M = 0.6 M and a Roche prefactor of C R = 2.0. Top panel: Cartoon showing a radial cross-section of the system. Key radial distances are marked: r subl , the sublimation radius; r R , the Roche limit; r 2:1 , the radius for which the 2:1 MMR coincides with the Roche limit. The WD and the planetary bodies are not drawn to scale. Middle panel: Log-scale zoom of the region just outside the Roche limit, showing the observed transit periods (vertical grey bands and lines) along with analytical minor-planet mass-distance relations (coloured lines and symbols). Labels 'A' through 'F' mark the periodicities seen in the K2 data, in order of their signal amplitude <ref type="bibr">(Vander- burg et al. 2015</ref>). The various colours, line-styles, and symbols used in the analytical mass-distance relations have the same meaning as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> (see caption of that <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. Also indicated (along the bottom axis) are distances equalling the WD's radius and one tenth of that, below which the radial extent of the transiting dust clouds may be greater than the radial separation of adjacent orbits. Bottom panel: Same as the middle panel, but in dimensionless parameters. This allows a comparison with the Saturnian system, which is shown in green. The properties of Saturn's moons were taken from JPL's Solar System Dynamics website (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov). The location of Saturn's F ring comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bosh et al. (2002)</ref>; its mass (though poorly constrained) is probably not greater than that of its two shepherding moons (see ). We set the Roche limit for Saturn to be at r R = 137,500 km, (i.e., in between the outer edge of Saturn's A ring and Atlas, the first satellite outside the main rings). addition, the analytical mass-distance relations with a high normalisation (i.e., low T ) require a recently created and/or massive disc. Given the low likelihood of witnessing an M disc 10 28 g disc within 1000 yr of its formation, minor planets with masses above the blue T = 10 9 line are improbable (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>).</p><p>Combining the above two considerations yields rough constraints on the masses of the bodies corresponding to the various observed transit periods. The 'B' period at 4.605 h, for example, would likely correspond to a body of mass 10 21 g M p 10 25 g (i.e., a radius between a few tens and several hundreds of km), with masses towards the lower end of this range being more likely. If the presence of massive bodies around WD 1145+017 is confirmed, this hypothesis of their origin could be tested by estimating the masses of the bodies. Most stringently, their relative masses as a function of their separation from the Roche limit should roughly follow the pyramidal-regime mass-distance relation (M p ∝ ∆ 9/5 ).</p><p>Additional massive bodies may be present around WD 1145+017, including more massive ones at longer orbital periods. In particular, there may be a large planet orbiting at r 2:1 (i.e., with an orbital period of P 2:1 ≈ 9 h), as seen in many of the numerical simulations (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. 7, top-right panel, and 8)</ref>. This planet could have evaded detection so far because it does not transit the WD and does not emit dust like the bodies responsible for the observed transits. Our model, however, does not require the presence of any additional bodies. The disc's Roche-limit overflow may have started relatively recently, such that the pyramidal regime has not yet been filled (see, e.g., the cyan circles for t = 10 7 yr in the bottom-right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>).</p><p>Also shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> (in the bottom panel) is a comparison of WD 1145+017 with the Saturnian system. This shows that (when expressed in dimensionless distance ∆) the positioning and spacing of WD 1145+017's transit periods bears some resemblance to that of Saturn's small inner moons, which are likely to have formed out of the planet's rings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Charnoz et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Charnoz et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">CC12</ref>). Saturn's rings are not currently overflowing the Roche limit (being held back temporarily by satellite MMR torques; <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Tajeddine et al. 2017</ref>), explaining why this system at present does not show the frequent, disruptive, dust-generating collisions that we infer to be associated with the planet-formation process around WD 1145+017. Nevertheless, the presence of Saturn's F ring (likely the result of a relatively recent collision between two small moons;  shows that violent collisions between building blocks are a regular occurrence in these systems. At times of active satellite formation, collisions are likely to be much more frequent. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> also shows that the spacing of objects in both systems is markedly wider than the predictions of the analytical model <ref type="bibr">(Eq. (37)</ref>; shown by the dots in the mass-distance relations). For WD 1145+017, it could be that additional bodies are present but remain undetected because they have not recently undergone dustproducing collisions. If this is the case, continued monitoring of the WD should reveal transits at periods between the observed ones. Alternatively, our analytical model may underestimate the spacing of the bodies, because it does not take into account that gravitational interactions between the massive bodies may increase the average spacing at which mergers happen (currently set to two mutual Hill radii in the model; see Sect. 2.4.5). Future modelling efforts could include N-body simulations to resolve this issue. Alternatively, the merger distance in the model could simply be increased to match the Saturn data, or it could be replaced with a prescription derived from stability-analysis studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chambers et al. 1996</ref>).</p><p>The more general pyramidal-regime prediction of dn/d∆ ∝ 1/∆ does seem to hold approximately for the Saturnian moons (i.e., they are roughly equidistant in log(∆), especially when considering the Epimetheus-Janus pair as a single object; see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b of  CC12</ref>). For WD 1145+017, the distribution of transit periods found in the K2 data may be closer to equidistant in ∆ (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015</ref>), but most of these periodicities still need to be confirmed. Given the difficulty of measuring the masses of very small bodies around a WD, an accurate census of the periodicities in WD 1145+017's light curve may be the most accessible way of testing our model.</p></div>

Here, we discuss these implications in the context of observational constraints.</p><p>The observed IR excess of WD 1145+017 constitutes a fractional luminosity of about 0.3 to 0.5% and requires a projected area of dust that is roughly 50 to 250 times the cross-section of the stellar disc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Zhou et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Xu et al. 2018</ref>). The postulated massive debris disc would produce a significant amount of IR emission (by reprocessing stellar radiation), but, since the disc must be oriented close to edge-on to produce bodies at (nearly) transiting inclinations, we would only detect a small fraction of its emission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vanderburg et al. (2015)</ref> find that a flat, optically thick disc with an inclination aligned with the transiting bodies produces less IR emission than the observed excess. Therefore, the existing photometric data are consistent with the presence of an edge-on massive disc. Fully explaining the observed excess, however, also requires an additional dust population with a different configuration. One possibility is that the IR excess is mostly due to the dust released from the massive bodies. The dust clouds seen in transit already account for some 10 to 20% of the emitting surface area inferred from the IR excess ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Xu et al. 2018</ref>) and it is likely that there is more dust associated with these clouds that passes above or below the stellar disc from our viewpoint.</p><p>The mass accretion rate of WD 1145+017 inferred from its atmospheric pollution (4.3 × 10 10 g s −1 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Xu et al. 2016</ref>) is relatively high (although, unlike the transits, this is not unique to this WD; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dufour et al. 2012</ref>). PR drag (on a physically thin, flat disc) can only explain accretion rates up to ∼ 10 8 g s −1 (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>; Rafikov 2011b), so an additional effect must be at play. We find that viscous spreading can yield the observed accretion rate for discs with masses of a few times 10 27 g (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, bottom-right panel). Hence, if the debris disc that we propose for WD 1145+017 is massive enough, it can potentially explain two uncommon properties of this WD: transits with stable periods and a high accretion rate.</p><p>Finally, the presence of a disc that overflows the Roche limit relaxes the requirement that the mass flow inferred from the transits (∼ 10 11 g s −1 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gänsicke et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rappaport et al. 2016</ref>) must equal that derived from the atmospheric pollution, because the system is not in steady state in this case. Instead, the disc constitutes a large mass reservoir, from which mass flows both inwards (explaining the mass accretion onto the WD) and outwards (producing the massive bodies associated with the transits).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Exoplanet recycling around non-WD hosts</head><p>While our study is primarily concerned with the formation of second-generation planets around WDs, the recycling scenario could in principle also operate around other astrophysical objects, as long as they are dense enough for the Roche limit (for appropriate material densities) to lie far enough outside their surface (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>). Here, we briefly discuss a few interesting cases, noting that further study would be needed to evaluate the planet-forming potential of compact particle discs in these different settings in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.1">Neutron stars</head><p>Because neutron stars are even more compact than WDs, the space between their surface and the Roche limit, where a tidal disc of particles may be located, is substantial. Incidentally, low-mass (M p 1 M Jup ) planets can be detected efficiently around pulsars (highly magnetised, rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit collimated beams of electromagnetic radiation) by searching for planetary perturbations on the otherwise highly stable timing of their pulsed emission (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cordes 1993)</ref>. Using this method, two superEarth-mass planets and one Moon-mass planet were inferred to orbit the pulsar PSR B1257+12 on low-eccentricity orbits with periods between 25 and 100 d <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Wolszczan &amp; Frail 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Wolszczan 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Konacki &amp; Wolszczan 2003)</ref>. The orbital periods of these planets are much longer than those predicted for the recycled planets in this paper (up to ∼ 10 h; see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(46)</ref>), indicating that the recycling mechanism as presented here is not responsible for them. We note, however, that one of the suggested formation scenarios for the pulsar planets involves the tidal disruption of a companion star (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Phinney &amp; Hansen 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Currie &amp; Hansen 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mar- galit &amp; Metzger 2017)</ref>, bearing some resemblance to the recycling scenario presented in this paper.</p><p>Despite the high sensitivity to planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Thorsett &amp; Phillips 1992)</ref>, the trio of planets around PSR B1257+12 remains the only confidently detected set of low-mass planets orbiting a neutron star. Possible reasons why the recycling mechanism presented in this paper does not (often) produce planets around neutron stars are as follows. (1) Neutron-star systems with planetary material available to form a debris disc may be rare, because the planets that orbit a neutron-star progenitor are easily lost during the supernova in which the neutron star is created. Asymmetric supernovae may kick neutron stars away from their planetary systems and, even in symmetric supernovae, the sudden mass loss involved can place planets on unbound hyperbolic trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Thorsett &amp; Dewey 1993)</ref>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> The sublimation radius around a neutron star may lie outside the Roche limit, precluding the formation of a rocky debris disc. The location of the sublimation radius depends on what fraction of the star's spin-down luminosity is available for the heating of dust and debris, which is not well understood. Estimates by <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Wang et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Shannon et al. (2013)</ref> place the sublimation radius for rocky material beyond the Roche limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.2">Hot subdwarfs</head><p>Hot subdwarfs are core-helium-burning stars at or beyond the blue end of the horizontal branch, thought to originate from red-giantbranch stars that undergo enhanced mass loss (possibly due to interaction with a close binary companion) or from mergers of lowmass-WD pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Heber 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Heber , 2016</ref>. With typical masses close to 0.5 M and radii of around 0.2 R (e.g., Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Grootel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Fontaine et al. 2012</ref>), the Roche limit is well outside the stellar surface for these stars. However, hot subdwarfs have effective temperatures exceeding 20,000 K, which may complicate the survival of rocky debris inside the Roche limit against sublimation.</p><p>Two B-type hot subdwarfs have been reported to host closein, Earth-sized candidate exoplanets: Kepler-70, a 2-planet system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Charpinet et al. 2011</ref>), and KIC 10001893, a 3-planet system <ref type="bibr">(Sil- votti et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In both cases, the claimed planets have orbital periods of 5 to 20 h, with period ratios close to MMRs. The suggested explanation for the origin of such planets is the engulfment of some of a star's original gas-giant planets during its red-giantbranch evolution, after which the planets undergo rapid inward migration and extensive mass loss, while the star is stripped of much of its envelop and becomes a hot subdwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Charpinet et al. 2011</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Passy et al. 2012</ref>). In a variation of this formation scenario, only a single giant planet is engulfed and the observed planets are remnants of its tidally disrupted core <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bear &amp; Soker 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Could the recycling mechanism presented in this paper play a role in the formation of the putative hot-subdwarf planets? On the one hand, their orbital periods are broadly consistent with the prediction of Eq. (46), which argues in favour of the recycling scenario. On the other hand, both reported systems feature multiple Earth-sized candidate exoplanets, contrary to the predicted architecture of the recycled planetary systems, which typically consist of a single large planet plus a set of much smaller ones. Our model, however, does not include resonant interactions between planets. Satellite-formation studies in which such effects are taken into account show that systems with two or three bodies of similar mass, orbiting in or close to MMRs with one another, can sometimes occur ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Salmon &amp; Canup 2017)</ref>. Finally, as mentioned above, the sublimation of rocky material inside the Roche limit may be a problem for the recycling scenario. However, circumstances may exist in which the debris is stable against sublimation (e.g., a high ambient gas pressure can quench sublimation; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Rafikov &amp; Garmilla 2012)</ref>. To sum up, the hot-subdwarf planets (if real) have the need to be generated after their host star's giant-branch phase and roughly fit the expected orbital periods, which is intriguing, but a more sophisticated model that can handle resonant interactions between planets is needed to understand whether they could have spawned from a massive tidal disc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.3">Late-type main-sequence stars and substellar objects</head><p>Most types of main-sequence stars have a relatively low mean density and a high luminosity, with the consequence that the Roche limit for such stars is inside the sublimation radius (or even inside the stellar radius for early-type stars). At the low-mass end of the main-sequence, however, the mean density goes up steeply (reaching a maximum of around ρ ∼ 10 2 g cm −3 at the star/brown-dwarf boundary), while luminosity goes down. As a result, late M-type main-sequence stars, as well as substellar objects such as brown dwarfs and giant planets, can host rocky debris discs in the space between their surface or the sublimation radius and the Roche limit. For most of these central objects, however, this space is not available immediately (i.e., while first-generation planets may be forming), because they take a long time to contract to their eventual compact size (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref>). Hence, any possible tidal discs around brown dwarfs and M dwarfs would have to form later (after several tens of Myr), for instance when a late instability in the host's planetary system sends a massive body into the tidal disruption sphere. If compact tidal discs do occur around mature low-mass stars or substellar objects, and if these discs are massive enough, they may produce second-generation (minor) planets via the recycling mechanism. A complication may be that planet migration due to stellar tides (which we neglected in our model for WDs) may have to be taken into account for these hosts, because they are not as compact as WDs. If the central object's rotation period is longer than P 2:1 , the tidal migration of planets at r ≤ r 2:1 is directed inwards. Mature brown dwarfs mostly have rotation periods of the order of a few hours (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Radigan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Metchev et al. 2015</ref>), so tidal inspiral is unlikely to pose a problem for recycled planets around most of them. The rotation periods of old M dwarfs, however, often reach values of the order of 1 to 100 d (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Irwin et al. 2011</ref>). Therefore, if the tidal torques are strong enough, they may prevent recycled planets around M dwarfs from persisting after the disc's mass decreases (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Rosenblatt et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Do we know of any exoplanets that could have formed in a recycling event? Not many exoplanets are known that orbit late M dwarfs and none are presently known around brown dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">He et al. 2017</ref>). Most of the low-mass planets discovered around late M dwarfs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">GJ</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dittmann et al. 2017</ref>) have orbital periods that are significantly longer than the prediction of Eq. (46). An exception is Kepler-42 c, which has an orbital period of 10.8 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Muirhead et al. 2012</ref>). The fact that this planet is situated in a multi-planet system with similarly sized planets further out, however, suggests a more conventional (first-generation) formation scenario.</p><p>In short, none of the currently known exoplanets around lowmass stars seem to have formed via the recycling scenario. However, late M dwarfs and brown dwarfs have not yet been surveyed for exoplanets very extensively. It is possible that recycled exoplanets do occur around these objects, but have not yet been found. Ongoing and future exoplanet-detection programs specifically targeting late M dwarfs and/or brown dwarfs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">MEarth, Nutzman &amp; Charbonneau 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">SPECULOOS, Burdanov et al. 2017</ref>) may be able to determine whether recycled exoplanets occur around these hosts and, if so, how common they are.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper considered the evolution of massive debris discs around WDs, using both analytical and numerical techniques. Following previous work on WD debris discs, we start by assuming that these discs are located inside the star's tidal disruption zone and that they are geometrically and dynamically similar to Saturn's rings. As a first conclusion, we reiterate the result known for planetary rings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Daisaka et al. 2001</ref>) that vertically optically thick discs located in the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone are gravitationally unstable (see Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), which means that they have an enhanced effective viscosity due to self-gravity wakes.</p><p>Previous theoretical work on the evolution of WD debris discs has focussed on disc evolution caused by PR drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Rafikov 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov 2011)</ref>. Our findings for low-mass discs are consistent with the results of these studies (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, top-left panel; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, bottom panels), but we also quantify the upper limit in surface mass density for which they are valid. For values above 10 3 to 10 4 g cm −2 (corresponding to disc masses around the mass of Pluto; ∼ 10 25 g), viscous spreading becomes more important than PR drag for the disc's evolution (see Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> <ref type="figure">; Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>The effective viscosity of a gravitationally unstable particle disc increases rapidly with distance (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>). As a result, discs whose evolution is dominated by viscous spreading have an outer edge that moves outwards rapidly, while a pile-up of material forms at their inner edge, which only moves inwards slowly. For intermediate-mass discs (with masses from 10 25 to 10 26 g, depending on their radial location), the viscous spreading can decrease surface densities to the point where PR drag takes over and subsequent evolution follows that known for low-mass discs (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, top-right panel). For discs more massive than about 10 26 g (roughly the mass of Io), however, the outer edge of the disc has reached the Roche limit before this happens (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> <ref type="figure">; Fig. 4)</ref>.</p><p>When disc material spreads to beyond the Roche limit, it is no longer prevented from coagulating by tidal forces and Keplerian shear, so this material will gather into larger bodies. Hence, viscous-spreading-dominated discs can produce a set of secondgeneration (minor) planets just outside their Roche limit (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, bottom panel) in the same fashion that small moonlets are being formed at the outer edge of Saturn's rings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Charnoz et al. 2010</ref>). For massive discs, this process takes place on relatively short (sub-Myr) timescales (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, middle panels), while the discs themselves can survive against viscous spreading and PR drag for longer than the age of the universe (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref>; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, bottom-left panel).</p><p>The bodies that form at the disc's outer edge migrate outwards by exchanging angular momentum with the disc via MMRs and they grow through mutual mergers. The interplay of these two effects results in a distinctive pattern of minor planets whose masses and mutual spacing increase with distance from the disc (see Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref>; <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), as has previously been studied in detail for massive planetary-ring systems (CC12). At a given radial distance, minor-planet masses go down with time, since mass flows through to larger bodies at greater radial distances, while continued viscous spreading decreases the disc's surface density, reducing the Roche-limit mass outflow available for forming new bodies (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs. 6, bottom panel, and 8)</ref>.</p><p>The outward migration of the bodies stops at r 2:1 , the radius at which their 2:1 MMR coincides with the Roche limit (because none of their first-order MMRs would overlap with the disc anymore if they were to migrate beyond this point). Only a limited amount of mass can be accommodated by minor planets in between the Roche limit and r 2:1 (see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(44)</ref>). Once this space has been filled up (which happens eventually for most planet-producing discs), material starts to accumulate into a single massive body at r 2:1 . This means that massive WD debris discs (i.e., with masses of about 10 26 g and higher) generally give rise to a single massive planet orbiting at r 2:1 , together with a set of smaller bodies in smaller orbits (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. 6, bottom panel, and 8</ref>).</p><p>The massive planet at r 2:1 can take up a substantial fraction of the disc's original mass (tens of per cent; see Eq. (45); <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, top panels). This means that if a super Earth is tidally disrupted by a WD and forms a massive debris disc, it can be partially recycled to form an Earth-mass second-generation planet. Given its 2:1 MMR with the Roche limit, the planet at r 2:1 has a clearly predictable orbital period (around 10 h; see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(46)</ref>). It is located in the WD's habitable zone for old, cool WDs (with cooling ages between about 2 and 10 Gyr; see Sect. 4.3). Constraints on the occurrence rate of this type of exoplanet are still relatively weak, but they are likely to be improved by several upcoming large, high-cadence transit surveys that include WD targets (see Sect. 4.4; <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>; <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>). The best place to look for such planets may be WDs that exhibit a strong IR excess and/or circumstellar gas in absorption, although it is also possible that a disc that gives rise to planets is destroyed after producing them (see <ref type="bibr">Sect. 4.2)</ref>.</p><p>As an application of our second-generation-planet-formation model, we have investigated whether it can shed light on the curious properties of WD 1145+017 (Sect. 4.5). The light curve of this WD shows irregularly shaped dips, probably caused by transiting clouds of dust orbiting close to the Roche limit. These dips repeat with remarkably stable periods, which can be explained if the dust is released from long-lived, massive bodies. The presence of such bodies on low-eccentricity orbits close to the Roche limit, however, is difficult to explain, since this region has been cleared earlier in the star's evolution. Second-generation planet formation from a massive debris disc, as presented in this paper, provides a natural explanation for the presence of massive bodies just outside the Roche limit. Furthermore, if WD 1145+017 currently hosts a disc that is overflowing the Roche limit, the transiting dust clouds may be the result of collisions that are part of the planet-formation process. In the context of this scenario, we make rough predictions for the masses of the putative bodies associated with the various observed transit periods (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>).</p><p>While our study mainly focussed on what happens around the outer edge of massive WD debris discs, we also obtained results on the mass accretion rates of WDs that host such discs. Specifically, we find that in discs more massive than about 10 27 g (i.e., the mass of a terrestrial planet) viscous spreading can directly dictate the inward mass flow at the sublimation radius, causing mass accretion rates of 10 9 g s −1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7, bottom-right panel)</ref>. Thus, the viscous spreading of very massive debris discs is a possible explanation for the high (super-PR-drag) mass accretion rates seen in some heavily polluted WDs. For WD 1145+017, in particular, the presence of such a disc may be able to simultaneously explain the massive bodies related to its transits and the high mass accretion rate inferred from its atmospheric pollution.</p><p>Finally, we have explored the potential of other astrophysical objects to host tidal discs that can spawn second-generation planets (see Sect. 4.6). Objects with sufficient compactness include neutron stars and hot subdwarf stars, but in both cases sublimation may preclude the presence of rocky debris inside the Roche limit. In the case of neutron stars, the loss of planetary material during their birth supernovae may be an additional obstruction. A more likely class of hosts consists of late M-type main-sequence stars and substellar objects like brown dwarfs and giant planets. At a mature age, these objects are compact and cool enough to allow rocky debris to persist inside the Roche limit (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref>). Hence, if such discs are formed at the right time and if they are massive enough, recycled planets may be produced around this class of hosts, although stellar tides may impede their survival around M dwarfs. We have examined whether any known (candidate) exoplanets around the above types of objects may have formed via the recycling scenario, but find that none conclusively show the expected characteristics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>of Metzger et al. 2012)</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Sometimes, the term &apos;Roche limit&apos; is used to refer strictly to the incompressible-fluid case with C R ≈ 2.456 in Eq. (1). We use the term more generally to mean the radial distance inside of which tides and shear cause an approaching secondary body to break up, or prevent a ring of particles from accumulating into a larger body (Holsapple &amp; Michel 2006).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> This &apos;PR-drag disc-evolution timescale&apos; is not to be confused with the more commonly used &apos;PR-drag timescale&apos;, i.e., the time it takes for an individual particle to migrate from some radius onto its host star. These two are only the same (to within a factor of order unity) for optically thin discs (Bochkarev &amp; Rafikov 2011).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Equation (19) can be derived from Eq. (14) by setting t visc = t crit (r R ), as given by Eq. (22), and solving for Σ. MNRAS 000, 1-28 (2018)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> For initial radii very close to the Roche limit, much less massive discs can also reach the Roche limit, and in Fig. 4 the M form curve even drops below the M crit one. This is because a well-defined M crit requires a non-zero scaled disc width δ, while the derivation of M form assumes that the disc is initially infinitely thin.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> Stricktly speaking, the relevant length scale is the wavelength of the fastest growing unstable mode λ fgm = 2σ r /(GΣ), rather than λ T , which is the wavelength of the longest instability. For Q T 2 (to which the gravitationally unstable disc material is expected to converge; see Sect. 2.2), however, these two length scales are approximately the same. MNRAS 000, 1-28 (2018)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> When expressed in terms of absolute physical quantities rather than the dimensionless ∆, q, and T (called τ disk in the notation of CC12), there are small differences between our formulae and those of CC12. This is due to a difference in prescription for the viscous timescale (CC12 omit the factor 1/12) and a different treatment of the Roche prefactor (fixed to C R = 2.456 by CC12).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> This can be derived from Eq. (S18) of CC12 (which gives the scaled distance of pyramidal-regime bodies when they are about to merge) by solving for q and multiplying the result by 3/2. The multiplication accounts for the fact that pyramidal-regime bodies on average have a mass that is a factor 3/2 higher than the mass used in CC12&apos;s Eq. (S18), because mergers result in bodies of twice the mass at the same distance.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Close to ∆ 2:1 , the relations will already become less accurate, because the derivations of CC12 use the approximation r r R (i.e., ∆ 1). MNRAS 000, 1-28 (2018)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> The detection limits shown in Fig. 9 are for planets orbiting at r 2:1 . Planets orbiting at r R transit twice more frequently than those at r 2:1 , but with transit durations that are a factor 2 1/3 shorter. Both these differences affect N in , so the detection limits for bodies at r R should be lower by a factor 2/2 1/3 = 2 1/3 ≈ 1.26 compared with the dashed lines in the figure.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> Incidentally, the 10-h-period terrestrial planet proposed by Li et al. (1998) to explain the peculiar emission lines of the highly magnetic WD GD 356 (see also Wickramasinghe et al. 2010) could have formed via the exoplanet-recycling scenario presented in this paper. MNRAS 000, 1-28 (2018)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="12"> For example, spherical grey dust grains of size s = 3 µm (well above the minimum grain size derived from multiwavelength transit observations; Xu et al. 2018) and density ρ d = 3 g cm −3 in orbit around WD 1145+017 (with parameters M ≈ 0.6 M , L ≈ 0.009 L ; Vanderburg et al. 2015) would have a radiation-pressure-to-gravity force ratio of β ≈ 0.001 (e.g., Burns et al. 1979). After being released from a massive (β 0) body whose orbit is circular, such grains would orbit the WD at a period that is a factor (1 − β)/(1 − 2β) 3/2 1 + 2β ≈ 1.002 longer than that of their parent body (e.g., Eq. (B6) of Rappaport et al. 2014), which is comparable to the ratio of the observed periods (4.499 h/4.490 h ≈ 1.002).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="13"> The evidence for the hot-subdwarf planets -sinusoidal modulations in the light curves of the stars, interpreted as the daysides of planets coming in and out of view (Charpinet et al. 2011; Silvotti et al. 2014) -is far from conclusive. Krzesinski (2015), for instance, has challenged the planetary origin of the light-curve modulations. MNRAS 000, 1-28 (2018)</note>

Since angular-momentum change rates are equivalent to torques, the conditions under which these two processes are in balance can be found by equating their radial torque densities:</p><p>We now proceed to determine expressions for the individual torque densities associated with viscosity and PR drag.

For a disc that is optically thick to the impinging radiation (τ 1), this factor simplifies to φ r 1. We choose the negative sign because the azimuthal PR-drag force acts in the direction opposite to the rotation of the disc. The PR-drag torque on a narrow disc annulus of width dr is 2πrdr × f ϕ,PR × r, and hence the radial density of PR-drag torque on the disc is</p><p>Inserting expressions (A3) and (A5) into Eq.
