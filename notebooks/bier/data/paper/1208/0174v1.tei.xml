			<abstract>
				<p>Gravitational microlensing, when finite size source effects are relevant, provides an unique tool for the study of source star stellar atmospheres through an enhancement of a characteristic polarization signal. This is due to the differential magnification induced during the crossing of the source star. In this paper we consider a specific set of reported highly magnified, both single and binary exoplanetary systems, microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge and evaluate the expected polarization signal. To this purpose, we consider several polarization models which apply to different types of source stars: hot, late type main sequence and cool giants. As a result we compute the polarization signal P , which goes up to P=0.04 percent for late type stars and up to a few percent for cool giants, depending on the underlying physical polarization processes and atmosphere model parameters. Given a I band magnitude at maximum magnification of about 12, and a typical duration of the polarization signal up to 1 day, we conclude that the currently available technology, in particular the polarimeter in FORS2 on the VLT, potentially may allow the detection of such signals. This observational programme may take advantage of the currently available surveys plus follow up strategy already routinely used for microlensing monitoring towards the Galactic bulge (aimed at the detection of exoplanets). In particular, this allows one to predict in advance for which events and at which exact time the observing resources may be focused to make intensive polarization measurements.</p>

At the same time, microlensing leads to the discovery and the detailed characterization of exoplanetary systems when planetary deviations in the light-curves expected for single-lens events are detected (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dominik (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gaudi (2010)</ref> for recent reviews).</p><p>Microlenses can spatially resolve a source star thanks to caustic structures created by a lens system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schneider, Ehlers &amp; Falco 1992</ref>). Caustics are formed by a set of closed curves, along which the point source magnification is formally infinite, with a steep increase in magnification in their vicinity. This increase is so steep that the characteristic length scale of the differential magnification effect is of the order of a fraction of the source star radius. In this way different parts of the source star are magnified by substantially different amounts. The resulting lensing light-curve deviates from the standard form expected for a point source event <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Witt &amp; Mao 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gould 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alcock et al. 1997</ref>) and the analysis of the deviations enables to measure the limb-darkening profile of the lensed star.</p><p>Early works <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Witt &amp; Mao 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Loeb &amp; Sasselov 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Valls-Gabaud 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heyrovsk´yHeyrovsk´y 2003)</ref> have pointed out the sensitivity of microlensing light-curves to limb-darkening, with the aim to help to remove the microlensing model parameter degeneracy. The specific use of microlensing as a tool to study stellar atmospheres was proposed later ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hendry et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gaudi &amp; Gould 1999</ref>), in particular to probe atmospheres of red giants in the Galactic bulge <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heyrovsk´yHeyrovsk´y &amp; Sasselov 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The best candidate events for studying stellar atmospheres are highly magnified microlensing events, which also show relevant finite size source effects. For these events the lens and the background source star are almost aligned and the lens passes over the surface of the source star (transit events). Although relatively rare, these events potentially contain unique information on the stellar atmosphere properties of the source star as shown by  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zub et al. (2010)</ref>. Indeed, besides the brightness profile of a remote source star disc, highly magnified events with large finite size source effects allow to measure the lens Einstein radius RE (if the physical radius R * of the source is known) and provide a unique chance to study spectroscopically Galactic bulge stars.</p><p>The light-curve analysis of highly magnified events is also sensitive to the presence of lens planetary companions, in particular when the planet-to star distance is of the order of RE. The same opportunity for studying stellar atmospheres is offered by binary microlensing due to caustic crossing as the source passes through fold <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schneider, Ehlers &amp; Falco 1992)</ref> and cusp caustics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Schneider &amp; Weiss 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zakharov 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of the present paper is to consider polarization variability of the source star light for real events, taking into account different polarization mechanisms according to the source star type. Indeed, variations in the polarization curves are similar to finite source effects in microlensing when color effects may appear due to limb darkening and color distribution across the disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Witt &amp; Mao 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bogdanov &amp; Cherepashchuk 1995a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gaudi &amp; Gould 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bogdanov &amp; Cherepashchuk 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dominik 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heyrovsk´yHeyrovsk´y 2007)</ref>.</p><p>It is known that the light received from the stellar limb may be significantly (up to about 12 percent) polarized due to the so called Sobolev -Chandrasekhar effect <ref type="bibr">(Sobolev 1949;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chandrasekhar 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sobolev 1963)</ref>. Polarization parallel to the limb of the source is caused by photon (Thomson) scattering off free electrons, when the light passes through the stellar atmosphere. This polarization mechanism is effective for hot stars of any luminosity class which, indeed, have a free electron atmosphere.</p><p>It is also known that, by a minor extent, the continuum spectrum of the main sequence stars of late type is linearly polarized by coherent (Rayleigh) scattering on neutral hydrogen in its ground state and, with a minor contribution, by scattering on free electrons <ref type="bibr">(Fluri &amp; Stenflo 1999</ref>). The polarization in late type stars has been measured only for the Sun (for which due to the distance the projected disc is spatially resolved) and also in this case as for hot stars, the polarization gets its maximum value near the solar limb, due to the most favorable geometry there.</p><p>However, the light received from the stars is usually unpolarized, since the flux from each stellar disc element is the same. A net polarization of the stellar light may be introduced by some suitable asymmetry in the stellar disc (e.g. eclipses, tidal distortions, stellar spots, fast rotation, magnetic fields) and also in the propagation through the interstellar medium <ref type="bibr">(Bochkarev, Karitskaya &amp; Sakhibulin 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dolginov, Gnedin &amp; Silant'ev 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In the microlensing context, polarization in the stellar light is induced due to the proper motion of the lens star through the source star disc, during which different parts are magnified by different amounts. Therefore, the gravitational lens scans the disc of the background star giving rise not only to a time dependent gravitational magnification of the source star light but also to a time dependent polarization.</p><p>As for the limb-darkening brightness profile, the polarization degree is maximized when the source trajectory crosses regions with high magnification gradient. This occurs in transit events since the magnification of the source star flux increases as the lens approaches closer to the source star, and during binary microlensing events since now there is the opportunity for caustic crossing.</p><p>Accordingly, we consider the polarization variability for the transit events (with lenses passing over source stars) selected by <ref type="bibr">Choi et al. (2011)</ref> and for a subset of exoplanetary events towards the Galactic bulge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gaudi 2010)</ref>. Exoplanetary events are binary lens systems characterized by values of the planet-to-star mass ratio q ≪ 1 and have smaller star-to-planet distance d as compared to the separation of the stars in a binary system. A full treatment of the polarization in binary microlensing events will be the subject of a subsequent paper. Here, selecting a representative sample of exoplanetary events, we show how the polarization works in binary microlensing.</p><p>The idea that polarization induced by an electron scattering atmosphere could be enhanced by gravitational microlensing and eventually observed was first raised and investigated in relation to supernovae by <ref type="bibr">Schneider &amp; Wagoner (1987)</ref>. In particular, the observation of a variable polarization due to a supernova beam expanding in a self-gravitating system constituted by individual masses (&gt; ∼ 10 −3 M⊙) may indicate the presence of dark matter objects.</p><p>Then, Simmons, Newsam &amp; Willis (1995a), Simmons, <ref type="bibr">Willis &amp; Newsam (1995b)</ref> and Bogdanov, <ref type="bibr">Cherepashchuk &amp; Sazhin (1996)</ref> pointed out that the polarization of star light induced by an electron scattering atmosphere is enhanced by the microlensing effect and that the relative motion of source and lens causes a time variation of the source polarization degree. Simmons, <ref type="bibr">Newsam &amp; Willis (1995a)</ref> and Simmons, <ref type="bibr">Willis &amp; Newsam (1995b)</ref> also present a numerical calculation of the polarization degree induced by a single-lens (the Schwarzschild lens), showing that during a microlensing event the polarization profile has a double peak for transit events, (where a part of the source disc is aligned with the lens and observer), while it has a single peak in the bypass events (where the source trajectory remains outside the lens).</p><p>Assuming that the source star has an electron scatter-ing atmosphere, Agol (1996) calculated the time-dependent polarization of a star being gravitationally lensed by a binary system. Polarization as high as P ≃ 1 percent can be achieved if the star crosses a caustic or passes near a cusp; otherwise, the maximum polarization is ≃ 0.1 percent. Polarization by non-compact microlenses <ref type="bibr">(Gurevich &amp; Zybin 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zakharov &amp; Sazhin 1996a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zakharov 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zakharov , 2010</ref>) was also analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Belokurov &amp; Sazhin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zakharov 1998</ref>) since a source may cross caustics arising in the model. The most likely candidates for observing polarization variability during microlensing events would be young, hot giant star sources, because they have electron scattering atmospheres needed for producing limb polarization through Thomson scattering <ref type="bibr">(Simmons, Willis &amp; Newsam 1995b)</ref>. Unfortunately, the bulge of the Galaxy does not contain a large number of hot giant stars. However, polarization may be also induced by the scattering of star light off atoms, molecules and dust grains in the adsorptive atmospheres of evolved, cool stars as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Simmons et al. (2002)</ref> and Ignace, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bjorkman &amp; Bryce (2006)</ref>. These more ubiquitous stars, that do not have levels of polarization as high as those predicted by the Chandrasekar model, may display an intrinsic polarization of up to several percent, due to the presence of stellar winds that give rise to extended adsorptive envelopes. This is the case for many cool giant stars, in particular for the red giants. Such evolved stars constitute a significant fraction of the lensed sources towards the Galactic bulge, the LMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alcock et al. 1997</ref>) and the M31 galaxy (Calchi Novati 2010), making them valuable candidates for observing variable polarization during microlensing events.</p><p>Polarization measurements on ongoing microlensing events can be useful for further characterizing them, for testing stellar atmosphere models and to complement finite source measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gould 1994)</ref>. In this respect, the detection of a variable polarization leads to an independent measure of the angular Einstein radius RE of the lens, the position angle of the lens and the velocity direction in the sky <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Yoshida 2006</ref>).</p><p>Of course, since accurate polarization measurements cannot be obtained with a survey telescope, alert systems are necessary allowing other larger telescopes to take polarimetric measurements during a microlensing event.</p><p>For definiteness, we consider the observed sample of highly magnified, single-lens transit events ( <ref type="bibr">Choi et al. 2011</ref>) and a subset of exoplanetary events observed towards the Galactic bulge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gaudi 2010</ref>). For these events we calculate the polarization profiles as a function of time taking into account the nature of the source stars. As an illustration, we also consider the expected polarization signal for the PA-99-N2 event towards M31 (Paulin- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Henriksson et al. 2003</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Basic equations</head><p>Let us consider the linear polarization of light scattered in a stellar atmosphere. Following the approach in Chandrasekhar (1960) we define the intensities I l (µ) and Ir(µ) emitted by the scattering atmosphere in the direction making an angle χ with the normal to the star surface and polarized as follows: I l (µ) is the intensity in the plane containing the line of sight and the normal, Ir(µ) is the intensity in the direction perpendicular to this plane (light propagates in the direction r × l). Here µ = cos θ and we are assuming that the polarization is a function only of µ. The centerto-limb variation in the polarization across the stellar disc originates from the contribution of the scattering opacity to the total opacity in the star atmosphere. The polarization typically increases from the center (µ = 1) to the stellar limb (µ = 0) since we tend to see more scattered, hence polarized, light towards the limb. In the hot stars, electron (Thomson) scattering is one cause of opacity. In the case of cool stars, coherent (Rayleigh) scattering on atomic and molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, and scattering off dust grains provide the main source of the scattering opacity.</p><p>We choose a coordinate system in the lens plane with the origin at the center (x0, y0) of the projected position of the source star. The Oz axis is directed towards the observer, the Ox axis is directed towards the lens (in single-lens events) and oriented parallel to the star-to-planet separation (in binary events). The location of a point (x, y) on the star surface is determined by the angular distance ρ from the origin of the coordinates and by the angle ϕ with the Ox axis (x = x0 + ρ cos ϕ and y = y0 + ρ sin ϕ). In the above coordinate system µ = 1 − ρ 2 /R 2 , where R is the star angular size. Here and in the following all distances are given in units of the Einstein radius RE of the total lens mass.</p><p>To calculate the polarization of a star with center at the position (x0, y0) we integrate the unnormalized Stokes parameters and the flux over the star <ref type="bibr">(Simmons, Newsam &amp; Willis 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Simmons, Willis &amp; Newsam 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol 1996</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F = F0 2π 0 R 0 A(x, y) I+(µ) ρdρ dϕ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">FQ = F0 2π 0 R 0 A(x, y) I−(µ) cos 2ϕ ρdρ dϕ ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">FU = F0 2π 0 R 0 A(x, y) I−(µ) sin 2ϕ ρdρ dϕ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where F0 is the unamplified star flux, A(x, y) the point source amplification due to the lens system and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I+(µ) = Ir(µ) + I l (µ) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">I−(µ) = Ir(µ) − I l (µ) .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>As usual, the polarization degree and the polarization angle are (Chandrasekhar 1960)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P = F 2 Q + F 2 U F , θP = 1 2 tan −1 FU FQ .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Clearly, neglecting other distorting factors, the stellar light will be unpolarized if we observe the source star without any gravitational lens effect since, due to the symmetry of their expressions, the parameters FQ and FU are equal to zero. The gravitational field produced by the lensing system breaks the spherical symmetry over the projected stellar disc and thus results in a non-vanishing polarization.</p><p>For single-lens events the amplification is <ref type="bibr">(Einstein 1936;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Paczy´nskiPaczy´nski 1986)</ref> A(x, y) = ρs + 2 ρs ρ 2 s + 4 ,</p><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ρ 2 s = ρ 2 0 + ρ 2 − 2ρ0ρ cos ϕ (8)</formula><p>is the angular distance between the considered surface element on the stellar disc and the lens position. Here ρ0 (ρ) is the angular distance of the lens (the surface element) from the star center 1 .</p><p>In the case of binary events, we evaluate the amplification map A(x, y) at any point in the source plane by using the Inverse Ray-Shooting method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kayser, Refsdal &amp; Stabell 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wambsganss 1997)</ref>.

As emphasized in these works, the model is well suited to describe polarization in evolved, cool stars that exhibit stellar winds significantly stronger than those of the Sun. The scattering opacity responsible for producing the polarization is the photon scattering on atomic and molecular species (Rayleigh) or on dust grains.

Indeed, since dust grains and molecules cannot form at temperatures higher than 3000 K − 4000 K, a circumstellar cavity was considered between the photosphere radius R and the condensation radius R h , where the temperature drops to 1500 K. The star envelope was assumed optically thin and the relevant scattering cross-section was evaluated in the dipole approximation. The relevant expressions for the Stokes parameters are given in the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Simmons et al.

This means that the wind mass-loss rate must be around 10 −7 M⊙ yr −1 to obtain τ λ ≃ 0.1. This level of mass loss can be achieved only in AGB stars. This class of stars constitutes the sources of only a few of the observed microlensing events, while much more common are subgiants and red giant stars. For a realistic estimate of the polarization level for these stars, one has to relate τ λ to the stellar parameters of the magnified star. Indeed, it is well known that from main sequence to AGB phases, the massloss rate increases by 7 order of magnitude ( <ref type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2005</ref>). By performing simulations of the mass loss of intermediate and low-mass stars, it was shown that the increase of mass loss is a continuous function (while the velocity and temperature evolutionary traces show gaps between the subgiant and AGB phases) and that ˙ M obeys the relation ( <ref type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2005</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">˙ M = 2 × 10 −14 (L/L⊙)(R/R⊙) 3 (T /T⊙) 9 (M/M⊙) 2 M⊙ yr −1 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>So, for the more common stars evolving from main sequence to red giant star phases (see also Here, we adopt the above formalism to derive the polarization profiles for source stars with envelopes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">POLARIZATION RESULTS</head><p>To make predictions of the polarization behavior during microlensing we have generated a large sample of single and binary lens events. Assuming the nature of the source star (a hot star, a late type main sequence or a cool giant star) and its radius ρ * , we explore the multidimensional space for microlensing (u0, tE, RE) and planetary (q, d, α) parameters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Ingrosso et al. 2006, 2009)</ref>, with the aim of deriving the polarization signal and eventually its observability. For  a given set of parameters of both the source and lens system, we first evaluate the amplification map in the lens plane and then the corresponding polarization curve, which shows a continuous variation with time, depending on the source position in the lens plane.</p><p>For single-lens events, generally, the maximum polarization degree takes place at the time t0 of the maximum amplification. This happens when ρ * /u0 &lt; 1 (bypass events) for which the source trajectory remains outside the lens. For single-lens events with ρ * /u0 &gt; 1 (transit events) for which some part of the source is directly aligned with the lens center and observer, the polarization curve has two maxima and one minimum, bracketed by the maxima, which coincides with the instant of maximum amplification <ref type="bibr">(Simmons, Newsam &amp; Willis 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Simmons, Willis &amp; Newsam 1995b</ref>). In the case of transit events, the polarization signal gets the maximum value when the source disk enters and exits the fold caustic (two peaks appear at symmetrical position with respect to t0). In this case, the characteristic time scale ∆t * between the two peaks of the polarization curve is related to the transit duration of the source disc by ( <ref type="bibr">Choi et al. 2011</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∆t * ≃ 2tE × ρ 2 * − u 2 0 .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>In binary microlensing events, for which there are a central (stellar) and one or two planetary caustics depending on the star-to-planet separation d &gt; 1 or d &lt; 1, respectively, significant polarization may be induced when the star trajectory intersects one of the caustics. Then, a polarization peak occurring at t = t0 implies that a planetary caustic is intersected by the source. Moreover, as for single-lens events, if the star source bypasses one caustic (central or planetary), a single polarization peak appears in the polarization profile at the time of nearest approach, while a double-peak feature occurs if the stellar disc transits a caustic.</p><p>Therefore, detection of polarization signals may allow, in principle, to distinguish between single and binary lens events. Indeed, single and binary events can be separated by the presence of a polarization signal at t = t0 or by an eventual asymmetry in the polarization curve (near t0) induced by the planetary caustic. This happens for events with b ≃ 1, for which the planetary caustic shifts in a position close to the central one.</p><p>In general, the polarization signal in binary microlensing events depends on the projected source trajectory in the lens plane, the size and position of the caustics and the diameter of the source disc. In Section 3.2 we consider, as an example, some exoplanetary events well observed towards the Galactic center, leaving a detailed study of the polarization in binary microlensing events to a subsequent analysis.</p><p>For single-lens events and polarization induced by electron scattering in the atmosphere of hot stars, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> we show the polarization degree P (in percent) as a function of the ratio ρ * /u0. As one can see, for ρ * /u0 &gt; ∼ 0.3 and ρ * &lt; ∼ 0.1, the polarization degree depends only on the ratio ρ * /u0 (see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3 in Yoshida (2006)</ref>). The polarization degree has the maximum value Pmax ≃ 0.7 percent at ρ * /u0 ≃ 1.04 and for low ρ * values. For large values of ρ * the polarization degree decreases as the star radius increases. We note that, similarly to limb-darkening measurements, the polarization degree is maximized for events with large finite source effects, namely for ρ * /u0 ≃ 1.</p><p>To compare the polarization degree for the three considered source models (hot, late type main sequence and cool giant stars), in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> we show P versus ρ * /u0. As in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>, the maximum polarization occurs at ρ * /u0 ≃ 1 and for low values of ρ * . The polarization for late type stars is calculated in the I-band assuming qI = 4.2 × 10 −4 , kI = 50 and ΓI = 0.5, that are typical parameter values for Sun like stars. As one can see the maximum polarization degree is in any case much lower than that for hot star sources. In the case of cool giant stars the polarization profile is not much different with respect to that for hot stars if τ ≃ 10 −3 . Of course, even larger values for P can be obtained, provided that τ &gt; 10 −3 . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> we also see that there exists a limiting value of the ratio ρ * /u0 (≃ 1.7 for τ = 10 −3 ) at which the polarization degree for cool giant stars overcomes that for hot stars. This is a relevant point since, as we shall see  later on, so large values of ρ * /u0 are rather common in the microlensing events observed towards the Galactic bulge.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> for cool giant stars we show how the polarization degree depends on the relevant model parameters <ref type="bibr">(Simmons, Newsam &amp; Willis 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Simmons et al. 2002)</ref>. We take ρ * = 0.01 and τ = 10 −3 and let the circumstellar envelope parameters β and R h vary. For ρ * /u0 &gt; 0.5 the polarization degree is almost insensitive to the β and R h values, since the polarization is mainly due to the source star disc.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>, for late type stars, we show how the polariza-tion degree depends on the ratio ρ * /u0 and the parameters Γ λ , q λ and k λ ≡ m −1 λ in eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. To this aim, we consider the V, R, I bands for which, adopting the relations and the parameter values in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Stenflo (2005)</ref>, we obtain qV = 2.5×10 −3 , kV = 18 (in the V band), qR = 1.2×10 −3 , kR = 23 (in the R band), qI = 4.2 × 10 −4 , kI = 50 (in the I band). As one can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> the polarization in late type stars is almost insensitive to variation of Γ, while it rapidly decreases from the V to I band. In this respect, polarization observations towards late type stars should be performed at low wavelength, at least for near enough objects for which absorption by interstellar medium is negligible. However, for polarization measurements towards Galactic bulge stars, the I band represents the best compromise between interstellar absorption and the dependence of the polarization on wavelength.</p><p>Concerning the polarization in exoplanetary events, as already mentioned, we find that one or more spikes appear in the polarization profiles when the caustics are crossed by the source star disc, corresponding to a large amplification of a narrow piece of the star surface. Outside the caustics, the polarization signal from the total stellar flux is almost vanishing. Clearly, in a real observation, the obtained polarization profile, in addition to the usual light-curve observations, may be used to constrain the binary system parameters.</p><p>To be more explicit on the expected polarization variability in microlensing, we now focus on a sample of highly magnified transit events (both single-lens and exoplanetary) observed towards the Galactic bulge by the OGLE and MOA collaborations ( <ref type="bibr">Choi et al. 2011</ref>). We also consider some bypass exoplanetary events towards the Galactic bulge for which the polarization signal is enhanced by the source star transiting a planetary caustics. The parameters of the best fit models to the light-curves are given for single-lens events in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and for exoplanetary events in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>

In these events the lens crosses over the source star disc and therefore, at the peak of the event, different parts of the source are magnified by substantially different amounts.

The adopted limb-darkening profile is given in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> where the values of the ΓI coefficients are evaluated in the I band and given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The polarization profiles of these 4 events, that are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>, have a unique behavior characterized by the presence of a double peak that corresponds to the time instants at which the lens enters and exits the source star disc. The time interval between the two peaks, as calculated by eq. (17), is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, where we also give the I band magnitude I0 at the instant t0 of maximum magnification. We note that, due to the typical small values of ∆t * &lt; ∼ 1 day, the source magnitude at the instant of maximum polarization is always very close to I0. The maximum polarization value (occurring in correspondence of each peak) turns out to be ≃ 3 × 10 −2 percent, almost irrespective of the u0 and ρ * values, since the ratio ρ * /u0 &gt; 1. Indeed, the ratio ρ * /u(t) is a function of time and always exists a time value tmax at which ρ * /u(tmax) = 1.04 where, as already shown, the polarization degree gets the maximum value. In between the two peaks the polarization profile depends on the ratio ρ * /u0 (giving the extent of finite source effects) and rapidly flattens as ρ * /u0 increases.</p></div>

For simplicity we fix the parameter values β = 2 and R h = 5R * , irrespective of the source spectral type 4 . Of course, in this case the polarization degree depends on the optical depth τI that is estimated from the ˙ M value in eq. (16). It turns out that our sources are characterized by a stellar envelope with τI in the range 10 −4 − 10 −2 . The corresponding polarization curves are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. As for single-lens events with late type main sequence source stars (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>), two polarization peaks are present (occurring when the lens enters and exits the source star disc) and the duration of the signal is related to the lensing parameters by eq. (17). We note in particular that the flat polarization profile in the case of the event OGLE-2011-BLG-1101/MOA-2011-BLG-325 is due to the large value of ∆t * ≃ 5 day, which is larger of the time interval (3 days around t0) considered in the figure.

The second class of planetary perturbations occurs in highly magnified events in which the source becomes very closely aligned with the primary central caustic. These events allow to probe the region of the central caustic (associated to the primary lens), that may be perturbed even by low-mass planets lying anywhere sufficiently close to the Einstein ring.

A further Monte Carlo study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ingrosso et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">(Ingrosso et al. , 2010</ref>) has evidenced that one of the binary component may even be  an exoplanet of a few Jupiter masses. Although the analysis of  does not provide a strong evidence for finite size source effect, which is necessary to the enhancement of the polarization signal, to our purposes we consider the lensing parameter for the binary finite source (FS) solution provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> in the paper by . In particular, for the source we consider a red giant with R ≃ 85 R⊙ and T eff ≃ 3700 K. Accordingly, from eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> we estimate τ ≃ 10 −2 and using the formalism in Subsection 2.4 we compute 6 the corresponding polarization profile shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 12</ref>. Inspection of this figure shows that     <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> in .</p><p>the amplitude of the polarization degree can reach values up to 0.5 percent (when the caustic region is crossed by the source star). In the same <ref type="figure">figure,</ref> for comparison, we show the polarization curve (dotted line) expected for a point lens (PL) model with the same finite source effect. Of course, with a distance modulus to M31 larger by about 10 mag than that of Galactic bulge stars, the observability of the polarization for M31 sources remains, at the moment, highly speculative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The combined effects of large magnification and finite size source effects in some microlensing events may allow to get relatively large values of the polarization of the light from the source stars. In this paper we calculate the polarization profile as a function of the time for a selected sample of both single and exoplanetary microlensing events observed towards the Galactic bulge, by taking into account the nature of the source star: hot, late type main sequence and cool giant stars. Indeed, different polarization mechanisms take place in the stellar atmospheres, depending on the source star type: photon (Thomson) scattering on free electrons, coherent (Rayleigh) scattering off atoms and molecules, and photon scattering on dust grains, for hot, late type and cool giant stars (with extended atmospheres), respectively.</p><p>The analysis of the polarization curves for single-lens, highly magnified microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge has shown that the polarization degree of the stellar light can reach values as high as 0.04 percent at the peak in the case of late type source stars and up to a few percent in the case of cool giant source stars (red giants) with extended envelopes. For these events the primary lens crosses the source star disc (transit events) and relatively large values of P are thereby produced due to large finite source effects and the large magnification gradient throughout the source star disc. The time duration of the peak of the polarization signal may vary, from 1h to 1day, depending on the source star radius and the lens impact parameter.</p><p>Similar values of polarization may also be obtained in exoplanetary events when the source star crosses the primary or the planetary caustics. While in the former case (as for single-lens events) the peak of the polarization signal always occurs at symmetrical points with respect to the instant t0 of maximum magnification, in the latter case the polarization signal may occur at any (and generally unpredictable) time during the event.</p><p>The natural question which arises is whether such polarization signals may be detectable with the present or near future technology. Polarimeters are nowadays available on large telescopes and the best possibility for measuring polarization in the R and I bands is offered at present by the polarimeter in FORS2 on ESO's VLT telescope. With this instrument it is possible to measure the polarization for a 12 mag source star with a precision of 0.1 percent in 10 min integration time, and for a 14 mag star in a 1h. Indeed, for a few of the events considered in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 4</ref> the peak I0 magnitude is ≃ 12 with the expected maximum polarization degree lasting up to 1 day, thus suggesting that polarization measurements in highly magnified microlensing events constitute a realistic target of opportunity for currently available instruments.</p><p>It goes without saying that polarization measurements in microlensing events require an alert system able to predict in advance the instant of the occurrence of the polarization peak. A alert system is already in operation based on OGLE and MOA survey data 7 , and it is particularly efficient in the case of highly magnified events, allowing to focus observing resources to make intensive observations around the peak of the event.</p><p>We emphasize that polarization measurements in highly magnified microlensing events offer an unique opportunity to probe stellar atmospheres of Galactic bulge stars. Besides the interest related to stellar astrophysics, the analysis of the polarization profile, which reflects that of the magnification light-curve, given sufficient observational precision, may in principle provide independent constraints on the lensing parameters also for exoplanetary events.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 15 in Suzuki (2007)), mass loss rates between (10 −13 − 10 −8 ) M⊙ yr −1 are expected.
