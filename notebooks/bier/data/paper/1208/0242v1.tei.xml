				<p>Context. In the exoplanetary era, the Kepler spacecraft is causing a revolution by discovering thousands of new planet candidates. However, a follow up program is needed in order to reject false candidates and to fully characterize the bona-fide exoplanets. Aims. Our main aims are: 1./ Detect and analyze close companions inside the typical Kepler PSF to study if they are the responsible of the dim in the Kepler light curves, 2./ Study the change in the stellar and planetary parameters due to the presence of an unresolved object, 3./ Help to validate those Kepler Objects of Interest that do not present any object inside the Kepler PSF and 4./ Study the multiplicity rate in planet host candidates. Such a large sample of observed planet host candidates allows us to do statistics about the presence of close (visual or bounded) companions to the harboring star. Methods. We present here Lucky Imaging observations for a total amount of 98 Kepler Objects of Interest. This technique is based on the acquisition of thousands of very short exposure time images. Then, a selection and combination of a small amount of the best quality frames provides a high resolution image with objects having a 0.1 arcsec PSF. We applied this technique to carry out observations in the Sloan i and Sloan z filters of our Kepler candidates. Results. We find blended objects inside the Kepler PSF for a significant percentage of KOIs. On one hand, only 58.2 % of the hosts do not present any object within 6 arcsec. On the other hand, we have found 19 companions closer than 3 arcsec in 17 KOIs. According to their magnitudes and i − z color, 8 of them could be physically bounded to the host star.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is not so long when the discovery of extrasolar planets was just utopian. However, after the first discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a main sequence star <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Marcy &amp; Butler 1996)</ref>, the scientific community has discovered and confirmed hundreds of these objects around other stars. In this context, the Kepler Space Telescope has detected a new large sample of planet host candidates by continuously observing more than 150000 stars in a specific field of view (RA=19h 22m 40s DEC=+44 30' 00"). During the first five quarters of observations (i.e, ≈ 4.5 months) the Kepler Team collected on its second public release a total amount of 997 planet host star candidates (second public release, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>However, to date, less than 5% of these candidates have been confirmed. After the candidates selection, there is a mandatory step to reject false positives before attempting any high accurate (difficult and expensive) radial velocity measurements. Since the Kepler effective point-spread function is very large (6-10 arcsec, depending on the particular target) and its pixel size is about 4 arcsec, several background objects could be blended by the host candidate (called Kepler Object of Interest, hereafter KOI). Bounded or not, these objects clearly affects the star and planet parameters such as the planet-to-star radius (R p /R * ), semi-major axis (a/R * ), impact parameter (b) or even the planetary mass (M p ).</p><p>The presence of a secondary star could lead to the definite rejection of the candidate, as an example, (see O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2006</ref>) In fact, there are several configurations that can mimic an exoplanet transit around its host star. The most relevant are: A./ a small substellar object transiting the other component of the binary system (since the smallest stars and brown dwarfs have the same size as Jupiter), B./ a stellar binary blended with a background star, C./ a grazing binary, which has not been ruled out by additional photometry or spectroscopy, D./ a background eclipsing binary blended by the light of the KOI, E./ a larger planet transiting a background star blended by the main target (this actually would not strictly be a false positive since there is a planet in the system but it would be in the sense of rejecting the brightest central star as a planet host) and F./ a long-term spot. There would be a 'G-case' where the main target actually hosts a planet but with a blended background companion or a non transiting bounded companion. These configurations would lead to a change in the planet properties, as it was said before.</p><p>Some of these configurations might be ruled out by the automatic pipeline implemented by the Kepler Team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jenkins et al. 2010</ref>). While cases A and B are well rejected by this pipeline and an individual study of the light curves done by the team itself ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>), low-resolution spectroscopy clearly reject the C configuration. However, D, E and G cases are the main sources of false positives in the sample of transiting planet candidates. More specifically, case G clearly shows the need for an intense high resolution imaging follow-up program to validate the planetary nature of the transients. Due to Kepler long base-line, we expect few or no case F. Theoretical studies in regard to the false positive probability of Kepler candidates conclude that obtaining high resolution images down to 1-2 arcsec is crucial to confirm the planets and its physical properties. As an example, an earth-size planet transiting a faint star might have a false positive probability greater that 20% if it lacks high-resolution imaging, which could potentially be decreased to less than 2% with a high-resolution image <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Morton &amp; Johnson 2011)</ref>. Several authors have acquired this kind of observations for other planet host candidates finding important changes in the planet-star properties. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> found stellar companions to 3 stars harboring planets. As a consequence, the updated values of the physical parameters changed about 2% with respect to the previous ones.</p><p>However, even if the planet is confirmed, its formation and evolution scenarios (including the migration) require accurate description of the effect of bounded stellar companions. The vast majority of planets found in multiple systems are actually S-type, meaning that the planet is orbiting one of the components of the multiple system playing the secondary star the role of a gravitational perturber <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kley 2010)</ref>. The presence of these secondary objects difficult the planet formation since they interact dynamically with the elements of the system and produce an extra heating of the protoplanetary disk. All these factors may imply important changes in the planetary architecture and exoplanet properties with respect to those formed around single stars. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eggenberger et al. (2004)</ref> found a statistical segregation in the planet mass for those planets with orbital periods shorter than 40 days around single and multiple systems.</p><p>In this paper, we present the first statistical study of multiplicity on the Kepler candidates. A set of high resolution images obtained with the Lucky-Imaging technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Law et al. 2006</ref>) in the 2.2 m telescope in Calar Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) with the AstraLux instrument were acquired. This technique allows us to obtain diffraction limited observations with the best seeing conditions in the SDSSi band (see the Félix Hormuth PhD dissertation). A total amount of 98 KOIs (i.e., about a 10% of the candidates listed in the Kepler second public release of the Kepler Team) have been pointed and studied.</p><p>In section §2 we will explain the observations, image processing and data extraction from the raw images, regarding: sample selection ( §2.1), data acquisition ( §2.2), data reduction and photometric calibration ( §2.3), including the astrometric corrections, and a study of the sensitivity curves and detectability of our observations. Results based on these observations will be presented in section §3. We also perform spectral typing of the detected companions ( §4.1) and give some clues about the possible gravitational bound between some of them ( §4.2). In section §4.3 we will discuss the implications on calculated planetary parameters from the Kepler light curves regarding the presence of a blended star. Some particularly interesting cases will be studied in §4.4 and final conclusions of this work will be presented in section §5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample selection</head><p>We have observed 98 KOIs. The majority of them were selected due to the lack of any kind of follow-up observations according to the published data of the Kepler Team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>, , second public release). The selection of the rest was coordinated with the Kepler Team. In addition, we limit our targets to be brighter than 15 magnitudes in the Sloan i band in order to detect objects 5 magnitudes fainter than the KOI (see section § 2.3.6). Apart from these constrains, KOIs were randomly selected from the remaining sample so that we expect no bias in our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data acquisition</head><p>The data presented in this paper was taken in the Calar Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) within 19 nights of observations divided in three separate runs <ref type="bibr">(06-12 June 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, 01-10 July 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">and 25-26 July 2011</ref>). Although two nights were lost due to weather conditions, the remaining 17 had very good atmospheric stability with low atmospheric extinction and sporadic or absent clouds, ideal for this observing technique. The mean natural seeing was around 0.9 arcsec over the entire run.</p><p>We used the AstraLux instrument placed at the 2.2 meter telescope to perform diffraction limited imaging of our sample of KOIs with the Lucky Imaging technique. We used the entire available field of view of the camera (i.e., 24 × 24 arcsec) to cover a separation range encompassing the entire mean Kepler PSF (6-10 arcsec). In brief, we took thousands of images with short exposure times (100 − 200 milliseconds), well below the typical atmospheric turbulence changes (see Felix Hormuth PhD dissertation). We set the exposure times and number of frames according to the atmospheric conditions and target magnitude in order to reach at least 5.0 magnitudes fainter than the central KOI. Thus, our total exposure times are in the range 340-2000 seconds We note that fainter objects than this magnitude difference would not affect the planet-star properties by more than 0.5% in the case of the R p /R * rate, see equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(6)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref>. Moreover the probability that Kepler observations have detected a transit with a signal to noise ratio greater than 7.1 decreases as the star gets fainter. Thus, we design our observations to reach ∆m i ≈ 5.0 mag at 1.0-1.5 arcsec from the KOI.</p><p>Images were firstly obtained in the SDSSi filter since the PSF deformation is lower for this band than for shorter wavelengths (this result is quite similar for the SDSSz band). An on-the-fly reduction allow us to check inmediately for close sources. If any, SDSSz band images were acquired in order to characterize the secondary object by using the i − z color (see section 2.3.5).</p><p>2.3. Data reduction and photometric calibration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Basic reduction</head><p>We used the AstraLux pipeline (see AstraLux Diploma Thesis by Felix Hormuth 1 ) to perform the basic reduction and combination of our lucky imaging frames. First, this pipeline applies the bias and flat field correction correspondent to each night to the science images. We used dome flat field to avoid inhomogeneities due to the pass of some clouds during the sunset in most of the observing nights. Second, it measures the quality of each science frame to select the 1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0% and 10% frames with the highest strehl ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Strehl 1902)</ref>, calculates the shifts between those single frames, performs the stacking and divides the pixel size to half its value (i.e., the pixel scale is resampled from 0.0466"/pixel to 0.0233"/pixel). According to our observing configuration (number of frames, single exposure time and gain), we need to use the 10 % selection rate images to reduce the photometric errors (as recommended in the User's Manual). Inspection of the lower selection rate images has been done for source detection purposes but not for photometric analysis presented in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Astrometric corrections</head><p>Astrometric corrections have been applied to the position of the targets when calculating angular separations and angles between them. We made use of our observations of the M15 dense globular cluster. A total amount of 66 stars in our image were identified and matched with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yanny et al. (1994)</ref> catalog from images of the Hubble Space Telescope. We performed astrometric calibration using the ccmap package in IRAF. We compute the transformation between <ref type="bibr">[x,y]</ref> coordinates to <ref type="bibr">[ξ,η]</ref> tangent plane coordinates in a second order fitting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ξ = c 00 + c 10 x + c 01 y + c 20 x 2 + c 02 y 2 (1) η = c ′ 00 + c ′ 10 x + c ′ 01 y + c ′ 20 x 2 + c ′ 02 y 2 (2)</formula><p>where c i j are the correspondent calculated coefficients, which are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. We find residuals of 48.5 mas in the ξ direction and 34.5 mas in the η direction. Pixel scale and rotation angle are found to be 0.02359 ± 0.0005 arcsec/pixel and 1.78 ± 0.01 degrees, respectively. We will consider the rms value as our mean astrometric error in both tangential coordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Source detection and photometric extraction</head><p>The SExtractor software for source extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996</ref>) was used to extract the pseudo-instrumental photometry (explained below) of sources surrounding each KOI. We chose 60 pixels apertures (1.4 arcsec) to account for the maximum flux percentage of the objects. We set the detection threshold to 2.0-σ in a minimum area of 30 pixels. Since this software does not take into account the exposure time and electromagnetic gain of the observations we had to correct the SExtractor output to obtain the real instrumental magnitudes. The gain correction is necessary since different gains were set to different objects in order to avoid detector saturation. This was the case for standard stars for which we set the software gain in the range 230-255. For all the science images, a software gain of 255 was applied. However, this software gain is not the physical electron gain and it is not linearly correlated to it (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>.7 in the AstraLux Thesis). In a private communication, the PI of the instrument (Felix Hormuth) provided us with a calibrated function relating both parameters. Hence, calling Y to the physical electron gain, the instrumental magnitude of an object would be as follows: m inst = m S Extractor + 2.5log(Yt exp ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Atmospheric extinction and Zero Point calculation</head><p>Extinction correction and determination of the zero points were done by using the observations of SDSS standard stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Smith et al. 2002)</ref>. We observed Ross 711 and SA105-815 during the first run; Ross 711, SA105-815 and BD+25-4655 in the second run; and Ross 711, BD+25-4655 in the third run. A good sampling of the airmass for each night ensured a correct determination of the calibration parameters for the photometric nights, namely the extinction coefficient (χ) and the zero point (C). According to the Calar Alto weather monitoring webpage <ref type="bibr">2</ref> and the results of the calibration diagrams (m standard − m inst vs. Airmass) for each night, we conclude that the following nights 2 publicly available at www.caha.es/WDXI/wdxi.php were clearly photometric: July 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th and 26th. The average error in the calculated magnitudes for these nights is around 1%. Another set of nights were classified as partially photometric because of sporadic clouds along the observing time or irregular seeing conditions that lead to an inaccurate photometry, since we observed the standard stars frequently. These nights were: June 11th and 12th, and July 1st, 3rd and 9th. Consequently, errors in these partially photometric nights are greater (1-3%) but still acceptable for our purposes. The column #5 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> provide information about the stability of the atmosphere for the observations of each object (according to the acquisition date). From our photometric results we can conclude that magnitudes brighter i = 21−22 have assumable errors while fainter objects are too noisy to accurately determine their magnitudes with errors below 1.5% and are then not taken into account for this study.</p><p>Hence, the calibrated magnitude for these objects has been calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m cal = m inst + 2.5log(A p Y) + Z p + Cχ (3)</formula><p>where A p is the aperture correction, Y the electron gain, C the extinction coefficient, Z p the zero point and χ is the correspondent airmass. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Detection and Calibration of very close objects</head><p>By looking into the reduced images, we selected the sub-sample of our KOIs that had close companions within 3 arcsec (17 KOIs) to perform an individual extraction of the photometry. Due to its proximity to the main target, we would need smaller apertures in order to not being contaminated from the PSF wings of the KOI. Hence, aperture correction was applied. Contamination coming from the KOI's PSF wing has been estimated by measuring the amount of flux from the KOI inside the companion's aperture. This extra flux would influence the magnitude of the companion in less than 0.03 magnitudes which is well below the photometric errors of these sources. Hence, no corrections of this nature have been performed in this work. Photometric extraction of the standard stars was also done with the IRAF package and calibration parameters were re-derived and applied to the science photometry. We determined the aperture correction by using the standard stars. As the phot task of the IRAF package already takes into account the exposure time of the image, here we just have to correct for: aperture correction, electron gain and atmospheric extinction. Hence, the final expression to derive the calibrated magnitudes is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m cal = m IRAF + 2.5log(A p Y) + Z p + Cχ (4)</formula><p>where χ is the correspondent airmass. We also tested a PSF approach rather that aperture photometry. The main problem of this technique with Lucky-Imaging observations is to find a standard PSF for the whole night. Due to the acquisition technique, each particular image/star would have a characteristic PSF that cannot not be modeled by a general one. However, aperture photometry for very close (&lt;1.5 arcsec) and faint companions can involve larger errors even using small apertures. Hence, we decided to use PSF photometry for the 2 KOIs with faint companions at very small angular separations (KOI-1375 and KOI-0387). The PSF was obtained from different available standard stars during the whole night. We calculated the stellar fluxes for each PSF and estimate the relative magnitudes between the KOI and the companion (∆i and ∆z) as a weighted average of all values. Since aperture and PSF photometry must coincide for the bright KOI, we used the calibrated photometry for the KOI obtained by aperture photometry (m P ) to obtain the companions' magnitudes as m /C = m P + ∆m for each filter in these two cases. For the remaining objects, we used aperture photometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Sensitivity, detectability and limiting magnitudes</head><p>We have estimated the mean completeness and limiting magnitudes of our images by using the observations of the globular cluster M15 in order to have a large sample of stars with a wide range of magnitudes. We measured the number of objects per magnitude bin of 0.5 mag on every photometric night for which images of M15 were taken. Computing the mean values of these bins we can construct the histogram shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. We have scaled this histogram to a 200 seconds exposure time image to account for the mean exposure time of our science images. We obtain a mean completeness value of i complete = 18.4 ± 0.3 mag and reach detectability down to approximately i = 22.5 mag. In the case of the SDSSz observations we adapted the exposure time to detect the companion seen on the SDSSi image. It is important to remember that these values have been calculated for a particular exposure time. Since we set different exposure times for each target in order to achieve ∆m i ≈ 5.0 (see lower panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>), completeness and detectability limits should change for each image. The scaled values of i complete for each particular science image attending to its real exposure time are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Note that we only show here the observations for the non-isolated KOIs (Kepler host candidates without any objects closer than 6 arcsec).</p><p>Sensitivity functions were compiled for each image to determine the depth in angular separation and magnitude (actually, ∆m) to which we are complete for 3 − σ detection threshold.</p><p>By measuring the observed radial profile averaged over a large number of directions (avoiding those angles in the way to the close companions) we can infer the dependence of the primary star brightness along the angular separation. Then, we reiteratively add the same profile but located at different angular separations between 0.2-3.0 arcsec and scale it to be ∆m magnitudes fainter according to the expression: F /C = F P 10 −0.4∆m , being F /C the encircled flux of the companion and F P the flux of the primary. We then measure the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of the added profile. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of these calculations where the artificial companion to the observed KOI profile range differential magnitudes of ∆m = <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">7]</ref> and angular separations between 0.2-3 arcsec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We have found 111 companion sources at angular separations between 0.3-10 arcsec from the 98 targeted KOIs. Since the Kepler point spread function varies from 6 to 10 arcseconds, we consider a KOI to be isolated if no objects below 6 arcseconds are found in our Lucky Imaging observations. Objects with  According to this definition, we have detected 57 isolated KOIs. This means a 58.2% rate of isolated objects for planet host candidates in the Kepler Objects of Interest catalog. It is important to remark that this isolation rate would decrease down to the 33.7% if we consider a 10 arcsec PSF for Kepler observations. However, the best PSF assumption of 6 arcsec will be considered in this paper.</p><p>Regarding KOIs with visible companions inside 6 arcsec, 41 planet host candidates have, at least, one object within this projected separation (i.e., 41.8 %). Among them, 17 KOIs present a total amount of 19 companions at less than 3 arcsec (17.3% of all KOIs considered). We will refer to this group along this paper as the close companions' group. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5</ref> we show the 17 KOIs with close companions and the Kepler optimal (public) apertures of the different Quarters in which the Kepler Mission is divided. All 19 companions lie inside these apertures contaminating the light curve fluxes with its relevant impact in the planet-star properties and planet validation. Moreover, 27 KOIs do present 30 companions within the range 3-6 arcsec (27.6% of all KOIs considered), medium distance group. This means that 3 of the main targets from the close companion group ( KOI-0433, KOI-0641 and KOI-0841, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 4)</ref> present either close (&lt; 3 arcsec) and medium-separation (3-6 arcsec) sources. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> summarize these results.</p><p>According to all these numbers, we have defined the observed companion fraction as oc f = n s+n , where n is the number of objects within a certain angular separation to the KOI for each particular type of system (either double, triple or quadruple) and s is the number of isolated KOIs found in our sample (i.e., s = 57). The cumulative oc f is plotted in the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>. We show there that given a KOI, the probability of having a double (visual) system within 3 arcsecs is 21% while if we go further away until 6 arcsecs, this probability increases to 37%. The same was done for triple systems (purple in upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) and we found that only the 3% of the KOIs do present more than 1 visual companion within 3 arcsec. No quadruple systems were detected in our sample within 6 arcsecs (orange line in the mentioned <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. We have also plotted a total observed companion fraction (black line) taking into account contributions from all type of systems. It is defined as oc f (T otal) = d+t+q s+d+t+q where d, t and q are the double, triple and quadruple systems found within a certain angular separation (similar definition as the one presented by Duchêne 1999). Note that in the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> only the oc f T otal is monotonically increasing as we move away from the primary. The decreasing cumulative oc f at 7-8 arcsec for the Double systems is due to the fact that when we reach the position of the third component of a triple system, this is automatically accounted in the Triple sample and removed from the Double sample. The same reason explains the decreasing cumulative oc f in the Triples system.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, we present our photometric measurements in the SDSSi and SDSSz bands for the KOIs with detected close (&lt; 3 arcsec) companions. In this table we also provide the angular separations between the stellar companions and the assumed KOI as well as the angular position from North towards East. It is important to notice that in cases where both objects have similar magnitudes it is not possible with our observations to infer which of the two is actually the one that harbors the transit (high resolution imaging in-and out-of-transit will be performed to that end). In order to avoid errors coming from the calibration process, we have measured the differential magnitudes ∆i and ∆z directly from the instrumental magnitudes. The i − z color has been derived directly from the calibrated magnitudes for the primary (brighter) star. Instead, in order to minimize the large errors due to the faintness of the majority of the close companions, we obtained the (i − z) /C color of the companion by using the expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(i − z) /C = ∆i − ∆z + (i − z) P<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where (i − z) P represents the color of the primary star. Due to effectivity reasons in our limited observing time, we have only obtained SDSSz images for those KOIs showing very close companions (&lt; 3 arcsec) in an on-the-fly reduction. Hence we lack i − z colors for companions at 3-6 arcsec. Photometric and astrometric information available from our observations for these medium-separation sources is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. Note that KOIs with companions at 3-6 arcsec that also have at least one object in the 0.3-3 arcsec, do have SDSSz photometry.</p><p>Reconnaissance spectra has been taken for 25 KOIs in order to more accurately derive their spectral types and physical parameters as temperature and surface gravity. Moreover, as said in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> this kind of observations are able to reject the possibility of a very close (&lt; 0.2 arcsec) binary that would produce a grazing eclipse, since radial velocities of tens of km/s would be present on it. The data is now being analyzed and will be published in a future paper ( <ref type="bibr">Lillo-Box et al., 2012b</ref>, in prep.).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Spectral types of the stellar components</head><p>We have applied two different methods to determine the spectral type (effective temperature) of the stellar companions according to their angular separation.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. North is up and East is left. Here we have assumed solar metallicity and two surface gravities to account for two possible evolutionary stages of the companion: Main Sequence foreground or bounded stars (log(g) = 4.5) or background giant star (log(g) = 3.5). Assuming a Main Sequence nature for the secondary, we can estimate their spectral types by using the i−z color. Synthetic spectra from Pickles (1998) for main sequence stars were convolved with the SDSSi and SDSSz transmission curves 4 following the same scheme as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> to derive a relation between the spectral type and the mentioned color. We can over plot our i − z colors in this diagram to estimate the companion spectral types. Typical errors depend on the spectral type since they are determined according to the photometric error in the calculus of the i − z values. In particular, it is important to notice that, since the dependence of the spectral type with the mentioned color is more steeped for types later than K5-K6, errors will be much smaller than for earlier types where the dependence starts to flatten. Thus, only stellar companions with i − z &gt; 0.21 (correspondent to a K5-K6 main sequence star) are considered in this analysis. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref> we show the results for the 9 companions and 2 primaries with estimated spectral types later than K5 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). As expected, these objects are cool, low-mass stars (late K or early M). Their physical association will be discussed in the following section. </p></div>

Recently, several multiple-star systems have been discovered, both circumbinary planets as, for instance, Kepler-16b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al. 2011</ref>) and binary systems with the planet orbiting one of the components of the couple as HD196885Ab (see Thebault 2011). These objects represent a challenge for theoretical models of planet formation, for instance, in terms of orbital stability <ref type="bibr">(Holman &amp; Wiegert 1999, see)</ref>. Moreover, it has been discovered that around one fifth of the known exoplanets inhabit double or multiple stellar systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Desidera &amp; Barbieri 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mugrauer &amp; Neuhäuser 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Thebault 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Medium-distance companions</head><p>We can infer rough distances to the KOIs and companions analyzed in previous section by a SED fitting by using the total flux emitted by the star (F tot ) according to the effective temperature estimated by VOSA. From this temperature and assuming a luminosity class we can estimate the bolometric magnitude of the star by using the relations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schmidt-Kaler (1982)</ref>. Hence, a luminosity L * can be derived so that we can evaluate the distance since L * = 4πd 2 F tot . For the KOIs we have assumed a main sequence stage but two distances have been calculated for the stellar companions assuming main sequence and giant stages. The errors have been calculated by taking into account the uncertainties in F tot and assuming 125 K of error in the temperature calculation for the L * derivation. The former uncertainty also includes the errors in the effective temperature and metallicity fitted by VOSA. The results are shown in the last column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 7</ref>.</p><p>The giant scenario for the companion does not seem to work with most companions since very large distances are found (d &gt; 21K pc, the Galaxy limit in the Kepler line of sight). Thus, the main sequence scenario is the only possibility for them. According to it, one (KOI-0623C) out of the 10 companions that could be fitted by VOSA has a distance in good agreement with its correspondent KOI. Among the remaining 8 possible companions, 7 are found to be background main sequence stars and one (KOI-212C) is a probable foreground M-dwarf with spectral type M4V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Close companions</head><p>Morton &amp; Johnson (2011) estimated that the probability for a given target in the Kepler field to have a background source brighter than m k = 24.0 within 2 arcseconds. This value strongly depends on the kepler magnitude (m k ) and galactic latitude (b) of the target. Since the 90% of our primary targets have kepler magnitudes in the range 13.0 − 15.5 and taking into account equation <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> in the mentioned paper, we can derive a background source probability range of 4-40% depending on the particular values of b and m k for each target. However, as it was previously said, we reach completeness for i = 18.5 (which translates to m k = 18.8 according to a simple transformation with r 2 = 0.97 using both KIC magnitudes) so that we would underestimate the chancealigned probability with respect to the one in the mentioned paper above. We have found 11 blended sources at less than 2 arcsec in 10 parent stars. That means a 10.2% of our sample which, even being a lower limit, clearly agrees with the mentioned values estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Morton &amp; Johnson (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Even though our photometric measurements do not provide enough information to clearly determine the gravitational bound (if any) of the system, we can infer some hints of this fact by analyzing several aspects of the available magnitudes of the A and B/C components. We have constructed an empirical Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) based on the synthetic griz photometry derived by Ofek (2008) for Tycho-2 stars with Hipparcos B T and V T bands as well as 2MASS JHK magnitudes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>). In order to reach the substellar domain, we also add the <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moraux et al. (2003)</ref> iz photometry for 109 brown dwarfs in the Pleiades region assuming a distance to the cluster of 130 pc <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Stello &amp; Nissen 2001</ref>). As we are interested in possible binary stars, we have computed the lower-envelope of the ZAMS for both catalogs together in an i vs. i − z color-magnitude diagram. Primary objects were located in that empirical ZAMS according to their i − z color, calculated from our own photometry. Hence, a distance modulus can be calculated for the primary star and applied to the secondary star assuming a joint formation for the system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> shows the results for all of our 17 KOIs with their 19 close stellar companions. At least 6 companions agree with a simultaneous formation in a double system (KOIs 0379B, 0645B, 0298B, 0641B, 0658B and 0401B), together with the KOI star. Other 3 close objects could also lie inside the ZAMS boundaries if we take into account the errors in the determination of this isochrone (KOIs 0592B, 0433B and 0703B). It is also important to note that some of them lie in the low-mass domain of the diagram. According to it, KOI-0641B, KOI-0658B, KOI-0433B and KOI-0703B could be low-mass stars or even brown dwarf companions to the host stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandner et al. (2000)</ref> provided with a simple formula to estimate the probability for a given source at a certain angular separation to be a background object. If we assume the limiting magnitude of the USNO-B1.0 catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Monet et al. 2003</ref>) in the Kepler field to be I = 17.5 magnitudes , we find an overall probability of 3.9% for a source separated 3 arcsec from our target to be a background object. This shows, although as a first approximation, the low probability for our close companions to be background sources rather than bounded binaries.</p><p>Our analysis implies that 6-9 found companions out of the 98 KOIs observed could be physically bounded. This means an observational lower limit of 6.2%-9.2% for the binarity rate among the Kepler targets (binaries with projected separations and/or magnitudes below our detection limits may increase these values). However, we warn this result regarding the lack of confirmation of their physical bound. Instead, we have shown several hints that point to this scenario. As it was said before, it has been estimated that 20% of the planets inhabit binary systems, most of them being wide binaries with separations greater than 1000 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Thebault 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Desidera &amp; Barbieri 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mugrauer &amp; Neuhäuser 2009)</ref>. This could be in good agreement with our results if the physical bound is confirmed for the 6-9 KOIs mentioned above. The presence of such widely separated companions would had weakly affected the planet formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Desidera &amp; Barbieri (2007)</ref> concluded that companions at more than 100-300 AU would not significantly influence the formation and migration of planets and thus, planet parameters may not have relevant differences with respect to those inhabiting single stars except for an over-abundance of high-eccentricity orbits in the wide binary planets. We do not detect any differences when comparing the KIC derived physical and orbital parameters of the 6-9 KOIs to the rest of the observed sample, confirming the results previously mentioned.</p><p>We note that our estimated binary fraction represents a lower limit due to our observational restrictions. Close and/or faint (low-mass) companions beyond our detectable limits (described in section §2.3.6) might increase this multiplicity fraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref> obtained a binary frequency of 34% for companions around close (&lt; 35pc) solar-like stars in the magnitude range V = 4 − 12. Although our present survey encompasses a different range of stellar masses, their result suggests that our study might indeed be missing a number of close and faint companions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Need for update of planet-star parameters</head><p>The incidence in the planet and host star parameters due to the presence of a bounded or visual companion to the host star can be measured by isolating the contribution of the host star from the blended companion. Although the transit depth defined as F notransit − F transit do not depends on the presence of blended objects in the PSF, physical properties of the planet-star system actually depend on the quotient ∆F = (F notransit − F transit )/F notransit as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref>. This quantity is clearly decreased with the closeness of a blended object since it would contribute with an additional flat flux (an intrinsic variability of the blended star would be visible in the light curve). Hence, a change of (F notransit − F blend )/F notransit will imply consequent changes in the planet-star parameters. Assuming that the planet is actually transiting the brighter star, the new depth will be given by (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Daemgen et al. 2009</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆F new = 1 + 10 − ∆z 2.5 ∆F old<label>(6)</label></formula><p>It must be noticed that for the two systems where more than one blended object is found, the ∆z should be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">z ′ /C = −2.5log         j 10 −0.4z j        <label>(7)</label></formula><p>Additional photometric studies like on-transit and out-oftransit high resolution images of the fainter star as well as observations of the transit depth at longer wavelengths such as with the IRAC bands of the Spitzer Space Telescope (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Desert et al. 2011</ref>) would be needed to rule out the possibility of the planet transiting the fainter star.</p><p>The impact on the physical parameters due to the presence of a blended companion could be quite significant. The largest change in the transit depth values according to Eq. 6 is ∆F new ≤ √ 2∆F old , assuming an equal-magnitude blended star. According to equation (6) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref>, this would increase the planet to star radius ratio in a 41%. The same calculation can be done for other parameters like: total on-transit duration (t T ), total on-transit flat duration (t F ) or period (P). We have performed this exercise for our observations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref> shows the re-calculated values of the transit depth, planet-to-star radius ratio and planet radius for the 24 planets orbiting the 17 stars with close companions. The last two parameters have been calculated by assuming no-limb darkening, using the mentioned formula in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref> which reads: R p /R * = √ ∆F. Our results show relative differences in the transit depths, calculated as (δ new − δ cat )/δ cat , in the range 1%-120% with respect to the values published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref>. According to the expression explained above, the 74% of the planets with detected companions at less than 3 arcsec would have changes in their R p /R s parameter below 10%, and the 91% of the them below 30%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1.">KOI-0641</head><p>This system is of particular interests. It is a triple visual system within 3.7 arcsec. The i − z color study reveals spectral types of K5-K9, M1-M3 and M3-M5 for the A, B and C components respectively. Regarding the SED fitting, we obtain spectral types M2 and M3-M4 for the A and C components respectively. Distances to the primary target agree in both approaches:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d = 125±22pc and d = 117 +6</formula><p>−5 pc. The KOI-0641B perfectly suits the bounded scenario according to its position in the ZAMS. If the case, it would have a projected distance of 275 ± 49 AU to the A component. The third object is located well above the empirical ZAMS (∼ 3 mag. brighter), indicating that it probably is a foreground M-dwarf. This hypothesis is in agreement with the distance calculated by the SED fitting approach, d = 76 +15 −10 , significantly closer than the A component.</p></div>

Our analysis suggests that it is a M5 +1 −2 star probably bounded to the main KOI. However, the primary target is also too faint (m i &gt; 14.5) and large errors in the determination of the distance do not allow us to set constraints in the projected separation of the system. Even that, due to the position of the secondary object in the HR diagram of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>, as in KOI-0641C, there exists the possibility of having a third component very close to KOI-0433B not resolved in our images.

Thus, a relative separation of 231 ± 35 AU is derived for the possible binary system. Moreover, since both objects have very similar magnitudes, it is not clear which star is actually hosting the transient object. Note also the presence of a third very faint object in the SDSSi image. This object is not detected in the SDSSz image acquired few hours later in the same night. The most probable reason is a background blue object.</p></div>

Hence, an assumption of the same age would lead to a similar spectral type. However, the KOI is several magnitudes brighter and redder than the companion, favoring the background nature for this close companion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have started a high resolution imaging follow-up for the Kepler sample of planet host candidates. The main goal of this survey is to provide additional constrains for the confirmation of the planetary nature of these candidates and identify those that are possible false positives. A total amount of 98 KOIs (out of the 997) from the second release of the Kepler Team have been properly observed by using the Lucky Imaging technique with the AstraLux instrument at the 2.2m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory.</p><p>Our main results show that the 58.2% of the KOIs are actually isolated in terms of not having any visual or bounded companion at less than 6 arcsec. In other words, the 41.9% of the candidates present close objects. This is an important result in terms of: (a) False positive rate determination, since it points directly which objects have stellar companions that can be mimicking a planet transit detected by Kepler, being then the highest priority for a deeper follow-up with ground-based telescopes to determine the nature of this transit; (b) Updating the planet properties, since as we have shown in the Discussion section, they depend on the brightness of the host star. We warn that orbital and physical parameters of the 23 planets orbiting the 17 KOIs with close stellar companions should be revised. (c) Estimating the binary rate in planet host stars. According to their position on a M i vs.</p><p>i − z color-magnitude diagram, we have shown that between 6 and 9 of the close companions could be actually bounded to the host star due to their position over our empirical ZAMS. Their distances agree with an S-type binary although still more observations are necessary to confirm both the planet and the binary in all cases. KOIs 0379B, 0658B, 0641B, 0645B and 0298B clearly lie over the ZAMS which suggests a simultaneous formation together with the primary star. Moreover, KOIs 0433B, 0401B, 0592B and 0703B could also lie inside the error bars of the ZAMS but more work should be done to confirm this result. If confirmed, it would imply a lower limit on the observed binary frequency of 6.2-9.2% Regarding the medium-distance companions (3-6 arcsec), we concluded that only one of them (KOI-0623B) is possibly bounded although we should flag this result due to the large errors in the distance estimates.</p><p>Finally, we have provided accurate astrometric positions and i magnitudes for the close and medium distance companions which could be used to re-compute planet-star parameters in those KOIs affected by the light of the companion. These results add more constrains for theoretical works regarding false positive probabilities for the particular objects studied in this paper.    </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Object Lower Limit SpT SpT Upper Limit SpT KOI-0641A K5 K7 K9 KOI-0641B M1 M3 M3 KOI-0641C M3 M5 M5 KOI-0703B K9 M1 M3 KOI-0298A K5 K7 K9 KOI-0298B K9 M0 M2 KOI-0658B M3 M3 M3 KOI-0401B K9 K9 M1 KOI-0422B M5 M5 M6 KOI-0645B K9 K9 M1 KOI-0433B M3 M5 M6</formula><p>Notes.

Notes. Objects marked with an asterisk (*) in the Companion column are assumed to be the Kepler Object of Interest. Close companions with similar magnitudes are found in these cases being 
difficult to distinguish which of them is the actual host. The assumed KOI is the brightest object in the system. Companions marked with a '+' symbol indicate those probably bounded according to 
section 4.2.2. The last column shows the photometric error if we take into account the empirical errors of the software gain of the intrument. </table></figure>
