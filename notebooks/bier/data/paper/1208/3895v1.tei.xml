			<abstract>
				<p>Context. Since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995 around a solar-type star, the interest in exoplanetary systems has kept increasing. Studying exoplanet host stars is of the utmost importance to establish the link between the presence of exoplanets around various types of stars and to understand the respective evolution of stars and exoplanets. Aims. Using the limb-darkened diameter (LDD) obtained from interferometric data, we determine the fundamental parameters of four exoplanet host stars. We are particularly interested in the F4 main-sequence star, θ Cyg, for which Kepler has recently revealed solar-like oscillations that are unexpected for this type of star. Furthermore, recent photometric and spectroscopic measurements with SOPHIE and ELODIE (OHP) show evidence of a quasi-periodic radial velocity of ∼ 150 days. Models of this periodic change in radial velocity predict either a complex planetary system orbiting the star, or a new and unidentified stellar pulsation mode. Methods. We performed interferometric observations of θ Cyg, 14 Andromedae, υ Andromedae and 42 Draconis for two years with VEGA/CHARA (Mount Wilson, California) in several three-telescope configurations. We measured accurate limb darkened diameters and derived their radius, mass and temperature using empirical laws. Results. We obtain new accurate fundamental parameters for stars 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra. We also obtained limb darkened diameters with a minimum precision of ∼ 1, 3%, leading to minimum planet masses of M sin i = 5.33 ± 0.57, 0.62 ± 0.09 and 3.79 ± 0.29 M Jup for 14 And b, υ And b and 42 Dra b, respectively. The interferometric measurements of θ Cyg show a significant diameter variability that remains unexplained up to now. We propose that the presence of these discrepancies in the interferometric data is caused by either an intrinsic variation of the star or an unknown close companion orbiting around it. Conclusions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many techniques have been developed during the past decade to enable the discovery of exoplanets. The radial velocity method, based on the reflex motion of the host star, is one of the most successful of these and has to date enabled the discovery of 535 planetary systems <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Most of these planets were found orbiting slowly rotating stars, late-type stars, or A giants. While A and F main sequence stars were usually avoided because of their high v sin i, a survey of A and F main sequence stars was nonetheless recently undertaken using a specialized analysis method to look for planets around these stars, and planets were indeed found around a few F stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref>). Unfortunately, the possible planet configurations fitting the radial velocity (RV) data were found to be dynamically unstable. To resolve this ⋆ Based on interferometric observations with the VEGA/CHARA instrument. ⋆⋆ Hubble Fellow <ref type="bibr">1</ref> As of <ref type="bibr">December 23, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schneider et al. 2011</ref> problem it is important to better understand the link between the presence and mass of exoplanets, the host star parameters, and the separation of the planet and host star.</p><p>Interferometric data are now able to bring additional information to bear on stellar variability and its contribution to noise in the radial velocity measurements, and can help to directly determine many of the fundamental parameters of the host stars with an accuracy of about 5% see for example (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baines et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">von Braun et al. 2011</ref>). This is not only very important for deriving accurate radii for transiting planets, but also for RV planets. Understanding the link between the presence and nature of exoplanets and the fundamental parameters of the star requires sampling a large number of targets. We have started a survey with VEGA (Visible spEctroGraph and polArimeter) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mourard et al. 2009</ref>), a visible spectro-interferometer located on the CHARA (Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy) array at Mount Wilson, California (ten ), to measure all currently accessible exoplanets stars, i.e. almost 40 targets. To build this sample, we first selected the exoplanet host stars listed in Schneider's catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>). Those stars have to be observable by VEGA, therefore we sorted out those that had a magnitude smaller than 6.5 in the V-and in the K band, and a declination higher than −30 • . Knowing the error on the squared visibility allowed by VEGA at medium resolution (≃ 2%), we can estimate the maximum and the minimum diameters for which we can obtain an accuracy of ≃ 2% taking into account the maximum and minimum baselines. We consider this accuracy as the minimum allowed to obtain sufficiently good informations on fundamental parameters of the stars and planets. Diameters included between 0.3 and 3 milliseconds of arc (mas) are sufficiently resolved to achieve this accuracy. We finally found 40 stars whose planets were discovered with the transit or RV techniques.</p><p>Interferometry is complementary to the transit method or RV measurements in determining exoplanet parameters. For instance, the transit method allows determining the exoplanet radius, while the RV method is used to detect the minimum mass. The main goal of these observations is to directly constrain these parameters, and to study the impact of stellar noise sources (e.g., spots, limb darkening) applied to these observing methods. In the long term, the results will be compared to a catalog of limb darkening laws from 3D hydro-dynamical modeling and radiative transfer. Thus, we will be able to create a catalog of measured angular diameters, and derive revised surface brightness relationships.</p><p>From October to December 2011, we obtained data on three stars of our sample : 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra, while a fourth star θ Cyg was observed over a longer period, from June 2010 to November 2011. We found that while the first three stars yield stable and repeatable results, there are discrepancies in the results of θ Cyg, forcing us to study this system more carefully. New and unexplained RV variations recorded with SOPHIE and ELODIE at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desort et al. 2009</ref>) provided a first clue that this star hosts either a complex planetary system, undergoes hitherto unknown variations, or has a hidden companion.</p><p>After a short introduction to the basics of interferometry, we describe in Section 3 the observations made of 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra during the year 2011 and derive the star and planet fundamental parameters. We then compare these values to those found in the literature. In Section 4, we present the observations of θ Cyg made during the last two years. We discuss the fundamental parameters we derived for this target in Section 5, and compare them with the previously known parameters for this star (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>). We then discuss the variation of the angular diameter of θ Cyg in Section 6 and some possible explanations of this variability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">VEGA/CHARA and visibility determination</head><p>The CHARA array hosts six one-meter telescopes arranged in a Y shape that are oriented to the east (E1 and E2), south (S1 and S2) and west (W1 and W2). The baselines range between 34 and 331 m and permit a wide range of orientations. VEGA is a spectro-interferometer working in the visible wavelengths at different spectral resolutions : 6000 and 30000. Thus, it permits the recombination of two, three or four telescopes, and a maximum angular resolution of ≃ 0.3 mas. Interferometry is a high angular resolution technique allowing one to study the spatial brightness distribution of celestial objects through measuring their spatial <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Squared visibility of a uniform disk (solid line) and of a limb-darkened disk (dashed line) for a star of 1.17 mas of diameter, a wavelength of 720 nm and a baseline ranging from 0 to 330 m. The LDD is sensitive close to the zero and in the second lobe of visibility, where it is higher than for a UD.</p><p>frequencies. By measuring the fringe contrast, also called visibility, one is able to determine the size of stars, thanks to the van Cittert-Zernike theorem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Born et al. 1980</ref>). The simplest representation of a star is a uniform disk (UD) of angular diameter θ UD . The corresponding visibility function is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V 2 = 2J 1 (x) x 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where J 1 (x) is the first-order Bessel function and x = πBθ UD λ −1 . B represents the length of the projected baseline, λ the wavelength of the observation. However, stars are not uniformly bright : a better representation of the surface brightness is the limb-darkened disk (LDD). The main differences between the two profiles arise close to the zero of visibility and in the second lobe, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The LDD is conventionally described by the function I λ [µ], where µ is the cosine between the normal to the surface at that point and the line of sight from the star to the observer and u λ the limb darkening coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hanbury Brown et al. 1974)</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I λ [µ] = I λ [1][1 − u λ (1 − µ)].<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A good approximation of θ LD is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ LD [λ] = θ UD [λ] × 1 − u λ /3 1 − 7u λ /15 1/2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>(Hanbury <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brown et al. 1974</ref>). The Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011) coefficients are listed in tables and depend on the effective temperature and the log(g). We calculated that in our observing conditions, a difference of 10% on the coefficients leads to a difference of 0.65% on the LDD and of 0.33% on the T eff . Using approximated coefficients is then of negligible consequence on the final parameters' values.</p><p>Because we performed 3T observations, we obtained three calibrated squared visibility points for each observation in the observed spectral band. The systematic and statistical errors were calculated for each data point. The systematic error accounts for the influence of the estimated error on the angular diameter of the calibrators. In almost all cases, the systematic error is negligible compared to the statistical one by a factor 10, because our diameters are small ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mourard et al. 2009</ref>). The statistical error takes into account the instrumental variations, the variations of atmospheric conditions (seeing), and vibrations of the telescopes or the delay lines. It is measured when we estimate the noise and the error on the noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Determination of the fundamental parameters</head><p>We used empirical relations to derive the fundamental parameters of the stellar and planet components. From the LDD (θ LD ) expressed in mas and the parallax (π) given in second of arc, we calculated the star's linear radius (R) and mass in the following manner. Using a simple Monte Carlo simulation, we obtain a correct estimate of the radius and its error :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R ± δR(R ⊙ ) = θ LD ± δθ LD 9.305 × (π ± δπ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We then use the gravitational acceleration relation to estimate the mass :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">− → g = GM/R 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where G is the gravitational constant. The modulus of g is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The error of the mass estimate is dominated by the uncertainty in parallax.

Observations of these three exoplanet host stars were made in October and November 2011 with the E1E2W2 triplet. The data processing and the results analysis were presented in Subsection 2.1. We used the calibrators HD211211 (cal1) and HD1439 (cal2) for 14 And, HD14212 (cal3) for υ And and HD187340 (cal4) for 42 Dra <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>). They were found using the SearchCal utility 2 developed by the JMMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bonneau et al. 2006</ref>). It gives, among other parameters, the stellar magnitude in the V and K bands, the spectral type, and also an estimate of the angular diameter along with the corresponding error. Angular diameters are determined by surface-brightness versus color-index relationships. We used the V/(V − K) polynomial relation given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bonneau et al. (2006)</ref>. Its accuracy of 7% is the highest concerning the color-index polynomial fits. We mainly observed with the three telescope (3T) configuration, but sometimes the conditions only allowed for 2T measurements <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. VEGA data are recorded as blocks of 1000 frames each of 15 milliseconds of exposure time.

The data were recorded at <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Journal of the observations of 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra. RJD is the reduced Julian day.

In most cases ( * ), CLIMB data in K band are also available. medium spectral resolution (R = 6000) and the data processing used 15 nm wide channels in the continuum of the red spectrum. We alternated the calibrators and target using the standard sequence Cal-Target-Cal, which provides a better estimate of the transfer function during the observations of the target. We know ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mourard et al. 2009</ref>) that, under correct seeing conditions, the transfer function of VEGA/CHARA is stable at the level of 2% for more than one hour. This has been checked in all our data set, and bad sequences were removed. We used the CLIMB beam combiner operating in the near-infrared as a 3T fringe tracker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sturmann et al. 2010</ref>) to stabilize the optical path differences during the long integrations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-14 And</head><p>This star is well-fitted by a limb-darkened diameter model that provides a χ 2 reduced of 2.8 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). It is obtained with the Claret coefficient u λ = 0.700, defined by the effective temperature and the log(g) given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. It follows a LDD of 1.51 ± 0.02 mas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baines et al. (2009)</ref> found an LDD of 1.34 ± 0.01 mas for 14 And, which is smaller by ∼ 10% than the one we found with VEGA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-υ And</head><p>The data points obtained at low spatial frequency are slightly lower than the LDD model. This explains the higher χ 2 reduced than for the other stars, which equals 6.9 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). Then, we obtained θ LD = 1.18 ± 0.01 mas using u λ = 0.534. υ And was observed by van <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Belle &amp; von Braun (2009)</ref> with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI), who estimated its LDD to be 1.02 ± 0.06 mas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baines et al. (2008)</ref> found a higher diameter with CHARA/CLASSIC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAlister et al. 2005</ref>) : 1.11 ± 0.01 mas. However, it appears that, due to the dispersion in their measurements, the value of their error bars could be underestimated. In our case, the formal uncertainty is also very small but the high value of the χ 2 reduced indicates a poor adjustment by this simple model. No value is consistent with the respective other, ours being separated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baines et al. (2008)</ref>'s by more than 5σ. More observations are definitively necessary to improve the accuracy and reliability of these measurements. However, the minimum masses of υ And's exoplanets are consistent with those calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Curiel et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wright et al.

Given the few studies of this stars, this additional measurement brings a new accurate confirmation of the diameter. Concerning the planet's fundamental parameter, we found a similar M pl sin(i) to that calculated by <ref type="bibr">Döllinger et al. (2009)</ref> (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 6</ref>).</p><p>Because CLIMB works in the K band, we used the corresponding Claret coefficients to estimate the LDD in this spectral band, resulting in u λ = 0.321, u λ = 0.247 and u λ = 0.353 for 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra, respectively. In each case we used the effective temperature and the log(g) given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Because CLIMB data are not very sensitive to limb darkening, because of the relatively low spatial frequencies and the fact that there is less limb darkening in K band, we used the visible coefficient for the global (VEGA+CLIMB) analysis. Although the χ 2 reduced becomes slightly lower when including CLIMB data <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 4)</ref>, the final results for the LDD are not changed, as expected because of the lower precision of the CLIMB visibilities and the lower influence on the diameter of the low spatial frequencies. The global results (VEGA+CLIMB) are thus the same as those obtained with VEGA only. The CLIMB data did not bring any improvements for this study.</p></div>

Using the data provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delfosse et al. (2000)</ref>, this dM translates into 7.9 mag    in the V band ). More recently, Roberts (2011) published adaptative optics (AO) data obtained with the AEOS telescopes in 2002, and reported a differential magnitude in the Bessel I-band of 5.89 ± 0.089 and a separation of 2.54 ′′ . This is compatible with a contrast of ≃ 7 at the V band. Spectroscopic data of θ Cyg collected with ELODIE and SOPHIE at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) revealed quasi-periodical radial velocity variations with a period of approximately 150 days. No known stellar variation modes can explain such long-term, high-amplitude RV variations. They were tentatively attributed to the presence of more than two exoplanets, possibly interacting with each other. However, this explanation was not only unsatisfactory because it is dynamically unstable, but also because it did not straightforwardly explain a peak observed in the periodogram of the bisector velocity span at ≃ 150 days. Clearly, the data at hand were not sufficient to fully understand this complex system. Our interferometric observations in the visible wavelengths have both high spatial and spectral resolution and help us probe the same domain as these spectroscopic results. Furthermore, we obtained measurements very close to the first zero of the visibility function (see Section 2.1), which allows accurate angular diameter determination and the possible identification of stellar pulsations. As a Kepler target, photometric observations were obtained in 2010 and solar-like oscillations were detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guzik et al. 2011</ref>). These observations imply the possible presence of γ Dor gravity modes, which are generally present in early-F spectral type stars. If these oscillations are confirmed, θ Cyg would be the first star to show signs of both solar-like and γ Dor oscillations <ref type="bibr">(Guzik &amp; Mussack 2010</ref>, and references therein).</p><note type="other">: Calculated exoplanets masses of 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra from interferometric data and comparison with previous work ( (a) Sato et al. 2008 ; (b) Curiel et al. 2011 ; (c) Döllinger et al. 2009)</note></div>

Three stars were used as calibrators : HD177003 (cal1), HD177196 (cal2) and HD203245 (cal3), whose parameters are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>.

The E2 telescope is known to present instabilities, like vibrations and delay line cart problems. Those points are therefore more dispersed than those at higher spatial frequencies, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref>, and the value of χ 2 reduced is mostly dominated by these points. In a first analysis, we have considered all data points. We used the LitPro software 3 (Tallon- <ref type="bibr">Bosc et al. 2008</ref>) and obtained a mean UD equivalent diameter of 0.726 ± 0.003 mas. The χ 2 reduced of the model fitting is equal to 8.4, which clearly indicates dispersion in the measurements or possible variations of the diameter from night to night. This will be investigated in Sect. 6. We also tested a linear limb-darkened (LD) disk model with a coefficient u λ as defined by Hanbury <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brown et al. (1974)</ref>. Unfortunately, the data quality at low-visibility levels is not sufficient for a correct u λ determination. For a more detailed analysis, we decided to fix the linear LD coefficient in the LitPro software. With T eff = 6745 K and log(g) = 4.2, we used the value of the Claret coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Claret &amp; Bloemen 2011)</ref> given for the R, I and J bands, and deduced by extrapolation the value at the observing wavelengths (715 and 670 nm). We found u 670nm = 0.510 and u 715nm = 0.493, and finally took the mean value 0.5. The adjustment of the whole data set (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref> gives the value θ LD = 0.760 ± 0.003 mas, with a reduced χ 2 reduced equal to 8.5. Our final value is consistent with the diameter estimated by van <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Belle et al. (2008)</ref> with spectral energy distribution based on photometric observations : they found θ LD = 0.760 ± 0.021 mas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyajian et al. (2012)</ref> observed this star in 2007 and 2008 with the CHARA CLASSIC beam combiner operating in the K band, and found θ LD = 0.845±0.015 mas and θ LD = 0.861±0.015 mas, which is much larger than ours. We will return to this point in Sect.6. As previously stated, the CLIMB measurements have large scatter and are at much lower spatial frequencies than the VEGA data. They provide a LDD equal to θ LD = 0.654 ± 0.090 mas, with a χ 2 reduced = 1.86, obtained with a Claret coefficient of 0.22 corresponding to the K band. When combining the CLIMB and VEGA data, the diameter remains the same, except that the χ 2 reduced decreases to 5.3. This is because of the large error bars obtained for CLIMB data at high frequencies, which do not con-  strain θ Cyg's LDD at all, although they reduce the χ 2 reduced . For θ Cyg, the scatter affects all measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Determination of fundamental parameters</head><p>The radius and the mass of θ Cyg were estimated using Equations 4 and 5.

The final uncertainty is equally due to errors in the parallax and the angular diameter. This results in a mass of 1.32 ± 0.14M ⊙ and locates θ Cyg between the two lines representing the evolutionary tracks of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> in the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guzik et al.

The errors were calculated using the Monte Carlo method. This results in T eff = 6767 ± 87 K, which is also consistent with the value given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desort et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We have seen in the previous section that the scatter of measurements for θ Cyg is larger than for the three other targets. It remains then to understand these variations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref> shows the night-to-night variations in the LDD of θ Cyg. The UD and LD models do not fit these results very well, as indicated by the generally high value of χ 2 reduced . <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyajian et al. (2012)</ref>'s CLASSIC data obtained between 2007 and 2008 also show some discrepancies in their visibility curve fitted with a UD model. This introduces the possibility of either an additional companion, or stellar variations around θ Cyg. The night-by-night observing strategy we employed so far was not optimized for the investigation of binarity but for the measurement of fundamental parameters. Thus, the UV coverage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref>, which represents the support of the spatial frequencies measured by the interferometer, does not constrain on the position of an hypothetical companion very well. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Stellar variations</head><p>Because θ Cyg's radial velocity is suspected to have a 150-day period (Desort et al. 2009), we studied a possible correlation between the variation of the diameter and this periodic behavior of the radial velocities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> represents the individual angular diameter plotted as a function of a phase (φ) corresponding to the reduced Julian day modulo the spectroscopic period of 150 days. This figure highlights a possible variation with an amplitude of ∼ 13% in diameter peak to peak. Solar-like oscillations lead to lower variations in amplitude than that, but Cepheid stars show similar-sized pulsations. According to θ Cyg's luminosity, however, it is not bright enough to be classified as a Cepheid. Moreover, a Cepheid's light curve presents much larger amplitude variations than θ Cyg's ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guzik et al. 2011</ref>). Its luminosity and temperature would instead locate it near the instability branch of the HR diagram, identifying it as a δ Scuti or γ Dor star, which are also A-or F-type stars.</p><p>This last possibility is also mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guzik et al. (2011)</ref>, who proposed two different models that could show evidence for γ Dor pulsations, but they only allowed l = 1 or l = 2 unstable g-modes. Their light curve does not reveal the typical γ Dor frequencies around 11 µHz, which are specific for these pulsations, though they do mention that these could be overshadowed by the granulation noise. Moreover, γ Dor oscillations have been found in many Kepler sources without much ambiguity because they show obvious evidence for this type of pulsation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tkachenko et al. 2012</ref>). Also, the RV measurements published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desort et al. (2009)</ref> do not reveal high-amplitude and highfrequency (hours to days) RV variations typical of γ Dor stars or δ Scuti stars.</p><p>Finally, we note that if the 150-day period RV variations were due to diameter variations, these diameter variations would be unrealistically large, much larger than those observed, and very significant photometric variations should have been detected by Kepler. We therefore conclude that stellar variations do not explain the observed features in a satisfactory manner. We therefore consider the possibility of an unseen stellar companion for θ Cyg, and see how the present interferometric data can help to test such a scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">An additional companion?</head><p>The known M-type companion to θ Cyg clearly does not affect our visibilities, because of the large separation in position (2 seconds of arc) and the large difference in magnitude (around 7). Any instrument hosted by the CHARA array and used in the same conditions as we did (e.g., medium resolution for VEGA) has an interferometric field of view much smaller than the telescopes' Airy spot, i.e. ≃ 0.1 second of arc. This means that any object located beyond this field does not interfere, but could create a photometric background that disrupts the visibility of the target if it is located in the entrance field of the instrument. In our case, the dM in the V band gives a very small contribution to this background, much lower than the error bars (≃ 1%). We therefore consider the presence of a second and much closer companion. The lower limit of detection allowed by adaptive optics (AO) is at about the diffraction limit of PUEO on the CFHT, i.e. around 100 mas for low-contrast binaries. Accordingly, a companion whose position is closer in than this limit would not be seen in AO direct imaging. However, given our current accuracies in visibility measurements, it could be detected by interferometric instruments if its flux contribution is higher than 2%. Because θ Cyg is not classified as SB2, such a flux ratio would imply a pole-on bound system or a visual unbound binary.</p><p>This last possibility has been considered, but is difficult to confirm. No objects are located close to θ Cyg in the background, except for θ Cyg-B, which could have moved closer to the main star over the years. As said by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desort et al. (2009)</ref>, the differential magnitude between the two bound stars in the V band is 7.9 mag and 4.6 mag in the H band. Thus, we can expect a dM of ∼ 3 mag in the K band, which would make it observable with CLASSIC. A rough estimate of the orbit of θ Cyg-B based on the data published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desort et al. (2009)</ref> shows that at the epoch of the interferometric observations, the separation is still larger than about 2 seconds of arc, which is well outside our interferometric field of view.</p><p>To explore the possibility of an unknown close companion around θ Cyg, we performed several tests on our data set. Because the VEGA visibilities are, at first approximation, dominated by one main resolved source, that is the primary component, we adopted a diameter of the companion of 0.2 mas, corresponding to an unresolved source. The UD diameter of the primary was fixed to θ UD = 0.726 mas, which is the diameter obtained when merging all nights. Then, by assuming a companion's flux in the range 2% to 15%, we obtained the position angle (PA) and angular separation (ρ) corresponding to the minimum χ 2 reduced . We performed the same tests with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyajian et al. (2012)</ref>'s CLASSIC data from <ref type="bibr">[2007]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 12)</ref>.</p><p>In half of the cases of the VEGA sets, we found a solution with a better χ 2 reduced than with a UD model. Generally, the best solution corresponds to a companion with 15% of flux, and a ρ included between 17.6 and 26.9 mas. However, in the other VEGA cases, the data do fit the binary model and no better solution is found. In the CLASSIC data, the χ 2 reduced is reduced by a factor 2 when we include the binarity. The better UV coverage obtained with the E1S1 baseline provides much better constraints on the model in that case. The best solution for the CLASSIC data gives a flux ratio of about 7% and a separation of about 25 mas. An example of the fit improvement for the CLASSIC measurements is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>. However, this flux ratio does not permit us to tell which type of star the companion could correspond to, because it is not necessarily bound, but coud be either foreground or background.</p><p>Finally, we explored the existence of a closure phase signal generated by this close unknown companion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Le Bouquin &amp; Absil 2012)</ref>. The closure phase is the sum of the phases of the complex visibilities obtained with the three baselines of a triplet. It is independent of the atmosphere, giving direct information of the object's visibility, which results in informations about asymmetries, presence of a companion, etc. We already said that the CLIMB data were at low spatial frequencies due to the longer wavelength of operation. Simulations show that in the baseline configurations used for this paper, the companion will produce a signal lower than 5 or 10 • , which is below the current accuracy of CLIMB phase closure measurements. However, the simulation shows that a huge closure phase signal of ±40 • should be detected by VEGA with the E1E2W2 configuration. Many tests have been performed on the data sets but the signal-to-noise ratio of VEGA phase closure measurements is not sufficient for a correct determination. Unlike from the estimation published in <ref type="bibr">Mourard et al. (2011)</ref>, we have now a clearer understanding of the noise level in closure phase measurements with VEGA. Closure phase is a third-order moment and the multi-speckle regime of VEGA prevents us from obtaining accurate closure phase measurements for stars fainter than magnitude 1 or 2, depending on seeing conditions ( <ref type="bibr">Mourard et al., 2012</ref> in preparation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We obtained new and accurate visibility measurements of 14 And, υ And and 42 Dra using visible band interferometric observations. From these we derived accurate values of the LD diameter and of fundamental parameters that are fully consistent with those derived with other techniques and bring some improvements in precision. The error bars and χ 2 reduced for these three stars are in general much smaller than those obtained on our fourth target : θ Cygni. We analyzed the scatter of measurements of θ Cyg, taking into account that instrumental or data processing bias are well understood thanks to the good results obtained on the three other stars. It appears that a solution with an unknown companion close to the star helps in reducing the residuals in the model fitting. The limited accuracy in our determination prevents us from being conclusive about the presence of a new close companion around θ Cyg, and do not allow us to tell which type of star it could be, because it is not necessarily bound. However, this result encourages organizing new observations in the visible and IR wavelengths, focused on confirming or denying this hypothesis. Closure phase signal is a good way to detect and characterize faint companions around bright stars. We performed simulations of expected closure phase signal for θ Cyg with a companion contributing 10% of the flux that is located at 25 mas. As explained before, VEGA is unfortunately not able to measure accurate closure phase signals. CLIMB in K band and MIRC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Monnier et al. 2008</ref>) in H band are welladapted for closure phase tests with the largest CHARA triangle (E1W1S1). Expected signals are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. Therefore, a more adequate observing strategy and dedicated observations will be prepared with the combination of the different CHARA beam combiners.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Squared visibility of 14 And (top), υ And (middle) and 42 Dra (bottom) versus spatial frequency [1/rad] for VEGA data points.
