				<p>An important source of opacity in exoplanet atmospheres at short visible and near-UV wavelengths is Rayleigh scattering of light on molecules. It is accompanied by a related, albeit weaker process-Raman scattering. We analyze the signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the geometric albedo of exo-planets, which could provide information about atmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra of planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong absorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the albedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the reflected light causing the so-called Raman ghost lines. Raman scattering can also cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a stellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the albedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing constrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman ghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in the atmosphere, even molecules like H 2 or N 2 that do not have prominent spectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, ghost lines could also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the effects of Raman scattering in hydrogen-and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. We analyze the feasibility of detecting the signatures of Raman scattering with the existing and future observational facilities, and of using these signatures as probes of exoplanetary atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Characterizing atmospheres of exoplanets usually involves detecting signatures of strong absorbers present in the atmosphere, such as alkali atoms sodium and potassium, and molecules like H 2 O, CH 4 , CO and CO 2 (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Seager &amp; Sas- selov 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hubbard et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sudarsky et al. 2003</ref>). However, these atomic and molecular species can often be present in small amounts and the bulk of the atmosphere can be made of spectroscopically inactive speciesmolecular hydrogen and helium in the case of giant planets, or molecular nitrogen in the case of the Earth's atmosphere. Determining the composition of the spectroscopically inactive gas components is very important for atmosphere characterization. Constraining the abundance of bulk gases breaks the degeneracies associated with measuring the (relative) abundances of trace gases and other atmospheric properties, such as the atmospheric pressure and temperature which can affect the strength of absorption lines. However, detecting molecules like H 2 and N 2 directly (i.e. spectroscopically) is challenging because these are homonuclear diatomic molecules with no low-lying excited electronic states, and hence do not have prominent spectral features in the opoklopcic@astro.caltech.edu tical wavelength range.</p><p>At high densities, these molecules can form temporary collisional pairs that have non-zero electric dipole moments and therefore exhibit radiative dipole transitions. Via this socalled collision-induced absorption (CIA) mechanism, H 2 -H 2 and H 2 -He pairs become an additional source of opacity in the infrared part of the spectrum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Saumon et al. 2012</ref>) that can be used to constrain the abundance of molecular hydrogen and helium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schwieterman et al. (2015)</ref> similarly proposed using an absorption feature of a collisional pair of N 2 molecules at 4.3 µm to detect and constrain the abundance of molecular nitrogen in the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. These broad spectral features of H 2 and N 2 can be very useful probes of deep and dense atmospheres. However, the spectral range in which they reside (NIR and IR) contains numerous spectral lines/bands of other strong absorbers like methane, water, and carbon dioxide with which CIA features often overlap, which can lead to uncertainties in the measured abundances. Therefore, having a complementary method of detecting signatures of H 2 or N 2 in the visible part of the spectrum would be very useful for breaking some of these degeneracies.</p><p>An important source of opacity at short optical and UV wavelengths is Rayleigh scattering of radiation by abundant molecules like H 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hubbard et al. 2001</ref>). Rayleigh scattering has been observed in transmission spectra of hot Jupiters <ref type="bibr">(Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2008a,b)</ref>, however this is not an unambiguous sign of H 2 because the observed spectral slope could also be produced by Rayleigh scattering by condensate particles, as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (2008a)</ref>. Rayleigh scattering does not leave direct spectroscopic signatures such as distinct spectral lines, that could be used to unambiguously identify the main scatterer.</p><p>A related, albeit weaker, process -Raman scatteringdoes imprint signatures of scattering molecules in the scattered light and hence in the albedo of planets. If these Raman features in the albedo were detected, they could be used to distinguish between molecular scattering and scattering by small particles which does not produce Raman features, hence providing information on the presence of clouds or hazes in the observed atmosphere. Additionally, Raman scattering features might be used to spectroscopically identify the dominant scattering molecule, such as H 2 or N 2 , and even the relative population of different molecular levels, thus constraining the temperature of the medium.</p><p>The effects of Raman scattering on planetary albedos and its potential for probing planetary atmospheres has been known and studied for a few decades, mostly in the context of Solar System planets (for reviews of the early studies of Raman scattering see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Price 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cochran 1981)</ref>. The purpose of this paper is to show that detecting the signatures of Raman scattering in the reflected light from exoplanets could be a powerful tool in exoplanet atmosphere characterization and hence may become an interesting target for observations in the era of the next-generation observational facilities. In this paper we investigate the effects of Raman scattering by molecular hydrogen and nitrogen on the geometric albedo spectra of exoplanets and analyze the feasibility of detecting these features in nearby exoplanets using the currently available and future observational facilities.</p><p>In Section 2 we give an overview of the basic physics related to Raman scattering and describe the effects of Raman scattering on the reflected light from planets and their albedo. In Section 3 we describe the radiative transfer calculations and model atmospheres that we use in this study. We present the results of radiative transfer calculations for two test cases -a monochromatic light source and a flat photon spectrum with an absorption line in Section 4. The goal of these test cases is to provide insight into the way in which Raman scattering affects the reflected light from planets. We then present the calculated albedo spectra for several models of clear and cloudy hydrogen-and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres irradiated by the solar spectrum. We discuss our results and analyze the detectability of Raman features in the reflected light from exoplanets in Section 5. In Section 6 we present the summary and the conclusions of this work.</p><p>2. RAMAN SCATTERING Scattering is an interaction between radiation and matter in which an incident photon is annihilated, and a new photon is created. If the scattered photon has the same energy as the incident one, the process is called Rayleigh scattering. If the energies of the incident and the scattered photon are differ- Raman shift:</p><p>eigenstates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. Schematic representation of Rayleigh and Raman scattering. The initial and final states are eigenstates of the molecule, whereas the intermediate state is virtual, making these processes sources of continuum opacity. The energy of the final state can be higher (Stokes Raman scattering), lower (anti-Stokes scattering) or equal to that of the initial state (Rayleigh scattering). The change in the photon energy (Raman shift) is determined by the structure of molecular energy levels, and is unique for every molecule.</p><p>ent, we talk about Raman scattering. Raman and Rayleigh scattering are sources of continuum opacity because in both cases the intermediate state of the atom or the molecule is a virtual state, not an eigenstate of the system, as in the case of resonance scattering. For a detailed treatment of Raman scattering we point the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Long (2002)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> shows schematically the mechanism of Raman scattering, as well as Rayleigh scattering which may be thought of as a special case of Raman scattering. Depending on whether the scattered photon has lower or higher energy than the incident one, we distinguish between Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman processes. Due to Raman scattering the molecule changes its rotational and/or vibrational state. The allowed changes in the rotational quantum number of the molecule are ∆J ≡ J f − J i = −2, 0, 2, corresponding to transitions with spectroscopic labels O, Q, and S, respectively. Vibrational quantum number of the molecule changes in the case of pure vibrational (Q-branch) or rotationalvibrational (O-and S-branch) Raman scattering. Raman transitions depend on the molecular polarizability, not on its electric dipole moment like the regular rotational and vibrational transitions. That is why even homonuclear diatomic molecules, like H 2 and N 2 , that have zero dipole moments and hence do not exhibit rotational and ro-vibrational transitions, do exhibit Raman transitions, since their polarizability is non-zero.</p><p>The change in the energy of the scattered photon, i.e. the Raman shift, is determined by the energy difference between the initial and the final state of the molecule. This property of Raman scattering can be used to spectroscopically identify the scattering medium by measuring the Raman shift that photons experience. Because the exact value of the Raman shift depends on the initial and the final state of the molecule and because the intensity of a shifted line is proportional to the population of the initial state (in the optically thin case), a detailed analysis of the Raman scattering features and their relative intensities can provide information about the relative Reflected light due to Rayleigh scattering is proportional to the stellar flux at the same wavelength. The contribution from Raman scattering depends on the incident flux at the Raman-shifted wavelengths. If there are strong features such as absorption lines in the incident spectrum, they will be present in the reflected light at the same wavelength (due to Rayleigh scattering) and at shifted positions (due to Raman scattering). Consequently, there are two types of features in the albedo spectrum due to Raman scattering: i) albedo enhancements at the wavelengths of absorption lines due to filling-in of the lines by Raman-shifted light and ii) dips in the albedo at wavelengths of the so-called Raman ghosts of the absorption lines. A pure Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere (with no Raman scattering and no absorption) would result in a flat, featureless geometric albedo spectrum.</p><p>population of different molecular levels, and hence be used to constrain the temperature of the scattering medium. If the intensity of light reflected off a planet is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident stellar light at the same wavelength, as it is in the case of a deep (semi-infinite) Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere without any absorption, the resulting geometric albedo spectrum of the planet (the ratio of the reflected and incident light as a function of wavelength) is flat and featureless. 1 On the other hand, the intensity of Raman-scattered light at any wavelength depends on the intensity of the incident radiation at a different, Ramanshifted wavelength. Due to this additional component, the total reflected spectrum (comprising of Rayleigh and Raman contributions) is not simply proportional to the incident spectrum and the resulting albedo is not smooth -it contains spectral features characteristic of Raman scattering. In this work, we focus on two types of features that appear in the planetary albedo spectrum as a result of Raman scattering (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> for reference):</p><p>1. Albedo enhancements: If the incident spectrum has some distinct spectral features, such as strong absorption lines, they will be present in the reflected light at the same wavelength due to Rayleigh scattering. However, the Raman-scattered component at that wavelength is related to the intensity of the incident radiation at the Raman-shifted wavelength, where there is (most likely) no line in the stellar spectrum and the incident intensity is higher. Hence, the relative contribution of Raman-scattered light to the total reflected light is enhanced at wavelengths corresponding to prominent absorption lines, thus filling-in these lines (i.e. reducing their depth) in the reflected light.</p><p>This additional component in the reflected light at the wavelengths of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, compared to the surrounding continuum, causes positive peaks in the albedo spectrum, which we call albedo enhancements. The effect is most pronounced for the strongest absorption lines in the incident spectrum.</p><p>2. Raman ghosts: The intensity of Raman-scattered light is reduced at wavelengths corresponding to Ramanshifted positions of strong absorption lines in the incident spectrum. Therefore, the total intensity of the reflected light at these wavelengths is reduced compared to the surrounding continuum, creating weak dips in the reflected spectrum, and consequently in the planet's albedo, called Raman ghosts.</p><p>The Raman effect occurs only on scattered photons, hence its signatures can only be observed in the reflected light, and not in transmission spectra of exoplanets.</p><p>The importance of Raman scattering in planetary atmospheres was first discovered in the 1960s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brinkmann (1968)</ref> used it to explain the observed filling-in of solar Fraunhofer lines in the Earth's atmosphere, also known as the Ring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grainger &amp; Ring 1962)</ref>. Studies of Raman scattering in the context of atmospheres of other planets began soon thereafter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wallace 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Belton et al. 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Belton et al. , 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Price 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cochran &amp; Trafton 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cochran 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cochran et al. 1981)</ref> and in the next few decades the effects of Raman scattering have been observed in all gas planets in the Solar System (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Karkoschka 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yelle et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bétremieux &amp; Yelle 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Courtin 1999</ref>).</p><p>To include the effects of Raman scattering in the atmospheric models, we follow the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bétremieux &amp; Yelle (1999)</ref>. They studied Raman scattering in the atmosphere of Jupiter, which they observed using the Hubble Space Telescope. By comparing the observations with models, they identified specific Raman features and used them to determine the rotational distribution of H 2 in the Jupiter's atmosphere and the H 2 ortho-para ratio. Their models were computed using the publicly available radiative transfer code DISORT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stamnes et al. 1988</ref>), which they modified to include the effects of multiple Raman scattering by H 2 . In this study, we also use DISORT, to which we have made similar modifications in order to include the treatment of Raman scattering.</p><p>For the purpose of studying the atmosphere of Neptune, Sromovsky (2005a) developed the first method for treating Raman scattering that includes polarization effects. This accurate method was then used to evaluate several approximate methods for including Raman scattering in radiative transfer calculations that were developed with the goal of reducing computational costs associated with rigorous treatment of Raman scattering. The approximation introduced by <ref type="bibr">Pol- lack et al. (1986)</ref> is often used to treat Raman scattering in modeling of reflected light and albedos of exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marley et al. (1999)</ref> use the Pollack approximation with correction terms calculated for a 6000-K blackbody. The albedo spectra produced by their models do not show distinct Raman features that are the focus of our study because a blackbody spectrum does not contain any lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODS 3.1. Model Atmospheres</head><p>We investigate the signatures of Raman scattering imprinted on the geometric albedo of H 2 -and N 2 -dominated atmospheres. We focus our attention on the near-ultraviolet and blue end of the visible spectrum (the wavelength range 3000 ≤ λ ≤ 5000Å5000˚5000Å) because the Raman scattering cross section has a strong wavelength dependence (σ ∝ λ −4 ) and the effects that we investigate become weaker as the wavelength increases. Compared to longer wavelengths, this part of the spectrum is relatively clean of absorption lines from atoms and molecules present in the atmosphere. The most notable absorption lines are those of sodium and potassium at ∼ 330 nm and ∼ 404 nm, respectively. The abundances of Na and K atoms in monatomic form strongly depend on the presence and structure of clouds in the atmosphere. We simplify our model atmospheres by neglecting absorption and including only opacity due to (Rayleigh and Raman) scattering. This allows us to more easily identify and study the effects of Raman scattering alone, which is the main focus of this paper.</p><p>For our main model atmosphere we assume that it is composed entirely of molecular hydrogen 1 H 2 (90% by number) and helium 4 He (10%). Both hydrogen and helium contribute to Rayleigh scattering, but only hydrogen molecules Raman scatter in the wavelength range that we are interested in. The mean molecular weight of this atmosphere is set to µ = 2.3 m p and the surface gravity is g = 10 3 cm s −2 .</p><p>We use three different temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles for clear (cloud-free) H 2 /He atmospheres: 3. Cold atmosphere: T-P profile of Neptune from Sromovsky (2005a, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) with temperature in the range ∼ 50 − 300 K.</p><p>The cloud-free atmospheres have a high-pressure (100 bar) bottom boundary with zero albedo. To assess the influence of thick clouds on the visibility of Raman features, we approximate the presence of a cloud deck at a given pressure by terminating the atmosphere and placing a Lambertian bottom boundary of our model atmosphere at that pressure level. Clouds can have a range of reflective/absorbing properties, which we incorporate by assigning different albedo values to the bottom boundary.</p><p>Additionally, we make a model atmosphere composed entirely of molecular nitrogen 14 N 2 , with a bottom boundary with albedo equal to 0.3 at a pressure level of 1-3 bar, and a TP profile matching that of the Earth's atmosphere 2 . Even though nitrogen-dominated atmospheres will most likely have other constituents that contribute to Rayleigh and Raman scattering (for example O 2 in the case of the Earth's atmosphere), we include only N 2 in order to investigate the effects of Raman scattering from this molecule alone. This analysis serves primarily as a demonstration that Raman scattering can be used to find signatures of gases other than H 2 . Modeling realistic atmospheres of smaller planets is beyond the scope of this paper. The mean molecular weight for the N 2 atmosphere is 28.0 m p , and the surface gravity of the planet is g = 10 3 cm s −2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Radiative Transfer Calculations</head><p>We perform radiative transfer calculations using a discrete ordinate algorithm DISORT <ref type="bibr">3 (Stamnes et al. 1988</ref>). The code was designed to perform monochromatic unpolarized radiative transfer in a scattering, absorbing and emitting planeparallel medium. The medium is divided into N lyr homo-geneous layers, separated by N lyr + 1 levels. The user defines the optical depth (τ ) and the single-scattering albedo (ω) for each layer. The medium can be illuminated by a parallel beam of radiation at the top boundary, at an angle of incidence specified by the user (polar angle Θ in , azimuth angle Φ in = 0). The code computes radiation intensities at user-selected angles and levels. All our calculations are performed with 50 computational levels (N lyr = 49) and 16 streams.</p><p>To define computational levels for each model atmosphere used in the radiative transfer calculations, we start by choosing the minimum and maximum pressure. For minimum we choose P min = 10 −4 bar. We tried a few different values of P min (in the range 10 −5 − 0.01 bar) and the final output of the calculation did not change significantly. As mentioned before, the maximum pressure is P max = 100 bar for the clear atmospheres, 0.1-1 bar for the cloudy H 2 /He, and 1-3 bar for the nitrogen-dominated atmospheres.</p><p>We divide the specified pressure range into computational pressure levels evenly distributed in logarithmic space. The temperature of each level is calculated using the temperaturepressure profile of the atmosphere. For each layer we compute its optical depth as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">τ i = σ(T i ) µg ∆P i , (1)</formula><p>where is µ the mean molecular mass, g is the surface gravity of the planet, and σ is the total scattering cross section (with contributions from Rayleigh and Raman scattering) calculated for the local temperature of that layer. The temperature of a layer is calculated as the average of the corresponding upper-and lower-level temperature, and the change in pressure across a layer ∆P i is just the difference in pressure between the upper and the lower level. Single-scattering albedo is computed for every computational layer and level using cross sections for Rayleigh and Raman scattering by H 2 and Rayleigh scattering by He atoms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ω(λ) = f H2 σ H2,Ray (λ) + f He σ He,Ray (λ) f H2 σ H2,Ray (λ) + f He σ He,Ray (λ) + f H2 σ H2,Ram (λ) ,</formula><p>(2) where f denotes the number fraction of each species. In a pure N 2 atmosphere we use only σ N2,Ray and σ N2,Ram . We take into account rotational and (ro-)vibrational Raman transitions from the ground electronic and ground vibrational level of the molecule. The initial rotational levels range from J = 0 to J = 9 for hydrogen, and from J = 0 to J = 25 for nitrogen. They are populated according to the Boltzmann distribution at the local temperature of the atmosphere T :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f J = g J Z e −E J /k B T ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where f J is the fraction of molecules that are in a state with the rotational quantum number J, Z is the partition sum, E J is the energy of the initial state and g J its statistical weight given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g J (H 2 ) = 2J + 1 for J even 3(2J + 1) for J odd , (4) g J (N 2 ) = 6(2J + 1) for J even 3(2J + 1) for J odd .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The final molecular states are either in the ground or the first excited vibrational level. For more details on the cross sections used, see Appendix A.</p><p>The publicly available version of the DISORT code (we use version 1.3 written in Fortran) does not include treatment of Raman scattering. We modify the code by including an additional source term due to Raman scattering (S Ram ) into the radiative transfer equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">µ dI λ (λ, ˆ k) dτ = I λ (λ, ˆ k) − S Ram (λ) (6) − ω(λ) 4π dΩP ( ˆ k, ˆ k )I λ (λ, ˆ k ) ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I λ (λ, ˆ k)</formula><p>is the specific intensity of radiation per unit wavelength, at wavelength λ, propagating in the direction ofˆk ofˆ ofˆk, µ denotes the cosine of the emission angle, τ is the optical depth, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P ( ˆ k, ˆ k ) is the (Rayleigh) scattering phase function.</formula><p>The only source term included in the standard version of DISORT describes thermal emission for each layer of the atmosphere. Because we are focusing on the wavelength range in which thermal emission is not very important (λ 5000Å 5000˚5000Å), we can modify this term to represent the Raman emission instead. As a result, our Raman source function is isotropic since it comes as a substitute for thermal emission, which was constructed with that property. The Raman emission is proportional to the mean radiation intensity at the Ramanshifted wavelength J λ (λ j ), the Raman cross section for the transition in question σ Ram (λ j ) and the fractional population of the initial molecular state f j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S Ram = j J λ (λ j ) f j σ Ram (λ j ) σ tot (λ) λ j λ 3 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The sum is taken over all relevant Raman transitions. The wavelength of the outgoing photon (λ) is related to the incident wavelength (λ j ) through</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 λ = 1 λ j − ∆ν j ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ∆ν j denotes the Raman shift in wavenumber (i.e. inverse wavelength) for the j-th transition. The factor (λ j /λ) 3 in the source term originates from the fact that Raman scattering conserves the number of photons, but redistributes them in wavelength space. In the radiative transfer equation we define the intensity in terms of energy per unit wavelength, hence we need to take that redistribution into account. One factor of λ j /λ comes from the change in the energy of the photons due to scattering and another (λ j /λ) 2 comes from the change in the wavelength range over which the photons get redistributed over (note that the Raman shift is constant in frequency, but changes in wavelength-space).</p><p>To calculate the Raman source term in each layer of the atmosphere at a given wavelength, we need to know the mean radiation intensity in that layer at Raman-shifted wavelengths, for all relevant Raman transitions. Hence, we need to cover the entire spectral range wavelength by wavelength, record the mean intensities and then use them to compute Raman intensities at different wavelengths. We start this procedure at the shortest wavelength (3000Å3000˚3000Å) and run the modified DISORT code without any Raman source terms. At each layer we record the mean intensity. After that, we run the code for longer wavelengths, up to 5000Å5000˚5000Å with 1 ˚ A spacing, now including the emission due to Raman scattering at shorter wavelengths. This accounts for Raman scattering transitions that lower the photon energy (i.e. the Stokes transitions). After we complete calculations over the entire wavelength range, we repeat them once again, this time having at our disposal the mean intensities over the entire wavelength range. This allows us to include the anti-Stokes Raman transitions (i.e. the Raman shifts to shorter wavelengths) as well.</p><p>The main output of the code is the radiation intensity at the top boundary in a specified direction (angle).

The results of these relatively simple test cases also nicely illustrate how Raman scattering affects the reflected light from a planet. Firstly, we look at the Raman-scattered light produced by a monochromatic source and then we illuminate the atmosphere with a flat photon spectrum with a single absorption line. After these simple test cases, we calculate the geometric albedo resulting from irradiating different model atmospheres with the solar spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kurucz 2005)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . The arrow points at the largest peak which is the reflected light due to Rayleigh scattering at λ = 1400Å1400˚1400Å. It accounts for about 60% of the total reflected light. Everything else comes from Raman scattering. The peaks around the incident wavelength are due to pure rotational Raman transitions. Peaks at wavelengths longer than ∼1480Å∼1480˚∼1480Å are due to various combinations of vibrational and rotational Raman transitions.</p></div>

There is no incident radiation at other wavelengths. The bottom boundary is at the pressure of 10 bar and its albedo is set to zero. We record the total flux emerging from the top of the atmosphere. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows the emerging flux as a function of wavelength, normalized to the incident beam. The largest peak (at 1400Å1400˚1400Å), accounting for ∼ 60% of the reflected flux, corresponds to Rayleighscattered light, everything else is reflected light due to Raman scattering. The first group of peaks represents photons that are produced by pure rotational Raman transitions -antiStokes for the peaks at shorter wavelengths than the incident radiation and Stokes transitions for the peaks at longer wavelengths.

Our results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> look very similar to results from both these papers, giving us confidence that our treatment of Raman scattering is sound. We do not expect our result to be in perfect agreement with theirs due to differences in the assumed atmospheric properties and taking into account Raman transitions from a different number of initial molecular states (we allow more excited rotational levels of the molecule to be initially populated, not just levels with J = 0 and J = 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Test Case II: Flat Spectrum with an Absorption Line</head><p>The second test case matches the one presented in <ref type="bibr">Sro- movsky (2005a)</ref>. A 100-bar deep, cold-model (as defined in Section 3.1) atmosphere is illuminated by a beam of radiation with an absorption line at λ = 3100Å3100˚3100Å inserted into an otherwise flat spectrum (constant λI λ , with I λ normalized at <ref type="bibr">2000Å 2000˚2000Å)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows the incident spectrum (dashed line) and the geometric albedo spectrum (solid line) calculated by our radiative transfer code. Our result for the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere looks very similar to that of Sromovsky, although we cannot reproduce the exact values of the albedo because we do not include the effects of radiation polarization.</p><p>This test case demonstrates the main features of Raman scattering that were discussed in Section 2. At the position of the absorption line in the incident spectrum, there is a strong peak in the geometric albedo spectrum caused by photons that are Raman shifted into that wavelength. Dips in the geometric albedo -Raman ghosts of the absorption line -are less prominent, yet noticeable. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows that the positions of ghost lines in an H 2 -dominated atmosphere are different from those in the atmosphere of N 2 . Raman shifts are determined by the rotational and vibrational energy levels of the molecule and hence the relative shifts of ghost lines are unique for every species. This demonstrates how observations of Raman ghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify homonuclear diatomics like H 2 and N 2 that otherwise do not have prominent spectral features in this wavelength range.</p><p>Intensities of individual ghost lines depend on the cross section for that particular transition and on the population of the initial state, governed by the Boltzmann distribution. By measuring the relative intensities of two ghost lines produced by the same feature in the incident spectrum, the temperature of the medium could be inferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Hydrogen Atmospheres Irradiated by Solar Spectrum</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> we show the incident spectrum and the computed albedo spectra for three models of clear (cloud-free) H 2 /He atmospheres. The three models have different temperaturepressure profiles, as described in Section 3.1. The albedo spectra show enhancements of the order of tens of percent at wavelengths at which the incident spectrum has absorption lines. In the cores of the most prominent lines, the Fraunhofer H and K lines of ionized calcium at 3969 and 3934Å3934˚3934Å, the geometric albedo can be almost twice as high compared to the surrounding continuum.</p><p>The albedo spectra look very similar for all three cloudfree models, although there are some differences due to the temperature dependence of the population of molecular rotational levels. Raman transitions originating from different initial levels have (slightly) different cross sections, changing the overall strength of the Raman effect with temperature. The cross sections are highest for low-energy initial states (for example, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. A1</ref> -the cross section for the rotational S-branch transition from level J = 0 is higher than the cross section for the initial level J = 1), making the Raman effect somewhat stronger in colder atmospheres.</p><p>The position of ghost lines also depends on the initial state of the molecule, and hence the temperature of the medium. this wavelength -a ghost originating from an S(0) Raman transition of the calcium H line, and the S(1) transition from the calcium K line. In our cold atmosphere model, almost all hydrogen is in the J = 0 and J = 1 levels, maximizing the intensity of the ghost lines originating from these two states. In this model, the ghost feature at ∼4027Å∼4027˚∼4027Å causes a ∼ 10% decrease in the albedo. At higher temperatures, the initial distribution of molecular states is broader, making individual ghost lines originating from low-energy states less intense. Placing a thick cloud deck at different altitudes (i.e. different values of pressure) affects the overall albedo spectrum even more than changing the temperature, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. If a cloud deck is high in the atmosphere, the light passes through a smaller column of gas and experiences less scattering than when it travels through a clear atmosphere or an atmosphere with low-altitude clouds. Because the total column mass of gas above a certain level of the atmosphere is proportional to the ratio of the pressure at that level and the planet surface gravity, our results are degenerate with respect to these two quantities. Hence, in order to measure the pressure level of clouds using the intensity of Raman peaks, the surface gravity of the planet needs to be known. We demonstrate this in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> where we show that the intensity of Raman features can be altered by changing the pressure level of the bottom boundary, while keeping the surface gravity fixed (left panel), or by changing the surface gravity while the bottom-boundary pressure remains the same (right panel).</p><p>What affects the strength of Raman features is the number of molecules available to photons for scattering above the cloud deck -having fewer Raman scattering events leads to an albedo spectrum in which Raman features are suppressed and the spectrum is dominated by Rayleigh scattering and the reflective properties of the clouds. Therefore, the strength of the Raman features can be used to infer the column mass of the scattering gas above the could deck and to put constrains on the presence and the altitude of clouds. In this optically thin regime, the albedo spectrum is much more sensitive to the properties of the planet than in the case of a clear, deep atmosphere where radiation can reach the pressure level at which the total optical depth (due to Rayleigh plus Raman scattering) becomes order unity. In the optically thin case, the overall planetary albedo depends on the albedo of the bottom boundary (i.e. the cloud deck) -more reflective bottom boundary results in a higher value of the geometric albedo continuum and larger Raman features as more photons get reflected from the bottom and have a second passage through the atmosphere on the way to the observer, allowing for more scattering evens to occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Nitrogen Atmospheres Irradiated by Solar Spectrum</head><p>We choose the parameters describing our nitrogen atmosphere so that they resemble the properties of Earth's atmosphere. We place the bottom boundary representing the surface of the planet at the pressure of 1 bar, and its albedo is set to 0.3. This choice of parameters leads to a relatively small column of the scattering gas, which is the reason why the albedo spectrum for this model shows only moderate effects of Raman scattering, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>. The effects are stronger for deeper atmospheres, as shown for the atmosphere ending at the pressure of 3 bar. In the case of a small planet with a shallow atmosphere, Raman features alone are unable to give information on whether the bottom boundary is an opaque cloud deck or the planet surface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Constraining the Pressure Level of the Cloud Top/Surface</head><p>The most prominent and most easily detectable Raman features are the peaks in the geometric albedo at wavelengths corresponding to absorption lines in the incident spectrum.</p><p>The albedo is enhanced at wavelengths corresponding to all lines, however the effect is most noticeable for strong lines, such as the Ca II H and K lines in the stellar spectrum. At these wavelengths the albedo can be enhanced by almost a factor of ∼ 2 in the case of a deep and clear H 2 -rich atmosphere ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5)</ref> or by tens of percent in atmospheres with thick clouds at pressures around 1 bar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6)</ref>. In general, the strength of these features depends on the number of Raman scattering events, i.e. on the column density of the scattering molecule that the light goes through before being scattered into our line-of-sight. This could be used to probe the depth of the atmosphere and put constraints on the pressure level of clouds or the planetary surface, if the surface gravity of the planet is known. If the dominant source of opacity at short wavelengths is scattering on particles (aerosols), instead of molecules, Raman features are not expected to appear in the spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Identifying the Dominant Scatterer</head><p>Raman scattering imprints 'ghosts' of features present in the incident spectrum at shifted wavelengths in the reflected spectrum. By measuring the Raman shift of the lines, the scattering molecule can be identified. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, the positions of Raman ghosts originating from the same line in the incident spectrum are different for H 2 , N 2 and any other molecule. The intensity of individual ghost lines is small, on the order of a few percent of the albedo for the strongest lines. However, because Raman scattering occurs over the entire observed wavelength range, small dips in the geometric albedo should appear at frequencies shifted by a fixed amount with respect to all stellar lines. Hence, it might be possible to get a statistical detection of the ghost lines and to measure the Raman shifts by doing a cross-correlation analysis of the incident spectrum and the geometric albedo in frequency-space <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cochran 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cochran et al. 1981)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>, we show such a cross-correlation with our simulated spectra. The y-axis shows the fractional difference between the planet spectrum with Raman features included (F Raman ) and the planet spectrum with a flat albedo (F flat ) showing no signs of Raman scattering. The x-axis shows the wavenumber (1/λ) offset from a strong line in the incident spectrum. We select ∼ 5% of the wavelength bins in the analyzed wavelength range that correspond to the strongest absorption lines in the solar spectrum. We analyze how the planet spectrum around each of these strong lines is affected by Raman scattering, sum up their relative contributions and present them in different colors for different model atmospheres.</p><p>At very small wavenumber shifts (i.e. close to the cores of stellar absorption lines) the planetary flux is enhanced by Raman scattering by a few tens of percent -the lines are 'filled-in'. In hydrogen-dominated atmospheres we see two troughs in the planet flux due to Raman scattering, around ∼ 354 cm −1 and ∼ 587 cm −1 . These flux decrements of the order of a few percent, correspond to Raman ghosts of strong stellar lines due to pure rotational Raman transitions from initial molecular states with J = 0 and J = 1. The troughs are strongest and most easily detectable for the cold atmosphere (T ∼ 100 K) because these two molecular states  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.

At higher temperatures more high-energy (high-J) states are populated and the intensity of individual ghosts is hence reduced. Raman shifts of molecular nitrogen are much smaller than those of hydrogen. Offsets corresponding to rotational Raman transitions from states with J in the range 0-12 are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> by the gray hatched region. Because the distribution of Raman shifts in N 2 is so broad, it is more difficult to discern. Another difficulty associated with small Raman shifts is that ghost lines can overlap with line wings, especially for strong, broad lines like the Fraunhofer H and K lines. Raman ghosts can blend with parent lines and cause merely a decrease in the filling-in effect, instead of showing up as discrete troughs in the planetary flux, as shown in the case of the N 2 model in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3.">Constraining the Atmospheric Temperature</head><p>Raman transitions from different initial states of the molecule have different Raman shifts, which is why an individual absorption line in the incident spectrum produces a whole forest of ghost lines in the reflected light, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.

We assume that the planet is observed near both quadratures (α = ±80 • ), where is has a radial velocity of ±130 km s −1 with respect to the star, and we impart the blue(red)shift to the planetary spectrum accordingly. We define our signal as the difference between the observed photon number count in the case of a planetary atmosphere with Raman albedo features and an atmosphere with a flat, featureless albedo. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref> for the case of planet moving away from (v = +130 km s −1 ) and moving towards the observer (v = −130 km s −1 ). Raman features in the planetary spectrum get blue(red)shifted as the planet orbits the host star. The wavelength shift is only ∼ 2 ˚ A, hence moderately high spectral resolution is needed to detect these subtle changes with orbital phase. In this case we use R = 3000. The Doppler-shifting approach is more favorable for narrow spectral features, hence the contributions to the total S/N are more evenly distributed over the entire wavelength range than in the case of the previous method we considered, where most of the signal came from prominent (and fairly broad) Raman features associated with the stellar calcium lines.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 13</ref> we show the calculated S/N using the two-phase formula, i.e. the difference between the red and the blue curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>. The S/N is evaluated over the 3500 -5000Å 5000˚5000Å wavelength range, for different combinations of distance from Earth and total exposure time on a 10-meter (left panel) or a 30-meter (right panel) ground-based telescope. Telescope throughput is assumed to be 15% over the analyzed wavelength range (in reality this value is not constant, it degrades towards the blue end of the spectrum). Our estimates suggest that detecting the signatures of Raman scattering in nearby exoplanets, using this method, would be very challenging with the currently existing telescopes. However, it should be possible with the next generation of large ground- based observatories if the photon-counting noise limit can be reached for this type of measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Caveats and Future Work</head><p>In this study we focus our attention on atmospheric scattering, in particular on the effects of Raman scattering and its imprint in the geometric albedo of exoplanets. We do not include absorption from atomic or molecular species in our treatment of atmospheric radiative transfer. In an absorbing atmosphere the effects of scattering are less pronounced than in an atmosphere in which absorption is negligible. Absorption leads to an overall decrease in the geometric albedo, particularly at wavelengths corresponding to strong absorption lines, where albedo can be significantly diminished compared to out-of-line continuum. The most likely sources of absorption in the wavelength range that we analyze in this work (∼ 300 − 500 nm) are alkali atoms sodium and potassium, with absorption lines at 330 nm (Na) and 404 nm (K). The strength of these lines depends on the vertical profiles of the Na and K abundance in the form of free atoms. Atmospheric models used in this initial study are not complex enough to include these effects self-consistently.</p><p>Similarly to filling-in of stellar absorption lines by the Raman effect, the absorption lines from atmospheric absorbers also become less deep due to photons that are Raman-shifted into the lines. This effect could lead to underestimates in the inferred atmospheric abundances of absorbing species if Raman scattering is not properly treated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sromovsky (2005a)</ref> found that this effect is present at a few percent level even in the near-IR, where Raman scattering is much weaker than at shorter wavelengths discussed in this work. According to their calculation, in a clear atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet, about 4% of the light coming from deep methane bands in the near-IR is Raman-scattered light. We leave the analysis of filling-in of atmospheric absorption lines in the near-UV and the visible part of the spectrum for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we investigate the effects of Raman scattering by H 2 and N 2 molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets. This process leaves distinct signatures imprinted in the reflected light and the planetary geometric albedo that could, if detected, be used to probe the physical conditions and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Here we summarize the basics of Raman scattering, our results and conclusions:</p><p>• Raman scattering, unlike Rayleigh scattering, changes the frequency of the scattered photons. The intensity of Raman-scattered light at some frequency ν depends on the intensity of the incident light at the Raman-shifted frequency ν + ∆ν. The frequency change ∆ν is determined by the energy-level structure of the scattering molecule, and therefore can be used as a spectroscopic signature of the molecule.</p><p>• Raman-scattered photons fill-in absorption lines in the reflected spectrum that are caused by the lower radiation intensity at wavelengths corresponding to absorption lines in the incident spectrum. This causes sharp peaks in the albedo spectrum at the wavelengths of strong lines in the stellar spectrum, such as the calcium lines at λ ∼ 390 nm in the solar spectrum. These albedo enhancements are the most prominent and most easily detectable Raman features in the albedo spectrum. Under favorable conditions of a deep and clear atmosphere, the albedo at these wavelengths can be enhanced by almost a factor of 2 compared to the surrounding continuum.</p><p>• Albedo enhancements are strongest for clear atmospheres and atmospheres with deep (low-altitude) clouds, whereas high-altitude clouds diminish the effect of Raman scattering. Hence, the strength of Raman peaks in the planetary albedo can be used to constrain the presence and the altitude of thick clouds.</p><p>• Raman scattering produces 'ghosts' of absorption lines in the incident spectrum. They are seen as small dips in the albedo at frequencies that are shifted by a fixed amount ∆ν (Raman shift) from the original line in the stellar spectrum. Individual ghost lines are weak (on the order of a few percent change in the albedo), however they are present at fixed distances from all stellar lines and thus might be detected statistically using cross-correlation techniques. By detecting the ghost lines and measuring their Raman shifts, the scattering molecule can be uniquely identified. This might be the most direct way to spectroscopically confirm the presence of spectrally inactive molecules like H 2 or N 2 in the visible part of the spectrum.</p><p>• The strength of individual ghost lines depends on the population of the corresponding initial molecular state and hence depends on the temperature of the medium. If the intensity of ghost lines produced by the same stellar line, but originating from different initial molecular states, could be measured, the temperature of the atmosphere could be inferred.</p><p>• The most prominent Raman features can be discerned even in spectra of moderate spectral resolution of R = λ/∆λ of a few hundred.</p><p>• Detecting Raman features in nearby hot exoplanets may be possible with the next generation observational facilities, such as the 30-meter-class groundbased telescopes.</p><p>• For exoplanets farther from their host stars, a promising method of detecting the signatures of Raman scattering would be using space-based coronagraph/starshade-equipped telescopes with spectrographs operating in the blue and near-UV wavelengths.</p><p>We thank the anonymous referee for their insightful comments which helped to improve the quality of the paper.

Many previous studies of Raman scattering used hydrogen Raman and Rayleigh cross sections from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ford &amp; Browne (1973)</ref>, which include transitions from initial molecular states with rotational quantum number J ≤ 3. This is well suited for studies of cold atmospheres of giant planets in the Solar System. However, atmospheres of exoplanets can have much higher temperatures in which a significant fraction of molecular hydrogen populates states with J &gt; 3. Since we were unable to find Rayleigh and Raman cross sections for J &gt; 3 states in the literature, we calculate them using the formulae from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dalgarno &amp; Williams (1962)</ref>.</p><p>The cross sections defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dalgarno &amp; Williams (1962)</ref> measure the the total (angle-integrated) outgoing power (in erg s −1 ) divided by the incident energy flux (in erg cm −2 s −1 ). We define cross section as the rate of scattering events (in units of events s −1 ) divided by the incident photon flux (in photons cm −2 s −1 ), hence we need to multiply the cross sections given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dalgarno &amp; Williams (1962)</ref> by the ratio of the outgoing (λ) and the incident (λ ) wavelength. Because of this correction factor our cross sections have wavelength dependence proportional to (λ λ 3 ) −1 , instead of (λ) −4 .</p><p>For a transition between the initial molecular state characterized by rotational and vibrational quantum numbers J i and v i , to the final state with quantum numbers J f and v f , the cross section is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Q S (v i , J i ; v f , J f ) = 128π 5 9λ λ 3 (J i + 1)(J i + 2) (2J i + 3)(2J i + 1) ||R i |γ(r)|R f | 2 (A1)</formula><p>in the case of the S-branch transitions (J f = J i + 2);</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Q Q (v i , J i ; v f , J f ) = 128π 5 9λ λ 3 3||R i |α(r)|R f | 2 + 2 3 J i (J i + 1) (2J i − 1)(2J i + 3) ||R i |γ(r)|R f | 2 (A2)</formula><p>for the Q-branch transitions (J f = J i ; Rayleigh scattering is a special case of Q-branch transitions, one for which v i = v f and λ = λ); and</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Q O (v i , J i ; v f , J f ) = 128π 5 9λ λ 3 J i (J i − 1) (2J i − 1)(2J i + 1) ||R i |γ(r)|R f | 2<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>for the O-branch (J f = J i − 2). In the expressions above α and γ are the average polarizability and the polarizability anisotropy of the molecule, given as functions of internuclear separation r.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure A1</ref>. Cross sections for Rayleigh scattering and several Raman scattering processes, for H2 (left panel) and N2 (right panel) in the wavelength range relevant for this study. Designations of Raman transitions have the following meaning: 'vib' refers to vibrational transitions in which the vibrational quantum number of the molecule changes from 0 to 1 (ground to first excited state), 'rot' describes pure rotational transitions in which the vibrational quantum number does not change. S(i) denotes transitions in which the rotational quantum number increases by 2 (from i to i + 2), for Q(i) the rotational quantum number does not change, and for O(i) the rotational quantum number decreases by 2.</p><p>(1980). R represents the radial wave functions of the H 2 molecule for the initial and final ro-vibrational state (denoted by R i and R f , respectively) that are obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation using the H 2 potential from Wolniewicz (1993). Our computations are performed in the limit of static polarizability, and are thus valid for photon energies small compared to the first electronic excitation energy of the H 2 molecule.</p><p>The resulting cross sections are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. A1</ref> for Rayleigh scattering and a few different Raman transitions. Table A1 contains coefficients that can be used to evaluate the Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross sections. The cross section for a transition from an initial molecular state characterized by quantum numbers v = 0 and J i , to a final state with v f and J f is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Q(0, J i ; v f , J f ; λ) = C λ λ 3 [cm 2 ],<label>(A4)</label></formula><p>where λ and λ are expressed in cm. The incident and scattered wavelengths are related by λ −1 = λ −1 + ∆ν, where ∆ν is the Raman shift of the transition in question. Our values of cross sections for the most important transitions (Rayleigh, pure rotational Raman transitions and vibrational Q-branch transitions) agree with values of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ford &amp; Browne (1973)</ref> to within ∼ 20% at the shortest wavelengths (around 300 nm) and within ∼ 5% around 500 nm. The source of discrepancy is most likely the fact that we do not include the effects of dynamic polarizability, which become more relevant at higher energies. The differences between our cross sections and the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ford &amp; Browne (1973)</ref> for vibrational S-and O-branch transitions are much larger (between 50-100% difference). We were not able to establish the origin of this discrepancy. However, because these transitions are typically between one and two orders of magnitude weaker in cross section than the other Raman transitions (pure rotational and vibrational Q-branch), they do not significantly affect the main results of this work.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Ji J f v f C ∆ν[cm −1 ] Ji J f v f C ∆ν[cm −1 ]</formula><p>NOTE-Coefficients for the scattering cross sections for H2.

QUADRATURE COEFFICIENTS To calculate the reflected light from a planet, we need to properly integrate over the surface of the planetary disk, as described in Section 3.3. In order to do that, we use the quadrature coefficients for order n = 6 and the corresponding angles of incidence for a planet at full phase (phase angle equal to zero ) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Horak &amp; Little (1965)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table B</ref> gives the coefficients of the quadrature expansion (a and b), along with the coordinates (ψ and ξ) of the nine points on the disk used to compute the reflected light and the corresponding cosines of the incident angles (µ). At full phase, the contributions from all four quadrants of the disk are the same, hence we can simply multiply the emerging intensity from the first quadrant by 4 to get the intensity from the entire planet.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">(16)</ref>. The last column (µ0, µ) gives the cosine of the angle at which the radiation beam illuminates the atmosphere, and at which the light is reflected toward the observer (these two angles are equal at full phase).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2. Reflected light due to Rayleigh scattering is proportional to the stellar flux at the same wavelength. The contribution from Raman scattering depends on the incident flux at the Raman-shifted wavelengths. If there are strong features such as absorption lines in the incident spectrum, they will be present in the reflected light at the same wavelength (due to Rayleigh scattering) and at shifted positions (due to Raman scattering). Consequently, there are two types of features in the albedo spectrum due to Raman scattering: i) albedo enhancements at the wavelengths of absorption lines due to filling-in of the lines by Raman-shifted light and ii) dips in the albedo at wavelengths of the so-called Raman ghosts of the absorption lines. A pure Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere (with no Raman scattering and no absorption) would result in a flat, featureless geometric albedo spectrum.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> For a Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere of finite depth the albedo spectrum is not necessarily flat, as shown in Sromovsky (2005b, Fig. 2), but it is always a smoothly-varying function of optical depth, and consequently, of frequency. Hence, sharp features like spectral lines do not appear in the albedo spectrum caused by Rayleigh scattering.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Due to conventions used to define angles specifying the direction of radiation propagation, DISORT variables PHI0 and PHI which designate the azimuthal angles of the incident beam and the output, need to have a 180 • offset in order to be oriented in the same direction. 5 http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun/irradiance2005/ irradthuwl.br_2nmresamp</note>
