				<p>Next-generation space telescopes will observe the atmospheres of rocky planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Understanding these observations will require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which extends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres. Fourth, we show using GCM simulations that rotation only has a strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both techniques.</p>

Results from the Kepler space telescope show that there are at least ∼ 0.5 rocky planets per M-dwarf, half of which could even be habitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>. Just as important, near-future telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST ) will be able to characterize the atmospheres of these planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beichman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cowan et al. 2015</ref>), making them one of the most promising observational targets of the coming decade.</p><p>New theories are needed to understand the potential atmospheres of these exoplanets, particularly their temperature structures and large-scale circulations. An atmosphere's temperature structure and circulation critically influence a planet's surface and atmospheric evolution as well as its potential habitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kasting 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Abe et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yang et al. 2013</ref>). An atmosphere's temperature structure and circulation are also important for interpreting observations. For example, a planet's emission spectrum is determined by the vertical temperature distribution of its atmosphere, while the planet's thermal and optical phase curves are set by its day-night temperature gradient and cloud patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yang et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hu et al. 2015</ref>). Even transit measurements can be strongly influenced by chemical mixing and clouds, which in turn depend on the atmosphere's large-scale circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fortney 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Parmentier et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Charnay et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Line &amp; Parmentier 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately there is a large gap between current theories of terrestrial atmospheres and the wide range of potential exoplanets. Planets accessible to follow-up observations will generally be in short-period orbits, experience strong tidal forces, and thus tend to be either tidally locked or captured in higher spin-orbit resonances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Makarov et al. 2012</ref>). The solar system offers no direct analogs of such atmospheres, and their dynamics are still poorly understood. In this work we focus on tidally locked (synchronously rotating) atmospheres because their dynamics would differ most drastically from rapidly rotating atmospheres, whereas planets in higher spin-orbit resonances should resemble hybrids between tidally locked and rapidly rotating planets (also see Section 9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Previous work and open questions</head><p>Many groups have already used general circulation models (GCMs) to study the thermal structure and atmospheric circulation of tidally locked terrestrial planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Joshi et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pierrehumbert 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Selsis et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leconte et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yang et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zalucha et al. 2013</ref>; Wordsworth 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kopparapu et al. 2016</ref>). These studies investigated a range of processes that shape the atmospheres of tidally locked planets, including the large-scale day-night circulation, equatorial superrotation, heat transport by atmospheric waves, and the potential for atmospheric collapse if the nightside becomes too cold. The development of theory to understand these processes, however, has not kept up with the rapid proliferation of simulations.</p><p>Recent theories of rocky planets focused on planets for which the horizontal heat redistribution is extremely efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Pierrehumbert 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mills &amp; Abbot 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yang &amp; Abbot 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth 2015</ref>). Among the latter, Pierrehumbert (2011b) developed a scaling relation for the surface temperature of a planet that is horizontally completely uniform and whose atmosphere is optically thick,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T s = T eq × τ β LW Γ (1 + 4β) 1/4 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here T eq is the planet's equilibrium temperature defined as T eq ≡ [L * (1 − α)/(4σ)] 1/4 , τ LW is the longwave optical thickness, Γ is the Gamma function defined as Γ(a) ≡ ∞ 0 t a−1 exp(−t)dt, and β ≡ R/(c p n). L * is the stellar constant, α is the planetary bond albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the specific gas constant, c p is the specific heat capacity, and n governs how optical thickness depends on pressure (Section 2). Similarly, Wordsworth (2015) developed a theory for the temperature structure of tidally locked atmospheres in the optically thin limit, in which atmospheres become particularly vulnerable to atmospheric collapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref> found a lower bound for the nightside temperature of a tidally locked planet 1 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T n = T eq τ LW 2 1/4 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Common to both scalings is that they are not valid in the physically important regime of optical depth unity, and indeed contradict each other when extrapolated to this limit. Neither do they explicitly account for horizontal atmospheric dynamics 2 . Nevertheless, we expect that the dynamics of tidally locked planets should be sensitive to a range of additional processes, including the atmosphere's radiative timescale, surface drag, and planetary rotation, all of <ref type="bibr">which</ref> have not yet been addressed for rocky exoplanets.</p><p>On a different front, recent work has begun to understand the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Showman et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Komacek &amp; Showman 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> developed a weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) theory that explains why the hottest hot Jupiters also tend to have the highest day-night brightness temperature contrasts. WTG describes atmospheres that are slowly rotating and are relatively cool, which allows atmospheric waves to efficiently eliminate horizontal temperature gradients ). In equilibrium the wave adjustment leads to subsidence, that is, sinking motions, in regions of radiative cooling (see Section 5). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> showed that day-night temperature gradients become large once the radiative timescale becomes shorter than the timescale for subsidence, t rad t sub . On hot Jupiters with sufficiently strong drag, temperature gradients are large when t rad t wave t drag × t wave ,</p><p>where t wave is the timescale for a gravity wave to horizontally propagate across the planet and t drag is a characteristic drag timescale. It would be tempting to assume Equation 3 applies equally well to rocky exoplanets. That is not the case, and published GCM results of rocky planets are already at odds with it. We show in Appendix A that for most tidally locked terrestrial planets drag and wave timescales are comparable, t drag ≈ t wave . If Equation 3 applied to rocky planets, they should develop large day-night temperature gradients when 1 t wave t rad .</p><p>In contrast, the GCM simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Selsis et al. (2011)</ref> indicate that tidally locked rocky planets can develop atmospheric temperature gradients at a surface pressure of about 1 bar (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>), which translates to a much lower value of t wave /t rad ∼ 0.05. Similarly, we found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot (2015)</ref> that rocky exoplanets develop large day-night brightness temperature contrasts when t wave /t rad 10 −2 . The disagreement between hot Jupiter theory and rocky planets has not been explored yet. Here we will show that the qualitative threshold for a WTG atmosphere to develop large temperature gradients, t rad t sub , also applies to rocky planets. However, rocky planets end up behaving quite differently than hot Jupiters because of the processes that determine the large-scale circulation and the subsidence timescale t sub .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Outline</head><p>In this paper we develop a series of models to understand the atmospheres of tidally locked rocky exoplanets. To show how our models complement previous theories we adopt our nondimensional analysis from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot (2015)</ref>. Using the Buckingham-Pi theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buckingham 1914)</ref>, we showed that the dynamics of a dry and tidally locked atmosphere with grey radiation are governed by only six nondimensional parameters. This set of nondimensional parameters allows us to cleanly disentangle the atmospheric processes that need to be addressed. One choice for the six parameters is given by R c p , a 2 L 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ro</head><p>, t wave t rad , τ SW , τ LW , t wave t drag .</p><p>The convective lapse rate is controlled by R/c p . The nondimensional Rossby radius a 2 /L 2 Ro governs the influence of planetary rotation on equatorial waves. Here a is the planetary radius, the equatorial Rossby deformation radius is defined as L Ro ≡ ac wave /(2Ω), Ω is the planetary rotation rate, and c wave is the speed of a gravity wave. Although c wave is a priori unknown, because it depends on an atmosphere's vertical temperature structure, we can place a reasonable upper bound on it by assuming an isothermal atmosphere. This assumption leads to c wave = R/c p × √ gH = R/c p × RT eq , where g is the acceleration of gravity and H ≡ RT eq /g is the scale height. The wave-to-radiative timescale ratio, t wave /t rad , compares the time it takes for equatorial waves to redistribute energy across the planet, t wave ≡ a/c wave , to the atmosphere's radiative cooling time, t rad ≡ c p p s /(gσT 3 eq ). The atmospheric shortwave and longwave optical thicknesses are τ SW and τ LW . The ratio of wave to drag timescales t wave /t drag = C D a/H governs surface friction and turbulent heat fluxes (Appendix A).</p><p>We only consider atmospheres that are transparent to shortwave absorption (τ SW = 0), which ensures that the solid surface substantially affects the atmospheric dynamics. This means we exclude from our consideration potential "rocky" planet scenarios with a bulk silicate composition, but with gaseous envelopes several hundreds of bar thick <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Owen &amp; Mohanty 2016)</ref>. We expect that the observable atmospheres of such planets would resemble gas giants more than rocky planets, with dynamics that are better captured by theories developed for hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Showman et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Komacek &amp; Showman 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Of the six nondimensional parameters τ SW and τ LW govern radiative transfer, R/c p sets the vertical temperature structure, and the remaining three parameters determine the horizontal dynamics. As an important starting point, we formulate an analytical radiative-convective (RC) model for the temperature structure of tidally locked atmospheres that only depends on β ≡ R/(nc p ) and τ LW and therefore addresses the first two processes (Section 3). In the optically thick regime this model reduces to the asymptotic limit found by Pierrehumbert (2011b). We then turn to horizontal dynamics. We show the day-night circulation acts as a heat engine, in which heating and cooling balance frictional dissipation in the dayside boundary layer (Section 4). We use our heat engine theory to develop a radiative-convectivesubsiding (RCS) model that includes the effects of t wave /t drag and t wave /t rad on temperature structure (Section 5). For cool/thick atmospheres the RCS model reduces to the RC model, whereas for optically thin and hot/thin atmospheres it reduces to the asymptotic limit found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>. Our RCS model explains why rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a significantly lower t wave /t rad threshold than hot Jupiters (Section 6). Next, we use GCM simulations to address rapidly rotating planets and a 2 /L 2 Ro (Section 7). We find that t wave /t rad has to be big for rotation to have a strong effect on temperature structure, that is, cause large eastward hot spot offsets or cold nightside vortices. Our results imply that planets like GJ 1132b or HD 219134b will likely have significant daynight temperature contrasts, unless their atmospheres are dominated by H 2 (Section 8). We estimate that detecting these potential contrasts via thermal phase curves will require about as much time with JWST as detecting molecular Longwave optical thickness at 1 bar τ LW,1bar -0.1 100</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Surface drag coefficient CD, via k vk - ×0.1 ×10</formula><p>a Minimum values correspond to CO2, maximum values correspond to H2. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

Finally, we discuss and summarize our results in Sections 9 and 10.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>We compare our models with a large number of GCM simulations. We use the FMS GCM with two-band grey gas radiative transfer and dry (non-condensing) thermodynamics. FMS has been used to simulate the atmospheres of Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frierson et al. 2006</ref>), Jupiter (Liu &amp; Schneider 2011), hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Heng et al. 2011</ref>), tidally locked terrestrial planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mills &amp; Abbot 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot 2015)</ref>, and non-synchronously rotating terrestrial planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kaspi &amp; Showman 2015)</ref>. We use the same FMS configuration as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot (2015)</ref>. The model version we use simulates the full atmospheric dynamics and semi-grey (shortwave and longwave) radiation, and we include instantaneous dry convective adjustment. Drag is parametrized using a standard Monin-Obukhov scheme which selfconsistently computes the depth of the planetary boundary layer as well as turbulent diffusion of heat and momentum. The surface is represented by an idealized "slab layer", that is a single layer with uniform temperature and fixed depth. The "slab" temperature can be interpreted as a temperature average across the surface's thermal skin depth (Pierrehumbert 2011b). Our simulations are all tidally locked and orbits are assumed to be circular so that the stellar flux is constant in time.</p><p>Because we only consider atmospheres that are transparent to shortwave radiation (τ SW = 0), the incoming stellar flux and the planetary albedo are degenerate in their effect on planetary temperature. For simplicity we set the surface albedo to zero in all our simulations and vary the incoming stellar flux. To specify the relation between longwave optical thickness and pressure, we use a standard power law of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ τ LW = p p s n .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The exponent n specifies how the optical thickness τ increases with pressure. For example, n = 1 if the opacity of a gas mixture is independent of pressure, and n = 2 if the opacity increases due to pressure broadening <ref type="bibr">(Pierrehumbert 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson &amp; Catling 2012)</ref>. Our GCM results assume n = 2 or n = 1. The longwave optical thickness τ LW is set independently of the atmosphere's bulk composition. To constrain τ LW we note that more complex radiative transfer calculations tend to find values of τ LW beween ∼1 and ∼10 at ∼1 bar across a wide range of atmospheres, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Robinson &amp; Catling 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth 2015)</ref>. We extend these bounds by one order of magnitude in each direction and require that the optical thickness at 1 bar satisfy 0.1 ≤ τ LW,1bar ≤ 100. The parameter bounds for our simulations are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> shows the temperature structure of a representative, slowly rotating and relatively cool, GCM simulation. The planet is Earth-sized (a = a ⊕ ), temperate (T eq = 283K), has an orbital period and rotation rate of 50 days, has a moderately thick N 2 -dominated atmosphere (p s = 1 bar), and a longwave optical depth of unity (τ LW = 1). The GCM does not explicitly model a host star, but the orbital period and equilibrium temperature correspond Inside the boundary layer temperature increases towards the substellar point, and air rises; outside the boundary layer temperature contours are flat and air sinks. The region of rapidly rising motions, ω &lt; 0.01 × min(ω), is narrowly focused on the substellar point while most of the atmosphere experiences weak subsidence, ω 0. We normalize temperature by the equilibrium temperature Teq, and pressure velocity by the characteristic surface speed from the heat engine Us × ps/a (Section 4). The planet's physical parameters are Teq = 283K, a = a⊕, Ω = 2π/(50d), ps = 1bar, τLW = 1, and (R, cp) = (R, cp)N 2 .</p><p>to an early M-dwarf (M0 or M1; Kaltenegger &amp; Traub 2009, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In terms of nondimensional parameters, (R/c p , a 2 /L 2 Ro , t wave /t rad , τ LW , t wave /t drag ) = (2/7, 0.12, 5 × 10 −3 , 1, 1.4). Because the temperature structure is approximately symmetric about the substellar point we present this simulation in terms of a substellar latitude, i.e., the angle between substellar and antistellar point (also see <ref type="bibr">Koll &amp; Abbot 2015, Appendix B)</ref>. The temperature structure in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> is comparable to that found by previous studies, and temperature contours are horizontally flat outside the dayside boundary layer (dashed black line). The flat temperature contours are characteristic of the weak-temperaturegradient (WTG) regime. However, WTG does not hold on large parts of the dayside where the absorbed stellar flux creates a region of strong convection and turbulent drag, which damps atmospheric waves and allows the atmosphere to sustain horizontal temperature gradients ). As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>, this boundary layer will be of critical importance for understanding the atmospheric circulation of rocky planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A TWO-COLUMN RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE MODEL</head><p>In this section we present a two-column model for tidally locked planets. We divide the planet into two (dayside and nightside) vertical columns, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The dayside is heated by stellar radiation, which triggers convection and sets an adiabatic vertical temperature profile. We assume the convective heat flux is large so that the temperature jump between dayside surface and lowest atmospheric level is small. We also assume convection is deep and do not include a stratosphere (i.e., a purely radiative layer in the upper atmosphere), so that the dayside column temperature profile in terms of optical thickness τ can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T = T d τ τ LW β ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where T d is the dayside surface temperature, τ LW is the total optical thickness in the longwave, and β ≡ R/(c p n) is the adiabatic lapse rate in optical thickness coordinates. Next, we assume the weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) regime holds globally (i.e., also inside the dayside boundary layer). The atmosphere is therefore horizontally homogeneous and the nightside temperature structure is also described by Equation 7. Under these assumptions the entire atmosphere is in radiative-convective equilibrium, with convection governed by the dayside surface temperature T d . The nightside surface will generally be colder than the overlying air, which leads to stable stratification and suppresses turbulent fluxes between the nightside surface and atmosphere. We idealize this situation by assuming that the nightside surface is in radiative equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). For a grey atmosphere on a dry adiabat, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) upward longwave and surface downward <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The two-column radiative-convective model. We assume convection on the dayside sets up an adiabatic temperature profile. Horizontal heat transport is assumed to be effective so that the atmosphere is horizontally uniform. The black dots indicate surface temperatures. The dayside surface and atmosphere are closely coupled via convection, whereas the nightside surface is in radiative equilibrium with, and generally colder than, the overlying atmosphere.</p><p>longwave fluxes are <ref type="bibr">(Pierrehumbert 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson &amp; Catling 2012</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F ↑ (τ = 0) = σT 4 d e −τ LW + σT 4 d τ LW 0 τ τ LW 4β e −τ dτ ,<label>(8a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">F ↓ (τ = τ LW ) = σT 4 d τ LW 0 τ τ LW 4β e −(τ −τ LW ) dτ .<label>(8b)</label></formula><p>Using these expressions we write the dayside TOA, nightside TOA, and nightside surface energy budgets 3 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L * (1 − α p ) 2 = σT 4 d e −τ LW + σT 4 d τ LW 0 τ τ LW 4β e −τ dτ + HT,<label>(9a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">HT = σT 4 n e −τ LW + σT 4 d τ LW 0 τ τ LW 4β e −τ dτ ,<label>(9b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">0 = σT 4 n − σT 4 d τ LW 0 τ τ LW 4β e −(τ LW −τ ) dτ ,<label>(9c)</label></formula><p>where T d is the dayside temperature, T n is the nightside temperature, and HT is the day-night heat transport.

The integrand in the upward flux decays exponentially at large τ , which means we can approximate the upper limit as infinity and replace the integral with a gamma function, τ −4β</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">LW τ LW 0 τ 4β e −τ dτ ≈ τ −4β LW ∞ 0 τ 4β e −τ dτ = τ −4β LW Γ(1 + 4β).</formula><p>Similarly, in the optically thick limit the downward flux at the surface has to approach unity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">τ LW 0 (τ /τ LW ) 4β e −(τ LW −τ ) dτ ≈ 1. Combining these approximations we find T n ≈ T d ≈ T eq τ β LW Γ(1 + 4β) −1/4</formula><p>, which is the same as Pierrehumbert's result (Equation 1). The dayside and nightside temperatures become equal in this limit because the atmosphere's downward longwave emission becomes large enough to eliminate the temperature difference between the nightside surface and the air directly above it (which in turn is equal to the dayside surface temperature).</p><p>In the optically thin limit, our model differs slightly from the result of Wordsworth (2015). For τ LW 1 we can approximate all exponentials using Taylor series, e −τ LW = 1+O(τ LW ). Retaining only the lowest order in τ LW , we write the integrals in the upward and downward fluxes both as τ −4β</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">LW τ LW 0 τ 4β e ±τ dτ ≈ τ −4β LW τ LW 0 τ 4β dτ = τ LW /(1 + 4β).</formula><p>The atmosphere's TOA upward and surface downward emission therefore become equal, which is a well-known property of grey radiation in the optically thin limit (Pierrehumbert 2011b). Again discarding higher-order terms in τ LW , we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">T d ≈ 2 1/4 T eq × [1 − 3τ LW /(4(1 + 4β))] and T n ≈ 2 1/4 T eq τ 1/4 LW × (1 + 4β) −1/4</formula><p>. This nightside temperature has the same asymptotic limit but is slightly warmer than Equation 2 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>. That is because we assume the atmosphere remains fixed to an adiabat, whereas Wordsworth (2015) assumes an atmosphere that is vertically isothermal. We will use our radiative-convective-subsiding model (Sections 5-6) to show that Wordsworth's result is a limiting expression for atmospheres that are very hot or thin, t wave /t rad 1, whereas our results in this Section apply for atmospheres that are cold or thick, t wave /t rad 10 −4 . Nevertheless, β is always of order unity so the difference between Equation 2 and our result is small in the optically thin regime.</p><p>Next, we compare the previous scalings and our radiative-convective (RC) model with our GCM simulations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  3</ref> shows dayside (top) and nightside (bottom) average surface temperatures of many simulations. To represent all GCM results in a single figure, we normalize surface temperatures using the equilibrium temperature T eq of each simulation. We only show simulations with β = 1/7, i.e., (R, c p , n) = (R N2 , c p,N2 , 2). First, as we showed above, the RC model tends towards the expressions of Pierrehumbert and Wordsworth in the optically thick and thin regimes (compare solid line with dashed and dotted lines). While the two approximate expressions diverge at τ LW = 1, our model provides a smooth fit in this region. Second, the RC model captures dayside surface temperatures very well, with deviations beween the RC model and the GCM simulations smaller than 0.1 × T eq . The RC model systematically overpredicts dayside temperatures because of its idealized geometry, which represents the entire dayside as a single column. For example, the dayside-average temperature of an airless planet in pure radiative equilibrium is 4 √ 2/5 × T eq ≈ 1.13T eq , whereas the RC model predicts 2 1/4 × T eq ≈ 1.19T eq . Third, the RC model captures the general trend of nightside surface temperature with τ LW . However, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> also shows that nightside temperatures exhibit a much wider spread than dayside temperatures, which is not captured by the RC model.</p><p>There are two reasons for the spread in nightside temperatures: first, rapidly rotating atmospheres develop horizontally inhomogeneous nightsides, and second, tidally locked atmospheres do not have an adiabatic temperature structure on the nightside. We address rotation in Section 7, here we consider the effect of temperature structure. <ref type="figure">Figure 4a</ref> shows the vertical temperature structure of a slowly rotating simulation. The grey lines show the vertical temperature profiles at each horizontal GCM grid point, which form a wide envelope. The hottest temperatures at the right side of the envelope correspond to the substellar point. These profiles are indeed adiabatic, which can be seen from the fact that they are parallel to the temperature profile of the RC model (dashed red-blue line    <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Temperature structure of a slowly rotating GCM simulation (a 2 /L 2 Ro = 0.1), compared with the radiative-convective (RC, left) and the radiative-convective-subsiding model (RCS, right). Solid curves correspond to dayside (red) and nightsideaveraged (blue) GCM temperature profiles, and GCM temperature profiles at each latitude and longitude (grey). Left: Although the RC model (mixed red-blue curve) qualitatively captures the temperature structure, it does not capture the nightside inversion and thus overpredicts the nightside surface temperature (compare blue square with blue circle). Right: the RCS model (dashed curves) accounts for imperfect day-night heat transport and qualitatively captures the nightside inversion structure. This leads to a better fit of nightside surface temperature than for the RC model. The planet's physical parameters are Teq = 400K, a = a⊕, Ω = 2π/(50d), ps = 0.5bar, τLW = 1, (R, cp) = (R, cp)N 2 , and g = 5m s −2 .</p><p>as the dayside and nightside averaged profiles show, large parts of the atmosphere do not follow an adiabat (solid red and blue lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>). The deviation arises because WTG breaks down inside the dayside boundary layer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>. This allows the atmosphere outside the boundary layer to decouple from regions of convection, and develop a strongly non-adiabatic temperature profile. In particular, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows that the nightside average (blue line) forms a strong inversion below p/p s ∼ 0.6, which means the nightside is stably stratified and far from radiative-convective equilibrium. Nightside inversions are a robust feature of tidally locked atmospheres and have been found in a range of simulations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Joshi et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leconte et al. 2013</ref>), but are not captured by the RC model. As a consequence the RC model produces a warmer nightside atmosphere and therefore also a warmer nightside surface than the GCM (compare blue square and blue circle in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>). We present a model that captures the nightside temperature structure in Section 5. However, to do so we have to account for atmospheric dynamics, which show up via the parameters t wave /t rad and t wave /t drag . To address the dynamics we first have to develop a theory of large-scale wind speeds and the atmospheric circulation, which we turn to in the next section.</p></div>

The ideal heat engine is an upper bound because additional physical processes, such as diffusion, lead to irreversible production of entropy and decrease the efficiency of a heat engine below its ideal limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pauluis &amp; Held 2002</ref>). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, the atmosphere absorbs heat near the dayside surface at a hot temperature and emits it to space at a cold temperature.

The only unknown in this equation is the dayside surface temperature T d . As we saw in Section 3, T d was already well constrained by the radiative-convective model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3</ref>). In this section we therefore close the model using T d from Equation 10a (but note that we will self-consistently solve for T d in Section 5). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares dayside averaged surface wind speeds U s with a numerical wind speed scaling from Wordsworth (2015, see Appendix B) and our analytical heat engine scaling. We note that Wordsworth considered the optically thin limit, whereas our results are valid for arbitrary τ LW . Wordsworth derived a scaling by assuming weak temperature gradients hold globally. In a weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) atmosphere, radiative cooling leads to subsidence, which Wordsworth assumed in turn drives the large-scale circulation. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows that the GCM wind speeds span two orders of magnitude, from 3 m s −1 up to about 300 m s −1 . The Wordsworth (2015) scaling seems to match these wind speeds at O(1) m s −1 . However, it predicts a strong decrease, down to less than 10 −2 m s −1 , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the GCM results <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6a)</ref>. The mismatch arises because Wordsworth's global WTG scaling assumes winds are purely driven by radiative cooling, U s ∝ τ LW (Appendix B), so U s should rapidly vanish in the optically thin limit. Instead, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that WTG balance breaks down in regions that are strongly convecting. The convecting regions in turn govern the return flow from the nightside to the dayside, which means that the effect of friction on the large-scale circulation cannot be neglected. Our heat engine scaling includes this effect and predicts very different dynamics. For example, in the optically thin limit the dayside temperature is approximately constant and 1 <ref type="figure">Figure 6b</ref> supports our theory. The slope predicted by the heat engine provides an excellent fit to the GCM results. Moreover, we expect the heat engine to provide an upper bound on surface wind speeds. Our expectation is confirmed by the GCM simulations, which fall below the dashed black line in <ref type="figure">Figure 6b</ref>. In addition, the overestimate of U s is small and generally amounts to less than a factor of 4 (grey dashed line in <ref type="figure">Figure 6b</ref>), with most simulations falling about a factor of 2 below the ideal limit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">− e τ LW ≈ τ LW , so U s ∝ τ 1/3 LW (Equation 12).</formula><p>Next, we use the surface wind speed scaling to place an upper bound on the strength of the day-night circulation. Of particular interest to us is the large-scale vertical motion on the nightside, which we will show governs the day-night heat transport and is critically important for the temperature structure on the nightside (Section 5). We express all vertical motions using pressure coordinates, that is, using the pressure velocity ω ≡ Dp/Dt where ω &gt; 0 means sinking motions. We take the surface wind speed U s to be the characteristic horizontal velocity within the boundary layer. We relate the horizontal velocity in the boundary layer to the pressure velocity near the substellar point using mass 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 <ref type="bibr">0</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Two different surface wind speed scalings compared with many GCM results (N = 271).

Right: our scaling for average surface wind speed for an ideal heat engine (Eqns. 12 and 10a). The GCM simulations are less efficient than ideal heat engines and therefore have smaller surface wind speeds. The grey dashed line corresponds to an inefficiency factor of 1/4. conservation (Equation D14),</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ω up p s ∼ U s a .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Figure 1b supports this scaling, and ω/ω up near the substellar point is of order unity. However, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref> also shows that there is a large asymmetry between rising and sinking motions. While air rises rapidly near the region of strongest convection at the substellar point, it sinks slowly over a large area outside the boundary layer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref> quantifies the asymmetry using A up /A down , the fraction of the atmosphere in which air rises versus sinks 4 . In the shown simulation rising air never covers more than 20% of the atmosphere, while its vertically averaged value is about 10% (dot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>). The asymmetry in vertical motions arises from the geometric asymmetry of the incoming stellar flux, and is distinct from the asymmetry of rising and sinking motions in Earth's tropics which is caused by the condensation of water during convection. Because upward and downward mass fluxes have to balance across a horizontal slice of atmosphere,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">ρA up ω up = ρA down ω down ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where ρ is the density of an air parcel, we can relate the pressure velocity on the nightside to the dayside surface wind,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ω down = A up A down p s a × U s .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Equation 15 explains how tidally locked planets sustain weak downward motions despite very large horizontal wind speeds. The time for a parcel of air to be advected horizontally is t adv = a/U s whereas the time for a parcel to subside (that is, be advected vertically) is ten times longer to sink back to the surface on the nightside than to be advected from the nightside to the dayside. The same comparison also explains why day-night temperature gradients of tidally locked planets are not set by the advective timescale and instead depend on the ratio of subsidence and radiative timescales (Section 6).</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">t sub = p s /ω down = A down /A up × t adv . For A down /A up ∼ 10</formula><p>Next, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> compares the pressure velocity ω down from Equation 15 with the mass-weighted vertically and horizontally averaged pressure velocities, ¯ ω night , from GCM simulations. In the comparison we use Equation 12 to predict U s but still diagnose A up /A down directly from GCM output. First, because the heat engine provides an upper limit on U s it also provides an upper limit on ω down . The GCM simulations indeed fall almost entirely below the dashed black line in <ref type="figure">Figure 6b</ref>. We note that in deriving Equation 12 we neglected some factors that we expect to be small (e.g., geometric factors), but which explain why some GCM simulations slightly exceed the value predicted by the scaling. Second, we find that relatively slowly rotating atmospheres (blue dots) closely follow the heat engine scaling and most of them deviate less than a factor of 4 from it (grey dashed line). Third, rapidly rotating atmospheres (red dots) still follow the scaling qualitatively but ¯ ω night is smaller than in slowly rotating atmospheres. The larger deviation arises because rapidly rotating atmospheres develop inhomogeneous nightsides (Section 7). In the extratropics the flow then becomes geostrophic which in turn suppresses vertical motions by O(Ro) 1, where Ro is the Rossby number <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Showman et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>We conclude that atmospheres of dry tidally locked planets are dominated by dayside boundary layer friction. The heat engine framework successfully constrains the amount of dissipation and surface wind speeds within the boundary layer. Combined with the areal asymmetry between rising and sinking motions, we find an upper bound on the nightside vertical velocity. Our result is distinct from previous scalings that have been proposed for exoplanets. We will use our result in the next section to constrain the thermal structure of the nightside.</p></div>

In this section we develop a two-column model that does so. We again divide the atmosphere into two dayside and nightside columns, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. As in Section 3 the dayside column is strongly convecting, but we allow the nightside temperature profile to deviate from an adiabat.

The left side of the thermodynamic equation represents advection, the first term on the right is heating/cooling due to compression/expansion as air parcels move vertically, the second term on the right is radiative heating/cooling, and the third term represents the effect of small-scale convection inside the boundary layer. In equilibrium ∂T /∂t = 0, and D is negligible on the nightside because the nightside is stably stratified. As long as horizontal temperature gradients are small on the nightside the thermodynamic equation then reduces to WTG balance</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">ω ∂T ∂p − RT c p p ≈ g c p ∂F ∂p .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Equation 18 entails that radiative cooling is accompanied by subsidence as follows. In a cooling layer the net radiative flux decreases towards the surface, ∂F/∂p &lt; 0. The lapse rate has to be smaller than, or equal to, the adiabatic lapse rate because the atmosphere would otherwise start convecting, ∂T /∂p ≤ RT /(c p p). It follows that ω &gt; 0. In Earth's tropics the vertical temperature structure, ∂T /∂p, and radiative fluxes, ∂F/∂p, are set by small regions of moist convection, in which case WTG can be used to predict the large-scale ω ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sobel et al. 2001</ref>). In this section we pursue the opposite approach: because ω is set by the day-night circulation which, in turn, is limited by friction in the dayside boundary layer (Section 4), we will use WTG balance to solve for T and F . For simplicity we replace ω with its vertical average ¯ ω. Because we assume that horizontal variations are small, we also replace all partial derivatives with normal derivatives. We rewrite WTG balance in optical depth coordinates and combine it with the Schwarzschild equation for the radiative flux F (Equation D16),</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">c p ¯ ω g dT dτ − βT τ = dF dτ ,<label>(19a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">d 2 F dτ 2 − F = −2 d(σT 4 ) dτ .<label>(19b)</label></formula><p>Given boundary conditions, these equations can be solved for T and F . The left side of Equation 19a represents the vertical energy flux due to subsidence (in W m −2 ). In the WTG regime subsidence is how the atmosphere transports heat between dayside and nightside. Atmospheres with strong subsidence (large ¯ ω) will tend to have nightsides that are close to an adiabat, while atmospheres with very weak subsidence will tend to approach pure radiative equilibrium on their nightsides (i.e., dF/dτ ≈ 0).</p><p>To solve for T and F on the nightside we need to specify an upper boundary condition. A natural choice is the tropopause, τ 0 , up to which convection rises on the dayside. Above τ 0 the atmosphere is in pure radiative equilibrium, dF/dτ = 0. We assume the stratosphere is horizontally uniform, which means it has the same temperature structure as in Pierrehumbert (2011b),</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">T strat = T eq 1 + τ 2 1/4 .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>We can now specify the boundary conditions for the nightside atmosphere and Equations 19.

The second is the stratospheric energy budget, that is, pure radiative equilibrium. The third condition is the nightside surface energy budget. Because the nightside surface is in radiative equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere, F ↑ (τ LW ) = F ↓ (τ LW ), the net radiative flux F = F ↑ − F ↓ has to vanish at the surface. The only unknown in these boundary conditions is the tropopause height τ 0 . The tropopause height τ 0 is in turn governed by convection on the dayside. On the dayside, the convective temperature profile (Equation 16) has to match the stratospheric temperature profile (Equation 20) at τ 0 , so</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">T d τ 0 τ LW β = T strat (τ 0 ), T d τ 0 τ LW β = T eq 1 + τ 0 2 1/4 .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Finally, we use the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy budget to constrain T d .

Finally, we constrain the pressure velocity ¯ ω on the nightside. We showed in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> that the heat engine scaling allows us to place an upper bound on ¯ ω once we account for the fact that atmospheres are imperfect heat engines and once we know the relative fraction of rising versus subsiding motions, A up /A down (we consider rotation in Section 7). In this section we incorporate these effects via</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">ω down = χ × p s U s a<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where χ captures the inefficiency of the heat engine as well as the smallness of A up /A down . We again use Equation 12 to compute U s , but now we self-consistently solve for the dayside temperature T d . To constrain χ we note that the asymmetry between rising and sinking motions is set by the tidally locked geometry and hence should not vary much between different simulations. We use A up /A down ≈ 0.1 from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref> as a representative value. Similarly, for slowly rotating atmospheres we found that ¯ ω falls between the value predicted by the heat engine and about a factor of four less <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>, so we choose a representative inefficiency of 1/2. Combining these two, we find χ = 1/20. Because rapidly rotating atmospheres tend to have weaker nightside subsidence <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>), our choice of χ is an upper bound for ω down and will overestimate the day-night heat transport on rapidly rotating planets. We emphasize that χ is the only tunable parameter in our model and is fixed to a single value. We do not change χ when we compare the radiative-convective-subsiding model with different GCM simulations.</p><p>We numerically solve the model to find the nightside temperature T and radiative flux F , the dayside surface temperature T d , the nightside surface temperature T n and the tropopause height τ 0 . The boundary conditions for T and F are specified at the tropopause and at the surface, so we use a shooting method (Appendix C). We note that the Schwarzschild equation <ref type="bibr">(Equation 19b</ref>) becomes difficult to solve accurately in the optically thick limit because the radiative boundary conditions at the tropopause and surface decouple at large τ LW <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Equations 21b,c)</ref>. Nevertheless, the underlying physics do not change qualitatively once τ LW 1. We therefore avoid these issues by limiting our numerical solver to atmospheres with τ LW ≤ 15. <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref> compares the radiative-convective-subsiding (RCS) model with the same slowly rotating GCM simulation as in <ref type="figure">Figure 4a</ref>. The RCS model produces an adiabatic temperature profile on the dayside and an inversion on the nightside. Compared to the radiative-convective model (RC, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>), the RCS model produces a colder nightside and a warmer dayside because it does not assume that the day-night heat transport is necessarily highly effective. The predicted temperatures match the GCM significantly better, particularly on the nightside. The RCS model also places the tropopause at p/p s ∼ 0.3, whereas the GCM tropopause is higher up, at p/p s ∼ 0.1. The high tropopause in the GCM arises because it is set by the deepest convection and hottest temperatures near the substellar point instead of the average dayside temperature <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4b)</ref>, which the RCS model does not account for. Finally, the inversion structure in the RCS model is somewhat skewed compared with the GCM, and the inversion occurs higher up in the atmosphere <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4b)</ref>. The raised inversion is likely due to our assumption of a vertically constant value of ω. Nevertheless, given the simplicity of the RCS model, we consider the fit between the RCS model and the GCM highly encouraging. We emphasize that the RCS model is obtained via a simple numerical solution, and is conceptually much simpler (and computationally much cheaper) than the full GCM.</p><p>Next, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref> compares the RC and RCS models with many GCM simulations. The top row compares the radiativeconvective model (RC) with the GCM, the bottom row does the same for the radiative-convective-subsiding (RCS) model. We note that in rapidly rotating atmospheres (a 2 /L 2 Ro ≥ 1) WTG balance does not hold at higher latitudes, and both models should break down. However, WTG balance actually provides a good approximation of the nightside structure even at rapid rotation provided the atmosphere is not too hot or thin (t wave /t rad 5 × 10 −2 ). We explain this threshold in Sections 6 and 7, here we simply mark simulations for which the RCS model could break down in red and all other simulations in blue. First, as we already explained for <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref>, the RCS model generally predicts warmer daysides than the RC model, which already overestimates dayside temperatures slightly (see right panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 9</ref>). To quantify the goodness of fit between the GCM and our models, we compute r 2 values for the simulations marked in blue. For dayside temperatures we find r 2 = 0.82 with the RC model, and r 2 = 0.23 with the RCS model. These values underline that the RC model already captures the basic structure of the dayside. Improving the fit even further would require addressing the spatial inhomogeneity on the dayside <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>, whereas the reduced heat transport in the RCS model actually worsens its dayside fit. Second, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref> shows that the RC model overpredicts nightside surface temperatures (top left panel). In contrast, the RCS model fits the GCM values extremely well (bottom left panel). For nightside temperatures we find r 2 = 0.76 with the RC model, while the RCS    model essentially reproduces the GCM results with a fit of r 2 = 0.98.</p><p>To conclude, we have formulated a radiative-convective-subsiding model that utilizes WTG balance combined with the heat engine scaling for the large-scale circulation to capture the day-night heat transport and nightside temperature structure. Our model captures the day-night temperature structure of many GCM simulations extremely well. We provide an intuitive understanding of the model results in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">TRANSITION TO LARGE DAY-NIGHT TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS</head><p>In this section we explain the threshold at which atmospheres of tidally locked rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients. We point out again that hot Jupiter theories suggest this should occur when t wave /t rad 1 (Section 1). In contrast, we show that on rocky planets the threshold is up to two orders of magnitude smaller and temperature gradients become large when t wave /t rad O(10 −2 ). The small threshold is important because it means rocky exoplanets are relatively more sensitive to the parameter t wave /t rad , so planets that are relatively cool or have thick atmospheres still exhibit large day-night temperature differences. Finally, we relate the RCS model back to previous theories by showing that it reduces to our RC model for t wave /t rad 10 −4 and to Wordsworth (2015)'s result for t wave /t rad 1 and τ LW 1.</p><p>To start, we consider the thermodynamic equation under WTG balance <ref type="bibr">(Equation 19a</ref>). WTG balance expresses a balance between subsidence heating and radiative cooling, and we nondimensionalize it usingˆTusingˆ usingˆT = T /T eq andˆF andˆ andˆF = F/(σT 4 eq ). We find that the ratio of subsidence heating to radiative cooling is governed by two parameters,  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Day-night temperature gradients are large once the wave-to-radiative timescale ratio twave/t rad exceeds the threshold from Equation 34 (vertical dashed lines). The panels show dayside surface temperature, Ts day , nightside surface temperature, Ts night , and the bottom-most atmospheric temperature on the nightside, Tatm night , from the radiative-convective-subsiding model (RCS, Section 5). In all cases, cool/thick atmospheres with twave/t rad 10 −4 have small temperature gradients between dayside surface and nightside atmosphere. Surface temperature gradients additionally depend on optical thickness, and even cool/thick atmospheres can have large day-night surface temperature gradients if τLW 1 (left panel). Black symbols show the nightside surface temperatures predicted by the radiative-convective model (RC), and the asymptotic scaling of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>; the RCS model reduces to either in the limits twave/t rad 10 −4 and twave/t rad 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">d ˆ T dτ − β ˆ T τ = t sub t rad d ˆ F dτ ,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where β = R/(c p n) sets the adiabatic lapse rate, t sub ≡ p s /¯ ω is a characteristic subsidence timescale for a parcel of air and t rad = p s c p /(gσT 3 eq ) is the radiative cooling timescale. Equation 27 is the three-dimensional equivalent of the WTG scaling developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> using the shallow-water equations. The lapse rate parameter β is always of order unity whereas the subsidence timescale t sub is an emergent timescale set by the largescale dynamics. When t sub /t rad 1 radiative cooling is inefficient compared with subsidence heating, the nightside atmosphere is close to an adiabat, and day-night temperature differences are small. When t sub /t rad 1 a parcel of air cools significantly as it descends, the nightside develops inversions, and day-night differences are large. Finally, for t sub /t rad 1 the nightside is close to radiative equilibrium.</p><p>The transition to large day-night temperature gradients occurs at a wave-to-radiative timescale threshold of t wave /t rad ∼ 10 −2 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows temperatures from the RCS model as a function of the timescale ratio t wave /t rad and optical thickness τ LW . We assume a representative rocky planet scenario 5 , and plot the dayside surface temperature, T s day , nightside surface temperature, T s night , and the atmospheric temperature just above the nightside surface, T atm night . Because the atmospheric temperature on the dayside is strongly coupled to the surface via convection, T atm day ≈ ≈T s day , the difference between T s day and T atm night also shows the day-night temperature gradient in the lowest part of the atmosphere. First, it is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> that the atmospheric temperature gradient is small when t wave /t rad 10 −2 . The transition to large temperature gradients spans many orders of magnitude, but we take t wave /t rad ∼ 10 −2 as a representative value that ensures temperature gradients are large for larger values of t wave /t rad . Second, once day-night atmospheric gradients are large their magnitude additionally depends on τ LW , with optically thicker atmospheres having larger maximum temperature gradients (compare maximum difference between T s day and T atm night ). Third, because the nightside surface is in radiative equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere, the gradient in surface temperatures is at least as big as the gradient in atmospheric temperatures. However, it can be much larger in the optically thin limit because the nightside atmosphere becomes ineffective at radiatively heating the nightside surface. At low optical thickness the nightside surface is much colder than the overlying air <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10a</ref>), while at high optical thickness the nightside surface is closely tied to the overlying air temperature <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10c)</ref>.</p><p>Next, we explain why atmospheres develop large temperature gradients at t wave /t rad ∼ 10 −2 . As we showed above, the nightside temperature structure is controlled by the ratio of subsidence to radiative timescales, t sub /t rad . Here we analyze the processes that control t sub . Using the heat engine and the area ratio between upward and downward motions, we already found the pressure velocity on the nightside ω down . Equation 26 allows us to write</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">t sub = p s ω down = a χU s .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Next, we scale the surface wind speed U s from the heat engine (Equation 12)</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">U s = (T d /T eq − 1) × (1 − e −τ LW ) c p R 2 t drag t rad 1/3 × c wave , U s ≈ c p R 2/3 t drag t rad 1/3 × c wave ,<label>(29)</label></formula><p>where in the second step we assumed an optically thick atmosphere, τ LW ≥ 1, so that all incoming stellar flux goes towards driving atmospheric motion, 1 − e −τ LW ≈ 1. We also drop the dependence on the dayside temperature from T d /T eq − 1. We do so because in the optically thick limit T d is approximately given by Equation 1, so (</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">T d /T eq − 1) 1/3 ≈ (τ β LW Γ[1 + 4β] −1/4 − 1) 1/3</formula><p>which is always of order unity 6 . We combine Equations 28 and 29 and find</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">t sub = 1 χ R c p 2/3 t rad t drag 1/3 t wave<label>(30)</label></formula><p>Equation 30 gives us the subsidence time on the nightside. Day-night temperature gradients will be small if a parcel of air cools slower than it sinks, t rad &gt; t sub . Conversely, day-night temperature gradients will be large if a parcel cools faster than it sinks, t rad &lt; t sub . The threshold between these two regimes is</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">t rad ∼ t sub t rad ∼ 1 χ R c p 2/3 t rad t drag 1/3 t wave t 2/3 rad ∼ 1 χ R c p 2/3 1 t drag 1/3 t wave t rad ∼ 1 χ 3/2 R c p t wave t drag 1/2 t wave (for τ LW ≥ 1).<label>(31)</label></formula><p>We can find a similar threshold for optically thin atmospheres (τ LW &lt; 1). We note that the standard radiative timescale t rad = c p p s /(gσT 3 eq ) is the cooling timescale of an optically thick column of air. In contrast, an optically thin column of air only emits a radiative flux ∼ τ LW × σT 4 eq so its radiative cooling timescale is</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">t rad,thin = t rad τ LW .<label>(32)</label></formula><p>WTG balance <ref type="bibr">(Equation 27</ref>) in the optically thin regime is still governed by the ratio of subsidence to radiative timescales, but now t rad has to be replaced by t rad,thin . To find the subsidence timescale t sub in the optically thin limit, we note that optically thin atmospheres are also less efficient heat engines. The lower efficiency arises because, for τ LW 1, the surface re-emits most of the incoming stellar flux directly back to space and only a fraction 1 − e −τ LW = 1 − (1 − τ LW + ...) ≈ τ LW of the stellar flux is available to drive atmospheric motions. The dayside temperature T d is approximately constant in the optically thin case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>, so t sub is</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">t sub = 1 χ R c p 2/3 t rad,thin t drag 1/3 t wave .<label>(33)</label></formula><p>Equation 33 only differs from Equation 30 through the use of t rad,thin instead of t rad . Our result for large temperature gradients therefore also holds for optically thin atmospheres, once we replace t rad with t rad,thin .</p><p>To compare our result with the result for hot Jupiters, we express the criterion for an atmosphere to develop large temperature gradients in terms of the wave-to-radiative timescale ratio t wave /t rad . Day-night atmospheric temperature gradients are large once</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">t wave t rad              χ 3/2 × c p R t drag t wave 1/2 if τ LW ≥ 1, χ 3/2 τ LW × c p R t drag t wave 1/2 if τ LW &lt; 1.<label>(34)</label></formula><p>We emphasize that Equation 34 only ensures that atmospheric temperature gradients are large, but they remain significant until t wave /t rad becomes extremely small <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref>. We draw three important conclusions from Equation 34. First, in the optically thick case the right hand side is dominated by χ ≈ 1/20 (Section 5) while the other quantities do not vary much in most cases of interest. The small value of χ causes the threshold for large day-night temperature gradients to generally be much smaller than one. As a representative high mean-molecular-weight (MMW) scenario, we consider an N 2 atmosphere with T eq = 300 K. In this case c p /R = 7/2 and t drag /t wave = 1.4 (Appendix A), so temperature gradients are large when</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">t wave t rad high M M W 5 × 10 −2 .<label>(35)</label></formula><p>Our result explains why rocky planets develop large atmospheric temperature gradients at a threshold almost two orders of magnitudes smaller than what one would expect based on the results for hot Jupiters, t wave /t rad 1. Second, hot H 2 -dominated atmospheres are a notable exception to the first result and develop day-night temperature gradients at larger values of t wave /t rad . The larger threshold arises because H 2 -dominated atmospheres have larger scale heights than high-MMW atmospheres, which increases the drag time t drag . For example, we consider a H 2 atmosphere with T eq = 600 K. In this case t drag /t wave = 40 (Appendix A) so temperature gradients are large when</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">t wave t rad H2 0.2.<label>(36)</label></formula><p>The wave-to-radiative timescale threshold in this case is a factor of four larger than for high-MMW atmospheres, but it is still almost an order of magnitude smaller than the result for hot Jupiters, t wave /t rad 1. Third, optically thin atmospheres are less prone to developing day-night temperature gradients than optically thick atmospheres because optically thin atmospheres cool less effectively. Although optically thin atmospheres are also less efficient heat engines, the radiative effect dominates because t rad,thin ∝ 1/τ LW whereas t sub ∝ t</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">1/3 rad,thin ∝ 1/τ 1/3</formula><p>LW . Weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) balance therefore holds even better in optically thin atmospheres than in optically thick ones. It also explains why the stratospheres of our simulations, where the atmosphere becomes optically thin <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Robinson &amp; Catling 2012)</ref>, are much more horizontally homogeneous than the lower atmosphere <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>We can now relate the RCS model to the results in Section 3. First, when t sub /t rad 1 radiative cooling is inefficient compared to subsidence heating. In this limit sinking parcels of air on the nightside remain close to an adiabat and the RCS model reduces to the RC model 7 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows nightside surface temperatures in both models and demonstrates that the RCS model reduces to the RC model at a representative value of t wave /t rad 10 −4 (compare blue lines to black dots). Second, when t sub /t rad 1 radiative cooling is much stronger than subsidence heating. In this limit WTG balance (Eqn. 27) becomes dF/dτ ≈ 0, so the nightside is in purely radiative equilibrium and F is vertically constant. To still satisfy the nightside surface budget (Equation 21c), F has to be zero. The Schwarzschild equation <ref type="bibr">(Eqn. 19b)</ref> shows that in this case d(σT 4 )/dτ ≈ 0 which means the nightside becomes vertically isothermal with a temperature that is set by the overlying tropopause temperature T strat (τ 0 ). A lower bound for T strat (see Eqn. 20) is given by the skin temperature T skin ≡ 2 −1/4 T eq (Pierrehumbert 2011b). In the optically thin limit the nightside surface energy budget is then equal to σT 4 n = τ LW × σT 4 skin = τ LW × σT 4 eq /2, and we recover Wordsworth (2015)'s result T n = T eq (τ LW /2) 1/4 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows that the nightside temperature in the RCS model reduces to this limit at a representative value of t wave /t rad 1 (compare black square and blue line in left panel).</p><p>Up to now we have focused on slowly rotating planets a 2 /L 2 Ro &lt; 1. Next, we consider the effects of rapid rotation, and how they interact with the threshold for large day-night temperature gradients.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Rapid rotation (a 2 /L 2 Ro 1) does not have a strong effect on temperature structure unless the atmosphere is also hot or thin (twave/t rad &gt; 10 −2 ). Shown are 2D temperature and wind fields, averaged over the upper troposphere (0.3 ≤ p/ps ≤ 0.4). Rotation increases from left to right, the wave-to-radiative timescale ratio increases from top to bottom. Increased rotation changes the circulation drastically, from a day-night flow at slow rotation (left) to an equatorially superrotating jet and cold nightside vortices at rapid rotation (right). However, at low twave/t rad temperature gradients are small, even if rotation is rapid (top right). Large temperature gradients, eastward hot spot offsets, and cold nightside vortices only emerge once an atmosphere is both hot/thin and rotates rapidly (bottom right). The substellar point is located at 270 • longitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">EFFECTS OF RAPID ROTATION ON TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE</head><p>In this section we use GCM simulations to address how rapid rotation affects the circulation and temperature structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leconte et al. (2013)</ref> showed that tidally locked planets develop drastically different circulations when a 2 /L 2 Ro 1 because equatorial waves are not able to freely propagate into high latitudes once the planetary radius, a, is larger than the equatorial Rossby radius, L Ro . Rapidly rotating planets then develop standing Rossby and Kelvin wave patterns. The standing wave patterns lead to strong equatorial superrotation, an eastward offset of the equatorial hot spot, and off-equatorial cold vortices on the nightside <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Matsuno 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Showman &amp; Polvani 2011</ref>). Here we also find that the circulation regime changes at a 2 /L 2 Ro ∼ 1. However, while rapid rotation drastically alters the flow field the effect on temperature structure is small unless the atmosphere is also prone to developing strong temperature gradients, t wave /t rad O(10 −2 ).</p><p>We perform a set of GCM simulations in which we vary a 2 /L 2 Ro and t wave /t rad while keeping all other parameters fixed. We vary a 2 /L 2 Ro by changing the rotation rate Ω, and t wave /t rad by changing the surface pressure p s . All other parameters are fixed to the same values as the reference simulation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, that is, a = a ⊕ , T eq = 283K, (R, c p ) = (R, c p ) N2 , and τ LW = 1. We explore a 2 /L 2 Ro = (0.1, 0.5, 1) and t wave /t rad = (10 −3 , 10 −2 , 10 −1 ), which correspond to 2π/60 days ≤ Ω ≤ 2π/6 days and 5 bar ≤ p s ≤ 0.05 bar.</p><p>We find that rapid rotation has a large effect on the circulation, but its effect on the temperature structure is small unless t wave /t rad also exceeds the threshold t wave /t rad 5 × 10 −2 from the previous section. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows 2D maps of the circulation and temperatures in the upper atmosphere. The wind and temperatures are mass-weighted averages taken over 0.3 ≤ p/p s ≤ 0.4, and the substellar point is located at longitude λ = 270 • . Slowly rotating simulations are shown in the left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. As expected, the circulation consists of a substellar-to-antistellar flow. At small values of t wave /t rad the day-night temperature differences are small, but the atmosphere develops large daynight temperature gradients at t wave /t rad = 10 −1 , consistent with our results in Section 6. The top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows simulations with small t wave /t rad . As rotation rate increases, the atmospheric circulation changes drastically. A strong equatorial jet develops and the nightside atmosphere additionally develops standing Rossby waves in the form of off-equatorial vortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Showman &amp; Polvani 2011)</ref>. Nevertheless, as long as t wave /t rad = 10 −3 , the maximum horizontal temperature difference at a 2 /L 2 Ro = 1 only reaches 0.05T eq , or ∼ 15 K. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> underlines that day-night atmospheric temperature gradients are primarily controlled by t wave /t rad . However, the effect of rapid rotation can strongly enhance temperature gradients in the form of eastward hot spot offsets and cold nightside vortices. The slowly rotating simulation with a thin atmosphere (a 2 /L 2 Ro = 0.1, t wave /t rad = 10 −1 ; bottom left) has its hottest point located at the substellar point and a maximum horizontal temperature difference of 0.2T eq , or ∼ 65 K. In contrast, the simulation with the same value of t wave /t rad but at rapid rotation shows an eastward hot spot offset and a significantly larger maximal horizontal temperature difference of 0.4T eq , or ∼ 110 K (bottom right). In the following section we consider what our results imply for future observations.</p><p>8. IMPLICATIONS FOR OBSERVATIONS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> summarizes some implications of our results for observations of rocky exoplanets. We showed that atmospheric day-night temperature contrasts strongly depend on the parameter t wave</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">/t rad = a/( R/c p × RT eq ) × gσT 3 eq /(c p p s ) ∝ T 5/2</formula><p>eq /p s . The planetary radius a and surface gravity g vary relatively little for plausible rocky planets, which means day-night temperature differences are to first order controlled by the equilibrium temperature T eq , the surface pressure p s , and whether or not the atmosphere is made of H 2 (via R and c p ). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> we consider these parameters for a GJ 1132b-sized planet 8 with hypothetical CO 2 and H 2 atmospheres. The red region indicates when the atmosphere is hot/thin and develops large day-night atmospheric temperature gradients (Equation 34 for τ LW ≥ 1). The blue region indicates when the atmosphere is cool/thick and day-night atmospheric temperature gradients become negligible (t wave /t rad ≤ 10 −4 from Section 6). Part of the CO 2 phase space is unstable to atmospheric collapse, which occurs when the nightside surface is cold enough for CO 2 to condense. We delineate atmospheric collapse using two approaches. First, the solid black line shows the empirical fit from Wordsworth (2015), who used a GCM with full radiative transfer to compute collapse thresholds up to T eq = 367 K. Second, we use the RCS model to compute when nightside surface temperatures fall below the condensation temperature of CO 2 . To specify the optical thickness we use Equation 6 and assume τ (1 bar) = 1 and n = 1. Although we do not include non-grey effects, the RCS model (dashed black line) closely fits the GCM results (solid black line) over the range of parameters explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>. As such, we consider the RCS model appropriate for predicting atmospheric collapse (also see Section 9). We repeat a similar computation for H 2 atmospheres, and find that the entire phase space in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12b is</ref>  Figure 12. CO2 atmospheres are more likely to develop large temperature gradients than H2 atmospheres. Atmospheric daynight temperature gradients are negligible inside the blue region (twave/t rad ≤ 10 −4 ) and are large inside the red region (Eqn. 34 for τLW ≥ 1). CO2 atmospheres collapse inside the grey region [solid line: empirical fit to GCM results from Wordsworth (2015); dotted line: calculated using our RCS model]. Bottom symbols show equilibrium temperatures of two nearby rocky planets and of a hypothetical tidally locked Venus; ( * ) marks scenarios for which rotational effects would additionally be important (a 2 /L 2 Ro ≥ 1). The shown thresholds assume a GJ1132b-sized planet (a, g = 1.16a⊕, 11.7 m s −2 ).</p><p>collapse <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . The symbols at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> show equilibrium temperatures 10 of two recently-discovered rocky planets and of a hypothetical tidally locked planet at Venus' present-day orbit (Berta- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Thompson et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Motalebi et al. 2015</ref>). Finally, we found that temperature structure can be affected by rapid rotation. We mark all rapidly rotating planet scenarios with a 2 /L Ro ≥ 1 using star symbols ( * ). For these cases we expect that strong rotational effects, such as large eastward hot spot offsets or cold nightside vortices, occur inside the red region (see Section 7). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> allows us to make some tentative predictions. First, with a high MMW atmosphere like CO 2 , GJ 1132b and HD 219134b would have non-negligible day-night temperature gradients. This conclusion holds even for surface pressures as high as that of Venus (p s = 92 bar). Second, GJ 1132b and HD 219134b with CO 2 atmospheres both satisfy the criterion for rapid rotation (a 2 /L 2 Ro ≥ 1). Should observations detect a large eastward hot spot offset, it would favor surface pressures less than O(1) bar (inside the red region). Third, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12a</ref> shows that a CO 2 atmosphere with surface pressure comparable to that of Mars (p s = 6 × 10 −3 bar) would be close to collapse on GJ 1132b. We note that our collapse calculation does not account for rotational effects, and cold nightside vortices <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.11)</ref> would allow the atmosphere to collapse at even higher pressures. Fourth, if these planets managed to retain H 2 -dominated atmospheres against atmospheric escape, they would be stable against collapse and exhibit much smaller day-night temperature differences than similar CO 2 atmospheres. The increased stability and smaller temperature gradient is due to a combination of H 2 's large heat capacity c p , which increases the radiative timescale t rad (Menou 2012a), its large gas constant R, which increases the speed of atmospheric waves c wave and thus decreases the wave timescale t wave <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Heng &amp; Kopparla 2012)</ref>, and its increased scale height, which decreases the effect of friction (Appendix A). Fifth, H 2 -dominated atmospheres would be significantly less affected by rotation than CO 2 atmospheres. The smaller effect of rotation is also due to the reduced wave timescale t wave in H 2 atmospheres. For example, assuming GJ 1132b's equilibrium temperature T eq = 579K, the characteristic speed of gravity waves in a CO 2 atmosphere is c wave = R/c p × RT eq = 158m s −1 , whereas in a H 2 atmosphere c wave = 838m s −1 . It follows that the nondimensional Rossby radius, a 2 /L 2 Ro = 2Ωa/c wave , is about five times smaller in a H 2 atmosphere. Our results also imply that rocky planets with H 2 -dominated atmospheres are less likely to exhibit eastward hot spot offsets and cold nightside vortices. These predictions are qualitative because they do not consider the optical thickness τ LW , which helps set the magnitude of the day-night temperature gradient <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref>. Quantitatively interpreting an observed daynight temperature gradient also requires constraining τ LW , for example via transit spectroscopy (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot 2015)</ref>.</p><p>One way of distinguishing the scenarios in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> would thus be through combined transit spectroscopy and thermal phase curve observations with JWST. Previous feasibility studies have tended to emphasize the transit technique (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beichman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2015</ref>), here we compare the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that can be achieved by spending the same amount of JWST time on low spectral-resolution transit and broadband phase curve observations. We find that it would take about as much time to measure the broadband mid-IR phase curve of a short-period rocky exoplanet as it would to detect molecular signatures in its atmospheres through near-IR transit spectroscopy. The basic science goal for transit observations would be to detect a molecular species from its spectral imprint; a flat spectrum could alternately be a cloudy atmosphere or no atmosphere. The basic science goal for phase curve observations would be to detect the day-night flux difference of a bare rock. An observed flux difference lower than that of a bare rock would imply the presence of an atmosphere thick enough to modify the day-night temperature contrast (outside the red region in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12)</ref>. Similarly, hot/cold spot offsets would imply the presence of an atmosphere that is hot or thin enough that its thermal structure is significantly affected by rotation (see above). We consider GJ 1132b with a CO 2 -dominated atmosphere as a representative target. We assume GJ 1132b is tidally locked, which could be verified using optical phase curves with TESS (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fujii et al. 2014</ref>). We compute transit signals following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cowan et al. (2015)</ref>, but assume that spectral features in the near-IR cause an absorption difference of three scale heights and have a typical width of 0.1µm (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kaltenegger &amp; Traub 2009)</ref>.

We check our transit estimate by comparing our SNR with the detailed calculations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. (2015)</ref>, and find that we can reproduce their results up to a factor of two (not shown). We also note that our estimate of GJ 1132b's thermal emission is slightly higher than the signal in Berta- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Thompson et al. (2015)</ref>, because the observer-projected dayside temperature of a bare rock is higher than its equilibrium temperature by (8/3) 1/4 ≈ 1.28 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koll &amp; Abbot 2015)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows our results. Similar to previous estimates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cowan et al. 2015</ref>), we find that a single transit would not be sufficient to conclusively identify molecular absorption features (SNR ∼ 1). The low SNR arises largely because of the high MMW atmosphere; for comparison, a H 2 atmosphere on GJ 1132b should be detectable in a single transit with SNR ∼ 22. For a CO 2 atmosphere, 13 repeated transit observations would reduce the noise sufficiently to allow spectral features to be discerned with SNR ∼ 4. The time it takes to measure 13 repeated transits of GJ 1132b is also equal to the time it takes to measure one half-orbit phase curve (from transit to secondary eclipse). We find that the thermal emission of a bare rock would be detectable with a comparable SNR ∼ 4. We conclude that characterizing high MMW atmospheres of rocky exoplanets will require relatively large investments of JWST time. If such observations are pursued, however, then thermal phase curves are a feasible technique that would yield important complementary information about these planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koll &amp; Abbot 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The heat engine framework is well-established for Earth's atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Peixoto &amp; Oort 1984)</ref>. Similarly Goodman (2009) pointed out that hot Jupiters can be viewed as heat engines, but did not develop his insight more quantitatively. Here we have demonstrated that the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets act as heat engines, which allowed us to develop a new constraint on their day-night circulations. We also found that surface wind speeds in most of our GCM simulations are about a factor of two smaller than the value predicted by the heat engine <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref>. Because work scales with the cube of the surface wind speed, our simulations produce ∼ (1/2) 3 = 1/8 as much work as an ideal heat engine. Interestingly, Earth's atmospheric heat engine also produces about an order of magnitude less work than its ideal limit and therefore has a similar inefficiency as our dry and tidally locked simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Peixoto &amp; Oort 1984)</ref>. Our result seems to be at odds with the usual understanding that the inefficiency of Earth's atmospheric heat engine is caused by its hydrological cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pauluis et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pauluis 2010)</ref>, and also raises the question whether our scaling can be generalized to planets that are not tidally locked. We hope to address these issues in future work. Our results also strongly suggest that hot Jupiters should obey similar constraints as rocky planets. For example, using the heat engine framework it might be possible to constrain the day-night overturning circulation, which controls the vertical mixing and chemical equilibrium of hot Jupiter atmospheres. However, modeling these atmospheres as heat engines will require a better understanding of the mechanisms through which they dissipate kinetic energy, which could include magneto-hydrodynamic drag, shocks, or shear instabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Li &amp; Goodman 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Menou 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fromang et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Our results allow us to interpret previous GCM results that have not been fully explained yet. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Merlis &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref> explored Earth-like atmospheres at different rotation rates. They found that although the strength of superrotation is strongly dependent on rotation rate, day-night surface temperature gradients are mostly insensitive to rotation rate (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref>). Our results explain why: Merlis &amp; Schneider varied rotation rates while keeping the stellar flux fixed at Earth's value. Their simulations were therefore in the rapidly rotating (a 2 /L 2 Ro &gt; 1) but relatively cool/thick regime (t wave /t rad &lt; 10 −2 ) in which temperature structure is not strongly sensitive to rotation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11)</ref>.</p><p>Second, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koll &amp; Abbot (2015)</ref> we found that thermal phase curves are mainly sensitive to the nondimensional parameters t wave /t rad and τ LW . Our result only broke down for hot/thin and rapidly rotating atmospheres, t wave /t rad 10 −2 and a 2 /L 2 Ro 1. Our results here explain both the wave-to-radiative timescale threshold of t wave /t rad ∼ 10 −2 and why rotation is relatively unimportant <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs. 10 and 11)</ref>.</p><p>There are additional physical effects that might affect our conclusions. We assume broadband grey radiative transfer, but a wide range of plausible atmospheric compositions feature significant spectral window regions. As already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leconte et al. (2013) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wordsworth (2015)</ref>, window regions allow the nightside surface to cool even more effectively, which would increase day-night surface temperature gradients compared to that predicted by our grey models. At the same time, large spectral window regions would increase the atmosphere's radiative cooling timescale and thus reduce atmospheric temperature gradients, similar to the optically thin cases we discussed in Section 6. We also did not consider shortwave absorption. Shortwave absorption will shift heating to lower pressures, which would decrease the heat intake temperature of the atmospheric heat engine and reduce the atmospheric circulation strength. We therefore expect our heat engine theory to be an upper bound on wind speeds.</p><p>Many planets might be able to retain a hydrologic cycle (e.g., H 2 O inside the habitable zone, or CH 4 on Titan-like planets) against atmospheric escape and nightside collapse. Besides changing the atmosphere's radiative properties (e.g., H 2 O effectively absorbs both in the shortwave and longwave), condensation would also modify the atmospheric dynamics. Moist GCM simulations indicate that the temperature and circulation structure sketched out in <ref type="figure">Figure  8</ref> could still apply qualitatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yang et al. 2013</ref>), but with several modifications. First, latent heat transport would reduce the day-night temperature gradient compared to dry atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leconte et al. 2013</ref>). Second, moist convection would lead to thick cloud cover on the dayside and could drastically change a planet's appearance to remote observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fortney 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yang et al. 2013</ref>). Third, dry atmospheres develop strongly turbulent daysides. The friction associated with this dry convection allows the nightside temperature structure to decouple from regions of convection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, Voigt et al. 2012</ref>). In contrast, moist atmospheres such as Earth's tropics maintain an adiabatic temperature profile through deep moist convection, while the dry turbulent boundary layer is relatively shallow. We therefore expect that moist atmospheres would be less dominated by friction, and would be even better captured by WTG models similar to our radiative-convective model (Section 3).</p><p>It is an open question how many rocky planets around M-stars will actually be tidally locked. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leconte et al. (2015)</ref> found that thermal tides in relatively thick atmospheres (p s 1 bar) can prevent habitable-zone planets around early M-dwarfs from reaching a tidally locked state. Although thermal tides could limit the application of our results to planets on longer-period orbits, they are less likely to apply to planets around late M-dwarfs or hot exoplanets like GJ 1132b. Moreover, given that rocky exoplanets are extremely common, we also expect that future discoveries will find rocky exoplanets in a wide range of rotational states. Optical phase curves could constrain the rotation rates of these planets without relying on models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fujii et al. 2014</ref>), while future theoretical work should consider the connection between the tidally locked limit we considered here and planets in higher-order spin-orbit resonances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have developed a series of theoretical models to understand the basic temperature structure and large-scale circulations of tidally locked planets with dry atmospheres. These models are able to capture and predict many fundamental aspects of much more complex GCM simulations, including the atmospheric temperature structure, dayside and nightside surface temperatures, as well as large-scale wind speeds. We draw the following conclusions from our work:</p><p>4. Like hot Jupiters, day-night atmospheric temperature gradients of rocky exoplanets become large once parcels of air take longer to subside than to cool radiatively. Unlike hot Jupiters, the timescale for subsidence on rocky planets is severely increased by the limited heat engine efficiency and the areal asymmetry between convection and subsidence. Rocky planets develop large day-night atmospheric temperature gradients when</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">t wave t rad          χ 3/2 × c p R t drag t wave 1/2 if τ LW ≥ 1, χ 3/2 τ LW × c p R t drag t wave 1/2 if τ LW &lt; 1.<label>(37)</label></formula><p>Optically thin atmospheres cool inefficiently, which makes them less likely to develop large temperature gradients than optically thick atmospheres.</p><p>5. Rapid rotation (a 2 /L 2 Ro 1) only has a strong influence on temperature structure if the wave-to-radiative timescale exceeds the above ratio, t wave /t rad O(10 −2 ). Once rotation is important its effects cannot be ignored for a detailed understanding of a planet's atmosphere, including its thermal phase curve signature and the potential for atmospheric collapse.</p><p>6. Short-period rocky exoplanets with high MMW atmospheres and surface pressures of 1 bar will likely exhibit significant day-night temperature gradients. Thermal phase curve observations of such planets will require similar amounts of JWST time as transit observations.</p><p>Our work was completed with resources provided by the University of Chicago Research Computing Center. We thank Malte Jansen and Feng Ding for insightful discussions, and an anonymous reviewer for their feedback. D.D.B. Koll was supported by a William Rainey Harper dissertation fellowship. cool temperature, T eq = 300K, and a standard value for the drag coefficient, C D = 10 −3 , we find t drag = 1.4t wave . Variations in the planetary radius a or in the drag coefficient C D do not affect this result much. For example, for a neutrally buoyant boundary layer C D = [k vk / log(z/z 0 )] 2 , where k kv is the von Karman constant, z is the height above the surface and z 0 is the surface roughness length. Because C D only depends logarithmically on z 0 , the drag timescale is not very sensitive to the surface properties. This means we expect friction to generally be an important process inside the boundary layer of rocky planets.</p><p>The most important exception is a hot H 2 atmosphere, through its effect on the scale height H. For example, repeating the above calculation with a hot H 2 -dominated atmosphere, R = R H2 and T eq = 600 K, we find t drag = 40t wave . This means surface friction is far less effective in H 2 atmospheres than in high MMW atmospheres.</p></div>

APPENDIX: NUMERICAL SOLUTION FOR THE RCS MODEL</head><p>The boundary conditions of the radiative-convective-subsiding (RCS) model are specified at two different points, the tropopause and the surface. Instead of matching both boundaries simultaneously we first guess a value of the nightside OLR, F (τ 0 ). Given a value of F (τ 0 ), we can solve for all variables (T d , τ 0 , T (τ ), and F (τ )). Our guess will in general not satisfy the nightside surface energy budget (Equation 21c), so we iterate until F (τ LW ) = 0 is satisfied. To iterate we use a bisection method, where the nightside OLR is bounded by 0 ≤ F (τ 0 ) ≤ σT 4 eq (the limits correspond to a planet with zero and perfect day-night heat redistribution).</p><p>We proceed as follows. Given a value of F (τ 0 ), Equations 25 and 22 can be rewritten as an implicit equation for τ 0 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">2 + τ 0 2 = 1 + τ 0 2 τ LW τ 0 4β e −(τ LW −τ0) + τ LW τ0 τ τ LW 4β e −(τ −τ0) dτ + F (τ 0 ) σT 4 eq (C8)</formula><p>We solve for τ 0 using, again, a bisection method, where we note that 0 &lt; τ 0 &lt; τ LW .

We then have three boundary conditions that are specified at the upper boundary, the guessed F (τ 0 ), dF (τ 0 )/dτ = 0, and T (τ 0 ). We use SciPy's VODE solver to integrate the WTG and Schwarzschild equations <ref type="bibr">(Equations 19</ref>) down to the nightside surface, which gives us the net surface flux F (τ LW ). We iterate until we satisfy the nightside surface budget, F (τ LW ) = 0. After having solved for T (τ ) we find the nightside surface temperature T n using the nightside surface energy budget (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson &amp; Catling 2012)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">σT 4 n = F − (τ LW ) = σT 4 eq τ 0 2 e −(τ LW −τ0) + τ LW τ0 σT (τ ) 4 e −(τ −τ0) dτ .<label>(C11)</label></formula></div>
