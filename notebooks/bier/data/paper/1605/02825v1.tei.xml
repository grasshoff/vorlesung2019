			<abstract>
				<p>We present astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)-the first large-scale demonstration of a fully automated transiting planet validation procedure. Out of 7056 KOIs, we determine that 1935 have probabilities &lt;1% to be astrophysical false positives, and thus may be considered validated planets. 1284 of these have not yet been validated or confirmed by other methods. In addition, we identify 428 KOIs likely to be false positives that have not yet been identified as such, though some of these may be a result of unidentified transit timing variations. A side product of these calculations is full stellar property posterior samplings for every host star, modeled as single, binary, and triple systems. These calculations use vespa, a publicly available Python package able to be easily applied to any transiting exoplanet candidate.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler mission has revolutionized our understanding of exoplanets. Among many other important discoveries, Kepler has identified several previously unsuspected features of planetary systems, such as the prevalence of planets between the size of Earth and Neptune, and a population of very compact multiple-planet systems. And perhaps most notably, it has enabled for the first time estimates of the occurrence rates of small planets (1 R ⊕ ) out to orbits of about one year (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burke et al. 2015</ref>). It is important to remember, however, that these revolutionary discoveries depend intimately on another revolution-how to interpret transiting planet candidate signals in the absence of unambiguous positive confirmation of their veracity.</p><p>Before Kepler, every survey searching for transiting exoplanets demanded that a candidate signal be verified as a true planet via radial velocity (RV) measurement of its mass. This would involve a series of follow-up observations in order to weed out astrophysical false positive scenarios-typically stellar eclipsing binaries in various configurations. However, following this model has been largely impossible for Kepler because of the quantity and character of the planet candidates (thousands of mostly small-planet candidates around relatively faint stars). There have been a small number of Kepler planets with masses measured by RVs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Santerne et al. 2015</ref>), and significantly more that have been confirmed as planets by measurement of transit tim-ing variations (TTVs) in multi-planet systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ford et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Steffen et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stef- fen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jontof-Hutter et al. 2015</ref>), but this still leaves the vast majority of candidates inaccessible to dynamical confirmation.</p><p>This situation has inspired the development of probabilistic validation as a new approach to evaluating transit candidates. The principle of probabilistic validation is to demonstrate that all conceivable astrophysical false positive scenarios are negligibly likely to be the cause of a transit candidate signal compared to the explanation of a planet transiting the presumed target star. The BLENDER method pioneered this approach and has validated many Kepler candidates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipping et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Torres et al. 2015</ref>). More recently, the PASTIS analysis suite has been introduced ( <ref type="bibr">Díaz et al. 2014</ref>) and used to validate both Kepler and CoRoT candidates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Santerne et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Moutou et al. 2014</ref>). An alternative validation approach for candidates in multipleplanet systems has also been applied to a large number of Kepler systems based on the general argument that it is unlikely to see multiple false-positive signals in the same Kepler light curve ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>), resulting resulting in validations of over 800 planets with 99% confidence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). This methodology differs from the BLENDER/PASTIS approach in two significant ways: (a) it is applicable only to planets in multi-planet systems, and (b) it relies on broad-brush general arguments rather than analyzing the details of candidate signals individually.</p><p>While they have both proven useful for the purposes of validating individual candidates of particular interest, neither BLENDER nor PASTIS is designed for fully automated batch processing of large numbers of candidates. Morton (2012) describes a computationally simpler planet validation procedure designed for exactly such a purpose, based on the idea of describing eclipse light curves as simple trapezoids and simulating realistic populations of astrophysical false positives. This procedure has also been used in the literature to validate a number of Kepler planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muirhead et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Daw- son et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swift et al. 2013</ref>), and has also been applied to a number of candidates found by the K2 mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Montet et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Becker et al. 2015</ref>). The code that implements this procedure is publicly available in the Python module vespa 8 <ref type="bibr">(Morton 2015b)</ref>.</p><p>This work presents results of applying vespa en masse to the entire Kepler catalog. This is both the first time that most Kepler candidates have been individually analyzed to assess false positive probability and the first time that a detailed automated planet validation calculation has been applied on such a large scale. Section 2 describes the methods used, Section 3 describes the data set, Section 4 presents the results, Section 5 compares these results with observational studies, and Section 6 contains concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>In this work, we apply the fully automated FPPcomputing procedure described in Morton (2012, hereafter M12) to 7056 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs; see Section 3 for details). While we refer the reader to M12 for a detailed description of the method, we outline it briefly in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">False Positive Probabilities</head><p>The basic idea of vespa is to assign probabilities to different hypotheses that might describe a transiting planet candidate signal. If {H i } is the set of all considered hypotheses, the probability for any given model i is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pr (H i ) = π i L i j π j L j ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where π i is the "hypothesis prior" and L i is the "hypothesis likelihood" <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The prior represents how intrinsically probable the hypothesized scenario is to exist, and the likelihood represents how closely the shape of the observed transit signal matches with the expected shape of a signal produced by the hypothesis.</p><p>The vespa procedure models an eclipse signal as a simple trapezoid, parametrized by depth δ, total duration T , and shape parameter T /τ , where τ is the "ingress/egress" duration (such that a completely Vshaped transit has T /τ = 2). For the transit signal being evaluated, the joint posterior probability density function (PDF) of these shape parameters is sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using the emcee sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). This allows the likelihood for each hypothesis to be determined by simulating a physically realistic population of the hypothesized astrophysical scenario and using this population to define the PDF for the trapezoidal parameters under the hypothesis. The likelihood is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L i = p sig (θ) p i (θ) dθ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where θ is the vector of trapezoidal shape parameters, p sig is the posterior PDF of the signal, and p i is the PDF for the parameters under hypothesis i. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The hypotheses supported by vespa are the following: unblended eclipsing binary (EB), hierarchical-triple eclipsing binary (HEB), chance-aligned background/foreground eclipsing binary (BEB), and transiting planet (Pl). 11 In this work, we also implement "double-period" versions of each of the stellar false positive scenarios, acknowledging the possibility that if an eclipsing binary has similar primary and secondary eclipse depths, then it might be mischaracterized as a primary-only transiting planet signal at twice the orbital period (especially if diluted). We note that the determination of the diluted eclipse depth of all these blended scenarios assumes that the light from the blended system is fully contained within the target's photometric aperture. That is, these scenarios do not account for the possibility that only a small fraction of the light from a nearby contaminating star might be in the aperture, many of which have already been identified via other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bryson et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref>. Observational constraints are incorporated in two different ways.</p><p>First, photometric (or spectroscopic/asteroseismic) measurements of the target star are folded into the population simulations of each hypothesis (see Section 2.2). All other constraints are applied to narrow down which simulated instances of each scenario may be counted in the final prior and likelihood evalulations; for example, only blended eclipsing binaries with secondary eclipse depths shallower than the observed limits contribute to the construction of the p i trapezoidal shape parameter PDF. For the "double-period" scenarios, we require the primary and secondary eclipse signals to have depths within 3-σ of each other, where σ is defined as the fitted uncertainty in the trapezoid-model depth of the candidate signal.</p><p>The steps vespa takes to calculate the FPP of a transit signal are thus as follows:</p><p>1. Generate posterior samples for the transit signal under the trapezoid model, using MCMC.</p><p>2. Generate population simulations for each hypothesis scenario being considered (conditioned on available observations of the target star; see Section 2.2).</p><p>3. Fit each simulated eclipse in each scenario with a trapezoid model (using least-squares optimization).</p><p>4. Evaluate priors and likelihoods for each hypothesis, taking into account all available observational constraints.</p><p>5. Use Equation (1) to calculate the posterior probability for each scenario.</p><p>10 L i may be seen to be the "evidence" or "marginalized likelihood" of the trapezoidal model under hypothesis i, with p sig being the likelihood and p i being the prior, integrated over the θ parameter space. But for clarity, and for continuity with previous publications, we continue to call L i the "likelihood" for hypothesis i.</p><p>11 We note that we do not consider "blended transiting planet" false positive scenarios, either due to physically associated or chance-aligned companions. See Section 4.6 for more discussion.</p><p>To quantify uncertainty due to the Monte Carlo nature of this procedure, vespa is also able to repeat these calculations any desired number of times by bootstrap resampling (with replacement) of the simulated populations, and recalculating the likelihoods based on the resampled populations. This mitigates the chances for rare outliers in a simulation to significantly affect the calculated FPP.</p><p>We note that a built-in weakness of model selection is that it assumes that the set of models being considered is comprehensive. This could in principle lead to a situation where one model is strongly preferred over all other models, but even that model is a poor explanation of the data-in this work, this could lead to improperly validated planets. There are two general strategies to try to address this issue. The first is to somehow quantify the absolute goodness-of-fit of the models, and require that a validated planet pass some threshold test. The other strategy, that we adopt here, is to expand the set of models to be more comprehensive. In order to do this, we introduce two artificial models: "boxy" and "long."</p><p>The "boxy" likelihood function is a step function at some minimum value of T /τ (zero below this threshold, and constant above), and constant throughout the space of the other trapezoidal parameters. Similarly, the likelihood of the "long" model is a step function at some minimum threshold value of duration T . These thresholds are set relative to the simulated trapezoidal shapes of the planet model: the T /τ threshold is the maximum value from the simulated planet population, and the T threshold is the 99% percentile of simulated planet population values. We also choose the model priors for these artificial models to be low, reflecting that we expect only a small number of signals to be unexplained by any of the astrophysical scenarios: the number that we choose for each of these models is 5 × 10 −5 , corresponding to an expectation that there may be ∼10 such signals among the ∼200,000 Kepler targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stellar Properties</head><p>The most substantial difference between the current implementation of vespa and the procedure documented in M12 is how stellar properties are treated. Previously, either the target star's mass and radius were explicitly provided, or they were randomly generated according to the stellar population expected along the line of sight by the TRIdimensional modeL of thE GALaxy (TRI-LEGAL) Galactic stellar population synthesis tool, but constrained to agree with some observed color(s) of the star (e.g. J − K), to within some specified tolerance. This strategy was used both to generate the host stars for the transiting planet model and the binary and triple stars for the EB and HEB false positive models.</p><p>The new method now used by vespa uses the isochrones Python module (Morton 2015a) to fold in observational constraints on the host star. At its core, isochrones performs 3-D linear interpolation in mass-[Fe/H]-age parameter space for a given stellar model grid. This method of stellar modeling for FPP calculation debuted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Montet et al. (2015)</ref> and is explained there in more detail. Instead of randomly generating stars (or binary or triple systems of stars) from a predefined distribution and culling them to approximately agree with observed colors, all available constraints on </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A , M A &gt; 0.1 Secondary mass M B ∝ (M B /M A ) 0.3 , 0.1 &lt;= M B &lt; M A Tertiary mass M C ∝ (M C /M A ) 0.3 , 0.1 &lt;= M C &lt; M B Age [Gyr] U (1, 15) a [Fe/H] 0.8 0.15 N (0.016, 0.15) + 0.2 0.22 N (−0.15, 0.22) b A V [mag] U (0, A V,max ) c Distance d ∝ d 2 a</formula><p>The age range for the Dartmouth stellar model grids used. b Double-Gaussian fit to measured local stellar metallicity distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hayden et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Casagrande et al. 2011</ref>). c Maximum allowed value is the Galactic extinction at infinity calculated along the star's line of sight, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schlegel et al.

This fit is done using multi-modal nested sampling, implemented with MultiNest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Feroz et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Feroz et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Feroz et al. , 2013</ref>, via the PyMultiNest wrapper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buchner et al. 2014</ref>). Monte Carlo samples of stellar properties for the population simulations are then drawn directly from these posterior samples.</p><p>As a result, vespa creates full posterior samplings of the physical properties of the host star, modeled as a single, binary, and triple star system, as a by-product of the FPP calculation. Parameters directly fitted for in this process are stellar mass, age, [Fe/H], A V extinction, and distance. For binary and triple fits, secondary and/or tertiary mass parameters are added, with all other parameters assumed to be the same among all components. Photometric observations upon which these fits are conditioned are assumed to be the sum of all components. If spectroscopic and/or asteroseismic measurements are used (e.g., constraints on effective temperature or stellar surface gravity), they are assumed to relate to only the primary star. Priors used in these fits are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>-notably, we use a prior on [Fe/H] based on a double-Gaussian fit to the local metallicity distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hayden et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Casagrande et al. 2011</ref>). Posterior chains of all other stellar parameters of interest (e.g., temperature, surface gravity, radius, etc.) are derived from the chains of fitting parameters by evaluting the stellar models using isochrones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DATA AND CONSTRAINTS</head><p>The goal of this work is to calculate the FPP for every KOI, regardless of classification as CONFIRMED, CAN-DIDATE, or FALSE POSITIVE. As such, we begin with a list of 7470 KOIs from the Q1-Q17 DR24 table at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) Exoplanet Archive (the most recent available uniform catalog). We then gather ancillary data and constraints from various sources in order to enable the vespa calculation: 6. Centroid uncertainty information from the NExScI Exoplanet Archive: we assume that the allowed "exclusion" radius for a blend scenario is 3× the uncertainty in the fitted centroid position (the koi_dicco_msky_err column in the Archive table). We floor this value at 0. 5, to prevent unrealistically small exclusion radii. If this quantity is not available from the Archive we set a default exclusion radius of 4 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1.</formula><p>7. The maximum secondary eclipse depth allowed by the Kepler photometry. This quantity is derived by searching the phased-folded KOI light curve for the deepest signal at any other phase other than that of the primary transit. This "model-shift uniqueness test" is described in both Section 3.2.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rowe et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Coughlin et al. (2015a)</ref>, and the values of these metrics for the Q1-Q17 DR24 release will soon be published ( <ref type="bibr">Coughlin et al. 2015, submitted)</ref>. The maximum secondary depth we use is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">δ max = δ sec + 3σ sec ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where δ sec is the fitted depth and σ sec is the uncertainty on that depth (including red noise). As the DR24 pipeline uses two different detrending methods, we calculate δ max and σ max using both methods and take the maximum between the two. When these metrics are not available for a particular KOI, we default to 10× the uncertainty in the Kepler pipeline measured transit depth (koi_depth_err1).</p><p>As explained in the vespa documentation, we first specify this ancillary data in a star.ini and fpp.ini file for each KOI, and then for each we run the command-line script calcfpp. This end-to-end calculation (which includes the isochrones fits for single-, double-, and triplestar models) takes approximately 30 minutes per KOI on a single core, allowing the entire set to be calculated in approximately one day on the Princeton Univeristy "Tigress" computing cluster, using 200 cores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>The results of the vespa calculations are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5 and Table 6</ref>, and are discussed in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Stellar Properties</head><p>As discussed in Section 2.2, vespa fits for stellar properties as part of its FPP-calculating procedure, using the isochrones package. Thus, we obtain posterior samplings of the physical properties of each KOI as a side effect of this batch calculation, a result of general interest independent of FPP. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> presents summarized results of these single-star fits. While vespa also fits double-and triple-star models for each KOI, these are of less general interest and so we do not present them separately.</p><p>FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 compare the estimated effective temperatures, metallicities, and radii derived in this work to those independently determined for (or compiled by) the official Kepler stellar properties catalog ( <ref type="bibr">Huber et al. 2014, hereafter H14)</ref>. While there is largely general agreement, there are also some discrepancies, highlighting some difficulties of estimating physical stellar properties.</p><p>In particular, we note that for stars which H14 list as T eff &lt; 4000 K, isochrones predicts systematically hotter temperatures. Many of the H14 properties for these stars are taken from <ref type="bibr">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013, D13)</ref>. Those properties were determined by trying to match the grizJHK photometry of a grid of model stars from the Dartmouth models, supplemented by some interpolation. D13 also imposed priors on <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and the height of stars above the plane of the Galaxy. To validate their methodology, D13 compare their results for 26 nearby stars to the masses predicted for those stars by combining parallax measurements with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Delfosse et al. (2000)</ref> relation between mass and absolute K-band magnitude. While they find general good agreement, D13 does note that their masses are on average about 5% lower than the Delfosse-predicted masses. Our estimated masses for these stars are typically ∼10-15% higher than those estimated by D13.</p><p>The same data (grizJHK photometry) and the same stellar models (Dartmouth) were used for both this work and D13, raising the question of the origin of the systematic differences between these methods. The primary origin of this discrepancy appears to be the fact that isochrones performs a full multi-modal posterior exploration of the stellar parameter space, marginalizing over the unknown A V extinction in the process, while D13 uses rather a fixed 1 mag of V -band extinction per 1000 pc and selects the maximum-likelihood match to the grid of models. As we allow for a maximum extinction up to the measured A V extinction at infinity, not explicitly tied to distance, this typically allows for slightly hotter stars with slightly more extinction than was permitted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013)</ref>.</p><p>The other significant discrepancy between the isochrones results and H14 is among evolved stars, as seen in the lower panel of FIG. 2. Many of these stars have densities measured via asteroseismology, and isochrones does not unambiguously identify all of them as evolved. However, it should be noted that we do in fact identify over half of them as probably significantly evolved-this is made possible by the multi-modal posterior sampling of MultiNest used by isochrones. In addition, as the middle panel of <ref type="figure">FIG. 2</ref> shows, even for stars not positively identified as evolved by H14, isochrones often allows for a significant range of stellar radiusalso desirable behavior, as H14 estimates the properties for many of these using only broad-band photometry as well, which means their true nature is not securely known. The need for caution when estimating the radii of KOI host stars has also been emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bastien et al. (2014)</ref>, who find from photometric "flicker" measurements that a significant number of FGK KOI hosts may be slightly evolved.</p><p>We emphasize that stellar parameter estimation is not the central goal of this work, nor are the FPP results very sensitive to the exact estimated stellar properties. The exception to this would be if the stellar density estimate is significantly mis-estimated, which would be the case if a star is not properly identified as evolved. However, we note that of the 730 KOIs with host stars &gt;2 R at the NExScI Archive, 502 of them already have FALSE POSI-TIVE designations; additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sliski &amp; Kipping (2014)</ref> find a large false positive rate for KOIs with evolved host stars. Given all of these considerations, we believe that potential systematic issues with stellar property determinations in various corners of parameter space do not strongly affect the main results, which are the astrophysical false positive probabilities of thousands of KOIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">False Positive Probabilities</head><p>Of the 7470 KOIs in the Q1-Q17 DR24 table at the NExScI Exoplanet Archive, vespa successfully calculates the FPP for 7056. Section 4.7 contains detailed explanations of the failure reasons for the 414 KOIs for which we do not present vespa results. FPPs and their uncertainties are determined as the mean and standard deviations of 10 bootstrap recalculations of the initially simulated populations for each KOI (as described in Section 2.1). These results are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>. The median fractional FPP uncertainty for KOIs with 0.001 &lt; FPP &lt; 0.1 (within an order of magnitude of the validation threshold) is about 12%, and this distribution is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">FIG. 3</ref>.</p><p>In order to properly interpret these results, it is necessary to understand the range of applicability of the vespa calculation. First of all, this method selects between different specific explanations for the transit-like signal, and cannot comment on whether the signal might be caused by stellar variability or an instrumental false alarm. Thus, vespa results on low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) candidates that are not clearly transit-like must be viewed with caution. This being said, the reason for including the artificial "boxy" and "long" models in the model selection calculation (Section 2.1) is to flag signals that do not fit well with any of the astrophysical eclipse models-in fact, the "long" model is preferred (&gt; 50%) by 526 KOIs that are already dispositioned as FALSE POSITIVE.</p><p>Additionally, an important constraint used in the FPP calculation is the allowed sky area inside which a blended false positive may live. As described in Section 3, this value is taken to be three times the uncertainty on the fitted centroid position from the pixel-level data. However, many KOIs have already been identified to be blended binary false positives displaced from the target star. Some of these are found by detecting significant centroid offsets in the pixel-level data-in these cases, vespa treating the confusion radius simply as the uncertainty in the centroid position will clearly give a misleading result. Other displaced false positives have been identified as originating from displaced stars by finding KOIs with matching periods and epochs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coughlin et al. 2014</ref>), and often the "parents" of these signals are outside the pixel masks, and so unable to be detected via centroidmeasuring methods. In these cases as well, the vespa assumptions break down, and the FPP calculations will not be valid.</p><p>To summarize, the results presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> are strictly reliable only for KOIs that have already strongly passed the other Kepler vetting tests, and that are not indicated to be clearly poor fits to all the proposed hypotheses. The first cut for this is the KOI disposition: FALSE POSITIVE indicates failure of one or more of these tests (and thus probable invalidity of the vespa calculation). However, because of the generally permissive philosophy of the Kepler dispositioning, not all CANDIDATE KOIs have the same level of reliability in their disposition, due an "innocent until proven guilty" philosophy. That is, something is not identified as a FALSE POSITIVE unless there is positive confirmation of false positive status.</p><p>In particular, when pixel-level analysis fails to determine whether the signal is indeed coming from the target star because of low SNR, such a KOI will still receive CAN-DIDATE disposition. Therefore, the vespa-calculated FPP may be considered most reliable only when a KOI is designated a CANDIDATE (or CONFIRMED) and has large enough SNR to enable secure positional determination. In addition, for greatest reliability we also require a signal's multiple-event statistic (MES; equivalend to SNR) to be greater than 10, in order to avoid low-SNR signals that might be caused by light-curve systematics.</p><p>To enable interpretation, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> thus contains the current KOI disposition, MES, and the results of the positional probability calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryson &amp; Morton (2015)</ref> <ref type="figure">. FIG. 4</ref> shows FPPs for all KOIs passing the following criteria:</p><p>• Dispositioned CANDIDATE or CONFIRMED at the NExScI archive,</p><p>• MES &gt; 10, indicating the signal is unlikely to be caused by systematic noise in the light curve, and</p><p>• Probability &gt; 0.99 to be on the target star, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryson &amp; Morton (2015)</ref>, along with a positional probability "score" &gt; 0.3 (indicating a reliable result).</p><p>These selections leave 2857 KOIs for which the vespa results can be considered most reliable; this is true even without giving any "multiplicity boost" to multi-KOI systems for the increased transit probability of subsequent planets once one planet transits in a coplanar system. Also, large candidates typically have high FPPs, in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Santerne et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Santerne et al. (2015)</ref>. And finally, the mean FPPs are very consistent with the a priori predictions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morton &amp; Johnson (2011)</ref> and with the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Unidentified Ephemeris Matches?</head><p>One potential concern worth addressing in some detail, before deciding which planets to validate based on the vespa calculations, is the possibility of false positives caused by distant contamination but not identified through the "period-epoch match" (PEM) technique used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref>, due to the fact that not all stars in the Kepler field were monitored by the mission. We thus estimate here the probability that a CAN-DIDATE KOI to which vespa assigns a low FPP might still be caused by such a scenario.</p><p>In the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI table used as the basis for this work, 980 KOIs were identified as PEMs. Of these, 187 were not identified as false positives by any other method. Only 15 of these 187 survived all the quality cuts described in Section 4.2. And of these 15, only 3 have FPP &lt; 0.01. (See Section 5.3 for an example of a KOI caused by a "column anomaly" effect that went unidentified by the Kepler pipeline but to which vespa assigned a high FPP.) Thus, we expect only about 0.3% (3/980) of as-yet unidentified distant-contamination FPs to end up with FPP &lt; 0.01 according to vespa. As the fraction of false positives from pixel contamination but unidentified as PEMs among the entire KOI sample is estimated to be something around 23% <ref type="bibr">(Cough- lin et al. 2014</ref>), we estimate that there remains a small (∼0.06%) residual FPP for all KOIs, even when the vespa-calculated FPP is negligibly tiny.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Validation of 1284 new planets</head><p>While the FPP below which to claim planet validation is clearly an arbitrary choice, there is precedent to using As there is significant interest in identifying potentially habitable planets, <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> lists the properties of 9 CAN-DIDATE KOIs newly validated by this work that may fall within the optimistic habitable zones of their host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kopparapu et al. 2013</ref>), according to the stellar properties reported by the DR24 table at the NExScI Archive. We note that while more detailed follow-up observations (imaging and spectroscopy) have been taken for each of these targets, we make no attempt here to characterize these systems in detail. However, we do note that high-resolution imaging of KOI-2418 and KOI-3010 reveal that these two host stars have close companions that may or may not change the habitable nature of the planets (e.g., if the planets happen to transit the secondary star instead of the primary). Additionally, analysis of high-resolution spectroscopy will solidify the properties of all these host stars, affecting the habitable zone boundaries. We thus emphasize that this list is neither complete nor final, serving only to draw attention to new validations of interest rather than to be a definitive statement on potential habitability. We also note that based solely on the properties in the DR24 table, KOI-5475.01 (listed as having a 448-day orbital period) should also be included in this list of potentially habitable-zone planets. However, as explained in Coughlin et al. (2015b, Section 5.5.4), this particular KOI actually has a 224-day period, making its insolation too high to be within the habitable zone; we have thus excluded it from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Likely False Positives</head><p>In addition to the confident validations, we identify 428 KOIs that currently have CANDIDATE disposition but for which vespa calculates FPP &gt; 0.9; these KOIs are likely to be false positives. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">As FIG. 7</ref> shows, many of these newly identified false positives have large radiithis is again because of the dispositioning philosophy adopted by the Kepler team, which does not use any cut in transit depth or inferred "planet" size to identify FALSE POSITIVES. To identify these likely false positives from the vespa calculations, we do not require CANDIDATES to obey the same selections we used to ensure a clean sample for validation. This is because even if a signal has characteristics such that a low vespa FPP would not be sufficient to validate it, a high vespa FPP is still sufficient to cast doubt on its planetary nature. One final note about these calculations is that unidentified transit timing variations (TTVs) will increase the FPP of a transit signal, as the shape of the folded light curve will be distorted, typically resulting in a longer signal which a trapezoid model will also identify as more Vshaped. While we have analyzed light curves correcting for known TTVs when available, we have also undoubtedly missed many systems with as-yet-unspecified TTV signals. This means that a large FPP may be simply an indication of unidentified TTVs rather than an astrophysical false positive, especially in multi-planet systems, which should overall have a very low false positive rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). It is thus probable that despite multi-KOIs having lower FPPs than singles <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>, even these relatively low FPPs are inflated by the effect of TTVs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> lists whether known TTVs were accounted for when constructing the folded transit light curve for each KOI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Blended Transiting Planets?</head><p>In this work, the only astrophysical false positive scenarios we consider are eclisping binary stars (EB, HEB, BEB, and the double-period versions thereof). Previous work studying Kepler false positive rates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>) has also considered the "blended transiting planet" to be a false positive-i.e., a fainter companion star hosting a transiting planet larger than what would be inferred if it were transiting the target star. Because we do not consider such a scenario to be a false positive, the vespa analysis presented here does not quantify its probability. As a result, we are not able to unambiguously determine the radii of the planets we validate-all the planet radii listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> are based on the assumption that the planet transits the target star and that the target star is unblended. If the target star is actually a member of an unresolved binary system (as a significant fraction of KOIs undoubtedly are), then the true planet radius will be larger (significantly larger if transiting a fainter companion). This was indeed the motivation for <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref> to consider the "blended transiting planet" as a false positive; part of the goal of that work was to compute the planet occurrence rates in different radius bins. However, trying to distinguish between single and binary target star configurations is beyond the scope of this work; we thus follow the precedent of Lissauer et al. (2014, especially Section 5) by acknowledging the potential for substantial radius uncertainties among the validated planet sample while nevertheless defending the validations themselves as robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Failure Modes</head><p>We were not able to successfully run vespa on all of the KOIs. The various reasons for these occasional failures are detailed below.</p><p>1. 28 KOIs did not receive MCMC modeling.

For 39 KOIs, the orbital period and stellar properties of the candidate imply the orbit to be within its host star's Roche limit. This usually happens when the host star is estimated to be a giant, and these situations are nearly always false positives.</p><p>The numbers in this list correspond to the numbers in the "failure" column in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">COMPARISON WITH FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONAL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDIES</head><p>One of the difficulties with probabilistic validation is that, by necessity, it is typically invoked when no other method of follow-up confirmation is possible. It can therefore be difficult to find ways to compare the results of a calculation such as vespa to any known observational ground-truth, or to "validate the validations." However, because so much follow-up observational effort has gone into Kepler candidates over the last few years, there actually are two different datasets that do provide such information for relatively small subsets of candidates. Here, we discuss the results of vespa calculations for these candidates and the impliciations for the reliability of the vespa framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Spitzer photometry</head><p>The first of these datasets is from <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2015)</ref>, who observe the transits of 50 Kepler candidates with the Spitzer Space Telescope in order to observationally constrain the FP rate. The idea behind these observations is that a blended EB false positive will often show a color-dependent transit depth, and so comparing the candidate depths measured by Kepler to those measured in the infrared by Spitzer would give an idea of how likely a signal is to be a false positive. The results of their analysis suggest that fewer than 8% of their observed candidates are likely to be false positives. Of these 50 candidates, vespa on its own calculates FPP &gt; 0.1 for four. Two of these (KOI-103.01 and KOI-248.02) are systems with known significant TTVs; the other two (KOI-247.01 and KOI-555.02) are likely false positives, with FPPs of 0.90 and 0.81, respectively. For all but two of the remaining candidates, vespa gives FPP &lt; 0.01. The false positive rates calculated in <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2015)</ref> are also based on probabilistic arguments very similar to Morton &amp; Johnson (2011) and thus are not quite candidates for "ground-truth" comparison, but the lack of transit chromaticity and the agreements between these two independent studies are certainly supportive of the vespa results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Radial-velocity monitoring of large candidates</head><p>A much more independent and powerful test data set has recently become available in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Santerne et al. (2015)</ref>, which presented the results of a long-term RV-monitoring campaign targeting 129 Kepler giantplanet candidates. Of these, they confirm 45 to be planets and identify 48 as eclipsing binaries, 15 as contaminating EBs (CEBs), and 3 as brown dwarfs. They are unable to determine the nature of the remaining 18. These results imply a relatively high FP rate among giant-planet candidates, possibly near 50%, which sounds potentially concerning, although we reiterate that KOIs are not ruled FALSE POSITIVES based on their transit depth or inferred size alone. Additionally, when we look at the vespa results on this sample, we see very good agreement between our results and the RV-detected "ground truth" <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 4)</ref>. Notably, confirmed planets show a mean FPP of about 10% and a median of much less than 1%, while confirmed EBs (CEBs) show a mean FPP of 75% (78%) and a median of 97% (99%). The three brown dwarfs also show low FPPs, which is understandable because vespa doesn't pretend to predict anything about the mass of the companion, and BDs are essentially the same size as giant planets. It is also instructive to investigate the four cases where vespa computes high FPPs (&gt;0.5) for confirmed planets. Three of these (KOI-377.01, KOI-1426.02 and KOI-1474.01) have significant TTVs, and one is a grazing eclipse (KOI-614.01). KOI-1474.01 is also on a highly eccentric orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dawson et al. 2012</ref>), in addition to its TTVs, which also contributes to its high FPP. Overall, this comparison powerfully demonstrates the reliability of the vespa calculation, showing that even in a population of candidates that include many false positives, it is able to effectively identify which are true planets and which are not.  We also briefly discuss another case of individual interest. KOI-6705.01, a 0.99 d signal around a mid M-dwarf star, was identified as a KOI of possible interest by <ref type="bibr">Gai- dos et al. (2015)</ref>. After significant follow-up observations and detailed full-frame image analysis, they concluded that the signal was most likely due to a charge-transfer effect from a 1.99 d EB located on the same CCD column. For this KOI, vespa calculates an FPP of 1, with the "long" model preferred by far (of the astrophysical models, the double-period BEB-the true scenario-is preferred). This is an excellent example of what was discussed in Section 4.3: that even effects like column anomalies that were not identified by the Kepler team as ephemeris matches will typically be identified as false positives by vespa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work, we have calculated the astrophysical false positive probability (FPP) for every Kepler object of interest (KOI) in the Q1-Q17 DR24 table, using the publicly available Python module vespa, which implements the procedure introduced in Morton (2012), with improvements in stellar parameter modeling and the inclusion of new "double-period" false positive scenarios and artificial models to identify KOIs that are not well explained by any of the astrophysical models. We have also for the first time estimated uncertainties in the vespa calculation, through a bootstrap resampling procedure.</p><p>While the assumptions behind this calculation are not necessarily valid for every KOI (see Section 4.2), we have identified 1284 KOIs that have reliable FPPs of &lt; 0.01, resulting in validation of their planetary nature at the 99% confidence level, more than doubling the number of confirmed Kepler exoplanets. Among this set of newly validated planets are 9 that are consistent with being in the habitable zones of their host stars. We also identify 428 new likely false positive KOIs, although we note that some of these may be due to unidentified or miscorrected transit timing variations.</p><p>The reliability of these calculations depends significantly on the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryson &amp; Morton (2015)</ref>, which quantify the probability that the eclipse/transit signal is spatially coincident on the sky with the presumed target star. Without confirmation that the transit signal is not coming from a significantly displaced source, the sky area used as part of the prior for the false positive scenarios would need to be significantly larger than the positional uncertainty value assumed in this work (described in Section 2.1). Additionally, the blended false positive scenarios vespa considers are assumed to be fully contained within the photometric aperture; this assumption would also be broken if the source of the eclipse were significantly displaced. We estimate that perhaps 0.06% of the planets we validate could be signals coming from significantly displaced sources, similar to those identified as period-epoch matches by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> but unidentified by that analysis.</p><p>While previous a priori false positive rate estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morton &amp; Johnson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>) have made clear that the Kepler planet candidate catalogs are generally low enough to ignore for the purposes of planet occurrence rate calculations, any more detailed study of any small subset of individual KOIs should understand in more detail the FPPs of those specific candidates. This type of small-sample candidate culling using individually calculated FPPs has already been done in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Morton &amp; Swift 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Morton &amp; Winn 2014)</ref>; the publication of this full catalog allows the community to do the same. In particular, several other studies have shown that specific samples of KOIs tend to have larger FPPs than the global average, so studies involving giant-planet KOIs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Santerne et al. 2015</ref>) or evolved stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sliski &amp; Kipping 2014)</ref> are in even greater need of the individual FPP analysis here presented.</p><p>The Kepler mission has demonstrated that spacebased transiting planet surveys identify planet candidates at a rate much faster than traditional follow-up techniques can confirm them. As a result, false positive probability quantification techniques are now an integral part of the landscape of exoplanet science. While the present work is the first large-scale demonstration of a fully automated validation procedure, there is much progress still to be made. For example, there is currently no support within vespa to calculate the FPP for a candidate which has a specifically identified but previously unknown close companion. Future development plans for the vespa package include support for this scenario, as well as other improvements. One of the most important of these will be to allow for a contaminating EB to not be fully contained within the target photometric aperture; that is, modeling the probability for further-away stars to be EBs contributing only a small amount of their flux to the target photometry, such as is the case for many of the false positives identified via ephemeris matching by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref>. Full inclusion of this effect will allow for even low-SNR candidates to receive confident vespa analysis, which is now limited only to KOIs for which confident pixel-level positional analysis is possible.</p><p>Beyond Kepler, future transit missions such as TESS and PLATO will require automated false positive analysis in order to efficiently sift through the large numbers of candidates that they will find. This work demonstrates that vespa will be a valuable tool towards this purpose.</p><p>Instructions for reproducing all the calculations presented herein can be found at https://github.com/ timothydmorton/koi-fpp. Summary figures produced by vespa for all KOIs can be accessed at http:// kepler-fpp.space.    <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-Comparison between effective temperatures estimated from the isochrones analysis in this work and those from the Kepler stellar parameters catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Huber et al. 2014</ref>, hereafter H14).

More than half of all KOIs to date have already been dispositioned FALSE POSITIVE or CONFIRMED. Those dispositioned CANDIDATE we further categorize according to their reliability. The "no reliable calculation" category means that the vespa calculation was not successful. "On-target probability uncertain" indicates that the positional probability calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryson &amp; Morton (2015)</ref> are not reliable (score &lt; 0.3). "On-target probability &lt; 0.99" means that the positional probability calculations indicate that there is a non-negligible chance that the source of the transit signal is not at the position of the KOI. The remaining three categories are all CANDIDATE KOIs reliably confirmed to be located at the presumed target star, grouped by false positive probability. 1284 of these are new planet validations.  55/1212 inconsistent (4.5%) <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.-Comparison between temperatures and radii estimated from the isochrones analysis in this work and those from the Kepler stellar parameters catalog (H14), for the sample of stars hosting planets validated in this study.

A small number of stars are also estimated by the photometric analysis of H14 to be evolved, but not by isochrones.

The stellar and planetary properties for this table are taken from the DR24 table at the NExScI Exoplanet Archive. Further individual study of each of these systems using detailed follow-up observations will either solidify or amend their potentially habitable nature. In particular, we note that high-resolution imaging observations on the CFOP archive a reveal both KOI-2418 and KOI-3010 to have close companions which may or may not affect their habitable nature. a http://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu</figDesc><table>KOI
