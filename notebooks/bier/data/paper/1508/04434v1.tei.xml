				<p>We present the first study to synthesize results from five different exoplanet surveys using three independent detection methods: microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging. The constraints derived herein represent the most comprehensive picture of the demographics of large-separation (2 AU) planets orbiting the most common stars in our Galaxy that has been constructed to date. We assume a simple, joint power-law planet distribution function of the form d 2 N pl /(d log m p d log a) = A(m p /M Sat) α (a/2.5 AU) β with an outer cutoff radius of the separation distribution function of a out. Generating populations of planets from these models and mapping them into the relevant observables for each survey, we use actual or estimated detection sensitivities to determine the expected observations for each survey. Comparing with the reported results, we derive constraints on the parameters {α, β, A, a out } that describe a single population of planets that is simultaneously consistent with the results of microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys. We find median and 68% confindence intervals of α = −0.86 +0.21 −0.19 (−0.85 +0.21 −0.19), β = 1.1 +1.9 −1.4 (1.1 +1.9 −1.3), A = 0.21 +0.20 −0.15 dex −2 (0.21 +0.20 −0.15 dex −2), and a out = 10 +26 −4.7 AU (12 +50 −6.2 AU) assuming &quot;hot-start&quot; (&quot;cold-start&quot;) planet evolutionary models. These values are consistent with all current knowledge of planets on orbits beyond ∼ 2 AU around M dwarfs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Understanding the demographics of exoplanets is requisite to the development of observationally-constrained formation and migration models. Exoplanet discovery surveys have revealed a large diversity of systems, many of which look nothing like our own Solar system. The overwhelming majority of planets discovered through such surveys have been detected indirectly by monitoring variations in: 1) the centroids of absorption lines in host star spectra (RV), 2) the apparent brightness of the host star (transit), or 3) the magnification of a background source near our line of sight to the host star (microlensing). The physical processes that produce these observables are fundamentally different, and consequently, the properties of the planetary systems they reveal are also different. In other words, each technique is sensitive to planets in a given region of parameter space (e.g. massorbital period space), with varying degrees of overlap with regions probed by other techniques.</p><p>In general, RV surveys are most sensitive to shortperiod, massive planets, transit surveys are most sensitive to very short-period planets with large radii, and microlensing surveys are most sensitive to a range of planet masses and orbital separations near the ice line (∼ few AU). Practical limitations currently restrict the sensitivity of direct imaging searches to the most massive ( M Jup ) planets at large separations ( 10 AU). Coronagraphy and high angular resolution obtained through the use of adaptive optics are required to reveal planetary companions that are several orders-of-magnitude clanton@astronomy.ohio-state.edu fainter than, and located at small angular separations from, their hosts. Although planet detections from individual methods are constrained to limited regions of planet parameter space, it is possible to synthesize results from multiple techniques to derive a more accurate and complete census of exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gaidos et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014a,b)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows several existing constraints on the occurrence rate of planets around M dwarfs for select microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys. A direct comparison between these results is complicated by the various selection effects and observational biases intrinsic to each survey. In <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014b)</ref> we perform a careful comparison of the results of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> microlensing survey with the RV studies of HARPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bonfils et al. 2013</ref>) and the California Planet Survey (CPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>) (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>) by mapping the observable parameters of the population of planets inferred from microlensing to those of an analogous population orbiting RV-monitored stars. Using the actual detection sensitivities of the HARPS and estimated sensitivities for the CPS, we determine the expected numbers of planet detections and long-term trends for both samples and compare with the reported numbers of detections and trends. We find agreement with the detections, demonstrating that RV and microlensing results are consistent, but found that we could not explain all the long-term trends. These excess trends are either not due to a planetary population, or are due to a population of planets to which microlensing is not sensitive.</p><p>A similar approach to comparing the results of mi- crolensing and direct imaging surveys, where we would predict the number of expected planet detections with the actual reported number of detections for a given imaging survey, would not be as informative as it was in the case of microlensing and RV. To zeroth order, the "sensitivity function" of direct imaging surveys to detecting planetary companions depends on just two parameters: the planet-to-star contrast ratio and the projected separation. Of course, these parameters are, themselves, dependent on several system-specific properties -such as age, metallicity, spectral type, distance, planetary atmospheric composition and structure -that are susceptible to large uncertainties, complicating direct comparisons between results of high-contrast imaging surveys with those of other detection methods. We define the "typical" microlensing planet to be one residing in the region of peak sensitivity of microlensing surveys, described by the following parameters: a host star mass of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ , a mass ratio of q ∼ 5 × 10 −4 , and a projected separation of r ⊥ ∼ R E ∼ 2.5 AU, where R E ∼ 2.5 AU is the typical Einstein radius for a 0.5 M ⊙ lens ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. 2010)</ref>. This corresponds to a typical microlensing planet mass of m p = qM l ∼ 0.26 M Jup ∼ M Sat . <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Quanz et al. (2012)</ref> present the deepest highcontrast image for an M star to date, looking at the 12 − 50 Myr old pre-main-sequence star AP Col, which is located 8.4 pc away, for a planetary companion. The authors present their 5σ detection limits in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref>. It is clear from this figure that a Saturn-mass planet at a projected separation of ∼ 2.5 AU (i.e. the typical microlensing planet) would be undetectable. This suggests that most, if not all, of the planets to which microlensing is sensitive will be undetectable to imaging surveys, meaning there is probably little overlap between these two techniques. Thus, we develop new methods in this study to constrain the distributions of the properties of wideseparation (a 2 AU) planets by combining the demographics derived from several individual microlensing, direct imaging, and RV surveys. More specifically, we will assume a simple, power-law planet distribution model, map the resultant populations into the relevant observables for each type of survey, and employ the actual detection limits for each survey to determine the expected observations. We will then weight the assumed planet population by its likelihood associated with each given survey, repeating this process many times to derive constraints on the parameters that describe our planet distribution model (i.e. power-law slopes, normalization, and the outer cutoff radius of the separation distribution function). This is the first study to attempt to perform a joint analysis combining the results from five different exoplanet surveys using three independent detection methods. The constraints derived herein represent the most comprehensive understanding of large-separation planets that orbit the most common stars in our Galaxy and will serve as the standard to which models of planet formation and migration must adhere. In § 2, we provide brief descriptions of the surveys and their results included in our analysis. We perform an order-of-magnitudestyle analysis in § 3 under several simplifying assumptions, such as a single characteristic host mass, distance, and kinematic parameters, as well as median sensitivity curves to describe each survey. These rough calculations allow us to develop the intuition necessary for understanding the constraining power of both the individual and combined survey results. In § 4, relaxing as many of these assumptions as possible, we describe the methodology we develop to perform a detailed analysis that treats uncertainties in the relevant stellar physical and kinematic parameters, orbital parameters, planetary evolutionary models, and variations in detection sensitivities among, and within, the surveys to which we compare. We present and discuss the results of these careful analyses in § 5, and follow up with a description of all sources of (quantified and unquantified) uncertainty in our analysis in § 6. We summarize our results and discuss future, related work in § 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Here we describe the results from several representative microlensing, direct imaging, and RV surveys we use to constrain the demographics of planets around M dwarfs. In this paper, we will make use of the following results: 1) the measured frequency of giant planets from the microlensing survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>, 2) the slope of the planetary mass-ratio function inferred from the microlensing survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>, 3) the detection of four long-term RV trends measured by the CPS TRENDS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>), 4) the non-detection of any planetary companions in a sample of 72 young, single M stars imaged by the Planets Around Low-Mass Stars (PALMS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. 2015</ref>) survey, and 5) the non-detection of any planetary companions around the 16 M stars imaged by the Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lafrenì ere et al. 2007)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> graphically displays three of these constraints. Note that the measurement for the CPS/TRENDS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>) differs in this plot relative to that in figure 1. Since we are concerned with the longperiod companions to M dwarfs in this paper, we only use the constraints from the trends that are detected and reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. (2014)</ref> (discussed in § 2.3), and thus the data point plotted here is the result only considering the constraints from their long-term RV drifts. Not shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref> are the two constraints we consider from the GDPS Lafrenì ere et al. 2007), as they only report a frequency for all stars in their sample (of which only 16 are M dwarfs; see § 2.2), and that of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> microlensing survey, which is a measurement of the slope (but not the normalization) of the planetary mass-ratio function (discussed in the following subsection). In the remainder of this section, we describe basic sample properties and results of all five surveys we consider, and place them into the context of the current knowledge of planet occurrences around M dwarfs and solar-type stars.</p><p>2.1. Microlensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>: The sample of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> is an unbiased selection of 13 high-magnification (A &gt; 200) microlensing events. Within this sample, there are a total of six planet detections in five systems. They find typical values of the planet-to-star mass ratio, Einstein radius, and lens mass of q 0 ∼ 5 × 10 −4 , R E,0 ∼ 3.5 AU(M ⋆ /M ⊙ ) 1/2 , and M l,0 ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ , respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> measure the frequency of ice and gas giant planets with mass ratios in the interval −4.5 ≤ log q ≤ −2 to be G ≡ d 2 N pl /(d log q d log s) = (0.36 ± 0.15) dex −2 at their mean mass-ratio, q 0 . This result is sensitive to a wide range of projected separations between s −1 max R E,0 r ⊥ s max R E,0 , where s max ∼ (q/10 −4.3 ) 1/3 , corresponding to de-projected separations well beyond the ice lines of these systems. In their analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> make the assumption that planets are distributed uniformly in log s near the Einstein radius and demonstrate that this assumption is consistent with the six microlensing detections in their sample.</p><p>On its face, this result appears to be in direct conflict with those of recent RV surveys, which have measured frequencies of giant planets around M dwarfs that are smaller by more than an order-of-magnitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bonfils et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>). Indeed, the publication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> left many uncomfortable with the idea that giant planets may be common around M dwarfs because the theory of giant planet formation by core accretion, supported by the RV measurements, predicts the opposite (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Laughlin et al. 2004</ref>). Qualitative arguments invoking the Galactic metallicity gradient or the sensitivity of microlensing surveys to longer periods than RV surveys seemed likely explanations for this vast difference in inferred occurrence rates. However, RV surveys of M dwarfs have already operated long enough to have significant sensitivity, at least in terms of orbital period, to the majority of planets detectable by microlensing. This motivated a study to statistically compare the constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred from these two discovery techniques and develop a thorough understanding of the conflation of the various selection effects intrinsic to them. In <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a,b)</ref>, we demonstrate that the giant planet frequencies measured by microlensing and RV surveys are actually consistent, and without a need to invoke the Galactic metallicity gradient. Rather, the steep planetary mass-ratio function derived from microlensing discoveries implies that RV surveys are detecting only the high-mass tail of the giant planet population inferred by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>. In Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a), we also synthesize constraints from the microlensing surveys of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> with those from the HARPS RV survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bonfils et al. (2013)</ref> and determine the frequency of Jupiters and super-Jupiters with 1 ≤ m p sin i/M Jup ≤ 13 and periods 1 ≤ P/days ≤ 10 4 to be f J = 0.029 +0.013 −0.015 , a median factor of 4.3 (1.5-14 at 95% confidence) smaller than the inferred frequency of such planets around FGK stars of 0.11 ± 0.20 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>). Thus, the combined microlensing and RV constraints are consistent with the generic prediction of core accretion that giant planet frequency is correlated with host mass, although it remains to be seen if these rates are consistent in detail with quantitative predictions of this model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> perform a likelihood analysis on the 10 microlensing planet discoveries up to their time of publication to determine the planetary mass-ratio distribution function, which they assume has the form dN pl /d log q = N 0 q n Θ(q − q low )Θ(q up − q), where q low = 10 −4.5 and q up = 10 −2 are the lower and upper limits on the mass ratio, respectively, and where Θ is the Heaviside step function. The authors report a slope of n = −0.68 ± 0.20 but are unable to place constraints on the normalization N 0 since they estimate the relative (not absolute) detection efficiencies as a function of q. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> infer a slope that is steeper than, but consistent with, that found by RV surveys of solar-type stars of n RV = −0.31 ± 0.20 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>). Constraints on planet frequency around M dwarfs for a few of the surveys we consider in this paper as functions of planet mass, mp, and semimajor axis, a. The vertical error bars on the points represent the measurement uncertainty on the planet frequency, while the horizontal "error" bars represent the approximate ranges of mass and semimajor axis over which these frequencies are measured. The region corresponding to giant planets in the left panel is shaded gray, while the vertical gray line in the right panel represents the approximate location of the ice line around a 0.5 M ⊙ star. The result plotted for the CPS/TRENDS survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. (2014)</ref> includes only the constraints from the four significant long-term RV trends they detect (see § 2.3 for description).</p><p>stars that have been selected for their youth and proximity, with the goals of discovering sub-stellar companions and determining the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs at separations beyond ∼ 10 AU. The median spectral type and distance of the full PALMS sample is approximately M3.5 and 21 pc, respectively. The median age of the sample is 135 Myr and 90% of the targets are younger than 620 Myr. Imaging of these 122 M dwarfs reveal that 44 are close stellar binaries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> do not include these close binaries in their statistical analysis in order to construct a sample that most closely matches those of RV surveys, which are routinely vetted of such binaries. Their final statistical sample is thus composed of 78 single M stars and represents the largest imaging search for planets around low-mass stars (0.1 − 0.6 M ⊙ ) to date. In our analysis, we further refine this sample to construct a sample to which we can fairly compare the results of other studies (in particular, the CPS RV sample of M dwarfs which have been explicitly vetted for binaries), eliminating three stars with spectral types earlier than M0: TYC 523-573-1 (K7.5), NLTT 26359 (K5), and TYC 1752-63-1 (K7). We also eliminate three stars which are close visual binaries with angular separations &lt; 1 ′′ , where there are no stable S-type orbits: 1RXS J034231.8+121622 AB, GJ 3629AB, and GJ 4185 Aab. This leaves us with a sample of 72 single M stars. Some of these stars are actually in wide binaries, but following the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref>, we only examine separations out to which there is a stable S-type orbit and assume no sensitivity to separations beyond this maximum stable separation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> report typical contrasts of 12 − 14 mag with Keck/NIRC2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wizinowich et al. 2000</ref>) and 9 − 13 mag with Subaru/HiCIAO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hayano et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hodapp et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Suzuki et al. 2010</ref>) at an angular separation of 1 ′′ , which correspond to limiting planet masses between roughly 0.5 − 10 M Jup at projected separations between 5 − 33 AU for 85% of their statistical sample. Overall, the PALMS survey is most sensitive to planets with projected separations between 10 − 100 AU, demonstrating an ability to detect ∼ 5% of 1 M Jup companions, ∼ 20% of 2 M Jup companions, and ∼ 50% of 5 M Jup companions in this range (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 24</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. 2015</ref> for the full PALMS survey sensitivity map).</p><p>A total of 167 faint point sources (planet candidates) are identified around 45 stars from first epoch images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> were able to obtain follow-up imaging and recover 56% of these candidates, showing that all are consistent with background stars. The nature of the remaining candidates with just a single epoch of astrometry is uncertain, however only 8 of these reside at projected separations within 100 AU. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> do not confirm any planets orbiting the single M dwarfs in their sample. These non-detections provide 95% confidence upper limits on the frequency of giant planets (1 − 13 M Jup ) orbiting single M dwarfs between 10 − 100 AU of &lt; 10.3% (&lt; 16.0%), assuming logarithmically-uniform distributions in planet mass and semimajor axis and "hot-start" ("cold-start") planet evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">) (Fortney et al. 2008</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> point out that the results of the PALMS survey, when compared with similarly large surveys for the direct detection of exoplanets around samples of A (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nielsen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vigan et al. 2012</ref>) and FGK stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nielsen &amp; Close 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. 2015</ref>), provide no statistical evidence for a dependency of the frequency of long-period, giant planets on host star mass. Larger sample sizes in all mass stellar mass regimes will be required of future surveys in order to distinguish small differences in the relative occurrence rates of long-period (&gt; 10 AU) giant planets around low-and high-mass stars.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> report the detection of four brown dwarfs, deriving a frequency of brown dwarf companions to single M dwarfs with masses between 13 − 75 M Jup and separations between 10 − 100 AU of 2.8 +2.4 −1.5 %, consistent with previous estimates for BD companions to M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dieterich et al. (2012)</ref> and to solartype primaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand (2009)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we will employ the sensitivity limits for the 72 single M stars targeted by the PALMS survey to identify classes of planet populations that are consistent with non-detections and compare these with the populations consistent with the results of the other exoplanet surveys from microlensing, RV, and the Gemini Deep Planet Survey ( <ref type="bibr">GDPS;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lafrenì ere et al. 2007</ref>). The contrast curves provided in table 5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. (2015)</ref> are the deepest contrast curves for each star, but are not necessarily the ones employed in their statistical analysis (see their § 6.1 for a description of how they select the appropriate contrast curves for their analysis). In order to most accurately determine the expected results of the PALMS survey for generic (power-law) planet populations and compare with the actual reported results, we instead use the same set of contrast curves used in their statistical analysis <ref type="bibr">(B.P. Bowler, private communi- cation)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lafrenì ere et al. (2007)</ref>: The GDPS is a direct imaging survey of young, nearby stars, with the primary science driver of constraining the occurrence rates of massive, planetary companions at orbital separations ranging between 10 − 300 AU. The GDPS sample includes 85 FGKM stars within 35 pc at ages ranging between ∼ 10 − 6700 Myr. The median values for several parameters of the full sample are a distance of 22 pc, spectral type of K0, age of ∼ 200 Myr, H magnitude of 5.75, proper-motion amplitude of 240 mas yr −1 , and metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.00 dex (with a standard deviation of 0.21 dex).Lafrenì ere et al. <ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref> do not detect any planetary companions, but report a typical 5σ detection limit sufficient to detect planets with masses &gt; 2 M Jup at projected separations between 40 − 200 AU.

There are a total of 16 M dwarfs among their full sample.</p><p>While the GDPS is an overall deeper survey than PALMS in terms of contrast, the sample sizes differ by a factor of ∼ 4. Thus, the reported upper limits on giant planet frequency at large separations from the PALMS survey seem to be more constraining than those reported by the GDPS. However, it is difficult to quantify the actual differences in completeness, as the GDPS results are quoted over a larger range of semimajor axis (25−420 AU) than that from PALMS (10−100 AU). Furthermore, the GDPS result includes the non-detections from the higher-mass stars, and it is not clear if the planet evolutionary models were incorporated in a consistent fashion between the two surveys. This highlights the importance of performing a self-consistent analysis between surveys using the same detection technique in order to perform a fair comparison of their results. To this end, we perform our own analysis of both the GDPS and PALMS sample within the same framework, using the exact same planet evolutionary models that have been interpolated to a given time resolution and extrapolated to a larger range of planet masses and to later ages. We describe in detail how we incorporate the evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ORDER OF MAGNITUDE EVALUATIONS</head><p>The primary objective of this study is to constrain the properties of wide (a 2 AU) planetary companions to M dwarfs by testing if a simple parameterized planet distribution model can explain the microlensing, RV, and direct imaging data. In order to do this correctly, we will need to map the parameters of an assumed model of the distributions of planet masses and semimajor axes into the appropriate observables for each discovery technique and use the actual detection sensitivities for each specific survey to determine their expected number of detections for a given planet population. The full procedure will require marginalizing over several stellar, Galactic, kinematic, and orbital parameters, but first we will forgo several of these steps to estimate -at an orderof-magnitude level of precision -the expected results for microlensing, direct imaging, and RV surveys. We perform this rough calculation first to develop intuition on the potential constraining power of each individual detection technique, as well as that from their combination. These evaluations are also a way to validate our more careful-but also more complicated and harder to interpret-methodology.</p><p>We begin by assuming planet populations that are described by four parameters: the slope of the mass distribution function, α, the slope of the separation distribution function, β, their normalization, A, and the outer cutoff radius of the separation distribution function, a out . The populations are thus distributed in planet mass and semimajor axis as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d 2 N pl d log m p d log a = A m p M Sat α a 2.5 AU β ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with a maximum semimajor axis of a out . We choose to normalize our distribution functions at a Saturn mass and at a semimajor axis of 2.5 AU, which correspond to the mass ratio and projected separation in units of the Einstein radius in the region of peak sensitivity for microlensing surveys, q 0 = 5 × 10 −4 and s 0 = 1, for a lens mass of M l ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ . Note that 2.5 AU is the median Einstein radius of an ensemble of simulated microlensing events with parameters consistent with those observed for actual samples of events (see Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014a,b for more information). We generate random planet populations, enumerated by the index i, each of which is described by a random set of parameters: {α i , β i , A i , a out,i }. We randomly (and independently) draw values of α and β uniformly within the range <ref type="bibr">[−4, 4]</ref>, values of log (A/dex −2 ) uniformly within the range <ref type="bibr">[−3, 3]</ref>, and values of log (a out /AU) uniformly within the range <ref type="bibr">[−1, 3]</ref>. We then map the properties of these populations into the observables relevant to microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys, and apply the appropriate detection criteria to determine the expected observations for each survey. Each planet population is then assigned a statistical weight according to its likelihood associated with all the surveys to which we compare. We thus derive maximum likelihood distributions of each of our population parameters (α, β, A, and a out ) which describe planet populations consistent with the results of all surveys. This process is described in greater detail in the following sections.</p></div>

These likelihoods are assigned according to the likelihood function measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>, to which we assign the variable L G .</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014b)</ref>, we approximate L G by first drawing a non-integer number from a Poisson distribution with a mean value equal to the number of detections in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> sample (six) to represent the average number of planets per star. We then use this number to compute the implied planet frequency, G, in a similar manner as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>. After repeating this process many times, we normalize the resultant distribution of planet frequencies such that the median value is equal to the maximum likelihood value reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> of 0.36 dex −2 . The likelihood function we derive from this process is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref> and has a median value and 68% uncertainties of 0.36 +0.15 −0.12 dex −2 . While this is an approximation of the actual likelihood function derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>, who report 68% uncertainties of ±0.15 dex −2 , we show in § 6 that other sources of uncertainty will dominate over that introduced by our approximation of L G . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the resultant constraints on the parameters of populations consistent with this survey. These can be understood by considering how changes in the parameters of our models affect the integrated planet frequency given by equation (2). We have assumed the measurement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> uniformly covers a given range of q and s, and thus effectively, a given range of m p and a (although in reality, the range in m p and a varies for each system depending on the orbital phase and primary mass -this will be addressed in the more detailed calculations presented in later sections). The black box in figure 5 illustrates this area, over which the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey is sensitive. Another important detail that must be kept in mind when thinking about these constraints is the point at which our planet distribution models are normalized. We refer to this as the "pivot point" of our models. The black diamond in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5</ref> shows the location of the pivot point, at a mass of m p = M Sat and a semimajor axis of a = 2.5 AU, relative to the regions of sensitivity for the various surveys. Note that the pivot point lies interior to the region of sensitivity of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey. As we will show, this has consequences that are reflected in the constraints we derive on the parameters of our planet models from comparison with this survey.</p><p>Comparison of our planet models with the results of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey essentially does three things: 1) puts a lower bound on a out , 2) puts an upper bound on A, and 3) constrains a combination of α and A. Panels (a), (c), and (e) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref> show that values of a out ≤ 1.4 AU are not allowed (although the bin size makes it appear as values down to ≈ 1 AU are allowed), as that would imply there are no planets beyond 1.4 AU, which is clearly discrepant with the observations. Panels (a), (b), and (d) demonstrate that there is a maximum value of A allowed. This is best understood mathematically. First consider cases where a out &gt; 7.2 AU. At a fixed value of A, there are specific values of α and β (that are completely independent of a out ) that minimize the integrals in equation (2). At these minimizing values, A becomes the only way to adjust G, meaning that there is a maximum value of A beyond which the implied planet frequency becomes too large to be consistent with the measurement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>To understand the constraint on the combination of α and A, consider what happens to the integrated planet frequency at fixed values of α, β, and a out . In this case, we can see directly from equation (2) that G ∝ A. Next, consider fixed values of α, β, and A. Larger values of a out will result in larger values of G, while smaller a out result in smaller G. However, at fixed β, a out , and A, increasing (decreasing) α will not always lead to increased (decreased) values of G. This is due to the fact that the pivot point lies interior to the region of sensitivity of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey. For fixed values of G, β, a out , and A, there are two values of α that will satisfy equation <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. Qualitatively, what is happening in this case, is a redistribution of planets from greater numbers of more (less) massive planets to greater numbers of less (more) massive planets for decreasing (increasing) values of α, while conserving the overall planet frequency. This is il- lustrated in panel (b) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>. Taking a slice through these contours at a fixed value of A = 0.01 dex −2 results in a bimodal distribution in α. If we had a perfect measurement of G and knew the exact values of β and a out , this distribution would consist of two "spikes," or delta functions, at specific values of α. However, uncertainty in the measurement of G and mutual degeneracies between α, β, and a out (see panels c, e, and f) give these modes finite width. As A increases to a maximum allowed value, these modes move closer together and eventually merge into a single peak at a value of α that minimizes the contribution of the mass integral in equation (2). Panel (d) displays a similar behavior in the point constraints of β and A, although it is less pronounced than that between α and A because the range of a covered by the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey is smaller relative to that of m p . Note that even though panels (b), (c), and (f) seem to indicate that there is a maximum value of α allowed, this is not a real constraint. Instead, it is a consequence of the limited range of A we consider, and if we had considered smaller values of A, the contours would expand to include larger values of α. However, some values of α would not be consistent with the distribution of mass ratios seen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> (and similarly, some values of β would not be consistent with their observed distribution of projected separations). We address this point in later sections.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. 2015</ref>) surveys are sensitive to direct detections. The solid, black diamond shows the "pivot point" of our planet distribution function, i.e. the point at which we choose to normalize our distribution function (mp = M Sat , a = 2.5 AU). Note that this pivot point is located inside the region of sensitivity for the microlensing surveys of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> and outside the regions of sensitivity for the remaining surveys.

Since the main result of the PALMS survey to which we will compare this order-of-magnitude estimate is the upper limit on the occurrence rate of giant planets with semimajor axes between 10 − 100 AU, we set a min,det,img = 10 AU and a max,det,img = 100 AU.</p><p>We determine P det (log m p ) by examining <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al.

The total number of expected detections for the full sample is then N tot,B15,i = 72N B15,i . We assign a statistical weight to each planet population according to the likelihood function we define to be L B15 ≡ P (0|N tot,B15,i ), where P (0|N tot,B15,i ) = exp(−N tot,B15,i ) is the Poisson probability of detecting zero planets among the 72 single M stars in the PALMS sample if the true number of detectable planets around such stars is actually N tot,B15,i .

As can be seen in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(4)</ref>, there are degeneracies between α, β, and A which result in no constraining power on combinations of these parameters from direct imaging results. The only real constraints (although weak) allowed by the PALMS survey individually are on a out . Panels (a), (c), and (e) demonstrate that there is a maximum allowed value of a out for a given value of α, β, and A. The shapes of these contour lines are straightforward to understand. For a out ≤ 10 AU, which is the minimum separation at which PALMS is sensitive to planets, there is no constraint on a out because all planets, regardless of their distribution (and overall occurrence rate) in mass and semimajor axis, would be undetectable by PALMS and thus consistent with the reported non-detections.</p><p>Panel (a) illustrates that for a small enough normalization, a out can be arbitrarily large (within the range of a out we consider).

Since in the above-described order of magnitude calculation, we have assumed the sensitivity of the PALMS survey is the same for each star in their sample, the transition from having a constraint on a out to having no constraint is quite sharp. As we will demonstrate, this will not be the case when we perform more careful calculations that make use of each individual sensitivity curve reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al.

Variations in the limiting contrast (and thus, planet mass) at a given separation among the stars in the PALMS survey will provide more sensitivity to these parameters, particularly α, as these detection limits will sample our planet distribution functions at a range of masses and semimajor axes that is not probed by the mean sensitivity curve we employ for this order of magnitude comparison.</p><p>Finally, we note that there is not much difference between the constraints obtained from the "hot-start" models versus those obtained using the "cold-start" models.

In Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a), we also derive an expression for the S/N at which an RV survey can detect planetary companions as a function of the magnitudes of the signal K and measurement uncertainties σ, the time baseline of observations T , and total number of observations N .

Since we are aiming for a rough estimate, we take the median parameters of the CPS M dwarfs to determine ˙ v thr and assume the resulting threshold as a function of a is the same for each of the 111 M dwarfs in their sample. The median parameters for the CPS sample are N med = 29, σ med = 4.5 m s −1 (inclues instrumental noise and stellar jitter), and T med = 11.8 yr. We plot this minimum-detectable acceleration as a function of log semimajor axis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 9</ref>. The dotted blue, vertical line marks the log semimajor axis that roughly corresponds to the median time baseline of observations, T med , for the CPS M dwarfs, log a T ∼ 0.59, assuming the median stellar mass of the CPS M dwarfs of M ⋆ ∼ 0.41 M ⊙ . As a increases beyond a T , ˙ v thr becomes an extremely weak function of P (and thus a). Expanding the Maclaurin series of sin 2 (x) = x 2 − x 4 /3 + O(x 6 ), where x ≡ πT /P , and substituting this expression into equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>, we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">˙ v thr ≃ 24 N 1/2 σ T Q ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>in the limit of T ≪ P .

This yields the expected number of long-term RV trend detections per star, N tr,i , for the CPS TRENDS survey, assuming their median sample parameters. The total number of trends we expect the CPS to detect for a given planet population is then N tot,tr,i = 111N tr,i . Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. (2014)</ref> report the detection of four significant long-term RV trends, we adopt a likelihood function of the form L tr ≡ P (4|N tot,tr,i ), where P (4|N tot,tr,i ) = (N tot,tr,i ) 4 exp(−N tot,tr,i )/4! is the Poisson probability of detecting exactly four trends from the 111 M stars in the CPS sample if N tot,tr,i is the true mean number of detectable trends within the sample. We plot this likelihood function in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>, where the abscissa in this case corresponds to N tot,tr,i . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the resultant constraints on the parameters of populations consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al.

There is not much orthogonality between these constraints and those supplied by the from the fact that we require the period of planets that we expect to be detected as a trend to be longer than the time baseline of observations, i.e. P &gt; T . Since we use only a median sensitivity to be representative of the full CPS M dwarf sample, this lower bound on a out is sharp at a = a T = 3.85 AU. Later in this paper, we will make use of each individual sensitivity limit and the lower bound placed on a out will not be as sharp, as the stars in the CPS sample have been monitored for a range of T . The observed anti-correlation between α and A in panel (b) is a reflection of the fact that the pivot point of our planet distribution function is outside the region of sensitivity for the CPS trends, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5</ref>. At fixed a out and β, increases (decreases) in A must be compensated by decreases (increases) in α to preserve the number of observed trends. The apparent constraints on the combination of α and β in panel (f) are not actual constraints; if we were to consider a larger range of A, this full space would be allowed.

For reference, we have also included the constraints obtained by combining the above-described combinations of survey results. These constraints are derived from order of magnitudelevel comparisons, but suggest that our simple, powerlaw planet distribution function can simultaneously explain the results of multiple exoplanet surveys, warranting more detailed and careful calculations (described in § 4).</p><p>We plot the corresponding one-dimensional likelihood functions on each parameter, marginalized over the other three parameters, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 16</ref>, and summarize the median values (and their 68% confidence intervals) in table 1 for both "hot-" and "cold-start" planet evolutionary models.</p><p>We have shown that our order of magnitude comparisons reveal that there is overlap in parameter space from the results of microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys. We are also interested in determining the probability of the resultant parameter distributions given by each survey individually. That is, how much does the likelihood function from a given survey vary over the 68% confidence interval determined from the combination of all surveys? In figures 17 ("hot-start") and 18 ("cold- start"), we plot the normalized likelihood functions (i.e. the likelihoods normalized by the maximum likelihood value for each individual survey) of given parameters across their 68% confidence intervals, assuming the remaining three parameters are at their median values (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">table 1</ref>). These figures show that the likelihoods of these parameters from each individual survey are consistent to within 1σ (i.e. their normalized likelihood is greater than ≈ 0.32) across much of their inferred 68% confidence intervals, and with normalized likelihoods 0.85 at the median value for all surveys (indicated by the vertical, grey lines). This demonstrates that this overlap in parameter space we identify is not improbable, but has a rather good chance of being real. In other words, these order of magnitude evaluations indicate that the results of microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys can be plausibly explained by a single planet population modeled with power-law distributions in mass and semimajor axis.</p><p>Note that while the direct imaging results, particularly those of the PALMS survey, in the "cold-start" case (figure 18) seem to be more constraining than those in the "hot-start" case (figure 17), this is not actually the case. The median value of a out in the "cold-start" case is larger than the minimum-detectable semimajor axis for the PALMS survey (10 AU), while this is not so for the "hot-start" case (refer to table 1). This is not surprising, as one would expect a larger median value on a out for the "cold-start" models relative to the "hot-start" models. However, it does make the interpretation of figures 17 and 18 a bit complicated. Since the values of the parameters over which we marginalize in each panel of these figures are set to the their respective median values, direct imaging surveys are fully consistent (normalized likelihood of one) over the full 68% confidence interval of the parameter plotted in each panel, as zero detections are predicted for a out &lt; 10 AU, with the exception of the top-left panel displaying the likelihood of a out itself. Thus, since the median value of a out is larger than 10 AU for the "cold-start" models, the number of expected direct imaging detections is non-zero, giving rise to the constraints within the 68% confidence intervals each parameter displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 18</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">METHODOLOGY</head><p>The order of magnitude-style calculations presented in the last section are useful for developing intuition about the ways in which individual surveys and their combination can constrain the distribution of properties of planets. In order to obtain more robust constraints, we now relax as many assumptions from those calculations as possible. In this section, we account for variations in stellar properties (mass, distance, age), Galactic properties (velocity dispersion, stellar number density along a given sight line), planetary orbital parameters, planet evolutionary models ("hot-start", "cold-start"), and detection sensitivities for each star/target in each survey.</p><p>The general procedure we adopt is as follows. We begin by generating a population of planets from our simple, power-law distribution function, assigning randomly oriented orbits and host star properties. Next, we derive the expected observables for each planet in the population for microlensing, RV, and direct imaging observations. Applying the sensitivity limits of the various surveys, we Constraints: Here, we have utilized the predictions of the "hot-start" planet evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Microlensing Observables</head><p>In order to compare with microlensing surveys, we need to map the planet masses and semimajor axes of populations of planets into planet-to-star mass ratios and projected separations in units of the Einstein radius, i.e. (m p,i,j , a i,j ) → (q i,j , s i,j ). This transformation requires that we associate each planet with a host star acting as a lens in a microlensing event. We generate a ensemble of microlensing events for each planet population by drawing event parameters from mostly naive prior distributions. We then calculate posterior distributions of parameters by weighting each event by its associated event rate-a statistical probability based on stellar, kinematic, and Galactic properties.</p><p>The priors from which we draw event parameters are as follows. We choose to fix the source in each microlensing event in the bulge at a distance of D s,i,j = 10 kpc. In reality, there is some distribution of source distances, however there exists a strong prior on D s . This prior is based on two facts: 1) the vast majority of sources are in the Galactic bulge, and 2) a majority of lenses are also located in the bulge. Since the lens must be located in front of the source, the range of D s is constrained to be a few kpc, placing most sources behind the Galactic center and in front of the back edge of the bulge. If we were to allow the source distance to vary, it would not significantly change our results, so we choose to fix it to simplify our calculations. respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">RV-Trend Observables and Application to the CPS TRENDS Survey</head><p>We compute the number of expected long-term RV trend detections for the CPS TRENDS survey given a specific planet population by calculating the magnitude of acceleration of the host star due to a planet on a given orbit and comparing with the detection sensitivities of the sample. Again, since we are testing whether or not a single planet population is consistent with the results of all the surveys we consider, we use the same orbital parameters we generated for the comparison with microlensing and direct imaging (see § 4.1.2). This allows us to immediately compute the expected acceleration for each planet in a given population, ˙ v i,j (a i,j , m p,i,j , i i,j , M 0,i,j ), using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>. We also need to know the periods of the planets' orbits, P i,j , to determine their detectability as a long-term trend, rather than as "secure" detections. For a planet to be detected as a long-term RV trend, the period of the planet must be larger than the baseline of observations, such that the RVs of the host are monitored for only a fraction of an orbital period (see Clanton &amp; Gaudi 2014a,b). The orbital period of each planet is easily computed via Kepler's Third Law (equation 11) given the masses of the CPS TRENDS M dwarfs and the planet's semimajor axis. For each star in the CPS TRENDS survey, which we will enumerate with the index k, we determine the "threshold" acceleration as a function of orbital period, above which planets are expected to be detected as long-term RV trends, ˙ v thr,k (P ), directly from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>.</p><p>We describe the reasoning behind this minimum-detectable acceleration in § 3.1.3 and in <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a,b)</ref>. Previously, in the order of magnitude comparison presented in § 3.1.3, we used the median sample parameters of the CPS TRENDS survey to derive rough constraints on the properties of planets consistent with the survey results. Now, we will perform a more accurate calculation, including a different detection limit for each star in the sample that is determined from the specifics of the observations of each target. We obtain masses, M ⋆,k , for each of the 111 M dwarfs monitored by the CPS TRENDS survey from Table 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al.

Thus, for each star, we compute the threshold acceleration (i.e. trend detection limit) as a function of orbital period using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> to obtain the "phase-averaged" S/N, Q k , and substituting this into equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>.

The first detection criterion simply requires that the acceleration of the host star due to a planet has large enough magnitude to be detectable, while the second criterion ensures that the period of the planetary orbit is longer than the baseline of observations. The total number of expected long-term RV trend detections for the CPS TRENDS survey for a specific planet population is then just the sum over all targets in the sample, N tr,i = k N tr,i,k , and the likelihood of each planet population is given by the likelihood function L tr (N tr,i ) = (N tr,i ) 4 exp (−N tr,i )/4!, which we plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>. We present and discuss the results of our comparison with the CPS TRENDS survey in § 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We find that the results of microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys are consistent with a single planet population described by a joint power-law distribution function in planet mass and semimajor axis. We present our final results in figures 25 ("hot-start"), 26 ("coldstart") and 27, and summarize the median values and 68% confidence intervals for each of the four parameters of our planetary distribution function, which are consistent with all surveys we consider, in table 2. We plot the associated likelihoods of the individual surveys across these 68% confidence intervals in figures 28 and 29, demonstrating that the resultant population of planets has a reasonably high likelihood of producing the observations reported by each survey.</p><p>There are several subtleties embedded in the constraints obtained from the synthesis of all survey results, so in order to demonstrate that we understand the results of our calculations, we first present the constraints obtained from each individual survey and compare with those we found in the order of magnitude evaluations of § 3 before reporting our final results.</p></div>

These constraints have some differences with those we obtained in the order of magnitude evaluations, but the general intuition we develop in § 3.1.1 for understanding these constraints still holds.</p><p>As we found in § 3.1.1, the most important constraint here is on the combination of α and A shown in panel (b) for the same reasons. We find that the constraints on the combination of β and A shown in panel (d) are more pronounced because, by applying different detection limits for each of the 13 microlensing events in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> sample, we are effectively sampling the planet distribution function over various ranges of s (and thus a), thus providing more sensitivity to β. As a result, the constraint on the combination of α and β is slightly stronger in this calculation relative to those of § 3.1.1.</p><p>Another difference here is that there is no minimum value of a out (within the range we consider) as we found for the order of magnitude calculations. There, we had a sharp cutoff at 1.4 AU due to the sensitivity criteria we applied, which is not apparent here. However, panel (a) shows that small values of a out require very large normalizations to be consistent with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> results. <ref type="figure">Finally, in panel (c)</ref>, we see that very large and very small values of α are excluded unless a out is small. It is obvious why the only constraining power offered by this survey is on α, but we note that the contours are not centered at α = −0.68 and the 68% contours spread larger than 0.20. Since q ≡ m p /M l , the conflation of dN pl /d log m p with the lens mass function (see § 4.2.2) means that dN pl /d log m p ∝ dN pl /d log q. This is in contrast to the order of magnitude constraints presented in § 3.1.1, where we had assumed a characteristic lens (host) mass rather than marginalizing over the population.</p></div>

These constraints are very similar, qualitatively, with those derived in our order of magnitude analysis of § 3.1.2.</p><p>The PALMS survey can only weakly constrain combinations of a out with α, β, and A. As shown in panels (c) and (e), large values of β and α are disallowed for large values of a out , since we would expect too many direct detections from such populations. In panel (a), we see the same behavior with large values of a out and A, although here it is less pronounced since this set of contours marginalizes over all values of α and β. For sufficiently small values of α and/or β, most combinations of a out and A are allowed. Our results are more sensitive to β, and especially more sensitive to α, than they are to A.</p><p>The major difference between the order of magnitude comparison presented in § 3.1.2 and the results of our de- Contours are drawn at levels of 68% and 95% of the peak likelihood and are marginalized over all other parameters except those being plotted.</p><p>tailed calculations we report here is this enhanced sensitivity to α shown in panels (b), (c), and (f). In our order of magnitude comparison, we assumed that each star in the PALMS sample had the same detection limit (the median of the sample), whereas here, we employ the individual sensitivities for each star. This allows us to sample the planet distribution function at different contrasts (and thus, through the use of evolutionary models, different planet masses), providing more sensitivity to the value of α. Not surprisingly, this is also where we see the largest difference between the "hot-" and "cold-start" models (see panel c). However, as we will demonstrate in § 5.2, there is not a significant difference in the constraints derived from the "hot-" and "cold-start" models over the regions of parameter space allowed by a joint comparison with all surveys. Lafrenì ere et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2007)</ref>: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 23</ref> plots the likelihood contours on the parameters of populations consistent with the GDPS we derive following the procedure outlined in § 4.5.2. The interpretation of these constraints is identical to that discussed above for the PALMS survey. Although the GDPS is, in general, a deeper survey than PALMS, the large difference in sample sizes between the surveys means that the GDPS constraints are weaker than those derived from the PALMS survey.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Synthesized Constraints</head><p>We have shown that, individually, the results of any single exoplanet discovery survey can only constrain combinations of the parameters of our assumed planet distribution function. However, a joint comparison with the results of multiple detection methods enables us to derive meaningful constraints on the individual parameters of a planet population that is consistent with the results of all surveys we consider. We plot the likelihood contours on pairs of parameters describing a population that is consistent with the results of various combinations of surveys in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 25</ref> for our "hot-start" calculations and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 26</ref> for our "cold-start" calculations.</p><p>Since the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> survey constrains a combination of α and A and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> survey constrains α, the combination of these two surveys provides a relatively tight constraint on A. With α and A more or less fixed, the CPS TRENDS survey places lower bound on β and a out , below which there are not enough planets at large enough separations to be detected as long-term drifts. However, due to degeneracies between β and a out , we are unable to place an upper bound on either of these parameters. Very large values of β are allowed by the trends as long as a out is relatively small. Inclusion of the direct imaging results does not improve the constraints much for similar reasons. Arbitrarily large values of β are allowed by direct imaging surveys as long as a out 10 AU. This is due to the fact that there is a sharp cutoff in detectability at projected separations approaching the inner working angle.</p><p>There is not much difference between the results of the "hot-" and "cold-start" calculations. The "cold-start" calculations are slightly less constraining, particularly on a out , but the difference is not much and well within the uncertainties <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(see table 2</ref>). One might assume that this is because the difference in expected planet luminosity between the two classes of evolutionary models is greatest at young ages, a region of parameter space occupied by just a fraction of the targets in direct imaging surveys. However, this is not actually the case, because it is these very targets (i.e. stars with ages 100 Myr) that provide the best constraints from imaging surveys as overall; most planets are not expected to be detected around the older stars. Instead, the lack of a significant difference between the "hot-" and "cold-start" predictions can be attributed to: 1) the difference in the predicted luminosities between the two classes of models decreases with planet mass at all ages, 2) our assumed power-law form for the planet distribution function, and 3) the most likely range of a out we find lies within a region where direct imaging surveys are mostly insensitive to planets. The bottom-left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> demonstrates that, at all ages, the predicted luminosities for lower-mass planets differ less between the "hot-" and "cold-start" models relative to the more massive planets. This is important, since we find that α is relatively well-constrained at negative values, and thus the mass function is heavily weighted towards lower-mass planets. Additionally, since our assumed planet distribution function has a power-law form, small changes in α, β, and/or a out can have a dramatic effect on the number of expected planet detections. As for the third reason, the detectability of exoplanets by direct imaging surveys dramatically decreases as the projected separation approaches the inner working angle (see e.g. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref> ofLafrenì ere et al. 2007 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. 2015</ref>), which means that we do not predict any exoplanet detections with separations a 10 AU for either survey, despite our choice of evolutionary model (see figures 22 and 23).</p><p>We plot the corresponding one-dimensional likelihood functions on each parameter, marginalized over the other three parameters, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 27</ref>, and summarize the median values (and their 68% confidence intervals) in table 2 for both "hot-" and "cold-start" planet evolutionary models. The final parameter constraints we report in table 2 do differ from those we found in our order of magnitude comparisons (presented in table 1). While the median values are consistent between the two independent analyses, the results of our detailed calculations are more constraining, particularly on β and a out (compare figures 16 and 27).</p><p>The likelihood distribution of α we find in our detailed analysis is slightly shifted towards smaller values, but has a 68% confidence interval with no larger or smaller a "spread" than that derived from our order of magnitude analysis. The same is true of A, although the shift is less pronounced. Although consistent between the two analyses, the resultant median value of β of our detailed calculations is a factor ≈ 2 larger than that of the order of magnitude comparison. Increased sensitivity to β due to the inclusion of (real) variations in detection limits within the individual surveys, which thus sample our planet distribution function at different semimajor axes, means we also find that β is better constrained Here, we have utilized the predictions of the "hot-start" planet evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>. Contours are drawn at levels of 68% and 95% of the peak likelihood and are marginalized over all other parameters except those being plotted.</p><p>relative to the results of our order of magnitude calculations (see § 5.1 for more discussion). In turn, due to the previously discussed degeneracy between β and a out (as well as variations in specific detection sensitivities), we find that a out is also better constrained by our detailed comparison, although the median values between the two analyses are indistinguishable. We have demonstrated that there is overlap among the constraints we derive from a comparison with each of the individual surveys, which means that the results of all the surveys we consider can be explained by a single planet population described by a simple, joint power-law distribution function given by equation (1). As before in our order of magnitude comparison, we now determine how the likelihood of such a planet population, according to each survey individually, varies over the 68% confidence intervals we derive on α, β, A, and a out .</p><p>In figures 28 ("hot-start") and 29 ("cold-start"), we plot the normalized likelihood functions (i.e. the likelihoods normalized by the maximum likelihood value for each individual survey) of given parameters across their 68% confidence intervals, assuming the remaining three parameters are at their median values (listed in table 2). These figures show that the likelihoods of these parameters from each individual survey are consistent to well within 1σ (i.e. their normalized likelihood is greater than ≈ 0.32) across much of their inferred 68% confidence intervals, and have normalized likelihoods 0.7 at the median value for all surveys (indicated by the vertical, grey lines). This demonstrates that this overlap in parameter space we identify is not improbable, and has a rather good chance of being real. Note that while in each of the panels there are some regions where the relative likelihood for a given survey seems low (e.g. in the upper left Constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">G10 + S10 + L07 + B15 G10 + S10 + M14 G10 + S10 + L07 + B15 + M14 0 1 2 log(a out [AU]) -2 0 2 α -2 -1 0 1 2 log(A [dex -2 ]) -2 0 2 β 0 1 2 log(a out [AU]) -2 0 2 α 68% Contours 95% Contours (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)</formula><p>Cold Start <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 26</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">UNCERTAINTIES</head><p>The main sources of quantified uncertainty in this study are those of the measurements made by the six different surveys with which we jointly compare. By employing the full likelihood functions (or approximations thereof) of these measurements, rather than the maximum likelihood values, the uncertainties we derive on our results naturally include the contributions from each individual measurement. However, there are multiple sources of unquantifiable uncertainty in this study, in particular in the adopted models and priors necessary to derive the mapping between the properties of planets (m p and a) into the observables relevant to the different types of surveys. There are certainly differences in the properties of the samples of the individual surveys (e.g. distributions in stellar mass and metallicity), the magnitudes of which are unknown due to a lack of the appropriate observational data. We discuss the nature of these unquantified uncertainties below, arguing that at least some of them should be subdominant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Priors on Unknown Stellar, Galactic, and</head><p>Planetary Orbital Properties As we have demonstrated, a robust, joint comparison between the results of these different techniques is contingent on an ability to map basic planet properties into the observables relevant to each method. This requires knowledge of the physical properties of the hosts as well as the planetary orbital parameters, since each technique is sensitive to a unique combination thereof. While we attempt to account for uncertainties in these properties by marginalizing over prior distributions, imperfect knowledge of their actual distributions leaves some level of residual error.</p><p>The routine observables in a typical planetary microlensing event contain little information about the physical properties of the lens system beyond the planetto-star mass ratio, q, and the projected separation in units of the Einstein radius, s. Measurement of the primary mass, and thus m p , requires detection of higher order effects in the light curve (e.g. finite source effects, microlens parallax, xallarap) to break the degeneracy between lens mass and distance. The mapping necessary to compare our planet population models to the results of microlensing surveys, (m p , a) → (q, s), thus depends on a Galactic model, priors on the lens mass and distance distribution functions, and priors on the planetary orbital parameters. In this paper, we adopt the same Galactic model and prior on lens distances as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014b)</ref>. We demonstrated in those studies that we are able to reproduce the observed distributions of host star parameters (R E , t E , |µ|, M l ) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> microlensing survey when weighting them by their expected event rates, with the possible exception of the distribution of lens distances. We found that events in our simulated sample typically have larger values of D l relative to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> sample. However, given the small number of actual distance measurements in the microlensing samples, this ultimately may not be significant. Although we adopt a different lens mass function in this study than in <ref type="bibr">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a,b)</ref>, we still find agreement between our simulated events and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> sample. We therefore expect uncertainties due to our choice of priors and Galactic model to be subdominant. The priors over which we marginalize the planetary orbital parameters (e, i, ω, Ω, M 0 ) are those predicted for randomly-oriented orbits at random phases. We are effectively assuming there is no preference of orbital orientation to location in the Galaxy or host star properties, which would mean that any uncertainties introduced into our analysis by unknown orbital parameters should be naturally included in our analysis by virtue of marginalizing over these priors. However, we note that orbital eccentricity might actually depend on location in the Galaxy and/or on host star properties, resulting in a potential source of unquantified uncertainty in our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Stellar Metallicities</head><p>The metallicities of the microlensing and direct imaging samples are unknown, however it is reasonable to expect that at least the microlensing sample should have a significantly different distribution than those of the RV and direct imaging surveys. The RV and direct imaging samples are limited to nearby M stars (within tens of parsecs), whereas microlensing probes stellar hosts several kpc into the Galaxy. Multiple studies have measured a Galactic metallicity gradient (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheng et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hayden et al. 2014</ref>) with metallicity decreasing as distance from the Galactic center increases. The metallicities of the disk lenses (and at least a fraction of bulge lenses; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bensby et al. 2013</ref>) are therefore expected to be enhanced relative to the local RV and direct imaging samples. Despite this, and the fact that there is a strong correlation between giant planet frequency and host star metallicity measured by RV surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gonzalez 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>), we found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a)</ref> that the measurements of giant planet frequency made by RV and microlensing surveys are consistent without a need to correct for any metallicity effects. This is discussed at length in § 6.4 of Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2014a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Non-M Dwarf Lens Contamination in Microlensing Samples</head><p>The rate of microlensing events along a given sight line depends explicitly on the lens mass distribution function since Γ ∝ θ E ∝ M 1/2 l (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gaudi 2012</ref>). The slope of the mass function is such that there are greater number of low-mass stars relative to higher-mass stars, and therefore a majority of lenses are M dwarfs. However, there is some level of contamination of the microlensing samples by earlier spectral types (mostly GK), and stellar remnants. An estimated ∼ 20% of microlensing events are due to remnants (primarily white dwarfs) and are essentially completely indistinguishable from other types of lenses by their timescale distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gould 2000)</ref>. Nevertheless, we expect the uncertainties due to any such contamination to be small in comparison with the Poisson errors due to the small number of planet detections in the microlensing samples that are included in our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Planet Evolutionary Models</head><p>For the purposes of comparing our planet population models with the results of direct imaging surveys, we must derive the expected planet-to-star constrast, ∆mag(m p , age, distance), for each system. Expected absolute H and/or K s band magnitudes of each planet are estimated using the planet evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> given the planet's mass and age; the latter is assumed to be the same as the host's age. These are then converted into apparent magnitudes using the distance of the host. The contrast is then simply the difference between the apparent magnitude of the planet and that of the host in the appropriate band. While the uncertainties in the ages and distances of these systems are somewhat taken into account in our analysis by marginalizing over the appropriate probability density functions of these measurements (see below for additional discussion), uncertainties in the planet evolutionary models themselves are not.</p><p>There are two classes of these models, "cold start" (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) and "hot start" (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. 2003)</ref>, which are broadly distinguished by their assumptions about the initial conditions of a newly-formed protoplanet concomitant with different formation mechanisms. The "cold-start" models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> we adopt in this paper follow the prescription of giant planet formation by core accretion presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Marley et al. (2007)</ref>. In their implementation, gas accreting onto the core during the phase of runaway gas accretion (occurring after the gaseous envelope has reached a mass roughly equal to that of the core and has hydrodynamically collapsed onto the core) is able to quickly radiate away most of its initial gravitational potential energy, lowering its specific entropy and causing the gas to reach thermal equilibrium with the local radiation field. This is the key reason for the significantly lower luminosity (at early ages) of the "cold-start" models relative to "hot-start" models. The "hot-start" models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> require newly-formed giant planets to slowly radiate all of their initial gravitational potential energy, and thus have initially high entropy, as would be expected for planets formed directly by gravitational collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012</ref>). For a planet of a given luminosity, this amounts to a basic degeneracy in the models between its mass, initial conditions, and age, such that even if we knew the exact age, it would not be clear which model best describes the planet's evolutionary state since we do not know the exact formation mechanism.</p><p>Not only are the luminosities of planets of a given mass and age quite discrepant between the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> up to ages of some tens of Myr, or even ∼ 100 Myr for more massive planets with m p 5 M Jup , due to various assumptions about their initial conditions, but their spectra (and thus their apparent brightness in the various photometric bands) are also sensitive to the assumed atmospheric conditions (e.g. clouds, composition). Indeed, the treatment of atmospheric chemistry and condensation differs between the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>, resulting in non-convergence at late times when the initial conditions have been forgotten.</p><p>Our assumption that the ages of the planets are the same as that of their host could also be a source of uncertainty in our analysis. Giant planet formation by core accretion is believed to take place over the course of several Myr (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008</ref>, and references therein) before dispersal of the gaseous disk, while formation by direct gravitational collapse can occur as quickly as a few orbital periods (∼ dynamical time; Boss 2000) and up to some ∼ 0.5 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Helled et al. 2006</ref>) if captured planetesimals heat up the contracting protoplanet. Thus, without knowledge of the exact formation mechanism of each planet, we could be overestimating its age by up to several Myr when using the "cold-start" models. It could also be the case that there are two channels of planet formation, with some planets being formed by core accretion and others by fragmentation. Our hope is that by performing our analysis twice, once with each class of models, we can bracket the range of expected luminosities for a given planet mass and age.</p><p>We also note that these planet evolutionary models are poorly calibrated, and comparisons with the few existing benchmark brown dwarfs have revealed significant discrepancies between the model predicted luminosities and the actual measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dupuy et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Dupuy et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Crepp et al. 2012</ref>). These studies have found that evolutionary models systematically underpredict luminosities by factors of up to 2 − 3, corresponding to mass overestimates between 15 − 30 percent. This caveat should be kept in mind when interpreting our conclusions.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do not find a significant difference between our results derived from the "hot-" and "coldstart" calculations (see § 5.2 for discussion), so we do not consider the use (or choice) of an evolutionary model a dominant source of uncertainty in our analysis (at least not over the region of parameter space we are constraining).</p></div>

The semimajor axis distribution function we adopt, dN pl /d log a ∝ a β , is related, but not equivalent, to dN pl /d log s due to conflation with the distributions of lens masses and distances, and possibly the distribution of projection angles (a function of e, i, ω, and M 0 ).

We plot these best-fit values of γ as a function of β in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 30</ref>. We find in both the "hot-" and "cold-start" cases that our results are consistent with an¨Opik an¨ an¨Opik's Law distribution (i.e. γ = 0; ¨ Opik 1924) over some range of the 68% confidence interval we derive on β (the range of β plotted in each panel), although γ can differ significantly across the full confidence interval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Comparisons with "Intermediate Data Products"</head><p>The most correct and robust way to perform this study would be to compare our planet distribution model directly to the data collected by each respective survey. For example, to compare with long-term trends detected by the CPS TRENDS survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. (2014)</ref>, we would need to follow the procedure outlined below.</p><p>1. For a given planet population, map each (m p , a) pair into the observables (K, P ), marginalizing over the appropriate stellar and orbital parameters.</p><p>2. Using the derived (K, P ), generate simulated RV curves with the same number of observations and cadence for each star in the actual CPS sample, including uncertainties due to systematics and stellar jitter. Variations in orbital parameters (including phases) are included as part of the mapping (m p , a) → (K, P ).</p><p>3. Pass these simulated RV curves through the detection pipeline of the CPS TRENDS survey to determine which planets produce detectable trends.</p><p>4. Compute the probability that the detected trends have accelerations consistent with the actual trends reported by the CPS. For any trends we expect to be deteced by the CPS that are not actually detected, we would compute the associated Poisson probability.</p><p>5. Multiplying together these probabilities, assign the planet population model under consideration a statistical weight. Repeat this procedure for all populations to constrain the parameters of our model, {α, β, A, a out }.</p><p>Similar types of analyses would be performed to compare our planet models to microlensing and direct imaging surveys. Such a study would require all original data and detection software for each survey, and thus would be much more involved than the methods we have developed. However, given the levels of uncertainty due to the sources discussed previously in this section, we believe such a careful analysis is currently unwarranted. We instead compare our planet population model to "intermediate data products" of the various surveys we consider. This results in sources of unquantified uncertainty that are only somewhat alleviated by the fact that we use the appropriate detection limits (or estimates thereof). Returning to the case of comparison with the trends detected by the CPS, our methodology is to use estimated detection limits (taking into account the actual number of observations, stellar jitter, measurement uncertainties, and time baseline of observations) for each star in their sample in the following manner. The derived observables, (K, P ), for each planet in a given population is determined to be either detectable or undetectable given the estimated sensitivites. We then assign a statistical weight to the population under consideration based on the total number of trends we expect to be detected by the CPS TRENDS survey and the likelihood function we approximate for their survey (see § 1) on the total (actual) number of detected trends. The "intermediate data product" to which we compare for the CPS is thus the total number of detected trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we assume a planet distribution function described by a simple, power-law form with four free parameters: d 2 N pl /(d log m p d log a) = A(m p /M Sat ) α (a/2.5 AU) β , with an outer cutoff radius of the separation distribution function of a out . We generate random planet populations from this distribution function, map their properties into the observables relevant to microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys, and compare the expected observations (determined using the actual detection limits) to the reported results of the five surveys we consider. We find that each survey individually can only constrain combinations of the parameters {α, β, A, a out }, but by performing a simultaneous analysis with the results of all surveys, we demonstrate that there is a single planet population that is consistent with them all. Each survey is sensitive to different, yet complementary, regions of parameter space with varying amounts of mutual overlap. This is important, as it allows each survey to sample the planet distribution function over different ranges of planet masses and semimajor axes, providing powerful constraints on the properties of planets at large separations. We find that the combination of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sumi et al. (2010)</ref> microlensing surveys tightly constrain α and A. With these two parameters (essentially) fixed, including the results of the CPS TRENDS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. 2014</ref>) places a lower bound on the allowed values of β and a out in order to explain the four significant long-term RV drifts that <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Montet et al. (2014)</ref> (convincingly) argue must be due to giant planets. However, we find that the subsequent inclusion of the results of the GDPS Lafrenì ere et al. 2007) and PALMS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowler et al. 2015</ref>) direct imaging surveys can only place relatively weak constraints on the values of β and a out , and we are left with a large range of allowed values on these two parameters.</p><p>The median values and 68% confidence intervals of the parameters of a planet population consistent with microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys that we derive when assuming "hot-start" planet evolutionary models are α = −0.86 +0.21 −0.19 , β = 1.1 +1.9 −1.4 , A = 0.21 +0.20 −0.15 dex −2 , and a out = 10 +26 −4.7 AU, and when assuming "cold-start" evolutionary models, we find α = −0.85 +0.21 −0.19 , β = 1.1 +1.9 −1.3 , A = 0.21 +0.20 −0.15 dex −2 , and a out = 12 +50 −6.2 AU. We find that while the results from our analysis assuming "hot-start" evolutionary models are slightly more constraining than those we find when assuming "coldstart" models, the difference is not significant. The lack of a significant difference can be attributed to a few reasons: 1) the difference in the predicted luminosities between the two classes of models decreases with planet mass at all ages, 2) our assumed power-law form for the planet distribution function, and 3) the most likely range of a out we find lies within a region where direct imaging surveys are mostly insensitive to planets. We find that α is relatively well-constrained to negative values, meaning the mass function is heavily weighted towards lower-mass planets. The predicted luminosities for lower-mass planets differ less between the "hot-" and "cold-start" models relative to the more massive planets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>). Furthermore, because our assumed planet distribution function has a power-law form, small changes in α, β, and/or a out can have a dramatic effect on the number of expected planet detections. Additionally, as the projected separation of a planet approaches the inner working angle, its detectability by direct imaging surveys dramatically decreases, meaning that we do not predict any detections of planets with projected separations r ⊥ 10 AU for either imaging survey, regardless of our choice of evolutionary model.</p><p>The degeneracy between β and a out suffered by our comparison with the results of direct imaging surveys, where arbitrarily large values of β are allowed when a out 10 AU (where these surveys are insensitive to planet detections) and large values of a out are allowed for small values of β (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 25</ref>), limits our ability to derive tight constraints on these two parameters. If we knew the value of either β or a out , we would immediately be able to break this degeneracy and derive much better constraints. Observational studies measuring (sub-)millimeter-wave continuum emission from protoplanetary disks around young M stars have inferred a wide range of characteristic radii, beyond which the dust surface density declines exponentially, between ∼ 20 − 200 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews &amp; Williams 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Isella et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Andrews et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guilloteau et al. 2011</ref>). The median value and 68% confidence interval we derive on a out are consistent with these observed disk sizes, however the long tail towards larger a out where direct imaging surveys lose sensitivity due to a limited FOV thus seems less likely than we estimate for a out 200 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 27</ref>). While planets formed in the disk could be placed into such very long-period orbits due to dynamical processes, such as planet-planet scattering, they are unlikely to end up on stable orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Futhermore, in a cluster environment, the timescale for planet "ionization" by passing stars is ∼ 200 Myr(n/pc −3 ) −1 (a/200 AU) −1 (v/0.3 km s −1 ) −1 , where n is the number density of stars and v is the relative velocity between the planetary system and the passing star <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Antognini &amp; Thompson 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we find that a single, continuous, jointpower law distribution function in both planet mass and semimajor axis can simultaneously explain existing observations from microlensing, RV, and direct imaging. However, we acknowledge the fact that the true planet distribution function is probably more complicated, with breaks in both mass and semimajor axis, and multiple power-law slopes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dodson-Robinson et al. (2009)</ref> demonstrate that giant planet formation by gravitational instability can succeed at large separations, but, even under the most favorable conditions, in situ giant planet formation by core accretion cannot occur beyond a ∼ 20 AU around M stars. Furthermore, outward migration of giant planets from the inner disk to large separations seems implausible <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pepli´nskiPepli´nski et al. 2008)</ref>, and although planet-planet scattering can shuffle giant planets out to large separations, it is unlikely they end up on stable orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009</ref>). Thus, if the mode of giant planet formation switches from core accretion to disk fragmentation as separation from the host star increases, it is reasonable to expect that the distribution of semimajor axes will have at least one break. The different formation mechanisms probably lead to distinct mass functions as well. However, since the existing observations can be explained by our simple distribution</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
