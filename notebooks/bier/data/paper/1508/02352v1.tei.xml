				<p>The imaging channel on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is equipped with four coronagraphs that provide high contrast imaging capabilities for studying faint point sources and extended emission that would otherwise be overwhelmed by a bright point-source in its vicinity. Such bright sources might include stars that are orbited by exoplanets and circumstellar material, mass-loss envelopes around post-main-sequence stars, the near-nuclear environments in active galaxies , and the host galaxies of distant quasars. This paper describes the coron-agraphic observing modes of MIRI, as well as performance estimates based on measurements of the MIRI flight model during cryo-vacuum testing. A brief-2-outline of coronagraphic operations is also provided. Finally, simulated MIRI coronagraphic observations of a few astronomical targets are presented for illustration .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High contrast imaging has made major strides since the first coronagraphs were used by Lyot to investigate the Solar Corona <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lyot 1939)</ref>. The success of coronagraphy using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 1 showed the clear advantage of the very stable environment achieved with space-based platforms, while the complementary successes of ground-based systems showed the importance of achieving very small Inner Working Angles (IWAs).</p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was recognized during its early development as a powerful platform for studying exoplanets, or more generally, circumstellar environments. In consequence, coronagraphic devices were foreseen as integral components of the science instruments. The potential is particularly large in the deep thermal regime where the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) operates, wavelengths where very faint objects can be detected by JWST in comparison with the limited sensitivity of even the largest groundbased telescopes. Therefore, in addition to a classical Lyot coronagraph, MIRI incorporates one of the most innovative concepts, the four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph (4QPM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rouan et al. 2000</ref>) to achieve this capability. At the time of the MIRI conceptual design phase, only a few coronagraphic technologies had been validated both in the laboratory and on-sky ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baudoz et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boccaletti et al. 2004</ref>); the 4QPM appeared to be the best option to provide the smallest possible IWA of ∼ 1λ/D at MIRI wavelengths (in this case, 10 -16 µm).</p><p>Direct imaging of exoplanets is one of the most challenging topics in modern astrophysics as it requires a large instrumental contrast, and hence very good optical quality. By the time of JWST's scheduled launch in late 2018, SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>) and GPI (Gemini Planet Imager, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>) will have been operating for nearly five years. These near-IR (0.95-2.3µm), eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) facilities will have likely discovered dozens of young giant planets that JWST will be able to observe at complementary wavelengths <ref type="bibr">(5-28µm)</ref>, improving the spectral characterization of the planet atmospheres and measuring their energy balance. In addition, the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) operating in the thermal infrared <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hinz 2009)</ref> will provide insights to the behavior of planetary systems at higher angular resolution than can be achieved with MIRI on JWST.</p><p>In addition, MIRI coronagraphy will enable a range of investigations to measure structures in circumstellar disks, potentially identifying locations of forming planets, or the influence of unseen planets on the circumstellar material. It will also enable detailed studies of the circumnuclear environments in active galaxies, potentially probing the connection between star-formation and outflows powered by the central supermassive black holes. Thus, high contrast capabilities provided by MIRI in the mid-infrared will open new frontiers in a variety of astrophysical contexts that have never been accessible before.</p><p>This paper updates the descriptions of the MIRI coronagraph performance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boccaletti et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cavarroc et al. (2008)</ref>. Section 2 introduces the coronagraphic modes available in MIRI and section 4 describes the numerical simulations and the expected raw contrast performance. Section 3 presents the contrast performance measured in the lab during the integration and test of the flight model. Section 5 discusses the target acquisition procedure that is specific for the MIRI coronagraph. The potential interest of MIRI for exoplanet and disk science is illustrated in section 6 together with simulated observations of known targets. Finally, we indicate in section 7 some possible expansions of the high-contrast capabilities of MIRI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Coronagraph Implementation</head><p>MIRI has four individual coronagraphs, one of which is based on the classic design of Lyot and three of which are based on four-quadrant phase masks (4QPMs). The classical Lyot coronagraph places an occulting spot in the focal plane to block the light from a bright point source from entering the instrument. Typically, this spot is of order 3 − 6λ/D in radius so that it blocks the majority of the light from the Airy core including a few bright rings. Nonetheless, some extraneous light escapes 1.) as the diffraction pattern associated with the telescope aperture and a particular coronagraph design, and 2.) as phase and amplitude aberrations of the wavefront in the optical train. Some of the unwanted light can be intercepted by appropriate Lyot stops, at the expense of lost light, at a reimaged pupil. These stops can remove the diffracted light induced both by the telescope pupil and the coronagraphic occulting spot 2 . However, completely suppressing the telescope diffraction pattern resulting from the multi-mirror JWST primary would require relatively complex stops. For MIRI, a Lyot coronagraph is provided at 23 µm, selected in part because of the lack of suitable transmissive optical materials to fabricate a 4QPM and in part to provide a broad spectral band to maximize the sensitivity on planetary debris disks (currently available 4QPMs are not achromatic).</p><p>Although classical Lyot coronagraphs can provide excellent contrast outside the area blocked by the occulting spot, obviously they are limited with regard to IWA to the projected radius of this spot (≥ 3λ/D). Phase mask coronagraphs are designed to reduce the IWA to near 1λ/D, by replacing the occulting spot with a transparent mask that imparts phase differences in different parts of the focal plane so when the reimaged pupil is formed the light interferes more destructively than with a Lyot mask, hence rejecting the starlight outside the geometrical pupil. There are several implementations of phase-mask coronagraphs based on this principle. The theory of 4QPMs is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rouan et al. (2000) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rouan et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>The 4QPMs in MIRI use an optical element that retards the phase by π in two diagonally opposite quadrants. If a monochromatic source is placed exactly at the center of the resulting four-quadrant phase mask, the rejection is formally complete. The overall operation is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. The MIRI phase masks are monochromatic versions of the 4QPM, that is they are effective at a single wavelength. The MIRI devices generally operate with spectral bandpasses of about 10%. However, the net coronagraphic rejection suffers from several limitations including phase and amplitude aberrations, which are larger in the case of MIRI than the chromaticity caused by the filter bandwidth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Riaud et al. 2003</ref>). As another defect, a point-source lying in between two quadrants is also partly attenuated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Riaud et al. 2001</ref>). Therefore, the 4QPM reduces the sensitivity (at maximum by a factor of 10) in the field along the four edges of the mask (in a width of about 1λ/D).</p><p>All four of the coronagraphic masks are implemented in the entrance field of the MIRI imager on a frame supporting four sub-fields of view; the three 4QPMs provide fields of 24 ×24 , while the free-standing Lyot spot mask is held by supporting bars across a 30 ×30 aperture. The mounting arrangement, along with that for the low resolution spectrograph slit, is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The location of the coronagraphic fields is shown in a flat field image (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>; they occupy about a third of the detector square field of view. No mechanism is required to utilize the coronagraphs -the telescope is used to position a star on each one as required.</p><p>The Lyot spot mask is machined in aluminium and has a radius of 2.16 , which is 3λ/D in radius at 23µm The 4QPMs are etched in germanium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>) and then anti-reflection coated. The pupil masks, mounted in the filter wheel, are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. The four masks are each associated with an appropriate filter (labeled "C" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) together with an appropriate Lyot stop in the filter wheel where the pupil image is formed. The stops have a transmission of 62% and 72% for the 4QPMs and the Lyot spot mask, respectively. The phase masks were designed to operate at 10.65, 11.40 and 15.50 µm for exoplanet science while the Lyot coronagraph is optimized for 23 µm, in particular for disk imaging. The two bands near 11 µm were selected to allow detection of the NH 3 feature at 10.65 µm in exoplanetary atmospheres. The choice of filter wavelengths for MIRI coronagraphs is discussed further in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boccaletti et al. (2005)</ref>. In practice, the central wavelengths of manufactured filters measured at nominal temperature are well controlled (1% offset at maximum), while the bandwidths can be broader by 40% at maximum.</p><p>A summary of coronagraphic configurations is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The rejection is calculated on-axis and accounts for all the aberrations considered in the simulation (see section 4). The coronagraphs produce a radial attenuation plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, which quantifies the total attenuation of a point-source located on-axis. The 50% transmission radius, defined as the IWA, is about 1λ/D for the 4QPMs and 3.3λ/D for the Lyot spot mask. 100% transmission (relative) is achieved at 3 and 5λ/D for respectively the 4QPM and the Lyot spot.</p></div>

(2003)</ref> and demonstrated on the telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boccaletti et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boccaletti et al. , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boccaletti et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gratadour et al. 2005;</ref>). The laboratory results showed very high performance (raw contrast approaching 10 6 ), although use on ground-based telescopes was challenging because of the level of aberrations left uncorrected by adaptive optics as well as the need to maintain the star precisely on the center of the phase mask, a near-corollary of the small IWA. This issue will be mitigated by operation in space with JWST. Therefore, the focus has shifted to tests of prototypes of the 4QPM coronagraphs for MIRI as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baudoz et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cavarroc et al. (2008)</ref>. The first of these papers concentrates on the specifications and manufacture of the 4QPM itself, optimized for the mid-infrared as required for MIRI. It considers the requirements on the chromaticity of the mask material, how well its dimensions must be matched to the wavelength of operation, and the fidelity that must be achieved at the intersection of the four quadrants (where the star image must be placed). It shows the results of a variety of manufacturing possibilities and demonstrates good results using germanium as the mask material. The steps between quadrants on this successful mask were reactive ion etched. The second paper is concerned with the operation of 4QPMs specifically in MIRI. It describes measurements of the performance of pre-flight phase masks in the MIRI imager test system at CEA-Sacley, including practical effects such as a mis-alignment of the instrument pupil with the telescope exit pupil. These experiments led to further optimization of the coronagraph. The performance with the flight units (next section) was predicted accurately in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Verification in flight instrument</head><p>The performance of the flight coronagraphs was verified in the flight model imager prior to its delivery to be integrated with the full MIRI Optics Module (OM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ronayette et al. 2010</ref>). The test arrangement of a warm source outside the cryostat with heavy filtering to block room-temperature thermal radiation is described in Paper III. A 30 µm diameter pinhole source (much smaller than the FWHM of the diffraction pattern) in the external apparatus was scanned in a raster pattern to measure the response of the coronagraphs, with results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>. The faint extended residual in the image to the right is due to local heating of the surroundings of the pinhole infrared source, which is not rejected by the coronagraph and places an artificial floor on its contrast performance.</p><p>The coronagraph shows good rejection of the central point spread function (PSF), by a factor larger than 100 on-axis (up to a few hundreds), although the level of rejection is probably limited more by the experimental limitations than by the coronagraph. The scans also showed that the IWA, defined as the angle with 50% of the maximum transmission, is at 1.3 λ/D for the 4QPM units. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the measured contrast as a function of distance from the center of the PSF, and demonstrates that it agrees closely with theoretical expectations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Coronagraph contrast performance</head><p>With the performance of the coronagraph itself confirmed, we now turn to simulations of its operation in JWST. Two models are under evaluation: Case A makes relatively optimistic assumptions about the wave front error, while Case B is more conservative.</p><p>The simulation of MIRI coronagraphy under Case A is performed in two steps, first the calculation of coronagraphic images and PSFs themselves and then a photometric treatment that includes sources of noise. The images are modeled with a Fourier-based approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boccaletti et al. (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The model accounts for the telescope pupil (18 hexagonal segments separated by small gaps) and phase aberrations (independent on each segment), for a total of ∼130 nm root mean square (rms) (mid and high frequencies) wavefront error (WFE), as well as a global low order aberration in the form of defocus equivalent to 2 mm at the telescope focal plane. In the pupil plane (filter wheel), the position of the Lyot stop can be mis-aligned so it is offset by 3% of the size of the pupil and includes also a 0.5 • rotation with respect to the perfect pupil orientation. To model the telescope pointing variations the calculation of the coronagraphic image is repeated 200 times with a 1-sigma dispersion of 7 mas (corresponding to the current specifications for JWST) and all realizations are summed in the end. A reference star image is calculated simultaneously (same setup as the target) but considering different jitter realizations. We assume that the target/reference duty cycle can be short enough to neglect the variation of the wavefront errors and consider that the target to reference mismatch is driven by the pointing precision of 5 mas (the JWST pointing requirement at 1-sigma/axis). Finally, several off-axis images (PSFs) are generated in the field at various positions (0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , 10 ) to account for the coronagraphic radial attenuation (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Both types of coronagraphs are included in the simulation, the 4QPM and the Lyot spot mask. For the broad band filter F2300C, polychromatic images are generated according to the tabulated transmission of this filter; the 4QPM coronagraphs were simulated with their integral filters. Raw coronagraphic contrasts (azimuthally averaged), corresponding to the first step of the simulation (free of detection noise), are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, together with 5-σ post-processing contrasts after reference star subtraction. This last step provides an estimate of the maximum contrast achievable directly with this technique. However, in addition to this simple, single reference star subtraction, several more advanced post-processing techniques have been developed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lafreniere et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Soummer et al. 2012</ref>) and should be implemented to improve this limit of detection.</p><p>We now consider Case B, which assumes a WFE of 204 nm and the specification offsetting accuracy (dispersion of 7 mas 1-σ per axis with different realization for the star and the reference). Jitter is not included. Model results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. While the achieved contrast is a fairly strong function of optimal positioning within the coronagraph, it is even more sensitive to the relative locations of the science target and the reference star (see, e.g, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cavarroc et al. 2008</ref>). The comparison with the Case A simulation reflects our current uncertainty about the exact parameters that are applicable and how their effects change with wavelength (e.g., the current work indicates a greater difference between Cases A and B at 15.5 µm than at 11.4 µm). Work is continuing to understand these differences and to use the knowledge gained to optimize coronagraphic observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Full system performance</head><p>The second part of the simulation includes the detection noise. We illustrate the procedure for Case A. The photon noise in the coronagraphic image depends on the star distance and spectral type, telescope area (25 m 2 ), telescope and optics transmission (85%), the detector spectral response (i.e., quantum efficiency maximum of ∼80% at ∼15µm ), the Lyot stop transmission (62% for 4QPM, 72% for Lyot spot and 100% for Lyot bar), and the integration time. The net transmission in the coronagraphic filters is about 15-20%. The intensity of the most distant off-axis PSF at 10 serves as a normalization factor for all simulated images, as if it were an observation of the unocculted star. In addition, we assume that the reference star is identical to the target star in terms of magnitude and spectrum.</p><p>At the level of the detector, we included read out noise (20e-RMS), and flat field stability (0.1%). The thermal background accounts for several components: the zodiacal light dominates at λ &lt; 15µm, while at longer wavelengths the telescope (primary and secondary mirrors) as well as the deployable tower assembly shield and sunshield are mostly responsible for the thermal emission. Overall the model corresponds well to the specifications of 3.9 MJy/sr at 10µm and 200 MJy/sr at 20µm (the possible higher emission from the sunshield than originally expected will compromise the performance of the Lyot system, but has less effect on the shorter wavelength coronagraphs). The performance presented in this section is strongly related to the end-to-end optical system assumptions, such as the wavefront error and the whole optical train stability of the telescope. The simulated performance may be conservative, particularly with the development of operations and analysis techniques optimized for JWST. In any case, the current model will have to be updated once the telescope is on orbit and commissioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Operations and Target Acquisition</head><p>MIRI operations, including coronagraphy, are discussed in <ref type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2014: Paper X)</ref>. Here we briefly discuss the operations unique for coronagraphy, particularly target acquisition (TA). To achieve maximum contrast, all coronagraph observations will require TA to center the target accurately on the coronagraph. The 4QPMs are particularly sensitive to slight offsets from the optimum location <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 1</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cavarroc et al. 2008</ref>). The Lyot coronagraph is less sensitive to small offsets, but still requires precise, and repeatable TAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Target acquisition</head><p>The basic approach to coronagraphic TA starts by selecting a suitable filter. For faint objects, the filter can simply be that associated with the coronagraphic mask, but for very bright objects, a neutral density filter will be needed. The target is initially placed at a fiducial location within the coronagraphic field of view. An exposure is obtained, a centroid is found for the target, and the offset necessary to move the target to the optimal location at the center of the coronagraph is calculated. The observatory then makes a small angle maneuver to place the target at the proper location in the coronagraph. Once the maneuver is complete the observatory enters "fine lock," which maintains precise pointing control throughout the observation. If the neutral density filter was used for TA, then the correct mask filter is selected for observations (the ordering of this step is under study, in case it is advantageous to move to the mask filter before maneuvering to the coronagraph position). A TA must be executed for observations obtained with each coronagraph separately. Thus, a science program that requires observations using multiple coronagraphs will need to take these additional TAs into account.</p><p>Two effects make the TA process complex: 1.) for the 4QPM coronagraphs, the phase mask can distort the image of a star close to its center and undermine the accuracy of the centroid determination; and 2.) the detector arrays have latent images (Paper VII) that could mimic planets or other exciting astronomical phenomena if the centroiding process left them close to the target star. These effects would make adequate TA very difficult at the nominal JWST offsetting accuracy specifications. Fortunately, it is projected that small angle offsets up to 20 distance will be much more accurate than dictated by the requirements. For example, an offset of up to 20 is expected to be accurate to 5 mas (1-σ per axis). Simulations of the centering accuracy on the coronagraph using the projected performance and a fiducial distance of 2 from the coronagraph center indicate a scatter of ∼7 mas (rms) and average centering errors of 2 -4 mas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lajoie et al. 2014</ref>). The details depend on the particular strategy, i.e., whether one utilizes a single position for target acquisition, or uses more than one to acquire additional information about the pointing. None of the strategies quite reaches the desired centering performance for the 4QPM coronagraphs (the Lyot is much more relaxed in this area), so further optimization is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Coronagraphic observations and results</head><p>After the TA process is complete, images are acquired until the necessary on-source integration time is achieved. The details of the actual operation of the detectors, their calibration and data reduction are described in <ref type="bibr">Ressler et al. (2014, Paper VIII)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2014, Paper X)</ref>.</p><p>To maximize contrast, most coronagraphic observations will require coronagraphic observations of a "reference star," whose image is then subtracted from the science target image(s). Typically this will be a star that is of similar or greater brightness compared with the science target; this ensures equal or greater signal to noise for the reference star in a similar or shorter amount of total integration time. The procedure for obtaining these observations is identical to that for the science target, including the TA.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 4, several techniques and algorithms for improving contrast have been developed that are more sophisticated than the classical reference star subtraction method. One is angular differential imaging (ADI), where the target and reference star are observed at multiple orientations of the observatory. Because the diffraction patterns and detector artifacts are fixed to the telescope reference frame, they move relative to the target when the observatory is rolled. Subtracting two (or more) rolled images removes, or at least reduces, these diffraction and detector features. JWST has limited roll capability (±5 • ), because it must keep the sunshield correctly positioned relative to the Sun, but will still provide sufficient angular roll for some science cases at large enough angular separations from the star. Larger roll angles can be achieved by observing the objects at different epochs during the year albeit with more significant changes in the wavefront error compared to back-to-back observations. Another class of enhancement is centered on sophisticated image analysis techniques, such as LOCI or KLIP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lafreniere et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Soummer et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Illustration of Dedicated Science Cases</head><p>This section presents a few science cases making use of the capabilities of the MIRI coronagraphs. We compare the simulated performance metrics presented in Section 4 with the expected flux densities from giant planets orbiting solar type stars out to 10 pc. We also present simulated observations of the emblematic HR 8799 planetary system discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marois et al. (2008)</ref>, and observations of the debris disk associated with HD 181327. These examples illustrate the promise of the MIRI coronagraph in the context of exoplanet and disk science. In the case of exoplanets, MIRI coronagraphic imaging will: 1.) measure effective temperatures; 2.) determine bolometric luminosities; 3.) measure the ammonia absorption feature (sensitive to the presence of ammonia clouds and to the atmospheric temperature); and 4.) in combination with shorter wavelength measurements, support comprehensive modeling of the atmospheric properties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnefoy et al. 2013</ref>). In the case of debris disks, the capability will let us: 1.) explore the virtually unknown region between about 1 and 30 AU, containing for example the ice lines (not resolved with Spitzer, too low in surface brightness for HST or groundbased telescopes); 2.) constrain the minerology of planetary debris; and 3.) search for structures maintained by larger bodies in planetary systems.</p></div>

The radial transmission of the coronagraph for each modeled planet is highlighted with dotted lines.</p><p>For synthetic photometry of planets, we used the BDcond2000 models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allard et al. (2001)</ref> integrated over the MIRI filters. Several test cases were considered: 300 K, 400 K, 500 K with a radius of 1.0 R J and 500 K, 1000 K, 1500 K with a radius of 1.4 R J .</p><p>At a separation of 1 , the contrasts expected, even for simple reference star-subtracted coronagraphy, enable detection in F1140C of 1.0 R J planets with temperature of 500 K (respectively 350 K) orbiting a G0V(respectively M0V) star. The situation is more favorable in F1550C where a 400 K temperature is reached at 1 from a G0V star. For example, the β Pic b planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lagrange et al. 2010</ref>) has a temperature of 1600-1700 K and a large radius (1.3-1.6 R J , <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnefoy et al. 2013</ref>), hence should be brighter than any planet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, so almost visible in raw coronagraphic images (providing the debris disk itself is fainter than the planet). Post-processing should yield a very high signal to noise detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Imaging HR 8799</head><p>For the simulations of HR 8799, we assumed an A0V star at 40pc, and 3 hours of onsource integration in each MIRI filter. The planets b, c, and d, were assigned temperatures of 900 K, 1100 K and 1100 K with identical radii of 1.25 R J . The corresponding contrasts in each filter, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allard et al. (2001)</ref>, are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The angular separations are 1.72 , 0.96 , 0.62 for planet b, c and d. Some of the planets are close enough to the center of the 4QPM coronagraphs to be attenuated significantly. Planet b is always at a separation larger than 3λ/D in any filter so it is not impacted. Planet c is inward of 3λ/D in F1065C, F1140C and F1550C, and hence is attenuated by 10, 15 and 30%, respectively. Similarly, planet d is attenuated by 35, 40, 40% in the same coronagraphic filters. Simulated images are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>.</p><p>Planets b and c are detected at all wavelengths, while planet d is only visible at 15.5µm. Signal to noise ratios measured in the brightest pixel are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. These numbers, if integrated over a PSF size can be as large as 100 for planet b, for instance. The apparent elongation of planet d in the F1550C filter (in which the star residuals are fainter than the planets and the background level) is in fact due to the presence of planet e nearby. These images were used to measure the planet photometry and to compare with the initial planet intensity. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> for planet b, where the solid line represents the model degraded to a spectral resolution of R = 20, red points stand for the initial photometry and blue points are the measurements obtained in each filter. There is good agreement in the four filters around λ = 10µm. At F1550C the departure of the measured intensity from the true value is larger and likely the result of residual diffraction on one side and background noise on the other side. This does not mean MIRI will fail to obtain accurate photometry in these cases but rather that a special analysis will be required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">The HD 181327 debris disk</head><p>Another example of MIRI coronagraphic capabilities is given for the case of an extended object. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> shows simulated images of the ring-like debris disk around the star HD 181327 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schneider et al. 2006</ref>). Here, we assumed an F5V central star, located at 50pc, and observed for 1 hour in each MIRI filter. The disk model corresponds to a ∼90 AU-wide belt containing 0.05 M ⊕ (up to 1 mm) of icy and porous, silicates and carbonaceous dust grains in collisional equilibrium. This model was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lebreton et al. (2012)</ref> to be the best Bayesian solution to reproduce the disk Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from mid-infrared to millimeter wavelengths, assuming the radial brightness profile measured in newly-reduced HST/NICMOS scattered-light images. Scattering and absorption efficiencies as well as equilibrium temperatures were computed as a function of grain size distribution and composition using state-of-the-art radiative transfer techniques. Monochromatic images were produced at the effective wavelength of each filter. They include a scattering phase function with g HG = 0.3 as seen in the HST images; their absolute flux is conservatively scaled to the HST one at 1.1 µm to correct for the limited capability to predict scattering properties. The transition between scattering-and thermal emission-dominated regimes occurs around 10 µm, which turns out to be the least favorable band for imaging due to an unfavorable compromise between contrast and resolution. The corresponding star to disk total flux ratio is 154, 48, 3.5, 0.16, respectively in F1065C, F1140C, F1550C, F2300C filters. The 86 AU ring-like pattern is obvious in all images as well as the north/south asymmetry. The 23µm image is sensitive to the outer part of the disk while the central cavity is blocked by the Lyot spot. Compared to the HST images obtained in the near-IR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schneider et al. 2006</ref>) and visible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schneider et al. 2014</ref>), the MIRI images have greatly reduced stellar residuals in the center and will allow a cleaner analysis of the dust grain properties based on mid IR colors. In addition, the ring disk is seen close to face-on and hence would be immune to the gain brought by angular differential imaging in ground-based observations. Here, for simplicity we assumed that the radial transmission of 4QPMs is isotropic, so we did not model the cross-like pattern of this coronagraph where the field is partially obscured. In practice, for extended objects, observations at multiple rolls (at least two at 45 • ) will enable "filling in" the gaps caused by the 4QPM boundaries and by the support bar in the Lyot coronagraph.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Expanding the wavelength coverage</head><p>MIRI coronagraphy is centered on four filters, which can be regarded as a minimum set for spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres considering the large spectral range available. In particular, wavelengths shorter than 10µm carry the signatures of water vapor and methane, which are expected to be abundant in giant planet atmospheres. In principle, one can use the broad band filters for imaging (labeled "W" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>) in combination with the Lyot mask. The absence of a Lyot stop to accompany these filters significantly reduces the coronagraphic rejection. However, the bar supporting the Lyot mask is sufficiently large compared to the size of the Airy disk, especially at the shortest wavelengths, for some coronagraphic effect to occur using the bar as the focal plane occulter. At a minimum, these non-standard degraded coronagraphic modes should be considered as anti-saturation devices rather than coronagraphs, but they can still can be very beneficial for observing near bright stars. There are currently no plans to implement these modes on-orbit. However, we present them here for completeness and to advocate interest in them.</p><p>To illustrate their application, similarly to section 4, we performed simulations of the Lyot bar mask for three imaging filters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(F560W, F770W, F1000W</ref>). We assume the central source is offset by 6" from the center of the field so the star falls on the bar rather than the Lyot spot. After reference star subtraction, the contrast performance is comparable to that of the coronagraphic modes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14)</ref> as the PSF falls off more rapidly with radius at wavelengths shorter than those passed by the coronagraphic filters. However, we note for F560W and F770W that the coronagraphic effect is really small beyond the IWA, as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Enhancing contrast with micro-offsets</head><p>Another possibility is to obtain multiple observations of the reference star with slightly different positional offsets. JWST has a fine steering mirror (FSM), which is used to compensate for small perturbations in pointing control. The FSM can also be used during coronagraphic imaging programs to perform micro-offsets (sub-pixel), thus building up a library of reference star images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Soummer et al. 2014</ref>) for use in the more sophisticated algorithms. Use of the FSM has the advantage that it does not require any additional TAs, both making this mode very efficient and avoiding additional errors due to small-angle maneuvers. The image library can be used for PSF subtraction with a variety of algorithms (e.g; LOCI or KLIP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lafreniere et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Soummer et al. (2012)</ref>). A preliminary evaluation (at this stage omitting the effects of latent images and pointing jitter, both of which need to be added to future simulations) indicates possible gains in contrast by up to an order of magnitude, when working close to the IWA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Soummer et al. 2014</ref>). This gain comes at the expense of the increased observing time on the reference star, but could be critical to success for demanding observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>The coronagraphic capability of MIRI is unique as it allows high-contrast imaging at wavelengths that are usually not considered for exoplanets and other high-contrast science. With JWST these science applications will become attractive owing to the large aperture and high sensitivity. The MIRI spatial resolution is comparable to those obtained in the near-IR in space with HST. To exploit this opportunity, MIRI includes phase mask coronagraphs, which are able to offer the same IWA as the NIRCAM coronagraphs but at longer wavelengths. Even with simple, single reference star subtraction, we have shown that the expected performance of the MIRI coronagraphs will open a new frontier in the characterization of many astronomical objects from exoplanets, to circumstellar disks, to the near-nuclear regions of nearby active galaxies and the host galaxies of distant quasars.</p><p>For example, our performance analysis indicates that the threshold of detection in terms of planet temperature is very comparable to the one achieved with SPHERE, about 400K. As a consequence, the very same planets detected from the ground in the near IR with 8-m class telescopes will be potential targets for MIRI. MIRI, together with NIRCAM, will complete the spectral characterization and determine the energy balance of young giant planets in large-radius orbits.</p><p>Since the coronagraphic suite of JWST was conceived (before 2005), several new developments have occurred in the field of exoplanet direct imaging, both at the instrumental level but more importantly at the data processing level. The MIRI performance will be enhanced by taking advantage of these new methods for data reduction that have shown significant improvement with respect to older techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lafreniere et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Janson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Soummer et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>

The phase plate modifies the wavefronts to produce the complex amplitude pattern indicated for a source centered exactly on the intersection of the quadrants. The lens behind the telescope focal plane forms a pupil where a traditional Lyot stop is placed to remove part of the diffracted light from the telescope pupil through the coronagraphic mask. When the following lens reimages the focal plane onto the detector, the complex amplitude pattern causes the light from the bright central source to interfere destructively. Figure adapted from Rouan et al. (2007). The layout of a Lyot coronagraph is identical except for the substitution of an occulting spot for the 4QPM.</figDesc></figure>
