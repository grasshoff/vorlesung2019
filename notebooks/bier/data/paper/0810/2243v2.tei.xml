			<abstract>
				<p>As the number of known exoplanets continues to grow, the question as to whether such bodies harbour satellite systems has become one of increasing interest. In this paper, we explore the transit timing effects that should be detectable due to an exomoon and predict a new observable. We first consider transit time variation (TTV), where we update the model to include the effects of orbital eccentricity. We draw two key conclusions: 1) In order to maintain Hill stability, the orbital frequency of the exomoon will always be higher than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the period of the exomoon cannot be reliably determined from TTV, only a set of harmonic frequencies. 2) The TTV amplitude is ∝ M S a S where M S is the exomoon mass and a S is the semi-major axis of the moon&apos;s orbit. Therefore, M S &amp; a S cannot be separately determined. We go on to predict a new observable due to exomoons-transit duration variation (TDV). We derive the TDV amplitude and conclude that its amplitude is not only detectable, but the TDV signal will provide two robust advantages: 1) The TDV amplitude is ∝ M S a −1/2 S and therefore the ratio of TDV to TTV allows for M S and a S to be separately determined. 2) TDV has a π/2 phase difference to the TTV signal, making it an excellent complementary technique.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over 300 exoplanets have been discovered to date with detection rates escalating (see http://exoplanet.eu by J. Schneider). The detections have been so far biased towards large bodies and the smallest transiting planet to date is still Neptune-sized, for Gliese 436b ( <ref type="bibr">Gillon et al. (2007)</ref>). Current instruments cannot yet detect transiting Earths but transit time variation (TTV) could offer a way to bring sensitivity down to sub Earth-mass level <ref type="bibr">(Holman &amp; Murray (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>). Given the large number of moons in our own Solar System, it is reasonable to postulate that satellites are common around exoplanets.</p><p>Another profound motivation for looking for exomoons is that they are likely to be terrestrial in nature, based upon our own Solar System, and hence one would propose that exomoons could be more habitable environments than the host of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) so far discovered.</p><p>Photometric detection of a moon is likely to be exceptionally challenging. An exomoon is likely to be sub-Earth ⋆ E-mail: d.kipping@ucl.ac.uk sized, based upon our Solar System, and so even a specialized transit space-based telescope like COROT will struggle to spot the signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref>). An additional problem lies in the fact that much of the time the exomoon will not appear to be its orbital distance from the planet, but some fraction of it, depending on the orbital phase of the exomoon during transit. The moon can effectively hide behind the planet or in front of it. This makes disentangling the photometric signature exceptionally difficult and was outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Cabrera &amp; Schneider (2007)</ref>.</p><p>Previously, several different authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Szabó et al. (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Simon et al. (2007)</ref>) have noted that transit timing variations (TTV) could be used to indirectly detect the presence of such exomoons. In the first half of this paper, we update the model for the TTV effect by including orbital eccentricity. We compare our formulation to the previously proposed mathematical treatment and demonstrate our model reduces to the original analytic equations for zero eccentricity.</p><p>However, the crucial problem with TTV is that the amplitude of the signal is proportional to both the exomoon mass, MS, and orbital separation, aS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ford &amp; Holman (2007)</ref> referred to this obstacle as the 'inverse problem', in regard to transit timing effects. In §3.1 we show that the exomoon's period cannot be reliably determined from TTV and hence aS remains an unknown. Ergo, one cannot establish the mass of the exomoon without assuming a value for the orbital separation. It is therefore clear that a strong desideratum is a secondary method which can complement TTV and remove this degeneracy and this constitutes the focus of the second part of our paper.</p><p>By considering the transit duration, we predict a new observable timing effect due to an exomoon, which we label as transit duration variation (TDV). We find that the amplitude of this timing signal is of the same order of magnitude to the TTV signal and indeed often larger. The effect is also predicted to be ∝ MSa</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">−1/2 S</formula><p>. Hence, the ratio of TDV to TTV allows for the mass of the exomoon to be found without assuming an orbital distance. In addition, TDV is π/2 out-of-phase with TTV, making it an ideal complementary method for exomoon detection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Outline of the model</head><p>In the first half of this paper, we aim to update the model for the transit timing variation (TTV) signal due a transiting exoplanet with a single satellite of mass MS and non-zero orbital eccentricity. In this work, we consider the variation of the mid-transit point of the planetary transit, TMID. This is in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Simon et al. (2007)</ref> who consider the planet and moon combined transit. Throughout our discussion, we also make the assumption that planet-moon orbital plane is co-aligned with the planet-star orbital plane at i = 90 • .</p><p>In our case, the planet orbits the barycentre of the planet-moon system with a semi-major axis of aW where W denotes wobble. The fact that aW &gt; 0 means that the time between the planet being at the mid-transit point and the barycentre being at the mid-transit point is, in general, non-zero, and this is the origin of the TTV effect.</p><p>Consider the projected distance between the planet and the planet-moon barycentre to be given by x ′ 2 , as illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>. The TTV effect will be given by x ′ 2 divided by thêthê x ′ 2 -direction component of the barycentre's orbital velocity around the star, given by v B⊥ . Since x ′ 2 is a function of the planet's true anomaly around the planet-moon barycentre, fW , so too is the TTV effect:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">TTV(fW ) = x ′ 2 (fW ) v B⊥ (1)</formula><p>In the case of a circular orbit, we expect the TTV signal to have a sinusoidal nature, and infact the peak-to-peak amplitude of the wave may be unambiguously defined as 2aW /v B⊥ . In the case of eccentric orbits, we expect nonsinusoidal waveforms, due to Kepler's Equation. Peak-topeak amplitudes can become ambiguous in such cases, and so we choose to use the root-mean-square (rms) amplitude definition, which is valid for all waveforms. For a simple circular orbit, the rms amplitude of the TTV signal, δT T V , will be given by: <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Cartoon of the star-planet-moon system. In this schematic, the observer lies at˜yat˜ at˜y 2 = +∞ and the exomoon is not shown, but the wobble of the planet due its presence is represented by the smaller ellipse. The origin of the x ′ 2 -y ′ 2 scale denotes the position of the planet-moon barycentre, which itself orbits the star in the˜xthe˜ the˜x 2 -˜ y 2 scale.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δT T V (circular ) = aW √ 2 · v B⊥<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Where the distance aW is small enough that we may assume v B⊥ is a constant over the time-scale of the TTV effect.</p><p>Let us now extend the analysis to include the effect of exomoon orbital eccentricity, eS and position of pericentre, ̟S, as well as planetary eccentricity eP and position of pericentre, ̟P . In appendix A, we derive the general equation for the rms amplitude of the TTV effect due to an exomoon to be given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δT T V = 1 √ 2 · a 1/2 P aSMSM −1 P RV p G(M * + MP RV ) · ζT (eS, ̟S) Υ(eP , ̟P )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ζT = (1 − e 2 S ) 1/4 eS q e 2 S + cos(2̟S)(2(1 − e 2 S ) 3/2 − 2 + 3e 2 S ) (4) Υ = cos h arctan " −eP cos ̟P 1 + eP sin ̟P "i · s 2(1 + eP sin ̟P ) (1 − e 2 P ) − 1 (5)</formula><p>Where aP is the semi-major axis of the exoplanet's orbit around the central star, aS is the semi-major axis of the exomoon's orbit around the exoplanet, G is the gravitational constant, M * is the mass of the host star and MP RV = MS + MP i.e. the combined mass of the exomoon and exoplanet respectively 1 .</p><p>In the case of eS → 0 we have ζT → 1 and similarly for eP → 0 we have Υ → 1. Thus we may compare our equation to that derived by previous authors, who assumed circular orbits, and expect to produce the same result. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref> predicted the peak-topeak amplitude of an exomoon around an exoplanet with orbital period PP to be given by equation (6).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∆tsar99 ∼ 2aSMSM −1 P × PP (2πaP ) −1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Using Kepler's Third Law, it is trivial to show that this is equivalent to our expression, for circular orbits and MP ≫ MS, except for a factor of 2 √ 2, which comes from the fact we use an rms definition of amplitude, rather than a peak-to-peak definition. Thus we have confirmed that our general expression for the TTV effect due to an exomoon is equivalent to the circular equations first derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref>. For completion, we note that the TTV amplitude may be written purely in terms of the masses of the three bodies and the period of the exoplanet (see appendix A, equation (A28) &amp; (A29)).</p><p>The effect of eccentricity is discussed in more detail in §3.3 and typical waveforms produced are shown later in figure 3, §4.2. In §4.2, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives a list of the expected TTV rms amplitudes due to a 1M L exomoon around some of the most promising exoplanet candidates.</p></div>

Therefore, we can only derive a set of harmonic frequencies which the exomoon's orbit could exhibit. We therefore conclude PS cannot be reliably determined from the TTV signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The limitation of TTV in determining MS</head><p>As originally pointed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider (1999)</ref>, the major problem with TTV is that one cannot determine the mass of the exomoon without making an assumption on the distance at which the moon orbits the planet. Using equation (3), it is possible to write the TTV amplitude as a function of purely the exomoon properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">δT T V ∝ MSaS (13)</formula><p>Therefore we can effectively only determine the moment of the exomoon. If one knows the period of the exomoon, then it is trivial to derive aS using Kepler's Third Law, but as seen in §3.1, PP cannot be reliably ascertained.</p><p>This crucial limitation of exomoon TTV makes mass estimation unfeasible and the best we can ever do is merely provide evidence for an exomoon within a large mass range. This severe limitation will be resolved later in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The effect of eccentricity</head><p>The effects of orbital eccentricity on the TTV amplitude are all absorbed into the two parameters, ζT (eS, ̟S) and Υ(eP , ̟P ). If we increase eS from zero to unity, regardless of what value ̟S takes, ζT decreases below 1 and hence the TTV amplitude will always decrease. This implies exomoon detections are biased towards satellites on circular orbits. The situation is more complicated for eP , where a nonzero eP makes the TTV amplitude significantly increased or decreased depending on ̟P . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref>, we plot Υ −1 as a function of ̟P for several different eccentricities and find that for eP &gt; 0, the most favourable position of pericentre is ̟P ∼ 3π/2. However, we point out a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kane &amp; von Braun (2008)</ref> which predicts such exoplanets to possess a low transit probability.</p><p>For the eccentric transiting exoplanets GJ436b, XO3b, HAT-P-2b and HD17156b, Υ −1 takes values 1.01, 1.03, 0.94 and 0.47 respectively. However, the stability of satellites around eccentric exoplanets remains unclear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TRANSIT DURATION VARIATION (TDV)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The TDV due to an exomoon</head><p>Transit duration variation (TDV) is the periodic change in the duration of a transit (τ ) over many measurements, where we define τ as the time between the 1 st and 4 th contact points. It has previously been discussed as a possible test of general relativity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pál &amp; Kocsis (2008)</ref>. In this discussion, we consider the TDV due to an exomoon and conclude that it should produce a detectable signal.</p><p>We first consider that the duration of a transit is inversely proportional to the projected velocity of the planet across the star, v P ⊥ , and make the following assumptions:</p><p>The projected velocity of the planet-moon barycentre during the transit, relative to the star, does not vary significantly over the time-scale of the transit duration.</p><p>The projected velocity of the planet during the transit, relative to planet-moon barycentre, does not vary significantly over the time-scale of the transit duration.</p><p>The orbital inclinations of the planet (i = 90 • ) and exomoon do not vary from orbit to orbit.</p><p>We do not consider additional perturbing bodies in the system.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">τ ∝ 1/v P ⊥<label>(14)</label></formula><p>In this case, any transit duration variation must be solely due to the variation of the velocity. For a single companion exomoon, the velocity of the planet will have two components:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">v P ⊥ = v B⊥ + v W ⊥ (15)</formula><p>where vB is the velocity of the planet-moon barycentre around the host star and vW is the velocity of the planet around the planet-moon barycentre, i.e. the wobble of the planet due its companion satellite. It is clear that v W ⊥ will be significantly different for each transit unless PP /PS is some low-order integer. Sometimes v W ⊥ will be additive to the barycentre's velocity and sometimes subtractive resulting in shorter and longer transit durations respectively; an effect we label TDV.</p><p>The factor by which τ will vary must be equal to the ratio of the velocities R = v W ⊥ /v B⊥ and from this starting point the TDV amplitude may be shown (see appendix C2) to be equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">δT DV = r aP aS · s M 2 S MP RV (MP RV + M * ) · ¯ τ √ 2 · ζD(eS, ̟S) Υ(eP , ̟P )<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ζD(eS, ̟S) = s 1 + e 2 S − e 2 S cos(2̟S) 1 − e 2 S (17)</formula><p>In an analogous way to the TTV amplitude, this may be re-written in terms of simply the masses in the system, and this equation may be found in the appendix C2, equations (C28) and (C29). We also point out that this effect has the following proportionality:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">δT DV ∝ MS · a −1/2 S (18)</formula><p>As a final note, we point out that in §3.3 we discussed how increasing eS tends to decrease the TTV amplitude. For the TDV signal, the opposite is true, increasing eS tends to increase the TDV signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">TTV &amp; TDV as complementary methods</head><p>From equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(13)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(18)</ref>, it is clear that the ratio of TDV to TTV should be able to eliminate MS and we can directly measure the orbital seperation of the exomoon aS and hence MS. The introduction of TDV allows for the precise measurement of MS without any assumption on the orbital separation. Using Kepler's Third Law, it is then possible to derive the exomoon's orbital period, which was shown in §3.1 to be unattainable from TTV alone. In appendix D, it is shown that if we assume eS ≃ 0 (but eP can take any value between zero and unity), then η = δT DV /δT T V is approximately given by: Therefore one may determine χ and hence aS (and MS) if one assumes the exomoon has zero eccentricity. This assumption is supported based on a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Domingos et al. (2006)</ref> and the pattern observed amongst large (&gt; 500km) moons in our own Solar System.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">η = δT DV δT T V ≃ 2π¯ τ PP · √ 3 χ 3/2<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Another major advantage of TDV is that the signal should lag TTV by a π/2 phase difference, originating from the fact TTV is a spatial effect whereas TDV is a velocity effect. Unfortunately, the direction and value of the phase shift remains unchanged between prograde and retrograde satellites.</p><p>Combining TTV and TDV should allow for a much more significant confirmation of a potential exomoon than just using TTV alone. The phase difference can be seen in the example waveforms in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>, where we plot the TTV and TDV waveforms due to a hypothetical exomoon of 1M L around a GJ436b for eS = 0, 0.3 and 0.6.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we predict the TTV and TDV rms amplitudes for a variety of known transiting planets. We include the effects of the known planetary eccentricity, and consider a 1M L exomoon with χ = 1/3 and eS = 0.</p><p>In most cases, the TDV amplitude is actually greater than the TTV amplitude. We do however point out that the error in the transit duration is typically 2-3 times that of the mid-transit time (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref>). Nevertheless, the signal should be detectable, especially with future telescopes like Kepler 3 . It is interesting to note that timing errors of just under 1 second could detect a 1M L around a 11.79MJ exoplanet in the case of XO-3b, a mass ratio of ∼ 3 × 10 −4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">A hypothetical habitable exomoon</head><p>Consider a hypothetical exoplanet which is identical to GJ436b except it has a period of PP = 35.7 days and is on a circular orbit, putting it into the habitable zone of GJ436 with Teq ≃ 300K. Although the Neptune-like planet itself would not be an ideal place to search for life, an Earth mass exomoon would be. Suppose there is a 1M L exomoon with this planet on a circular orbit and χ = 0.25 and hence a period of PS ≃ 2.5 days. Could we detect such a provocative target using timing effects alone?</p><p>The predicted rms TTV amplitude would be 138s and the TDV amplitude would be 60s. For GJ436b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref> used the 1.52m Telescopio Carlos Sánchez telescope and achieved a timing accuracy of ∼ 13 seconds and a duration error of ∼ 50 seconds. This suggests that the detection of the exomoon should be presently possible through TTV from the ground, and feasible with TDV in the near future. This illustrates that even ground-based instruments could detect an Earth-like body in the habitable zone using timing effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented an updated model for the TTV signal due to an exomoon to include the effects of orbital eccentricity in both the exoplanet and the exomoon. From the updated TTV model, we draw the following conclusions:</p><p>(a) TTV is degenerated in that it can only determine MS × aS, where MS is the exomoon mass and aS is the exomoon's orbital radius.</p><p>(b) The TTV due to an exomoon can be significantly enhanced for exoplanets of eP &gt; 0 and ̟P ∼ 270 • . However, it remains unclear how dynamically stable such exomoons would be.</p><p>(c) The TTV frequency will be always be greater than the sampling frequency of once every transit, implying we can only determine a set of possible harmonic frequencies for the exomoon's period, PS.</p><p>An exomoon is predicted to have another detectable timing effect on a transit in the form of transit duration variation (TDV). We have derived an equation for predicting the TDV amplitude and drawn the following conclusions:</p><p>(˜ a) The ratio of TDV to TTV allows for the separate determination of MS and aS; thus solving the 'inverse problem' for exomoons.</p><p>( ˜ b) The TDV signal is of a similar order of magnitude to the TTV signal.</p><p>(˜ c) the TDV signal is also enhanced for eP &gt; 0 and ̟P ∼ 270 • .</p><p>( ˜ d) TDV lags TTV by a 90 • phase difference, making it an excellent complementary technique for exomoon detection.</p><p>We also find that current ground-based telescopes could detect a 1M L exomoon in the habitable zone around a Neptune-like exoplanet. The author would therefore encourage observers to produce not only their mid-transit times, but also transit durations for each transit, rather than composite lightcurve durations. This will allow constraints to be placed on the presence of exomoons around such planets.</p></div>

If we start out with the same setup as the cited author, we have an ellipse located with the centre at the origin of an x ′ -y ′ plot and the barycentre located at (aW eW , 0). We account for the position of periastron (defined in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>) by rotating the ellipse counter-clockwise by an angle ̟W about the z ′ -axis. This gives us the S ′ 1 frame:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">x ′ 1 = x ′ cos ̟W − y ′ sin ̟W (A3) y ′ 1 = x ′ sin ̟W + y ′ cos ̟W (A4)</formula><p>To match the figure, we require a translation to place the planet-moon barycentre at the origin. After applying this translation, we have found the desired S ′ 2 frame.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">x ′ 2 = x ′ 1 − aW eW cos ̟W (A5) y ′ 2 = y ′ 1 − aW eW sin ̟W (A6)</formula><p>Note that eW , the eccentricity of the planet's orbit around the planet-moon barycentre, must be equal to eS. However, ̟W will have a phase difference of π relative to ̟S. In the defined ellipse, the distance between the barycentre and the centre of the planet, rW as a function of true anomaly, fW , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">rW (fW ) = aW (1 − e 2 W ) 1 + eW cos fW (A7)</formula><p>With this equation, we may define the x ′ and y ′ position of the centre of the planet as a function of fW .</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">x ′ = aW eW + rW (fW ) · cos fW (A8) y ′ = rW (fW ) · sin fW (A9)</formula><p>Having defined x ′ (fW ) and y ′ (fW ), we have also acquired x ′ 2 (fW ), using equation (A5). Putting x ′ 2 (fW ) into equation (A2) and integrating between the limits 0 and 2π, as dictated by (A1), we find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">δT T V = aW · ζT (eS, ̟S) √ 2 · v B⊥ (eP , ̟P ) (A10)</formula><p>where we define ζT (eS, ̟S) by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ζT = (1 − e 2 S ) 1/4 eS q e 2 S + cos(2̟S)(2(1 − e 2 S ) 3/2 − 2 + 3e 2 S ) (A11)</formula><p>Note, that we have replaced eW with eS, since they are equivalent, and ̟W with ̟S since the π phase difference between them does not affect this expression.</p><p>aW may be re-written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">aW = aS MS MP RV (A12)</formula><p>And aS may be expressed in terms of the Hill radius, dmax.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">aS = χdmax = χaP " MP RV − MS 3M * " 1/3 (A13)</formula><p>In this expression, aP may also be re-written using Kepler's Third Law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">aP = " G(MP RV + M * )P 2 P 4π 2 " 1/3 (A14)</formula><p>Finally giving:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">aW = χ · MS MP RV · " G(MP RV + M * )(MP RV − MS)P 2 P 12π 2 M * " 1/3</formula><p>(A15) Let us now turn our attention to the expression for v B⊥ (eP , ̟P ). If we assume the time it takes for the planet to cross a distance aW is small compared to the period of the orbit, then we may assume v B⊥ does not vary. However, it is only the perpendicular component of vB, which we label as v B⊥ , which dictates the TTV effect. In the case of a circular orbit, it is easy to see that v B⊥ = vB, but for eccentric obits, this is not the case.</p><p>Consider the orbit of the planet-moon barycentre around the host star. To find the perpendicular component of the barycentre's orbital velocity, we must find the gradient of the tangent to an ellipse which has been rotated for the position of periastron, ̟P , and then translated so that the star is at the origin. We now consider añ x-˜ y plot in a frame˜Sframe˜ frame˜S with an ellipse centered at the origin and the star located at coordinates (aP eP , 0). We then apply a counter-clockwise rotation about the˜zthe˜ the˜z-axis by an angle ̟P into the˜S1the˜ the˜S1 frame. We then apply the translation to reach the˜S2the˜ the˜S2 frame. The equations are identical to (A3) &amp; (A4) and (A5) &amp; (A6) except we replace the W subscript with P . These equations may be re-written to make˜xmake˜ make˜x &amp; ˜ y the subject as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">˜ x = − ˜ x2 cos ̟P − ˜ y2 sin ̟P − aP eP (A16) ˜ y = ˜ x2 sin ̟P − ˜ y2 cos ̟P (A17)</formula><p>Note that we have assumed the orbital eccentricity of the planet-moon barycentre around the host star is equivalent to the orbital eccentricity of the planet around the host star.

Thus we write vB as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">vB = r G(MP RV + M * ) aP · s 2(1 + eP sin ̟P ) (1 − e 2 P ) − 1 (A23)</formula><p>And we may now create a single parameter to absorb the effects of planetary eccentricity, Υ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">Υ = cos h arctan " −eP cos ̟P 1 + eP sin ̟P "i · s 2(1 + eP sin ̟P ) (1 − e 2 P ) − 1 (A24) Thus: v B⊥ = Υ(eP , ̟P ) · r G(MP RV + M * ) aP (A25)</formula><p>The final expression may be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">δT T V = aW √ aP √ 2 p G(MP RV + M * ) · ζT (eS, ̟S) Υ(eP , ̟P ) (A26)</formula><p>where aW is given by equation (A15), aP is given by equation (A14), ζT (eS, ̟S) is given by equation (A11), Υ(eP , ̟P ) is given by equation (A27).

The calculated (or expected) transit duration, τ , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">¯ τ = X v B⊥ (C1)</formula><p>Where X is the distance the planet has to cross in order to complete the transit and vB is the velocity of the planet during transit, as given by Kepler's Third Law.</p><p>In the case of an additional moon orbiting the planet, the velocity of the planet now has two components, the velocity of the planet-moon barycentre (vB) and the wobble velocity due to the perturbation of the moon.

For a circular orbit, it is trivial to show that the variation will be sinusoidal and hence the rms amplitude of v W ⊥ is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">|v W ⊥ | = 1 √ 2 " GM 2 S aSMP RV " 1/2 (C7)</formula><p>Let us now consider the velocity of the planet-moon barycentre around the host star.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C2 Derivation of the eccentric form</head><p>Here, we derive the TDV rms amplitude in the case of eccentric orbits. We use the definition of TDV given by equation (C4). The orbital velocity of the moon around the barycentre of the planet-moon system for a circular orbit is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">vW = s GM 2 S aSMP RV = s GM 3 S aW M 2 P RV = r µW aW<label>(C15)</label></formula><p>In the case of an eccentric orbit, this velocity becomes a function of true anomaly, fW .</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">vW (fW ) = µ 1/2 W · " 2 rW (fW ) − 1 aW " 1/2 (C16)</formula><p>The TDV signal has a waveform governed by the ratio of the perpendicular component of the planet's wobble velocity to the perpendicular component of the velocity of the planetmoon barycentre around the host star, multiplied by the duration of the transit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">TDV(fW ) = ¯ τ v B⊥ · v W,⊥ (fW )<label>(C17)</label></formula><p>In order to find the rms amplitude of this signal, we need to derive v W,⊥ (fW ), which is not the same as vW (fW ). To do this, we need to find the gradient of the tangent of the planet's position along our transformed ellipse from figure A. To find the gradient of the tangent to the ellipse at any true anomaly, fW , we need to implicitly differentiate the equation for the ellipse in the S ′ 2 frame. Equations (A5) and (A6) may be rewritten making x ′ and y ′ the subject:</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">x ′ = −x ′ 2 cos ̟W − y ′ 2 sin ̟W − aW eW (C18) y ′ = x ′ 2 sin ̟W − y ′ 2 cos ̟W (C19)</formula><p>These two equations must satisfy the standard equation of the ellipse:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">x ′2 a 2 W + y ′2 a 2 W (1 − e 2 W ) = 1 (C20)</formula><p>We substitute (C18) and (C19) into (C20) and then differentiate implicitly with respect to x ′ 2 . We arrange the equation to make dy ′ 2 /dx ′ 2 the subject. Finally, we replace the x ′ 2 and y ′ 2 terms using equations (A5) and (A6) and find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">dy ′ 2 dx ′ 2 = y ′ sin ̟W − (1 − e 2 W )x ′ cos ̟W y ′ cos ̟W + (1 − e 2 W )x ′ sin ̟W (C21)</formula><p>x ′ (fW ) and y ′ (fW ) are known and so we have found the gradient of our tangent. The angle of the tangent is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">θ ′ (fW ) = arctan h dy ′ 2 dx ′ 2 i (C22)</formula><p>And finally we may express v W,⊥ (fW ) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">v W,⊥ (fW ) = vW (fW ) · cos[θ ′ (fW )]<label>(C23)</label></formula><p>We now take the rms of this waveform in the way detailed in appendix A and find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">δT DV = τ v B⊥ · r µW 2aW · ζD(eS, ̟S)<label>(C24)</label></formula><p>where ζD(eS, ̟S) = s 1 + e 2 S − e 2 S cos(2̟S) 1 − e 2 S (C25) Note that we have replaced eW by eS since they are equivalent and similarly for cos 2̟W and cos 2̟S. Taking the limit of this expression as eS → 0 gives the expected result of τ √ µW /vB √ 2aW . v B⊥ has already been derived in appendix A and equation (A28).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>estimated χ 1/3 and Domingos et al.
