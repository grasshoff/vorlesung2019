			<abstract>
				<p>Photometry is presented of the Dec. 25, 2007 transit of HD 17156b, which has the longest orbital period and highest orbital eccentricity of all the known transiting exoplanets. New measurements of the stellar radial velocity are also presented. All the data are combined and integrated with stellar-evolutionary modeling to derive refined system parameters. The planet&apos;s mass and radius are found to be 3.212 +0.069 −0.082 M Jup and 1.023 +0.070 −0.055 R Jup. The corresponding stellar properties are 1.263 +0.035 −0.047 M ⊙ and 1.446 +0.099 −0.067 R ⊙. The planet is smaller by 1σ than a theoretical solar-composition gas giant with the same mass and equilibrium temperature, a possible indication of heavy-element enrichment. The midtransit time is measured to within 1 min, and shows no deviation from a linear ephemeris (and therefore no evidence for orbital perturbations from other planets). We provide ephemerides for future transits and superior conjunctions. There is an 18% chance that the orbital plane is oriented close enough to edge-on for secondary eclipses to occur at superior conjunction. Observations of secondary eclipses would reveal the thermal emission spectrum of a planet that experiences unusually large tidal heating and insolation variations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is possible to estimate the mass and radius of a transiting planet using a combination of photometry, Doppler data, and stellar modeling, just as has long been done for eclipsing binary stars (Vogel 1890). Some aspects of the planetary orbit and atmosphere can also be measured through high-precision transit photometry and spectroscopy (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Charbon- neau et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Seager 2008</ref>). These opportunities are more likely to occur for short-period planets, because the probability for a randomly-oriented orbit to be viewed close enough to edge-on for transits declines as P −2/3 . This explains why all but one of the known transiting planets have periods smaller than 10 days.</p><p>The exception is HD 17156b, for which P = 21.2 days. This planet was discovered in a Doppler survey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref>. The probability for transits to occur was larger than one might have guessed based only on the period, because the planet is near pericenter at the time of inferior conjunction (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Barnes 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, or Kane &amp; von Braun 2008</ref>, and indeed transits were discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al. (2007)</ref>. The relatively long period, along with the large orbital eccentricity of 0.67, presents an interesting opportunity to study the planetary atmospheric response to strongly time-variable heating by the parent star <ref type="bibr">(Langton &amp; Laughlin 2007)</ref>. However, the long period also presents a challenge to observers. From a given site, there are only 2-3 good opportunities each year to observe a complete transit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Narita et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2008)</ref> observed the photometric transits of Oct. 1, Nov. 12, and Dec. 3, 2007, respectively. They were able to improve upon the precision of the system parameters given originally by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al. (2007)</ref>, but left further scope for improvement through higher-precision photometry.</p><p>In this paper we present photometry of the transit of Dec. 25, 2007 based on observations with 4 different telescopes. We also present 10 new measurements of the Doppler shift of the host star, gathered outside of transits. We analyze all of these data to refine the estimates of the system parameters, using similar techniques to those we have applied previously as part of the Transit Light Curve (TLC) project <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Holman et al. 2006</ref>) and that were recently applied to a sample of 23 planets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Torres et al. (2008)</ref>. The observations and data reduction are described in § 2. The data analysis is described in § 3. In § 4, the results of the data analysis are used together with other observed stellar properties and stellar evolutionary models to determine the properties of the star and planet. All of the results are summarized in § 5, and potential future studies are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations and Data Reduction</head><p>2.1. Out-of-transit radial velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref> reported 33 measurements of the radial velocity (RV) of HD 17156 over a time range from January 2006 to February 2007. Of these, 9 velocities were obtained with the Subaru 8m telescope and HDS spectrograph, with a precision of approximately 5 m s −1 . The other 24 velocities were based on observations with the Keck I 10m telescope and HIRES spectrograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Vogt et al. 1994)</ref>, with a precision of 1-2 m s −1 .</p><p>To these, we add 10 new Keck/HIRES velocities with 1-2 m s −1 precision that were obtained between August 2007 and March 2008. The new data are based on observations with the same telescope, instrument, and setup as the previous Keck observations. In particular we employed an iodine gas absorption cell to calibrate the instrumental profile and wavelength scale. To maintain a consistent signal-to-noise ratio of about 200 per resolution element, we employed the HIRES exposure meter, which uses a pickoff mirror to direct a small fraction of the starlight to a photomultiplier tube and monitors the exposure level as a function of time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kibrick et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>All 34 of the Keck/HIRES velocities were re-measured based on an improved reduction of the raw CCD images and a refined version of the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butler et al. (1996)</ref>, including the use of a new stellar template. (The stellar template, an important ingredient in the deconvolution algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butler et al. 1996</ref>, is an observation of the target star obtained without the iodine cell and with a higher signal-to-noise ratio and higher resolution than the rest of the spectra.) The resulting velocities are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. For convenience, this table also includes the Subaru/HDS velocities reported previously. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows the radial velocities as a function of orbital phase, using the ephemeris derived in § 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transit photometry</head><p>We observed the transit of UT 25 December 2007 (JD 2454459) using telescopes at two different observatories in Arizona: the Fred L. Whipple Observatory (FLWO) and Fairborn Observatory. The Moon was full. The weather was generally clear over both observatories, although there were some light clouds and transparency variations.</p><p>At FLWO, we used the 1.2m telescope and Keplercam, a 4096 2 CCD with a 23 ′ × 23 ′ field of view ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Szentgyorgyi et al. 2005</ref>). The images were binned 2 × 2, giving a scale of 0. ′′ 68 per binned pixel. We obtained 10 s exposures though a z-band filter for 6.5 hr bracketing the predicted midtransit time. The telescope was defocused to avoid significant nonlinearity  and saturation, giving a typical full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of stellar images of 4 ′′ (6 pixels). The time between exposures was 11 s due to readout and reset operations. Autoguiding failures led to pointing drifts of 10 pixels in right ascension and 40 pixels in declination over the course of the night. During the observations the target rose from airmass 1.34 to 1.30 (reaching the meridian at HJD 2454459.67) and then set to airmass 1.64.</p><p>We used standard IRAF procedures for overscan correction, trimming, bias subtraction, flat-field division, and aperture photometry of HD 17156 and 32 other stars in the field of view (all necessarily fainter than HD 17156). We created a reference signal by combining the normalized light curves of the different comparison stars, and divided the flux history of HD 17156 by this reference signal. We experimented with different choices for the aperture size, combinations of the comparison stars, and weighting schemes for combining the normalized light curves, aiming to minimize the standard deviation of the out-of-transit portion of the light curve. Best results were obtained when the aperture diameter was 15 pixels and the comparison light curves were weighted by the square root of the mean flux.</p><p>At Fairborn Observatory, we used 3 independent telescopes: the T8, T10, and T11 0.8m automated photometric telescopes (APTs). All of the APTs are equipped with two temperaturestabilized EMI 9124QB photomultiplier tubes for measuring photon count rates simultaneously through Strömgren b and y filters. Each telescope nodded back and forth between HD 17156 (V = 8.17, B − V = 0.64) and the comparison star HD 15784 (V = 6.64, B − V = 0.64), which was found to be constant in brightness by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref>. The T8, T10, and T11 APTs obtained 170, 190, and 200 observations of both stars, respectively, over a period 7.2 hours. From these measurements, we computed a total of 560 target-minuscomparison differential magnitudes in each b and y photometric band. The time series was trimmed to 523 points to eliminate bad data taken at the highest airmass. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the resulting light curves, we averaged the b and y passbands together, resulting in a synthetic (b + y)/2 passband.</p><p>The FLWO and APT light curves were corrected for differing airmass extinction between the target star and comparison stars, by fitting the observed magnitudes to a linear function of airmass (see Eqn. 3). The parameters of the linear function were determined simultaneously with the other model parameters, as described in § 3. The extinction-corrected data are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, and plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, along with the best-fitting model. For the APT data, the standard deviation of the out-of-transit (OOT) data and of the residuals are 0.00214 and 0.00213, respectively. The corresponding figures for the FLWO data are 0.00233 and 0.00206, respectively. For both light curves, the expected photometric precision due only to Poisson noise and scintillation noise (using the empirical formulas of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Reiger 1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Young 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">and Dravins 1998</ref>) is about 50% smaller than the OOT standard deviation, with the dominant contribution arising from scintillation noise. It is possible that the scintillation noise was higher than the empirical and highly approximate formula predicts. It is also likely that there are additional noise sources such as transparency variations beyond the simple dependence on airmass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analysis of radial-velocity and photometric data</head><p>At the heart of our analysis was a simultaneous fit of a parametric model to the new light curves and the available radial-velocity data. In § 3.1 we describe the model and fitting procedures. In § 3.2 we provide more detail about the photometric noise and how it was modeled. In § 3.3 we discuss the determination of midtransit times and a new transit ephemeris. In § 4 we explain how the data analysis was integrated with stellar evolutionary models to determine the final system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Joint radial velocity and photometric analysis</head><p>The model is based on a two-body Keplerian orbit, with the loss of light during transits given by the formulae of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. The orbit is parameterized by the semi-amplitude (K), period (P ), midtransit time (T c ) 1 , inclination (i), eccentricity (e), and argument of pericenter (ω). The coordinate system is chosen such that i &lt; 90 • and the longitude of nodes is zero.</p><p>Additional parameters relevant to the photometric data are the planet-to-star radius ratio (R p /R ⋆ ), the semimajor axis in units of the stellar radius (a/R ⋆ ), and the limb-darkening coefficients (u 1 and u 2 ) for each light curve. We assumed a quadratic limb-darkening law,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I µ I 1 = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ) 2 , (1)</formula><p>where µ is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface, and I µ is the specific intensity. In many studies of transiting planets, the limbdarkening coefficients are often held fixed at values deemed appropriate for the host star, based on stellar-atmosphere models. However, when the data are sufficiently precise it is preferable to fit for the coefficients, as recently emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Southworth (2008)</ref>. This is because the model atmospheres might be wrong, and at least are uncertain to some degree. Neglecting this uncertainty leads to underestimated errors in all parameters that are covariant with the limb-darkening coefficients, namely R p /R ⋆ , R ⋆ /a, and i. For this study we allowed u 1 and u 2 to vary freely subject only to the conditions u 1 + u 2 &lt; 1 (nonnegative intensity at the limb), u 1 + u 2 &gt; 0 (fainter at the limb than the center), and u 1 &gt; 0 (maximum intensity at the center). It proved advantageous to perform the fit using the linear combinations</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v 1 = u 1 + 7 5 u 2 , v 2 = − 7 5 u 1 + u 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>because v 1 and v 2 have nearly uncorrelated errors (for further discussion, see Pál 2008).</p><p>The model also has 6 nuisance parameters. For each of the two RV data sets there is an additive constant velocity (γ K for Keck/HIRES and γ S for Subaru/HDS). For each of the two light curves there are the parameters m 0 and k of the differential extinction correction,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m cor = m obs + m 0 + kz,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where m obs is the observed magnitude, m cor is the corrected magnitude, and z is the airmass.</p><p>All together there were 18 parameters: K, P , T c , i, e, ω, R p /R ⋆ , a/R ⋆ , an additive velocity for each of two RV data sets, two limb-darkening coefficients u 1 and u 2 for each of two bandpasses, and two parameters m 0 and k for each of two bandpasses to describe the correction for differential airmass extinction. The fitting statistic was</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ 2 = χ 2 F + χ 2 V + χ 2 T ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with the terms defined as follows. The first term is based on the fit to the photometric data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">χ 2 F = 1372 i=1 f i (obs) − f i (calc) σ f,i 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where f i (obs) is the ith measured flux (photometric data point), f i (calc) is the calculated flux given a particular choice of model parameters, and σ f,i is the uncertainty in the ith measured flux. The choice of σ f,i is nontrivial and is discussed in § 3.2. Here we simply state our choice to take σ f,i to be a constant for each light curve given by σ f,i = βσ res , where σ res is the standard deviation of the flux residuals, and β ≥ 1 is a factor intended to account for time-correlated errors. For the APT light curve, σ res = 0.00213 and β = 1.03, giving an effective uncertainty per point of 0.0022. For the FLWO light curve, σ res = 0.00207 and β = 1.28, giving an effective uncertainty per point of 0.0026.</p><p>The second term in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> is based on the fit to the RV data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">χ 2 V = 43 i=1 V i (obs) − V i (calc) σ V,i 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where V i (obs) and V i (calc) are the ith observed and calculated RVs, and σ V,i is the corresponding uncertainty. For σ V,i , we used the quadrature sum of the measurement uncertainty given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and a constant σ V,0 = 3.4 m s −1 intended to account for stellar "jitter," excess noise that is usually attributed to motions of the stellar photosphere. This choice resulted in a reduced χ 2 V of unity when fitting the RV data only, and it is consistent with observations of other stars of similar type <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wright 2005</ref>).</p><p>The third term in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> is an a priori constraint enforcing the transit ephemeris that is derived in § 3.3. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">χ 2 T = P (days) − 21.21688 0.00044 2 + T c (HJD) − 2, 454, 459.69987 0.00045 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The central values of P and T c , and their uncertainties, are derived in § 3.3 based on observations of 5 different transits spanning 106 days. They are more precise than could be derived internally from only the RV data, the APT data, and the FLWO data that are fitted here; hence during this step we treated P and T c as externally measured quantities. Since the transit ephemeris is based in part on the midtransit times of the APT and FLWO light curves, we used an iterative procedure: first, a previously published ephemeris was used in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>; second, the midtransit times based on the APT and FLWO light curves were determined as in § 3.3; and third, the ephemeris was re-derived and used in the next iteration of the fit to the RV and photometric data. Further iterations were performed but made no appreciable difference in the results.</p><p>We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the best-fitting model parameters and their uncertainties (see, e.g., Appendix A of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tegmark et al. 2004</ref>). This algorithm creates a sequence of points (a "chain") in parameter space by iterating a jump function, which in our case was the addition of a Gaussian random deviate to a randomly-selected single parameter. After this operation, if the new point has a lower χ 2 than the previous point, the "jump" is executed: the new point is added to the chain. If not, then the jump is executed with a probability proportional to exp(−∆χ 2 /2). If the jump is not executed, the current point is repeated in the chain. The sizes of the random deviates are set to values for which ∼40% of jumps are executed. After creating multiple chains to check for mutual convergence, and trimming off the initial segments to eliminate artifacts of the initial condition, the density of the chain's points in parameter space is taken to be the joint a posteriori probability distribution of the parameter values. Probability distributions for individual parameters are created by marginalizing over all other parameters. For each parameter we report the mode of the distribution and the 68.3% confidence limits, defined by the 15.85% percentile and the 84.15% percentile in the cumulative distribution.</p><p>The results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, with the designation A in the last column. The entries designated B are those that are drawn from other works and are repeated here for convenience. The entries designated C are based on a synthesis of our modeling results and theoretical models of stellar evolution, as discussed in § 4. The results for the limb-darkening parameters are given separately, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Photometric noise analysis</head><p>Deriving reliable uncertainties in the system parameters requires a realistic treatment of the photometric noise. In this work, as in others, we have based our analysis on a χ 2 statistic that implicitly treats the noise as independent and identically-distributed Gaussian random variables added to each datum. This is because simple and fast statistical methods are applicable in that case, and because there is no clear alternative. Unfortunately, precise photometry is often plagued with time-correlated ("red") noise, which is probably responsible for the frequent disagreements between reported values of photometric parameters in the literature. It is advisable to attempt to justify the common assumption of independent Gaussian noise, or at least to gain some understanding of the limitations of that assumption. 2 .</p><p>To investigate the noise in our light curves, we performed some tests on the residuals. The top two panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> show the residuals for the two independent light curves. The second row shows histograms of the residuals, which are approximately Gaussian. The third row shows the autocorrelation of the residuals as a function of the lag,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A(l) = N −l−1 i=0 (r i − ¯ r)(r i+l − ¯ r) N −1 i=0 (r i − ¯ r) 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where N is the number of data points, r i is the ith residual flux (measured flux minus calculated flux) and ¯ r is the mean residual flux. The autocorrelations are 0.1. The fourth row shows the Allan deviation σ A (l) of the residuals, where σ A is defined by <ref type="bibr">(Allan 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson, Moran, &amp; Swensen 2001)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">σ 2 A (l) = 1 2(N + 1 − l) N −2l n=0 1 l l m=0 (r n+m − r n+l+m ) 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where N is the number of data points, r i denotes the ith residual, and l is the lag. The Allan deviation is commonly used in the time metrology literature to assess 1/f noise. The solid lines show the dependence σ A ∝ l −1/2 that is expected of white Gaussian noise. The data fall close to these lines. The bottom row of panels shows the standard deviation of the time-binned residuals, as a function of the number of data points per bin. Specifically, we averaged the residuals into m bins of n points and calculated the standard deviation σ n of the binned residuals. In the absence of red noise, one would expect</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ n = σ 1 n 1/2 m m − 1 1/2 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>but in reality σ n is larger than this expression by a factor β. In general β depends on m but the dependence is weak. For bin sizes ranging from 10-30 min (the most important timescale of the transit light curve) the mean value of β is 1.03 for the APT light curve and 1.28 for the FLWO light curve. Apparently the APT residuals average down as one would expect of white noise, while the FLWO residuals are correlated to some degree.</p><p>As stated above, our χ 2 -based method is strictly appropriate only for uncorrelated errors. One might imagine modifying the definition of χ 2 F to employ the full covariance matrix of the errors rather than assuming independent errors. However, given that there is little structure in the autocorrelation functions to provide guidance on how to model the covariance matrix, and that the correlations seem small, we account for correlated noise in a simple and approximate fashion: we assign a photometric error bar of σ f,i = βσ res to each data point, where σ res is the standard deviation of the residuals. The choice β = 1 is essentially equivalent the common procedure of assuming equal errors for all data points and scaling the error bars such that χ 2 /N dof = 1. We used β = 1.03 for the APT data and β = 1.28 for the FLWO data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Midtransit times</head><p>Measurements of midtransit times are important for refining the transit ephemeris and thereby enabling accurate predictions for future observations, and also for searching for satellites and additional planets via the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Holman &amp; Murray (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>. We determined the midtransit time from each light curve using 3 different methods to check for consistency: the MCMC algorithm described in § 3.1, and two different bootstrap analyses described below. All of these methods rely on the photometric transit model and the computation of χ 2 F . Besides T c , the only other variable parameters were the slope (k) and offset (m 0 ) of the differential extinction correction. These were the only other parameters covariant with the midtransit time. All other parameters needed to specify the transit model were held fixed at the best-fitting values.</p><p>The first bootstrap method was "random draws with replacement" ( <ref type="bibr">Press et al. 1992, p. 689)</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. It involves minimizing χ 2</head><p>F as a function of the parameters for 10 4 synthetic data sets, each of which has the same number of data points as the real data. Each entry in a synthetic data set is a datum (a time stamp and relative flux) drawn randomly from the real data set, with repetitions allowed. Thus, a substantial fraction of the entries in each synthetic data set are duplicated at least once and receive greater weight in χ 2 F sum. The idea is to estimate the noise properties of the data using the observed data values themselves, rather than choosing models for the underlying physical process and for the noise. However, an underlying assumption is that the errors are uncorrelated and identically distributed. The distribution of results for T c is taken to be the probability density for the midtransit time.</p><p>The second bootstrap method was "residual permutation." It is similar to the method just described but the synthetic data sets are created differently. The residuals of the bestfitting model are added back to the model light curve after performing a cyclic permutation of their time indices. With N data points, one may create N − 1 synthetic data sets in this manner. Another N − 1 may be created by inverting the time order of the residuals and then performing cyclic permutations. The idea is again to use the data themselves to estimate the noise properties, but this time without assuming that the errors are uncorrelated. The correlations between residuals at different times are preserved. The distribution of results for T c is taken to be the probability density for the midtransit time. A disadvantage of this method is that only 2(N − 1) realizations can be generated without further assumptions, and therefore the distribution is relatively noisy.</p><p>The results from all 3 methods are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. As before, the quoted values are the modes of the probability distributions and the quoted error bars range from the 15.85% percentile to the 84.15% percentile. The distributions are symmetric in all cases, and are nearly Gaussian for the MCMC and random-draws methods. The residual-permutation method produced distributions with broader wings than a Gaussian function. For each light curve, the results from all 3 methods are in agreement within 0.15σ, where σ is the error in the MCMC method. The bootstrap method gave the smallest error bars, as one might expect, given that the bootstrap method ignores correlated noise. (The bootstrap-derived error bar is smaller than the MCMC-derived error bar by approximately the "red noise" factor β.) In what follows, we adopt the MCMC results for concreteness and for consistency with our previous analyses. The error bars on the midtransit times derived from the FLWO and APT light curves are 1.1 min and 0.9 min, and the difference between the results is 1.0 min. This level of agreement is a consistency check on the accuracy of our error bars.</p><p>We fitted a linear ephemeris, T c [E] = T c [0] + EP , to all of the midtransit times at our disposal: namely, the APT and FLWO midtransit times presented in this paper, and the 4 different midtransit times reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al.

We used the same code as <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Torres et al.

Since the error bars on the two results are comparable, one might be tempted to use the spectroscopic log g as a further constraint on the stellar properties. We did not take this approach out of concern that the spectroscopic determination is more complex and liable to underestimation of the error (see, e.g., ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Summary and comparison with previous results</head><p>We have presented photometry of a transit of HD 17156b, and 10 additional measurements of the radial velocity of the host star. We have analyzed the data along with the other observed stellar properties to refine the estimates of the basic system parameters. For many of the parameters, our results are more precise than those reported previously, despite some aspects of the previous analyses that may have caused the quoted error bars to be unrealistically small. Specifically, none of the previous analyses allowed for any uncertainty in the limb-darkening law, and neither <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al. (2007)</ref> nor <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref> attempted to quantify the effect of time-correlated noise. Another improvement in our analysis was the integration of the data analysis with stellar evolution models to make full use of the information in the light curve and arrive at a self-consistent solution.</p><p>Our result for the stellar mass, M ⋆ = 1.263 +0.035 −0.047 M ⊙ , agrees with the previous determination of 1.2 ± 0.1 M ⊙ by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref> and improves on the precision. Our result for the stellar radius, 1.446 +0.099 −0.067 R ⊙ , agrees with the Fischer et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2007)</ref> estimate of 1.470 ± 0.085 R ⊙ . The essential difference between the two analyses is that we made use of the photometric determination of ρ ⋆ while <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref> used the spectroscopic determination of log g. As for the planet, our result of 1.023 +0.070 −0.055 R Jup is very similar to the value 1.01 ± 0.09 R Jup found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref>. This should be interpreted as an agreement between the measured transit depths, and not necessarily the other light curve parameters, because <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref> did not fit for the a/R ⋆ parameter. Instead they used an external constraint on that parameter based on the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2008)</ref> also found the same transit depth, but a smaller value of a/R ⋆ and therefore larger values of R ⋆ and R p (by about 1σ, where σ is the error quoted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. 2008</ref>). Our result for R p is approximately 3 times more precise.</p><p>The results for the limb-darkening coefficients, given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, show that the darkening is greater in the (b+y)/2 band than in the z band, as expected. The values of the coefficients themselves are poorly constrained and the errors are highly correlated, making it difficult to compare to specific theoretical predictions. For the z band, interpolation of the tables of Claret <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2004)</ref> gives a prediction of u 1 = 0.17 and u 2 = 0.35, which is just outside the 1σ range of our results. The data favor a less limb-darkened star. The tables of Claret <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2000)</ref> give u 1 = 0.52 and u 2 = 0.28 for the b band, and u 1 = 0.39 and u 2 = 0.33 for the y band. Either set of coefficients is compatible with the loose bounds provided by the APT data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison with theoretical models</head><p>A primary goal of precise transit observations is to compare the observed planetary properties with theoretical models of the planet's interior structure. For example, a persistent theme in this field is that at least a few planets have radii that are "too large" by the standards of theoretical models of solar-composition giant planets, even after accounting for the intense stellar heating and selection effects (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burrows et al. 2007</ref> for a recent discussion). Other planets are so small that the models fit only when the composition is altered to be much richer in heavy elements than the Sun, a possible indication of the dense interior cores that are expected according to the core-accretion theory of planet formation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sato et al. 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bodenheimer et al. (2003)</ref> give predictions for the radii of giant planets as a function of the age, mass, and time-averaged equilibrium temperature of the planet, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">T eq = (1 − A)L ⋆ 16πσa 2 (1 + e 2 /2) 2 1/4 = (783 K) (1 − A) 1/4 , (14)</formula><p>where A is the Bond albedo, L ⋆ is the stellar luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a is the semimajor axis, and e is the eccentricity. In the latter equality we have evaluated T eq for HD 17156b using the results given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. As long as the albedo is not very close to unity, Bodenheimer et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2003)</ref> predict a planetary radius of 1.10 R Jup for a solar composition at 4.5 Gyr. They also considered enriching the solar composition by 40 M ⊕ of additional heavy elements (4% of the total mass) and found that the radius decreases by less than 1%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> have presented theoretical models parameterized by mass, age, and an effective orbital distance, defined as the distance from the Sun where a hypothetical planet on a circular orbit would receive the same time-averaged flux as the actual planet,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">d ⊕ = a(1 + e 2 /2) L ⋆ L ⊙ 1/2 = 0.13 AU,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where again we have evaluated the expression as appropriate for HD 17156b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> also predicted 1.10 R Jup for a solar composition at 4.5 Gyr, decreasing to 1.02 R Jup when 100 M ⊕ of solar-composition material (10% of the total mass) is replaced by a heavyelement "core." This would provide a good match to the observed radius of 1.023 R Jup .</p><p>We conclude from these comparisons, as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref>, that HD 17156b is smaller than a theoretical giant planet of solar-composition, and that this may be an indication of heavy-element enrichment. Heavy-element enrichment is expected according to the core-accretion model of planet formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mizuno 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Pollack et al. 1996</ref>. There is evidence for such enrichment in Jupiter and Saturn, with Jupiter in particular consisting of 3-15% heavy elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guillot 2005</ref>). One should be wary of over-interpretation, given that our measurement of R p differs from 1.1 R Jup by only 1.1 times the measurement uncertainty. However, there are some known factors that would increase the theoretical radius and thereby enlarge the discrepancy at least slightly: the fiducial radius calculated by <ref type="bibr">Bo- denheimer et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> refers to a higher pressure (smaller radius) than the transit-measured radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burrows et al. 2003</ref>); the models do not take into account tidal heating and consequent inflation due to the nonzero eccentricity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Liu et al. 2008)</ref>; and the age of the system is estimated to be 3 Gyr, younger than the 4.5 Gyr age for which the models were calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">The spin-orbit angle, and the probability of secondary eclipses</head><p>One parameter that we have not improved on, but that deserves mention, is the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis. One might expect the axes to be wellaligned, given that the star and planet formed from a common disk and given the good alignment observed in the Solar system. Then again, by the same logic the orbit should be circular, and it is not. A lower limit on the angle between the spin and orbital axes can be derived by monitoring the apparent Doppler shift throughout a transit, exploiting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Queloz et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Winn et al. 2005</ref>). Using this technique, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Narita et al. (2008)</ref> found that the angle between sky projections of the two axes is λ = 62 ± 25 deg, a 2.5σ misalignment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cochran et al. (2008)</ref> presented two different data sets giving λ = 4.5 ± 15.6 deg and λ = −32.4 ± 25.2 deg, and concluded that the data are consistent with good alignment. Unfortunately, our new data alone do not allow for significant progress on this issue, because the limiting errors are in the precision of the RM data, which we have not improved in this study. Further spectroscopic observations are warranted.</p><p>Another important angle is the orbital inclination with respect to the sky plane. If the orbit is oriented close enough to edge-on, then the planet will be periodically eclipsed by the parent star. Observations of such secondary eclipses would reveal the planetary albedo or thermal emission from the planet, depending upon the observing bandpass. In addition, infrared observations could help to understand the radiative dynamics of the planetary atmosphere, as emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al. (2007)</ref>. To check whether secondary eclipses are likely to occur, we used our MCMC results to compute the a posteriori probability distribution for the impact parameter at superior conjunction,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">b II = a cos i R ⋆ 1 − e 2 1 − e sin ω .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>We find the probability for secondary eclipses (b II &lt; 1 + R p /R ⋆ ) to be 18%. The probability for complete eclipses, or occultations (b II &lt; 1 + R p /R ⋆ ), is 15%. These odds are better than those found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irwin et al. (2008)</ref>, which were 6.9% and 9.2%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2008)</ref> found the probability of occultations to be 0.04%. Presumably this significant difference is attributable to our finding of a more edge-on orbit (i = 86.2 +2.1 −0.8 deg, as opposed to 85.5 +1.9 −1.2 deg from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2008)</ref>. Our error bars for i are no smaller than those reported previously because the achievable error in i worsens rapidly as i approaches 90 deg <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carter et al. 2008</ref>). To help in planning observations, we have used our results to predict the timing of the events, as well as the quantity (R p /d II ) 2 (where d II is the star-planet distance at superior conjunction) which sets the amplitude of the reflected-light signal from the planet. The results for this latter parameter are conditioned on the assumption that secondary eclipses do indeed occur. The results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Since the orbit of HD 17156b is highly eccentric, the definition of T c requires some care. Here we define it as the time when the projected planet-star separation is smallest, which is also the time of minimum light for a limb-darkened star. This is to be distinguished from other possible definitions, such as the halfway point between first and last contact, or the moment when the true anomaly f of the planetary orbit is equal to π/2 − ω.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In this vein we quote an email from G. Kovacs: &quot;Identifying the &apos;red noise component&apos; (whatever it means) in a single realization of a rather limited time series (such as photometric followup data) is a mission impossible.&quot;</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> The quoted M V is based on the transformation of Tycho-2 apparent magnitudes (Høg et al. 2000) to the Johnson V band, giving V = 8.172 ± 0.012, and the Hipparcos parallax of π = 13.34 ± 0.72 mas (van Leeuwen 2007). We have assumed zero reddening.</note>
