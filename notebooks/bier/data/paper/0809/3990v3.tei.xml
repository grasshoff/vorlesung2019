			<abstract>
				<p>On the Earth, photosynthetic organisms are responsible for the production of virtually all of the oxygen in the atmosphere. On the land, vegetation reflects in the visible, leading to a &apos;red edge&apos; that developed about 450 Myr ago and has been proposed as a biosignature for life on extrasolar planets. However, in many regions of the Earth, and particularly where surface conditions are extreme, for example in hot and cold deserts, photosynthetic organisms can be driven into and under substrates where light is still sufficient for photosynthesis. These communities exhibit no detectable surface spectral signature to indicate life. The same is true of the assemblages of photosynthetic organisms at more than a few metres depth in water bodies. These communities are widespread and dominate local photosynthetic productivity. We review known cryptic photosynthetic communities and their productivity. We link geomicrobiology with observational astronomy by calculating the disk-averaged spectra of cryptic habitats and identifying detectable features on an exoplanet dominated by such a biota. The hypothetical cryptic photosynthesis worlds discussed here are Earth-analogs that show detectable atmospheric biomarkers like our own planet, but do not exhibit a discernable biological surface feature in the disc-averaged spectrum.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The determination of the presence of biological processes on extrasolar planets will depend on the detection of spectral signatures that indicate habitability (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Owen 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Des Marais et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Selsis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wolstencroft and Raven, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raven and Wolstencroft, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kaltenegger and Selsis, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Segura et al., 2007</ref> for detailed discussion).</p><p>These spectral signatures broadly fall into two classes: 1) atmospheric spectra of major and trace gases that suggest gas exchange reactions out of equilibrium with purely geochemical processes (such as high simultaneous concentrations of O 2 , O 3 , CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and N 2 O), 2) spectra from surface reflections that indicate absorption from pigments or compounds that are not mineralogical and may be derived from biotic syntheses. Here we discuss how these spectral features might appear in disc-averaged spectra of an Earth-like planet observed from space and their detectability.</p><p>In the latter category of spectral signatures, the 'red edge', which is characteristic of terrestrial vegetation, has received considerable attention (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Seager et al., 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, Tinetti et al 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Kiang et al 2007a</ref>. The red edge results from a strong chlorophyll absorption in the red region of the spectrum contrasted with a strong reflectance in near-infrared wavelength regions. Photosynthetic plants have strong reflectance, possibly as an evolved mechanism that restricts metabolically dangerous overheating in air. Direct selection for this red edge is certainly possible, and some desert plants have highly reflective surfaces with a reflectance of 0.05 -0.25 between 400 and 700 nm, rising to as much as 0.80 at 750nm, and a reflectance of 0.35 -0.80 and 0.05 -0.57 from 750 to 1000 nm and from 1000 to 2000 nm respectively. These properties of desert plants restrict absorption or transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as of longer wavelengths <ref type="bibr">(Gates, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jones, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Merzlyak et al., 2002</ref>).</p><p>The vegetation red edge (VRE) on Earth is distinctive. It can be used to map vegetation with very high resolution data. Several groups have measured the integrated Earth spectrum with the technique of Earthshine, which uses sunlight reflected from the non-illuminated, or "dark", side of the moon. Earthshine measurements have shown that detection of Earth's red edge could be feasible but made very difficult owing to its broad, essentially featureless spectrum and the interfering effects of cloud coverage (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Montanes-Rodriguez et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2005</ref>). Averaged over a spatially unresolved hemisphere of Earth, the additional reflectivity of this spectral feature is a few percent.</p><p>The exact wavelength and strength of the spectroscopic red edge depends on the plant species and environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wolstencroft and Raven, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tinetti et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiang et al., 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stomp et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, Arnold et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiang et al. (2007a)</ref> provide a synthesis of the maximum absorption wavelengths found in a diversity of photosynthetic organisms, including microbial phototrophs.</p><p>Despite some variations between organisms, they suggest that general rules can be devised which can be used to predict where photosynthetic organisms are most likely to absorb in the spectrum (see also <ref type="bibr">Stomp et al., 2007)</ref>. They also propose that these spectral signatures may shift according to the spectral output of the parent star <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kiang et al., 2007b)</ref>.</p><p>The presence of a red edge, or any surface biological signature, depends upon the photosynthetic organisms growing on the planetary surface influencing reflected light. In many environments, microbial phototrophs are hidden beneath substrates, but they remain sufficiently close to the surface to collect light for photosynthesis ( <ref type="bibr">Cockell and Raven, 2004)</ref>. This phenomenon (which can be called 'cryptic photosynthesis') is particularly common in extreme environments where organisms may escape detrimental conditions on the surface, such as desiccation and UV radiation, within shielded micro-habitats. This phenomenon raises the possibility of a 'false-negative' detection of life if the alteration of surface reflection spectra, including the red edge, is used as a criterion for habitability, i.e., an atmospheric spectral signature of photosynthesis -oxygen or ozoneindicates habitability but no surface reflected signature is found.</p><p>In this paper, we discuss the case of cryptic photosynthesis worlds. We combine geomicrobiology with observational astronomy to: 1) provide an overview of cryptic photosynthetic communities on the Earth, and 2) calculate the expected spectral signature from planets where a large proportion or all of its photosynthesis is cryptic.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORMS OF CRYPTIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON THE EARTH</head><p>A number of regions of the Earth exhibit cryptic photosynthetic growth. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises the categories of cryptic photosynthesis that we recognise on the Earth with corresponding comments about their substrate requirements, what surface planetary geology would be needed to realise these requirements elsewhere (and thus how common the communities could be) and how productive some of these communities are.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rock</head><p>and mineral-based cryptic photosynthesis Chasmoendoliths. The most ubiquitous habitat for cryptic photosynthesis, which makes the fewest assumptions about the host material, is the chasmoendolithic habitat, in which microorganisms inhabit fractures and cracks within rocks that are connected to the surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Broady (1981)</ref> described a diversity of photosynthetic organisms inhabiting Antarctic rocks, and lichens have been described in Antarctic granites (De los <ref type="bibr">Rios et al., 2005</ref>). However, any process that produces cracks within rocks, e.g., aqueous and Aeolian weathering, heat fracturing from volcanic activity, freeze-thaw, and tectonic alteration, for example, provides habitats in which photosynthetic organisms can live, and in potentially any environment. Impact cratering is one universal process that fractures rocks and generates space for colonization by chasmoendoliths <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.1c</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Cockell et al., 2005</ref>). Chasmoendoliths can therefore inhabit any type of rock, including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary and therefore make the fewest assumptions about the geological conditions to be found elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cryptoendoliths.</head><p>Cryptoendolithic communities are organisms growing within rock structural cavities and inter-grain spaces rather than macroscopic cracks connected to the surface as in the case of chasmoendoliths. They are therefore associated with permeable rocks and depend upon the transmission of light into the rock interstices ( <ref type="bibr">Nienow et al., 1988)</ref>. Like hypoliths, they are predominantly found in sedimentary lithologies such as quartzitic sandstones <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.1b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(Friedmann, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr">(Friedmann, , 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Saiz-Jimenez et al., 1990</ref>), but they are also found in volcanic glass <ref type="bibr">(Herrera et al., 2009</ref>). Thus, although cryptoendolithic colonization requires more specific geological conditions than for chasmoendoliths they can be widespread in diverse lithologies. The potential habitats in which cryptoendoliths persist can be expanded into usually nonporous rocks by physical processes that systemically fracture and increase their permeability and translucence. One such process is impact cratering, which has been reported to transform gneiss, which is usually a poor substrate for cryptoendolithic communities, into a more porous and translucent material <ref type="bibr">(Cockell et al., 2002</ref>).</p><p>Hypoliths. Most hypoliths are to be found under quartz rocks, since quartz is translucent <ref type="bibr">(Warren-Rhodes et al., 2006</ref>), allowing photosynthetic organisms to inhabit the underside and still receive enough light for growth. Raven et al. estimated the minimum light level required for photosynthesis to be 0.1 µmoles/m 2 /s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raven et al., 2000</ref>). The reduction of visible light to approximately 0.06% of ambient (assuming it to be ~2,000 µmoles/m 2 /s at midday) would be sufficient to extinguish photosynthesis, consistent with the observations reported for the colonization of quartz rocks. For example, at a depth of 40 mm under typical quartz rock collected from the Negev Desert, less than 0.01% of incident light <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berner and Evenari, 1978)</ref> penetrates while in colonized quartz rock from the Mojava desert less than 0.08% penetrates to below 25 mm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schlesinger et al., 2003)</ref>. Although quartz is a common substrate, the potential range of hypolithic growth is vastly expanded by the process of freezethaw, which moves rocks, generating 'patterned' or 'sorted' ground <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1a)</ref>. Small movements in the rocks generate spaces into which light can penetrate, accounting for the widespread colonisation of polar desert rocks by hypolithic communities ( <ref type="bibr">Cockell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Stokes, 2004, 2006</ref>). Polar deserts account for about 5 x 10 6 km 2 of Earth's surface (about 4% of the Earth's surface), but there is no reason why a planetary surface could not be entirely covered by polar desert subjected to freezethaw. The important attribute of the habitat is that the penetration of light to the underside of the rock is made possible by a ubiquitous physical process in polar regions (freeze-thaw) and it imposes no special geological requirements on the substrate, other than that it is not toxic to the biota growing beneath it.</p><p>Euendoliths. A more specialist form of endolithic growth is euendolithic (rockboring) behaviour. The evolutionary selection pressures for this mode of rock colonization have been discussed <ref type="bibr">(Cockell and Herrera, 2008)</ref>. They may include selection pressures to acquire nutrients from rocks or benefits conferred by escaping extreme environmental conditions on the rock surface. Euendolithic growth is widespread in carbonate-dwelling fungi and cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr">(Golubic et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoppert et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Smits, 2006</ref>). The activities of euendoliths play an important role in rock weathering in coastal areas ( <ref type="bibr">Schneider and Le Campion-Alsumard, 1999</ref>), where the majority of them are to be found, although some deserts hosts euendoliths <ref type="bibr">(Bungartz and Wirth, 2007)</ref>. Reports of euendolithic borings in deep-sea volcanic rocks have been made (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fisk et al., 1998)</ref>, although the latter borings have not been associated with phototrophs. The euendolithic habit shows that low permeability and porosity does not preclude cryptic photosynthetic growth and that many rocks are susceptible to the innovation of active dissolution mechanisms that allow organisms to achieve cryptic growth within the rock substrate.</p><p>Sands and desert crusts. Many sands and soils harbour microbial crusts composed of diverse assemblages/communities of organisms with a photosynthetic component <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Belnap and Lange, 2001</ref>). Many of these are visible from the surface, however some, particularly in extreme deserts, are located beneath the surface. Soil crusts have previously been recognised as potential analogs for life on the early Earth <ref type="bibr">(Campbell, 1979)</ref>. Cryptic photosynthesis within soils and sands (including desert crusts) depends upon the presence of translucent substrates which allow sufficient light penetration for photosynthetic growth in the grain interstices <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref>. The presence of granular materials such as sands and soils into which photosynthetic organisms can grow is a reasonable assumption for any planet with water and thus a hydrological cycle driving weathering processes, which produce granular material from parent minerals. The organisms that inhabit soil crusts are diverse and influenced by the specific mineralogy of a given crust, such as the diverse soil and desert crusts of the Colorado Plateau, USA ( <ref type="bibr">Garcia-Pichel et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Some of these communities grow in habitats with negligible precipitation, relying on 'occult precipitation' from dew and fog, and even atmospheres of very high relative humidity, to permit photosynthesis and growth <ref type="bibr">(Lange et al., 1994)</ref>. The organisms are generally desiccation tolerant (unlike the vegetative stages of most vascular land plants) and are poikilohydric (cannot control their water loss, as can the homoiohydric vascular land plants; <ref type="bibr">Raven, 1995)</ref>. Interestingly, rehydration after desiccation to a water content permitting growth is possible using water from a high atmospheric relative humidity alone with green algae (free-living and lichenised), but not with free-living cyanobacteria and cyanolichens <ref type="bibr">(Lange et al., 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">(Lange et al., , 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lange et al., , 2001</ref>). It is likely that the extent of hydration is an important factor for many non-aquatic communities relying on cryptic photosynthesis (including all types of endoliths); lack of hydration limits photosynthesis by inhibiting metabolism, while excessive hydration can restrict gas exchange with atmosphere as a result of the much lower diffusion constants of CO 2 and O 2 in water than in air <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lange et al., 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaporitic</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>communities.</head><p>Cryptic communities are also found in salt deposits <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.1d</ref>) such as the cyanobacterial colonization of halite deposits in Baja, <ref type="bibr">California (Rothschild et al., 1994)</ref> and halite deposits in the Atacama Desert, Chile <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wierzchos et al., 2006</ref>). Thus, even transient minerals produced by weathering and evaporative processes can host cryptic communities. The communities often form well-defined zones within the substrate, such as zones dominated by cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria beneath them <ref type="bibr">(Oren et al., 1995)</ref>. Evaporites containing halite require that their occupants are halophilic or at least halotolerant.</p><p>Communities in evaporitic deposits in extreme environments have been described. Similarly to endolithic organisms that inhabit the interior of rocks, the habitat can provide protection from environmental extremes. For example, cyanobacteria, principally Chroococcidiopsis morphotypes, inhabit evaporitic deposits in the Atacama desert <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wierzchos et al., 2006</ref>). The organisms inhabit halite outcrops within the desert's hyperarid zone, achieving metabolic activity during periods of moisture availability, which is hypothesised to be assisted by halite deliquescence <ref type="bibr">(Davilla et al., 2008)</ref>. Organisms within evaporites are not confined to extreme environments, however, and occur wherever evaporative conditions favour salt deposit formation.</p><p>For example, the colonization of salt deposits in the Harz Mountains, Germany, by cyanobacteria has been investigated <ref type="bibr">(Bioson et al., 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cryptic biota based on the various phases of water</head><p>In addition to rock-forming minerals, the different phases of water, both on land and in water bodies, can host cryptic communities. Snow and ices can hide a photosynthetic biota beneath. The diversity of cryptic biota associated with these habitats is large. They include organisms covered by transient seasonal snow and ices and biota living permanently beneath snow and ice covers. The best-studied example of the latter biota is photosynthetic mats that inhabit the perennially ice-covered lakes of Antarctica (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hawes and Schwartz, 2001</ref>).</p><p>Sea ice. Sea ice typically has a brown layer at the bottom when viewed from beneath, or in section; this brown layer consists of (photosynthetic) diatoms and other biota in brine channels <ref type="bibr">(Arrigo et al., 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arrigo et al., , 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arrigo et al., , 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">Lizotte, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thomas and Dieckmann, 2002</ref>). Sea ice occurs mainly in the Antarctic and shows great seasonal variability; at its maximum extent it covers 35 x 10 6 km 2 , or 13% of the Earth's surface <ref type="bibr">(Parkinson and Gloerson, 1993)</ref>. Although ice can be transparent, in most natural environments heterogeneities in the ice structure and/or snow coverings make the biota spectrally hidden to observers above the material.</p><p>Deep Chlorophyll Maximum. Cryptic photosynthesis can occur in water bodies or oceans and could be relevant for planets with oceans or even covered entirely by oceans <ref type="bibr">(Léger et al., 2004</ref>). O 2 -producing organisms at more than few metres depth of an ocean ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beckmann and Hense, 2007)</ref> or a lake are non-detectable in reflectance measurements due to the overlying water column that attenuates the reflected light from the organisms beneath (see <ref type="bibr">Weston et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Xiu et al., 2007)</ref>. Photosynthetic pigments can only be remotely detected if they occur in the top few metres of the water body. Shorter wavelengths of PAR are absorbed by water to a smaller extent than is red and infra-red radiation so that "blue to green ratios" are used to detect chlorophyll ( <ref type="bibr">Platt and Sathyendrenath 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Falkowski and Raven, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Xiu et al., 2007</ref>).</p><p>The DCM phenomenon involves the occurrence of phytoplankton, typically measured as their chlorophyll, at a substantial depth in a large water body. This depth is usually more than 10 m and as great as 100 m or more in ocean waters with a low attenuation coefficient for PAR. DCMs can persist for periods of weeks to (at least) years, although with variations in their depth <ref type="bibr">(Huisman et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>The occurrence of DCMs involves phytoplankton organisms of neutral or negative buoyancy (i.e. sinking relative to the surrounding water) within a definite range of values of vertical mixing of the water column ( <ref type="bibr">Klausmeier and Litchman, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fennel and Boss, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hodges and Rudnik, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ruiz et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raven and Waite, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huisman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beckman and Hense, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The formation of DCMs can be considered in the context of the inverse gradients of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and nutrients in the surface ocean, combined with sinking of phytoplankton that are denser than the surrounding water <ref type="bibr">(Huisman et al., 2006, Beckman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hense, 2007</ref>). Attenuation of PAR by water, dissolved material and particles including organisms gives an exponential decay in PAR with depth <ref type="bibr">(Falkowski and Raven, 2007)</ref>. Phytoplanktonbased productivity converts dissolved nutrients into particles, some of which sink and are biologically mineralised at depth, regenerating the nutrients. Return of the nutrients to the photic zone can be by permanent or seasonal upwelling (advection), or, over a larger area, by vertical turbulent diffusion <ref type="bibr">(Huisman et al., 2006</ref>).</p><p>A DCM forms when the supply of nutrients by turbulent diffusion is largely consumed in the DCM, with loss of phytoplankton and nutrients by sinking. The rate at which cells sink out of a DCM is an important factor in its dynamics and, in the limiting case, its steady state <ref type="bibr">(Huisman et al., 2006</ref>). Further to complicate the issue, <ref type="bibr">Pilati and Wurtsbaugh (2003)</ref> have experimental evidence from a lake that persistence of a DCM requires the activities of zooplankton grazers.</p><p>The DCM represents an example of cryptic photosynthesis not obviously caused by extreme conditions, but rather by the interaction of the spatial constraints on the simultaneous availability of two resources, i.e. PAR and nutrients. To the extent that the phytoplankton under these conditions escape damage by high PAR <ref type="bibr">(Raven, 1989)</ref> and/or UV at the surface, then their occurrence in a DCM could be regarded as means of avoiding extreme conditions. This situation may have been the case earlier in Earth's history between the time at which oxygenic photosynthesis originated and sufficient oxygen built up in the atmosphere to produced an effective atmospheric UV screen.</p><p>These examples show that cryptic photosynthesis can occur in many terrestrial and aquatic planetary environments; all lithologies can harbour cryptic photosynthesis (igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic), as can salts and minerals generated by evaporative processes, and environments containing liquid or frozen forms of water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRODUCTION OF THE OXYGEN BIOSIGNATURE</head><p>Can a cryptic biota produce an oxygen atmospheric signature? In this section we explore whether a cryptic world could produce a level of oxygen in the atmosphere that is detectable with future space based missions. The extent to which a cryptic photosynthetic biosphere could produce an oxygen biosignature on a given planet depends on a diversity of factors that are poorly quantified on Earth and unknown for extrasolar planets <ref type="bibr">(Catling et al., 2005</ref>). They include, inter alia: 1) the size of the planet, which will influence the extent of plate tectonics and hydrogen escape, 2) the area covered by the communities and the proportion of different cryptic biota, which will influence total oxygen production, 3) the quantity of abiotic reductants produced which must be oxidised before a net oxygen accumulation can occur, 4) the area of continents, which will influence carbon turnover and extent of long-term carbon sinks, 5) the flux and spectral quality of light from the host star, which will influence photosynthetic productivity <ref type="bibr">(Wolstencroft and Raven, 2006</ref>), and 6) the sinks for reduced carbon, which will influence net oxygen accumulation. Oxygen accumulation in the atmosphere relies on there being a sink for the carbon reduced from CO 2 , such as sequestration in the deep ocean or lithosphere.</p><p>Nevertheless, one can make a crude estimate of oxygen production using published data on cryptic photosynthesis. Cryptic photosynthetic communities show huge variability in their productivity. In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we have compiled a range of data from different communities and estimated the O 2 production of the communities based on published carbon uptake data. On land cryptic biota generally have lower productivity than non-cryptic biota and this probably reflects their frequent association with extreme environments. For example, <ref type="bibr">Cockell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Stokes (2004, 2006</ref>) estimate high arctic hypolithic carbon uptake of 0.8 g C/m 2 /year which can be compared to the estimates published by Raven (1995) of 0.9 µmol CO 2 /m 2 /s -equivalent to 380 g C/m 2 /year -for a mat of filamentous cyanobacteria. This two order of magnitude difference would be consistent with the low light levels and cold temperatures that the hypoliths must endure on the underside of polar rocks and the transient summer activity that was assumed in the calculations ( <ref type="bibr">Cockell and Stokes, 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Johnston and Vestal (1991)</ref> concluded that Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are about two orders of magnitude less productive than the open oceans.</p><p>The potential O 2 production by planetary-scale cryptic biota can be crudely calculated. Some workers have attempted to estimate the annual productivity of communities taking into account nanoclimate data acquired in the field. The mean net photosynthetic uptake of Antarctic cryptoendoliths is estimated to be 606 mg C/m 2 /y ( <ref type="bibr">Friedmann et al., 1993)</ref>. Assuming a classic stoichiometric production of O 2 for CO 2 taken up in photosynthesis, this is equivalent to the production of 2.2 g O 2 /m 2 /y. If these communities covered the entire planetary surface then their annual O 2 output could be ~1.1 x 10 15 g/y. The quantity of oxygen in the atmosphere today is ~1.5 x 10 18 kg. Therefore, in theory these communities could produce the total quantity of O 2 found in the present atmosphere in about 1.3 Myr. Not all organic carbon is buried to cause net O 2 atmospheric accumulation. If 0.1% of the net carbon taken up by the endoliths is eventually buried as is assumed for deep sea sediments <ref type="bibr">(Hedges, 2002)</ref>, then it would take approximately 1.3 Gyr to accumulate today's oxygen concentration. However, generating this concentration is not required to produce a detectable oxygen biosignature. Kaltenegger et al. calculate that the lowest concentration of oxygen that could be detected in a planetary atmosphere is 10 -3 PAL (Present Atmospheric Level) for a resolution of 70 in the visible and 25 in the mid IR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kaltenegger et al. 2007</ref>). Thus, oxygen accumulation to detectable levels could occur much more rapidly.</p><p>There are obvious simplifications in this calculation. As <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows, the polar cryptoendolithic case is conservative and many cryptic habitats have much greater productivity. There is a trend towards increasing productivity in temperate cryptoendoliths and cryptic biota generally. At the same time, this calculation is obviously grossly simplistic as reductants are constantly being produced, such as in volcanism (and they would be at high concentrations in young atmospheres). This factor will reduce O 2 accumulation as it probably did on the early Earth. Finally, as listed at the beginning of this section, there are other factors that influence net oxygen accumulation in the atmosphere. However, the calculation shows that cryptic terrestrial photosynthesis could, under the right conditions, produce sufficiently large quantities of oxygen over geological time periods to produce an oxygen biosignature.</p><p>Similarly, in the oceans, cryptic photosynthesis exhibits smaller productivity than non-cryptic biota, but values may still be high enough to produce oxygen accumulation over geologic time periods. For example, sea ice communities are estimated to assimilate 0.063-0.070 Pg carbon in photosynthesis per year <ref type="bibr">(Lizotte, 2001</ref>) in contrast to phytoplankton in this zone, which contribute about 1.3 Pg carbon per year. For comparison, the total marine primary production today (almost all from phytoplankton) has been estimated at about 50 Pg carbon per year <ref type="bibr">(Field et al., 1998)</ref>, though higher values for the marine component have been suggested by del <ref type="bibr">Giorgio and Williams (2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Whittacker, 1975)</ref>. This suggests that the cryptic photosynthesis by sea ice diatoms accounts for about 0.1 % of global marine productivity whereas potentially detectable phytoplankton in the sea ice zone account for more than 2% of global marine productivity.</p><p>For the DCM, <ref type="bibr">Weston et al. (2005)</ref> found that it accounted for 37% of total annual new (i.e. potentially exportable) production in the summer-stratified North Sea. While the spatial and temporal extent of DCMs in the ocean is variable, these data suggest that DCMs contribute a significant amount to global primary productivity in the oceans, as in lakes <ref type="bibr">(Moll and Stoermer, 1982)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that, where DCMs occur, they account for 5-90% of the primary productivity in the water column (total productivity, not just the 'new' exportable production).</p><p>The requirement for net oxygen accumulation is a carbon sink. On land, estimates of carbon sequestration by cryptic photosynthesis are unreliable since the longterm fate of fixed carbon from these communities has generally not been studied. The most important long-term sink for landproduced carbon is ocean sediment burial after riverine and Aeolian input <ref type="bibr">(Hedges, 1992)</ref>. Another plausible long-term sink for carbon is in freshwater sedimentary basins and subsequent burial, in a similar manner to coal formation. With respect to polar environments, where many of the cryptic biota discussed in this paper are located, permafrost is a potential long-term carbon sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zimov et al., 2006</ref>). The permafrost of the Arctic is estimated to hold ~400 Gt of carbon and can act as a sink over megayear time scales. On a cold planet with predominantly frozen conditions carbon could be leached from cryptic biota into the active zone to subsequently freeze and allow for net O 2 accumulation. <ref type="bibr">Friedmann et al. (1993)</ref> investigated the fate of fixed carbon from Antarctic cryptoendoliths and calculated that about 50% of the carbon is lost into the environment without being respired. This carbon could become available for storage.</p><p>In the case of marine environment it seems likely that carbon from sea-ice communities or a DCM could be buried in deep-ocean sedimentary deposits in analogy to the Earth, allowing for net O 2 accumulation. We have been unable to find data on the life-time and ultimate sedimentation of the organic carbon produced in sea ice, but the DCM is better studied. Primary productivity in DCMs depends on input of nutrients by eddy diffusion (see <ref type="bibr">Huisman et al. 2006</ref>). This productivity involving nutrient input from outside the zone where photosynthesis occurs is termed 'new production' by oceanographers and limnologists, in contrast to 'regenerated (or recycled) production' where remineralisation occurs in close proximity to the primary producers. 'New production' also includes surface productivity based on upwelled water, atmospheric inputs of combined (non-N 2 ) nitrogen, iron and phosphorus and biological nitrogen fixation. All forms of new production can be exported to deeper waters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Weston et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Weston et al. (2008)</ref> indicated a very important role for the DCM in export production in the shallow southern North Sea. However, long-term net organic carbon burial depends on net input of combined nitrogen, phosphorus and iron and from biological nitrogen fixation in the water body. DCMs are typically remote from nutrient inputs from rivers, are 10 -≥100 m vertically from the site of atmospheric nutrient inputs, and are often too deep for the most of the photosynthetic organisms that can carry out the energyintensive process of biological nitrogen fixation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Letelier et al. 2004</ref>). This means that they seem to ultimately depend on the export component of surface primary productivity elsewhere in the ocean. However, on a planet whose oceanic primary productivity is all at 10 -≥ 100 m and where there is no competition for nutrient from surface-dwelling primary producers there could be export production and burial of carbon from the DCM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model description -Radiative transfer model to generate spectra of Earth and planets</head><p>where the predominant photosynthetic output is cryptic. The radiative transfer model we use to generate the spectra of cryptic planets and Earth is based on a code that was originally developed to calculate the Earth's infrared transmission spectrum <ref type="bibr">(Stier and Traub, 1978)</ref>, later extended to include infrared emission as well as visible transmission, and has since been used extensively for analyzing high resolution Fourier Transform spectra from ongoing stratospheric balloon-based observations to study the photochemistry and transport of the Earth's stratosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Jucks et al., 1998</ref>). Our line-by-line radiative transfer code has also been used for numerous planetary disk modelling studies, both for theoretical work (e.g. Des <ref type="bibr">Marais et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Traub and Jucks 2002)</ref> and for fitting observed Earthshine spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Woolf et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turnbull et al., 2006</ref>) and infrared data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kaltenegger et al., 2007)</ref>, and finally for calculating the visible and infrared spectrum of the Earth over geological time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kaltenegger et al., 2007)</ref>. The model provides an excellent fit to observed reflection and emission data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Woolf et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turnbull et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Christensen and Pearl, 1997</ref>).</p><p>We use a simple geometrical model in which the spherical planet is modelled with a plane parallel atmosphere and a single angle of incidence and reflection. This angle is selected to give the best analytical approximation to the integratedEarth air mass factor of two for a nominal illumination (quadrature); the zenith angle of this ray is 60 deg.</p><p>We model Earth's and cryptic world's reflection spectra using Earth's spectroscopically most significant molecules at Earth's present atmospheric pressure (H 2 O, O 3 , O 2 , CH 4 , CO 2 , CFC 11 , CFC 12 , NO 2 , HNO 3 , N 2 and N 2 O). We divide the atmosphere into 30 thin layers from 0 to 100 km altitude. The spectrum is calculated at very high spectral resolution, with several points per line width, where the line shapes and widths are computed using Doppler and pressure broadening on a line-by-line basis, for each layer in the model atmosphere. We include opacities due to Rayleigh scattering for each layer in the model atmosphere. We assume that the different reflecting layers (one surface and three cloud layers) can be approximated by 4 parallel streams that are co-added to produce the overall spectrum. All streams traverse the same molecular atmosphere, but each stream reflects from a different surface. For example, the first stream reflects from the planet's surface at 0 km altitude, the second and third stream reflect from a cloud layer with a top at an adjustable height (1 km and 6 km), and the fourth stream reflects from a cloud at a high altitude (12 km).</p><p>We adopt an overall 60% cloud cover factor for our Earth and planet models, with the relative proportions of cloud at each altitude being set to be consistent with the Earthshine data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Woolf et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turnbull et al., 2006</ref>). The proportional factors are 40% of the total at 1 km, 40% at 6 km, and 20% high cloud at 12 km for today's Earth. Most surface features like ice or sand show very small or very smooth continuous reflectivity changes with wavelength (albedo data from ASTER 1999, USGS 2003) (see Kaltenegger, 2007 for details). In our models we assign 70% of the planetary surface as ocean, 2% as coast, and 28% as land. The land surface for present-day Earth consists of 30% grass, 30% trees, 9% granite, 9% basalt, 15% snow and 7% sand. For the modelled cryptic worlds, the fraction of Earth's surface that is covered by vegetation (60%) is assumed to be made out of materials associated with cryptic photosynthesis habitats. These individual surfaces for the present-day Earth as well as cryptic photosynthesis habitats (no vegetation) are co-added percentage-wise to model a realistic Earth surface (this part of the model is shown in case a). For our final models the spectra from the surfaces and clouds are coadded with the indicated weights (case b) (see <ref type="figure">Fig.2</ref>).</p><p>The overall high-resolution spectrum is calculated, and smeared to lower resolution, like that proposed for missions such as Darwin/TPF. For reference and further explanation concerning the code, the reader is referred to our calculation of a complete set of molecular constituent spectra, for a wide range of mixing ratios, for the present Earth pressure-temperature profile, for the visible and thermal infrared, in Des <ref type="bibr">Marais et al. (2002)</ref>, and for the Earth over geological time, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kaltenegger et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>Results. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> summarises our results and show the expected spectral signatures of worlds harbouring cryptic photosynthetic biota. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows reflection spectra from 0.5 to 2 µm (the visible to near-IR region) for eight different cryptic photosynthesis worlds compared to present-day Earth with Earth cloud coverage for a disk averaged view. To highlight the difference in the overall detectable spectra, we model two scenarios for every cryptic world: a) we replace the fraction of Earth's surface that exhibits vegetation with the habitat of the chosen habitat and b) we assume that there were no clouds on that planet or their contribution could be averaged out of the spectrum. Case b) is chosen to explore the difference of the surface features of cryptic worlds in detail, but is currently considered unrealistic for a remote observation of a planet. Note that there is a factor of 5 in scale between the plots a) including and b) excluding clouds, demonstrating the high albedo of clouds in comparison to surface albedos. Clouds reduce any surface features (e.g. the red edge) considerably.</p><p>To remotely detect potential life on other planets with space mission in preparation, we explore the absorption features in its spectrum and whether any of these features cannot be explained without a biological source to produce them. On Earth the high oxygen concentration in our atmosphere is a sign of biological activity, especially in combination with methane.</p><p>As signs of life in themselves H 2 O and CO 2 are secondary in importance because although they are raw materials for life, they are not unambiguous indicators of its presence. Both existed a long time in Earth's atmosphere before life appeared. The oxygen and ozone absorption features in the visible and thermal infrared respectively could have been used to indicate the presence of photosynthetic biological activity on Earth anytime during the past 50% of the age of the solar system, while the red edge reflection feature evolved only during the most recent 10% of the age of the solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kaltenegger et al., 2007)</ref>. Oxygen is likely to be biogenic when found in combination with water if the planet's temperature is moderate and a runway greenhouse stage-like proposed for early Venus -can be excluded (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Selsis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Segura et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In the visible to near-infrared one can see increasingly strong H 2 O bands at 0.73 µm, 0.82 µm, 0.95 µm, and 1.14 µm. The strongest O 2 feature is the saturated Fraunhofer A-band at 0.76 µm. A weaker feature at 0.69 µm can not be seen with low resolution. O 3 has a broad feature, the Chappius band, which appears as a broad triangular dip in the middle of the visible spectrum from about 0.45 µm to 0.74 µm that can also be seen. CO 2 has negligible visible features at present abundance and accounts for the weak 1.06 µm feature. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates that cryptic worlds would show surface reflectance spectral signatures in the 0.4 to 2 µm range entirely explained by abiotic materials for a variety of biota found on Earth (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), but are habitable worlds..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>On a hypothetical planet where surface vegetation never developed, or surface conditions are more extreme than on presentday Earth, or a high impact rate favours cryptic photosynthesis, or where the complete surface is ocean-covered, a substantial amount of O 2 production could occur within cryptic photosynthetic communities. On such a planet a surface biosignature such as the Vegetation Red Edge would never develop. The reflection surface spectrum of such extrasolar worlds would be dominated by standard mineral and water reflections. Prior to the rise of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere and the formation of an ozone shield, the initial production of oxygen would have been accomplished by a photosynthetic biota protected from UV radiation that was essentially cryptic. Marine cryptic photosynthesis would have been most important as net carbon burial would likely have been more effective in the oceans than on land, and therefore would have made a greater contribution to atmospheric oxygenation. From this standpoint, the Earth during the onset of the Great Oxygenation Event ~2.4 Ga ago until the appearance of a red edge ~0.45 Ga ago may have exhibited a cryptic photosynthesis signature.  <ref type="bibr">Friedmann, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bell and Sommerfield, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wessels and Büdel, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kurtz and Netoff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Saiz- Jimenez et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cockell et al., 2002</ref> 0  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">1978;</ref><ref type="bibr">Büdel and Wessels, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Büdel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Smith et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schlesinger et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warren- Rhodes et al., 2006</ref> 2.9 g O 2 /m 2 /y ( <ref type="bibr">Cockell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Stokes, 2004, 2006</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pollehne et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">MacKey et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klausmeier and Litchman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fennel and Boss, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hodges and Rudnik, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee and Whitledge, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weston et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huisman et al.,2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beckmann and Hense, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hanson et al. , 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Xiu et al., 2007)</ref> characteristics.
