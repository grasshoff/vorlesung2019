			<abstract>
				<p>The Doppler technique measures the reflex radial motion of a star induced by the presence of companions and is the most successful method to detect ex-oplanets. If several planets are present, their signals will appear combined in the radial motion of the star, leading to potential misinterpretations of the data. Specifically, two planets in 2:1 resonant orbits can mimic the signal of a single planet in an eccentric orbit. We quantify the implications of this statistical degeneracy for a representative sample of the reported single exoplanets with available datasets, finding that 1) around 35% percent of the published eccentric one-planet solutions are statistically indistinguishible from planetary systems in 2:1 orbital resonance, 2) another 40% cannot be statistically distinguished from a circular orbital solution and 3) planets with masses comparable to Earth could be hidden in known orbital solutions of eccentric super-Earths and Neptune mass planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Most of the +300 exoplanets found to date have been discovered using the Doppler technique, which measures the reflex motion of the host star induced by the planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marcy &amp; Butler 1996)</ref>. The diverse characteristics of these exoplanets are somewhat surprising. Many of them are similar in mass to Jupiter, but orbit much closer to their host stars. This finding has led to extensive work on planet formation and migration theories to explain how those planets got to their present location (eg. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ward 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ida &amp; Lin 2004</ref>). Also, many of the planets seem to move in orbits with eccentricies significantly larger than those observed in the Solar System (where e &lt; 0.1, except for Mercury which has e ∼ 0.2), This result poses a problem for the planet formation theories of Core Accretion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) and Disk Instability (Boss 1997), since both predict that planets form in quasi-circular orbits. The current explanation is that large eccentricities are triggered by secular interactions, i.e. the Kozai effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Soderhjelm 1975)</ref>, or by rare close-in encounters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ford et al. 2005</ref>). The true distribution of exoplanet eccentricities is therefore key to understand the formation of planetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thommes et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>About 25% of the planets detected to date are in multiplanetary systems. The first multi-planet system was discovered around the solar type star υ Andromedae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Butler et al. 1997a</ref>). Currently we know of three planets in that system with masses between 0.69 and 3.95 m Jup and orbital periods between 4.6 and 1275 days. The second multi-planet system discovery was around the M dwarf Gliese 876 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Delfosse et al. 1998</ref>). In that case, the first detected planet (Gl 876b, with Msini = 1.935 M Jup and P = 60.94 days), was the one orbiting furthest from the star. A better sampling of the Doppler curve led to the subsequent discovery of the other two planets, Gl 876c, a 0.56 M Jup planet orbiting with a period of 30.1 days and Gl 876d, a closer-in 0.018 M Jup planet with a period of only 1.94 days. Gl 876b and c, in particular, are in 2:1 resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Laughlin &amp; Chambers 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, multi-planet systems are usually first detected as a single planet in a significanly eccentric orbit. Then, every time an additional planet is found, the eccentricities of the already known planets tend to decrease. This is because spurious harmonics due to random noise and uneven sampling are absorbed at half of the period of the detected planet when an eccentric solution is forced (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lucy 2005</ref>, for a more detailed discussion on spurious eccentricities). 55 <ref type="bibr">Cnc (Fischer et al. 2008</ref>) and HD160691( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pepe et al. 2007</ref>) are the most clear examples. Both planetary systems started with detections of single massive planets with relatively large eccentricities (i.e. e &gt; 0.3). At present, the four planets detected in HD160691 and the five planets in 55 Cnc have all eccentricities smaller than 0.2. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> illustrates the evolution of the published eccentricities in 55 Cnc as more and more planets were discovered.</p><p>In this paper we explore the case where two-planet systems can be confused with single planets in eccentric orbits. The situation arises when two planets are in a circular 2:1 mean motion resonance being the outer one the most massive (m in /m out ≤ 0.5). Since a full Keplerian solution for a single planet is the natural choice, the statistical degeneracy explained in detail in Sec. 1 introduces an observational bias towards eccentric solutions.</p><p>In the forthcoming sections we show how this bias can have important implications for the known sample of extrasolar planets, that is, a significant fraction of the reported eccentric planets may in fact be multiple systems in nearly circular orbits, and several very low mass planets might have been already detected, but their effect on the star has been misinterpreted as an orbital eccentricity of an outer more massive planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Mathematical solution degeneracy</head><p>The solution degeneracy between a single planet eccentric orbit and two planets in circular resonant orbits is a direct consequence of the well known Fourier expansion of the Kepler equation into powers of the eccentricity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moulton 1914</ref>, as an example). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konacki &amp; Maciejewski (1996)</ref>, the method of frequency analysis was first applied to an extrasolar planetary system and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konacki &amp; Maciejewski (1999)</ref> adapted it to Doppler measurements. The potential confusion between eccentric orbits and resonant systems has been briefly mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marcy et al. 2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ford (2006)</ref>, but this issue has not been specifically considered until now in a broad statistical sense.</p><p>Mathematically, the degeneracy between the resonant and the eccentric solutions comes from the fact that their equations of Keplerian trajectories are identical up to first order in the eccentricity. Detailed analytical expressions in terms of the Bessel functions can be found elsewhere (eg. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konacki &amp; Maciejewski 1999</ref>). The relevant terms up to the 7th power in the eccentricity can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lucy (2005)</ref>. Here we only discuss the first order term, which is the one relevant to the degeneracy under discussion</p><p>In the case of a single eccentric planet, the reflex radial velocity motion of the star is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v e r = v r0 + K cos [W (t − τ 0 )] (1) + Ke cos [2W (t − τ 0 ) − ω] + O(Ke 2 ) ,</formula><p>where v r0 is the linear radial velocity of the barycenter of the system, K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity variations induced by the planet on the star, ω is the argument of the periastron (angle between the periastron of the orbit and the ascending node), τ 0 is the time of crossing of the ascending node, and W = 2π/P is the orbital frequency, where P is the orbital period (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>). The term proportional to Ke is called the first eccentric harmonic, while the term O(Ke 2 ) contains all the higher order contributions.</p><p>If instead we have a two-planet system, both in circular orbits and the inner planet having an orbital period half of the outer one, i.e. W 2 = 2W (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref>), the expression for the radial velocity of the star is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v R r = v r0 + k 1 cos [W (t − τ 0 )] (2) + k 2 cos [2W (t − τ 0 ) + φ 0 ] + O(k 1 e 1 , k 2 e 2 , Ke 2 ),</formula><p>where k 1 and k 2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the outer and the inner planet. W and τ 0 are the orbital frequency and the time of crossing of the ascending node of the outer planet, and the angle φ 0 is the relative phase between the two planets at τ 0 . Higher order terms, summarized here as O(k 1 e 1 , k 2 e 2 , Ke 2 ), become significant if the orbits are allowed to be eccentric.</p><p>To a first order approximation, v e r and v R r are formally identical if k 1 = K, k 2 = Ke, and φ 0 = −ω. This implies that the signal k 2 of an inner lower-mass planet will be indistinguishable from the first eccentric harmonic Ke unless the observations are precise enough to resolve the second order term in the harmonic expansion. The amplitude of that second order term is 9/8 Ke 2 ∼ Ke 2 . (see Appendix A in Lucy 2005).</p><p>The similarity of both solutions is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which shows how the Doppler radial velocity curves would look like in each case (one-planet in an eccentric orbit versus two resonant planets in circular orbits), for different values of ω and e. The two configurations can be easily confused, especially when e &lt; 0.3 in the single planet case (or equivalently, when the inner planet is significantly less massive than the outer planet,i.e. k 2 &lt;&lt; k 1 ). Confusion is also possible for larger values of e if the uncertainties are large and the radial velocity curves are sparsely sampled, which is the case for several published Doppler velocity curves. As an example estimate, if the detected semi-amplitude and eccentricity are K ∼ 100 ms −1 and e ∼ 0.1, the amplitude of the second harmonic will be Ke 2 ∼ 1 ms −1 and both orbital solutions are indistinguishable at the 3-σ level unless the precision of the data is better than 0.3 ms −1 . This is a problem, since only recently have planet hunting groups started to achieve that level of precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mayor et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fischer et al. 2008</ref>). All these statements will be made more precise in Section 2.1. There is also the accuracy limitation imposed by the stellar jitter 1 , which has typical amplitudes of 3-5 ms −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>). The optimal strategies and the limitations of the Doppler technique to disentangle this degeneracy are discussed in Sec. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Impact on known planetary systems</head><p>Since, at least, 200 of the 350 known exoplanets have reported eccentricities between 0.03 and 0.5, the mathematical degeneracy described in the previous section may be affecting a large fraction of known reported planets in eccentric orbits. Of course, this does not imply that all the reported eccentric solutions must be resonant pairs instead, but a singificant fraction of them may be, and this can have a strong impact on our undersanding of formation of planetary systems.</p><p>Assuming circular orbits, the mass of the inner companion candidate m h can be estimated from the Keplerian solution as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m h sin i = e 2 1/3 m 1 sin i,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where m 1 is the mass of the outer planet and e its eccentricity, both parameters derived from the one-planet fit. The sin i factor reflects the fact that the inclination i (and the true mass) is unknown when only Doppler information is available. When a resonant two-planet system is confused with a single eccentric planet, we refer to this situation as an eccentricity imposter. The term Ke 2 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives the amplitude of the signal that needs to be resolved in all radial velocity candidates to distinguish between solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Statistical analysis</head><p>In order to quantify the extent of this degeneracy in the currently known planet sample, we performed actual fits to most of the known candidates with available data up to the date (March 2009, see Exoplanet Encyclopedia 2 ). The data has been collected from two sources, the systemic project web page Systemic 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Laughlin et al. 2009)</ref>, and the NStED database 3 . Still, there is a significant number of published detections with no publicly available datasets. The transiting exoplanets have been excluded from the list because many of them have poorly sampled radial velocity curves and their true eccentricity can be determined by other means such as the photometric methods as described in Sec. 4.2. Known multi-planetary systems have been excluded from the list as well. These systems requires a more complex analysis which addds unnecessary complications at this point. A number of highly eccentric planets have not been added in the main sample because there is no reasonable doubt about their eccentric nature. Their eccentricities, their corresponding Ke 2 and the SNR of the second eccentric harmonic are given in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> and they are included in the statistical discussion at the end of this section. The sample processed by our orbital fitting approach contains 163 datasets listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Our method is based on a sequential fit of three different models: circular, resonant and finally Keplerian. This approach takes maximum advantage of the epicyclic decomposition of the radial velocity signal as given in equation (1). For practical purposes, equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> can be writen as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v e r = γ + A sin (W t) + B cos (W t)<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ C sin (2W t) + D cos (2W t)</formula><p>+ β t which shows that the only severe non-linearity on the expression for the Doppler Keplerian signal is in the period. All the other orbital parameters can be obtained as combinations of the coefficients using basic trigonometric identities. The parameter β takes into account the signal of very long period objects which appear as a linear trend. It is usually fitted to the published solution and we will keep it as a free parameter in all that follows.</p><p>Step 1 consists on doing a linear Least Squares fitting(LS) of γ, A, B and β for many test periods. The best period is the one which gives the minimum χ 2 . This is equivalent to the classic Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but has the advantage that the peaks (Least Squares minima in this case) and the coefficients from the fit have a direct physical interpretation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cumming 2004</ref>, for a review on the topic).</p><p>In a second step, the data is fitted against the more complete model containing γ, A, B, C, D and β using many test periods around the best circular solution found in step 1. Let us remark again that the only strong nonlinearity lies on the period, so the fitting of the linear parameters can be done very efficiently and without danger of ending in a local minimum, a problem which plagues more direct attack methods. The solution of this step gives the best resonant orbital solution.</p><p>Finally, the exact Keplerian expression for the radial velocity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lucy &amp; Sweeney 1971</ref>) is fitted to the data using a non-linear Least Squares approach. The seed values of the parameters for the Keplerian solution are obtained from the resonant solution using the map defined by equations (1) and (2). The optimal Keplerian fit is done using a straight-forward non-linear LS minimization scheme using the analytic partial derivatives of the Doppler signal with respect to the orbital parameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Press et al. 1992</ref>). The final Keplerian fits we obtain are in good agreement with those found in the literature. Therefore, as a by-product of this study, we also proof a powerful method to attack the Kepler problem taking advantage of the Linearized form of the Keplerian motion. The χ 2 of each solution (circular, resonant and eccentric) are shown in columns 2, 3 and 4 on <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. The next step is to decide which of the orbital solutions is the best (resonant or Keplerian) and whether it is significantly better than the circular one. To do that, we apply the confidence level test given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lucy &amp; Sweeney 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lucy 2005)</ref>. We only accept one of the non-circular solutions if the c.l. is better than 95%.</p><p>In order to decide if the best non-circular solution (eg. resonant) is statistically better than the other one(eg. Keplerian) we compute the False Alarm Probability of the favoured solution as follows. Let us assume that the resonant solution is preferred, i.e. χ 2 res &lt; χ 2 ecc . Then we generate a synthetic data set using the best Keplerian solution. We add Gaussian noise with a standard deviation equal to the RMS of the Keplerian fit, and then obtain the best fit resonant configuration. This process is repeated a large number of times. The number of times when we get a χ 2 smaller than the real resonant solution illustrates how an (un)fortunate combination of random errors may be confusing a truly eccentric orbit with a resonant one. On the contrary, if the eccentric solution is preferred, we generate synthetic resonant data and fit for the Keplerian solution. Since this is a computationally expensive process, the FAP is initially computed based on 1000 synthetic realizations of the data. If the FAP is found to be smaller than 10% the FAP is recomputed using 10 5 datasets. The result of this process is illustrated in the last three columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>, which contains the preferred model, its FAP and a quality indicator: * indicates a FAP&lt; 5%, ** corresponds to FAP&lt; 1%, *** is FAP&lt; 0.1%. If the solutions are not significantly different (FAP &gt; 5%) they are flaged as U (undecided ).</p><p>The results of this procedure are also illustrated on <ref type="figure">Fig.3</ref>. The quantity on the y-axis is defined as the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the second harmonic and is computed from the best Keplerian fit as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">SNR (2) = Ke 2 RMS N obs (5)</formula><p>where RMS is the root mean square of the residuals and N obs is the number of observations. The horizontal line at SNR (2) = 4.32 is the minimal theoretical threshold to detect the second Keplerian harmonic, assuming that the required level of significance p is 95% as given in Lucy (2005, eq. 18). The black points are the undecided ones, this is, where the first eccentric harmonic is clearly significant (circular solution discarded) but the statistics are insufficient to decide which solution is significantly better (eccentric vs resonant).</p><p>A word of caution has to be made here. The χ 2 are obtained using the nominal uncertainities published with the Doppler data. It is well established that most of the stars introduce additional noise of astrophysical origin, that is usually called stellar jitter. The jitter makes it more difficult to disentangle the degeneracy under discussion, meaning that more accurate measurements with better spectrographs may not help. In the randomly generated datasets, not considering the noise due to the stellar jitter tends to give overoptimistic False Alarm Probabilities. This is the reason why we use the RMS of the solution rather than the published uncertainties to generate synthetic data.</p><p>In many cases, the current radial velocity data sets are sparsely sampled, and more intensive monitoring at the most sensitive phases is required (see Sec. 4.1), especially for those systems above the 4.32 line of <ref type="figure">Fig.3</ref> and marked on Tab. 3 as undecided. We also show how the number Ke 2 is a powerful discriminator to a priori decide if a dataset is sensitive to the second eccentric harmonic, or equivalently, if a dataset is able to disentangle the degeneracy under discussion by just computing SNR (2) using the Keplerian parameters. In all the cases where an eccentric/resonant solution is preferred against a circular one, we have added to column 6 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> the number of required observations N req to reach the SNR (2) of 4.32 according to the eccentricity and RMS of the best Keplerian solution using equation 5. A circular orbit means that the first eccentric harmonic proportional to Ke is already too small to be detected,so N req is not given. In many cases the number of required observations is extremly large. These cases are indicated with a +1000. Even if the minimum number of observations is reached, it is not always possible to distinguish between solutions depending on the sampled phase. In such cases, a few more points in the right phases should be enough to confirm a resonant candidate or a given eccentricity. It is also important to note that extending the time baseline can help disentagle resonant systems if the periods are not exactly 2 : 1 or if the system is in a strong interacting regime. This point is discussed again in Section 3.</p><p>Our results considering the sample of 163 planets plus the 13 very eccentric ones in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>. When the solution is clearly non-circular, our data processing approach is unable to determine which solution is favoured in 63% of the cases, which clearly proves the extent of the degeneracy. The statistical behaviour of the sample is in good agreement with the predicted degeneracy threshold at SNR (2) = 4.32. This gives us confidence in our data analysis scheme and the method we propose to evaluate the statistical significance of each solution using Monte Carlo generated False Alarm Probabilities. A few systems with already known resonant configurations which have gone to the process of : detect one eccentric planet and later discovery of a second planet in a 2:1 configuration; are not considered in these counting (eg. GJ 876 with 3 known planets, HD 128311 with 2 planets, HD 160691 with 4 planets). With this, we want to remark that highly ecentric candidates with unexplained large RMS (with large χ 2 in Tab.3) seem to be good targets to follow-up and uncover multiplanetary systems with very low mass companions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">HD 125612b/c?</head><p>A detailed analysis of our best resonant candidate system HD 125612, is discussed here to illustrate the procedure of evaluating the False Alarm probability in more detail. HD 125612b is a gas giant planet detected around a nearby G3V star as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref> (from now on F07). A common proper motion M4V companion has been recently associated to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mugrauer &amp; Neuhäuser (2009)</ref>. The M4V is at a minimum distance of ∼ 4750AU from HD 125612A and has negligible effects on the Doppler data during the time span of the observations. The star is relatively quiet, so the expected jitter is of the order of 2.0 m/s. F07 already pointed out an unexpectadly large RMS and ¯ χ 2 , indicating the presence of additional bodies in the system. We find that a resonant solution clearly improves the quality of purely Keplerian fit <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). Assuming a stellar mass of 1.1 M ⊙ , the best-fit masses of the putative resonant planets are m b = 3.2±0.4 m Jup and m c = 1.1±0.3 m Jup with P b = 509 ± 15 days and P c = 254.5 days (P c is not a free parameter in our resonant model). Since only 19 data points are available, we agree with F07 that more data is required to disentangle the true nature of this system.</p><p>To quantify how sigificant is the resonant solution with respect to the eccentric one, we compute the empirical False Alarm Probability as described in the previous section. For this experiment, we use the square root of the reduced χ 2 , (i.e. ¯ χ 2 ) to enable direct comparison with F07.</p><p>¯ χ 2 differs from χ 2 used in Section 2.1 by a constant multiplicative factor which is not relevant for the FAP estimations because the number of free parameters in the our resonant model is equal to the number of parameters of a single planet Keplerian solution. In this case we use the published uncertainities and the a nominal stellar jitter of 2.0 m/s to weight each observation and compute the ¯ χ 2 . Since the FAP is very small, we produce one million Monte Carlo realizations of the data. The histogram of the obtained ¯ χ 2 is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.5</ref>. In 350 out of one million cases, the resonant solution gives a better ¯ χ 2 than our best fit 1.64, obtaining a false alarm probability of 0.035%.</p><p>We perform the same experiment but assuming an exact resonant orbit, adding noise, and fitting a Keplerian orbit for another set of one million MC realizations. In this case, the Monte Carlo generated distribution of the ¯ χ 2 peaks at 3.5 very close to the ¯ χ 2 published in F07. This indicates that the obtained ¯ χ 2 = 3.6 by F07 is compatible with the confusion of a resonant system with an eccentric planet. We have repeated the experiment introducing different levels noise (form the nominal 2.0 m/s to 10 m/s), obtaining very small FAP in all cases.</p><p>Therefore, we find strong statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that HD 125612 has a pair of planets in the 2:1 resonance instead of a single eccentric planet. It clearly exemplifies how the degeneracy under discussion and how the natural bias to the eccentric orbital solutions can be affecting a good number of exoplanet discoveries.</p><p>Finally, the dynamical stability of the system has been checked by numerical orbital integrations up to 1 Myrs using Mercury <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chambers 1999</ref>). The integration of HD 125612 shows that the candidate resonant planets would be in a strongly interacting regime where one of the resonant critical arguments circulates and the other one has a large libration amplitude. However, the system remained stable and no close encounters occurred. Since the orbital solution is poorly constrained, more data is required to further constrain the orbital parameters and ensure the long term stability of the system. The resulting Doppler signal as a function of time is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. In the Figure, it can be seen that the dynamincal interactions between planets will have obvious effects on the Doppler signal in time-scales as short as a few orbital periods (∼ 10 years).</p><p>A small linear trend is required to obtain a good fit of the data (in both Keplerian and resonant cases), which is too large to be explained by the newly discovered M4V companion. This indicates the presence of an additional very long period and massive planet in the System. We strongly encourage the follow-up of this system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dynamical stability</head><p>As illustrated in the discussion of HD125612b, a question that needs to be addressed is whether the 2:1 resonant configurations in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> are, in general, dynamically stable. Several 2:1 resonant multi-planet systems have already been found (i.e. GJ 876, HD 82943, HD 73526, HD 128311). Dynamical stability of 2:1 resonant configurations has been also discussed by several authors. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee &amp; Peale (2002)</ref> show that resonant locking may arise naturally during the migration of exoplanets in the presence of a protoplanetary disk. The case where the outer planet is significantly more massive has been recently discussed in great detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Michtchenko et al. (2008)</ref>, concluding that long term stability is guaranteed and that the resonant capture during migration is particularly favoured. Therefore, there is no theoretical objection to the case addressed in this paper, on the contrary, recent work strongly support the existence and stability of k 2 &lt;&lt; k 1 systems in 2:1 resonant configurations.</p><p>Eccentric hot Neptunes (m 1 sin i &lt; 50 m ⊕ ), are particularly interesting since their potentially hidden companions are of a few Earth-masses or less (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). Their small Ke 2 makes it difficult to distinguish between solutions with the current instrumental accuracies but these are excellent targets to seek out for the effects of dynamical interactions. A very tantalizing case is the 4 planet system around GJ 581 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>) where the inner body is of a few earth masses and the new published solution for the exterior planet (GJ 581d) gives an eccentricity of 0.4. A resonant planet hidden in the eccentric solution of GJ 581d would perfectly fill the current gap between the 12 day orbit of GJ 581c and 66 day orbit of GJ 581d. The potential candidate would be of a few earth masses (∼ 2 − 3M ⊕ ) and would lie in the middle of the habitable zone. Recent dynamical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zollinger &amp; Armstrong 2009</ref>) considering all the planets except the small inner one, strongly support the stability of the system when adding a few Earth-mass planet in a fairly broad range of orbital configurations around the 2:1 resonance with GJ 581d. Since the inner planet is very small and in a very tight orbit, the authors do not expect these results will change too much. Given the RMS for GJ 581(∼ 1.46 m/s), an amplitude of the second harmonic for GJ 581d of 0.4 m/s and ignoring the dynamical interactions, the number of observations required to reach a SNR (2) of 4.32 and disentagle the degeneracy is ∼ 280. Compared to the current 110 observations,this number could be achieved in near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Breaking the degeneracy</head><p>The question now becomes on how to observationally identify eccentric imposters. We focus here on the Doppler and photometric methods, which are the only two techiques with currently enough sensitivity to discern between both cases. In the future, techniques such as astrometry and direct imaging will be useful as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Using improved Doppler data</head><p>As discussed in previous sections, the most direct approach is to increase the number of radial velocity observations, N obs , and their precision σ obs , until the condition SNR (2) &gt; 4.32 is satisfied. It is important to recall that the actual limit in pushing the accuracy σ obs is currently put by stellar jitter that and can be of the order of 2 − 5 ms −1 even for relatively quiet stars. We suspect that some of the undecided solutions in <ref type="figure">Fig 3 over</ref> the critical line of 4.32 are most likely dominated by stellar jitter or poorly sampled making still undecidible which solution is favoured.</p><p>The phase of maximal difference will depend on each particular combination of orbital parameters and has to be examined case by case by direct inspection of the best Keplerian solution compared to the best resonant one by subtracting both fitted models. As a general rule, the differences will be more obvious near the quadratures of the resonant solution, that is, around the extremes of the doppler curve and at the quadratures of the inner candidate seen as little bumps on the resonant signal (dashed line) in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>This strategy works better when the initial one-planet fit suggests a relatively large eccentricity e &gt; 0.3 and a poor initial fit. An example of this situation was the discovery of the planetary system around GJ 876. That system was initially confused with a single planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Delfosse et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Marcy et al. 1998</ref>) in an e ∼ 0.31 orbit. Additional observations revealed a system of two resonant planets with smaller eccentricities and in a strong interaction regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marcy et al. (2001)</ref>. Further observations and detailed numerical integration of the N-body problem by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2001)</ref> confirmed the presence of the two massive eccentric bodies and uncovered an additional very short period companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rivera et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, in the case of planets in a strongly interacting regime (see Sec. 2.2), the numerical integration of the orbits provides a powerful discrimination method and can be used to predict the timescale required to observe the dynamical effects which should be observed in the case of a resonant configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Photometric methods</head><p>A second approach is to use photometric observations. These can confirm or discard the presence of a second planet in some circumstances, either by detection of planetary transits and occultations, or by observing reflected light or thermal emission from the planets. Photometric methods are mostly efficient for planets in short period orbits, since those tend to be hot and have a higher probability of transiting in front of their star. Assuming that the period P , the eccentricity e, and τ 0 are known from the Doppler solution and that the orbital inclination of the planet is close to 90 0 (edge on), the predicted instant of transit T I depends on the eccentricity as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T I = τ 0 + NP 1 4 − eP cos ω π + O(e 2 ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where N is the number of integer periods elapsed from τ 0 . If the system contains a hidden companion, then the true e will be small and the transit will occur almost exactly 1/4P after crossing the line of nodes. This test is only significant if τ 0 is well constrained. An unambiguous determination of the eccentricity is obtained when both the primary transit and the occultation (planet passes behind the star), can be observed. This is because the time interval between these two events is independent of τ 0 . If the orbit is circular, the occultation occurs half period after the transit. If the orbit of the planet is truly eccentric, the time difference between the transit T I and the occultation T II is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T II − T I = P 2 + 2 eP cos ω π + O(e 2 ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>which can be as large as several hours on some of the known transiting planets.</p><p>A representative example where the observation of transits brakes the degeneracy is GJ 436. The star hosts a hot-neptune in an eccentric orbit (e ∼ 0.14) with a period of only 2.63 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Maness et al. 2007</ref>). The potential hidden companion would have a mass as low as 2.5m ⊕ . GJ 436b was recently found to transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gillon et al. 2007</ref>), but because of the uncertainity in τ 0 , the detection of the primary transit alone was not sufficient to confirm the eccentric orbit. Shortly after, the occultation was observed in thermal emission with the Spitzer telescope at the instant predicted by an eccentric solution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deming et al. 2007)</ref>. If the orbit of GJ 436b had been circular, the time of the occultation would differ by three hours from the observed time and would not be detected with the Spitzer observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We show that the Doppler signal of a single eccentric planet can mimic the signal of a two-planet system in a 2:1 circular or near-circular resonant orbit. This degeneracy is affecting a large fraction of the known exoplanets, this is, around 30 − 40% of the published single planet sytems. We also find strong evidence of at least one case (HD 125612) where the resonant solutions is significantly better than the published eccentric one by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fischer et al. (2007)</ref>. The analysis described in this paper can also be applied to multi-planet systems with eccentric candidates, where the degree of degeneracy is expected to be similar or even stronger due to the mixed signals of the different planets involved. The detailed analysis of multiplanetary systems is more complex and usually involves dynamical stability consideration. Therefore, a case by case study is imposed. A remarkable example is the planetary system around GJ 581 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>) were 2 − 3 earth mass planet could be hidden in the habitable zone of the system.</p><p>The only techniques currently able to distinguish between two resonant planets and single eccentric planet systems are limited to the Doppler and photometric approaches described above. In the future, other methods such as astrometry and direct imaging, will also provide ways to uncover eccentric imposters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moorhead &amp; Ford 2009</ref>). Astrometry will be the first one to become sensitive enough, once the upcoming space astrometric missions Gaia/ESA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lindegren et al. 2008</ref>, to be launched in 2011) and SIM/NASA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Unwin et al. 2008</ref>, to be launched after 2015), go on-line. High precision astrometry will be most helpful if the resonant orbits are not coplanar. Otherwise, it will suffer from the same degeneracies as the Doppler technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Konacki et al. (2002)</ref>. The ultimate test will be direct imaging, which will make possible to measure whether the orbit of the detected planet is indeed eccentric. This will have to wait until spaceborne missions such as a Darwin/TPF launch. The conclusions of this work make it worth reconsidering some published orbital solutions and motivate the follow-up of some interesting systems. We find that future announcements of eccentric planets should be carefully tested before publication since it is relatively simple to check if there is any improvement using a resonant configuration. Also, we find that several reported radial velocity curves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mayor et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayor et al. , 2009</ref>) may contain hidden signals of rocky planets.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">0 &lt; e &lt; 1 1a.</formula><p>1b.</p><p>e =e =0     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .aFig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Seen from above, diagrams of the relevant orbital parameters of one planet in an eccentric orbit (Left), and two planets in a 2:1 resonant circular orbit (Right). τ 0 is the instant of crossing of the line of nodes.
