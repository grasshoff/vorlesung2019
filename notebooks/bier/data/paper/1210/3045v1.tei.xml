			<abstract>
				<p>The TASTE project is searching for low-mass planets with the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, by gathering high-precision, short-cadence light curves for a selected sample of transiting exoplanets. It has been claimed that the &quot;hot Jupiter&quot; WASP-3b could be perturbed by a second planet. Presenting eleven new light curves (secured at the IAC80 and UDEM telescopes) and re-analyzing thirty-eight archival light curves in a homogeneous way, we show that new data do not confirm the previously claimed TTV signal. However, we bring evidence that measurements are not consistent with a constant orbital period, though no significant periodicity can be detected. Additional dynamical modeling and follow-up observations are planned to constrain the properties of the perturber or to put upper limits to it. We provide a refined ephemeris for WASP-3b and improved orbital/physical parameters. A contact eclipsing binary, serendipitously discovered among field stars, is reported here for the first time.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Most of the extrasolar planets discovered so far are massive, gaseous giant planets. The present trend is to probe smaller and smaller masses, with the final aim of detecting temperate "superEarths" or Earth-sized rocky planets (1-10 M ⊕ , 1-3 R ⊕ ) around solar-type stars. The signal expected from a true Earth analog orbiting a Sun twin is extremely small: ∼ 80 ppm for the photometric transit, and ∼ 10 cm/s for the radial velocity (RV) Doppler shift. In the conventional framework both measurements are required to derive the planetary radius and mass (R p , M p ), i.e. the basic quantities necessary to confirm the planetary status of the transiting body, and to characterize it. Achieving a photometric precision of ∼ 20 ppm (which would allow the detection of an Earth-like planet at 4σ level) over the timescale of a transit is within reach of space-based telescopes only, while a long-term 20 cm/s RV accuracy is still too ambitious even for the most stable spectrographs, like HARPS.</p><p>A few indirect techniques have been developed to get estimate of M p (or upper limits to it) for a non-transiting planet without the need of RV measurements, the most promising being the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method. By monitoring a known transiting planet by high-precision photometry, the central instant T 0 of each individual transit can be estimated. The ⋆ This article is based on observations made with the IAC80 telescope operated on the island of Tenerife by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in the Spanish Observatorio del Teide. ⋆⋆ email address: valerio.nascimbeni@unipd.it ⋆⋆⋆ INAF associated gravitational perturbation of a previously-unknown third body, not necessarily transiting, can cause a significant variation of the orbital period P <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>). The effect is greatly increased if the perturber is locked in a low-order meanmotion resonance with the transiting planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref>). The Asiago Search for Transit timing variation of Exoplanets (TASTE) project was started in 2010 to search for TTVs with several ground-based, medium-class facilities on a sample of carefully selected targets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nascimbeni et al. 2011a</ref>).</p><p>The TTV technique has been exploited and already gave interesting results on a number of Kepler mission candidates. Some candidate planets in multiple systems were validated through TTV analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>). In the past few years, some authors have claimed TTV detections also from ground-based facilities, but none is confirmed so far. Among these claims, WASP-10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Maciejewski et al. 2011</ref>), WASP-5b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fukui et al. 2011</ref>), the intriguing case of HAT-P-13b, that was monitored also by TASTE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pál et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nascimbeni et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Southworth et al. 2012)</ref>, and the subject of the present investigation: WASP-3b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>WASP-3b is a typical short period (P ≃ 1.8468 days) "hot Jupiter" (1.31 R jup , 1.76 M jup ), hosted by a F7-8 dwarf. It was discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pollacco et al. (2008)</ref>. Analyzing an O − C (Observed − Calculated) diagram computed by comparing the T 0 of fourteen transits with the value predicted by a linear ephemeris, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref> claimed the detection of a sinusoidal modulation with a period of P TTV ≃ 127.4 days and a semi-amplitude of ∼ 0.0014 days ≃ 2 min. They interpreted this signal as the effect of an outer perturber, identifying three possible orbital solutions in the range 6-15 M ⊕ and P = 3.03-3.78 days. No independent confirmation of this claim has been published so far, though both Littlefield (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sada et al. (2012)</ref> discussed the consistence of their data with that TTV modulation.</p><p>In this paper we present (Section 2) eleven unpublished transits of WASP-3b: six of them have been gathered at the IAC-80 telescope and five at the UDEM 0.36m (Universidad de Monterrey, Mexico). We also sifted the literature in search of all the archival photometric data useful for a TTV study (Section 3). In Sections 4 and 5 we describe how both new and archival light curves, for a total of forty-nine transits, were reduced and analyzed in a homogeneous way, with the same software tools to provide a consistent estimate of the planetary parameters and their uncertainties. This is crucial especially for T 0 , whose estimate has been shown to be easily biased by the employed analysis technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fulton et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Southworth et al. 2012</ref>). Besides T 0 , we also refined the orbital and physical parameters of WASP-3b, and computed an updated ephemeris (Eq. 10) for any forthcoming study on this target. In Section 5.2 we demonstrate that the TTV claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref> is not supported by our analysis, and probably due to small-sample statistics. Yet, we point out that the revised O − C diagram displays a complex, non-periodic structure and is not compatible with a constant orbital period. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the possible origin of this TTV signal, and show that careful dynamical modeling and additional photometric and RV follow-up is required to confirm the hypothesis and to constrain the mass and period of the possible perturber(s).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">IAC-80 observations</head><p>We observed six transits of WASP-3b between 2011 May 7 and Aug 2, employing the CAMELOT camera mounted on the IAC80 telescope. A log summarizing dates and other quantities of interest is reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Individual transits are identified by an ID code ranging from N1 to N6. IAC80 is a 0.8m Cassegrain reflector installed at the Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Canary Islands) and operated by Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC). CAMELOT is a conventional imager with a 10 ′ .4 × 10 ′ .4 field of view (FOV), equipped with a E2V 42-40 2048×2048 CCD detector, corresponding to a 0.304 ′′ pixel scale. The software clock interrogated to save the timestamps in the image headers is automatically synchronized with the GPS time signal.</p><p>All the observations were carried out with a standard Bessel R filter and the same instrumental setup. Windowing and 2 × 2 binning were employed to increase the duty-cycle of the photometric series, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nascimbeni et al. (2011a)</ref>. A 10.4 ′ × 3.2 ′ read-out window was chosen to image the target and a previously selected set of reference stars in a region of the detector free from cosmetic defects. The one-amplifier readout was preferred to prevent gain offsets between different channels. Stars were intentionally defocused to a FWHM of 10-13 binned pixels (≃ 6.0-8.0 ′′ ) to avoid saturation and to minimize systematic errors due to intra-pixel and pixel-to-pixel inhomogeneities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Southworth et al. 2009</ref>). Exposure time was set to 20 s (N1-4) or 15 s (N5-6), resulting in a net cadence τ = 19-25 s and a ∼ 75-87% duty-cycle, with the only exception of N3. On that night, due to software problems, the images were read unbinned and in unwindowed readout mode, decreasing both signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and duty-cycle.</p><p>The weather was photometric on all nights, except for a few thin veils during N3. Our initial goal was to start the series one hour before the first contact of the transit, and to stop one hour after the last contact. Nevertheless, the amount of pre-transit photometry is only a few minutes for the N4 and N6 light curves, and the N1 series was interrupted twenty minutes earlier because of twilight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">UDEM observations</head><p>We observed five transits of WASP-3b between 2008 Sep 3 and 2010 Aug 15 with the Universidad de Monterrey (UDEM) 0.36-m reflector. UDEM is a small private college observatory having Minor Planet Center Code 720 located in the suburbs of Monterrey, México. The data were acquired using standard Bessel I-and Sloan z-band filters with a 1280×1024 pixel CCD camera at 1.0 ′′ pixel scale, resulting in a field-of-view of ∼ 21 ′ .3 × 17 ′ .1. The observations were slightly defocused to improve the photometric precision and to avoid saturation. On-axis guiding was used to maintain pointing stability. Exposure times were set to 30 s for I and 40 s for z. All images were binned 2 × 2 to facilitate rapid readout (∼ 3 s). Each observing session lasted about 4.5 hours in order to accommodate the transit event and also to cover about one hour before ingress and one hour after egress. The computer clock was reset to UTC via Internet at the beginning of every observing session to the nearest second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Archival light curves</head><p>All the available archival data were searched for any light curve useful for a TTV analysis, i.e. complete transits of WASP-3b with a suitable S/N. Partial transits were rejected, except for a few cases with high S/N and without obvious presence of "red noise" after a visual inspection. We define red noise, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pont et al. (2006)</ref>, as correlated noise having covariance between data points on time-scales of the same order of the duration of our transit signal. The transit itself must be modeled and removed from a light curve in order to study the statistical properties of its noise content. Thus, first we analyzed the whole sample of light curves in Section 5.1, then we discuss how to select a high-quality subset for furter analysis in Section 5.2 ("ALL" vs. "SELECTED").</p><p>Hereafter we refer to each light curve with the corresponding alphanumeric ID code reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Overall, thirty-eight archival light curves were (re-)analyzed in the present study:   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Data points are plotted with the original cadence, except for G1, G2 and Z1, E7 that are binned respectively on 30 s and 300 s intervals for clarity. The red line is the best-fit model found by JKTEBOP. Transits have been offset in magnitude by integer multiples of 0.025.</p><p>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref>: six complete transits in the R band from two different telescopes (M1-3 at Rohzen-0.6m, M4-6 at Jena-0.9m). The first five observations (M1-5) were carried out on focused images, a practice resulting in a possible increase of the content of red noise. Other six light curves from various amateur observers (E1-7) were visually selected and downloaded from the ETD database 1 .</p><p>The first two follow-up light curves of WASP-3b were published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pollacco et al. (2008)</ref>: one transit observed at the IAC80 (alternating V and I filters) and one at the Keele-0.6m (R band), both in 2007. Unfortunately, the original light curves are no more retrievable and we did not include them in this study. A T 0 data point is determined by the first term of their published ephemeris:</p><p>T 0 (BJD UTC ) = 2454143.8503 +0.0004 −0.0003 + N · 1.846834 +0.000002 −0.000002 (1) One should be careful, however, as this T 0 (corresponding to <ref type="bibr">2007 Feb 12)</ref> is not an independent measurement of a single transit event. Instead, it comes from an ensemble analysis of SuperWASP, IAC80 and Keele-0.6m data. For this reason we adopted T 0 from Eq. (1) as our first data point in the determination of our new ephemeris, but not in our subsequent TTV analysis (Section 5.2). The epoch N of each reported observation in our set is defined according to the ephemeris in Eq. (1), i.e. as the number of transits elapsed since 2007 Feb 12.</p><p>All timestamps were converted to BJD(TDB), i e. based on Barycentric Dynamical Time following the prescription by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Eastman et al. (2010)</ref>. Each light curve was calibrated in time by identifying the time standard reported in the data headers and (when clarifications were necessary) contacting the authors. Generally speaking, even when the authors report a reliable synchronization source (GPS, NTP, etc.) for their data, it is impossible to carry out an external confirmation of that. The only exception, discussed in Section 6, is when two or more independent observations of the same event were performed. Though we did not find any reason to doubt about the accuracy of the absolute time calibration of the above-mentioned data, it is worth noting that most of these observations were not performed with the specific goal of a TTV analysis. Thus, the precision achievable on T 0 could be limited by sub-optimal choices about the instrumental setup. For instance, it is widely known that a "large" (in our case, τ 60 s) exposure time is one of those limiting factors (Kipping 2010). When required, light curves in flux units were converted to magnitudes and normalized to zero by fitting a low-order polynomial function to the off-transit data points. In a few cases, the tabulated photometric errors are underestimated up to about 50%, as confirmed by the reduced χ 2 r ≫ 1 (χ 2 being defined as the χ 2 divided by the number of degrees of freedom of the fit). This is not unusual in high-precision photometry, due to effects which are not accounted for by standard noise models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Howell 2006</ref>): poorly-modeled scintillation, high-frequency systematics mimicking random errors, stellar microvariability for both target and comparison stars, etc. We dealt with this by rescaling the errors by a factor of χ 2 r , following a common practice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Winn et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gibson et al. 2009</ref>). When the photometric errors were not published, the error was assumed to be constant and equal to the scatter σ of the off-transit polynomial-corrected curve. We define the scatter as the 68.27 th percentile of the residual distribution from the median, after a 5σ iterative clipping. This measurement is much more robust against outliers than the classical RMS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">IAC80 photometry</head><p>The six IAC80 light curves (N1-6) were reduced with the STARSKY photometric pipeline, presented in Nascimbeni et al. (2011a,b) but here upgraded with some improvements. The present version v1.1.002 adopts a new, fully empirical weighting scheme to carry out differential photometry. Reference stars were previously weighted by the amount of scatter measured on their light curves after being registered to the total reference magnitude m i (that is, the weighted mean of the instrumental magnitudes of all the comparison stars; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Broeg et al. 2005</ref>). That was an iterative process. Instead, the updated version first extracts the off-transit part of the series, then constructs a set of "intermediate" light curves of the reference stars by subtracting the magnitude of each of them to the off-transit magnitude of the target. Ideally, those curves should be flat and their RMS should be equal to the quadratic sum˜σ sum˜ sum˜σ 2 + σ 2 t , being σ t the theoretical photometric noise expected on the target (calculated as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nascimbeni et al. 2011a</ref>) and˜σand˜ and˜σ the intrinsic noise of the reference star, defined as at the end of Section 3. We therefore estimated the latter as˜σas˜ as˜σ = σ 2 − σ 2 t . The individual weights for a given comparison star are then assumed to be 1/ √ ˜ σ 2 . The output of this weighting algorithm is checked during each run against two other weighting schemes: 1) equal weights, i.e. unweighted, and 2) using weights derived from the expected theoretical noise computed for the reference stars. The DSYS and PSYS parameters (as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nascimbeni et al. 2011b</ref>) allow us to diagnose "bad" reference stars, and to set their weights to zero. For all the N1-N6 transits, the same set of eleven reference stars was employed, for consistency reasons. All of them show no sign of variability or higher-than-expected scatter.</p><p>A second improvement to STARSKY is a new algorithm developed to deal with light curves having red noise caused by veils, trails or thin clouds. This happen when the cloud possess a structure at angular scales on the same order of the FOV, and/or it is moving fast. Even differential photometry can be affected by these events, as the change of transparency can affect the target and the reference stars by a different amount. Of course, this systematic effect is correlated on with the rapidity of transparency changes. and this correlation can be exploited to discard the af-fected frames. A quantity that we called "numerical derivative of the absolute flux" (NDAF) is evaluated for each frame i of the series:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">NDAF = 1 F i F (i+1) − F (i−1) t (i+1) − t (i−1) (2)</formula><p>being F i the weighted instrumental flux of the reference stars (F i = 10 −0.4m i , m i defined as above), and t i the JD time at the mid-exposure. When NDAF deviates more than 4σ from its average along the series, the frame is discarded. The first and last frame are ignored by our algorithm. STARSKY outputs light curves extracted from a set of different photometric apertures. These curves are then detrended by a routine which searches for linear and polynomial correlations between the off-transit flux and several combinations of external parameters such as: the position of the star on the detector, the airmass, the FWHM of the stellar profiles, the mean sky level, the reference flux F i , and time. In the following, we describe the reason to search for a linear correlation between differential flux and airmass X. Let's consider the simple case of two stars (target "t" and reference "r") having out-of-atmosphere magnitudes m t and m r and color ξ t and ξ r , respectively. Given the extinction coefficient k and the extinction color term k ′ , the measured differential magnitude ∆m is the difference between the observed magnitudes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆m = (m t + kX + k ′ Xξ t ) − (m r + kX + k ′ Xξ r )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>By grouping the involved terms, and taking into account that X is the only quantity that shows short-term variations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆m = (m t − m r ) + X · k ′ (ξ t − ξ r )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that systematic effects due to differential extinction on the "true" (intrinsic) differential magnitude (m t − m r ) are linearly proportional to X. Eventually, we chose the light curve with the smallest amount of scatter σ and the lowest level of red noise estimated from the β parameter as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Winn et al. (2008)</ref>. The overall S/N of an observation can be quantified by rescaling the unbinned photometric σ of the light curve (having a net cadence τ) on a standard 120-s timescale, that is by calculating σ 120 = σ √ τ/120 s . With the only exception of N3, the final IAC80 light curves have σ 120 = 0.67-0.95 mmag <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>), only slightly larger than that achieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gibson et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tripathi et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Christiansen et al. (2011)</ref>, with space-based or much larger facilities. N6 shows a large amount of red noise of unknown origin, but probably related to colordependent systematics caused by variable atmospheric extinction. For the above-mentioned reasons, N3 and N6 were employed in the determination of our new ephemeris, but not in our TTV analysis (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">UDEM photometry</head><p>Standard dark current subtraction and twilight sky flat-field division process were performed for calibration on each image of the UDEM light curves (U1-5). Aperture differential photometry was carried out on the target star and 4-6 comparison stars of similar magnitude (|∆m| 1.5). The apertures used varied for each date due to defocus and weather conditions, but they were optimized to minimize the scatter of the resulting light curves. We found that the best results were obtained by averaging the ratios of WASP-3b to each comparison star. This produced smaller scatter than the method of ratioing the target star to the sum of all the comparison stars. We estimated the formal error for each photometric point as the standard deviation of the ratio to the individual comparison stars, divided by the square root of their number (error of the mean).</p><p>After normalizing the target star to the comparison stars and averaging, some long-term systematics as a function of time were found. This is perhaps caused by differential extinction between the transit and comparison stars, which generally have different and unknown spectral types. This variation was removed by fitting a linear airmass-dependent function to the outof-transit baseline of the light curve.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Fitting of the transit model</head><p>We chose to analyze all of the new and archival light curves employing the same software tools and algorithms. Our goal was to get homogeneous estimate of the physical/orbital parameters of WASP-3b. In particular we were interested for our TTV analysis in estimating the T 0 of each transit and its associated error in the most accurate way, avoiding biases due to different techniques. We avoided estimating T 0 through heuristic algorithms which assume a symmetric light curve, such that developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kwee &amp; van Woerden (1956)</ref>. The main reason is that they do not fit for any quantity other than T 0 . Even more important, they are not robust against outliers, they provide values of T 0 known to be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kipping 2010</ref>) and errors on T 0 known to be underestimated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pribulla et al. 2012</ref>). JKTEBOP 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Southworth et al. 2004</ref>) is a code which models the light curve of a binary system by assuming both components as biaxial ellipsoids and performing a numerical integration in concentric annuli over the surface of each component. JKTEBOP version 25 was run to fit a model light curve over our data and to derive the four main photometric parameters of the transit: the orbital inclination i, the ratio of the fractional radii k r = R p /R ⋆ , the sum of the fractional radii Σ r = R p /a + R ⋆ /a (R ⋆ is the stellar radius, R p the planetary radius, and a the orbital semi-major axis), and the mid-transit time T 0 . We chose to fit i, k r , Σ r independently for each data set, because in a perturbed system i and Σ r could change over a long timescale, while k r is an important diagnostic of light curve quality: when the photometric aperture is contaminated with flux from neighbors, the transit is diluted and k r becomes smaller. Moreover, an independent fit allows us to highlight correlations between i, k r , Σ r and to derive more reliable global results, as discussed at the end of this Section.</p><p>We set a quadratic law to model the limb darkening (LD) effect, naming u 1 the linear term and u 2 the quadratic term: <ref type="bibr">2</ref> and µ = cos γ, where I 0 is the surface brightness at the center of the star and γ is the angle between a line normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight of the observer. Southworth (2010), among others, has shown that fixing the values of both u 1 and u 2 should be avoided, as it could lead to an underestimate of the errors. On the other hand, most light curves have a S/N too low to let both u 1 and u 2 free, and the resulting best-fit results can be unphysical. We set the quadratic term u 2 always fixed to its theoretical value interpolated from the tables computed by Claret (2000) (BVR c I c bands), and Claret (2004) (Sloan ugriz), adopting the stellar parameters of WASP-3 derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pollacco et al. (2008)</ref>. For all light curves from nonstandard photometry, that is unfiltered CCD photometry (C1-8, L1-3, E1) or from wide-band R + V photometry (G1-2), estimating first-guess LD coefficients is not trivial. As for G1-2, we interpolated u 1 = 0.24 and u 2 = 0.38 from the tables by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Claret (2000)</ref> by taking the average of the values tabulated for the Johnson-V and Cousin-R bands, as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gibson et al. (2008)</ref>. We did the same for C1-8, L1-3, and E1, assuming that the quantum efficiency of a typical unfiltered CCD usually peaks somewhere in between those two bands.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I µ /I 0 = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ)</formula><p>Then one of the three following procedures was applied:</p><p>1. On the data sets with a high overall S /N and with two or more transits gathered with the same instrument and filter (G1-2; T1-3; T5-T6; M1-3; M4-5; C1-8; L1-3; N1-5) we first fitted a model with free i, k r , Σ r , T 0 (and u 1 fixed at its theoretical value) to the "best" individual light curves to get a preliminary estimate of their T 0 . For "best" we mean complete transits with high S/N: our choice is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, fourth column. Then we phased all those curves setting T 0 = 0. The free parameters i, k r , Σ r , u 1 were fitted again on the stacked light curve, in order to get a high-S/N "reference" model of the transit by integrating the information contained in the whole set. We fixed i, k r , Σ r , u 1 to their best-fit values, and fitted a model with only T 0 as free parameter on all the individual transits, including the low-S/N or partial ones. 2. On T4, a high-S/N but single light curve, we carried out one simultaneous fit with i, k r , Σ r , T 0 , and u 1 as free parameters. 3. In all other cases, the data quality did not allow us to constrain u 1 to values with physical meaning, thus u 1 was fixed to its theoretical value along with u 2 . Each transit was then fitted individually to get i, k r , Σ r , and T 0 .</p><p>The construction of the reference model from the IAC80 best data set (N1-2, N4-5 light curves) is summarized in (as an example) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref> It is worth noting that on average the individual light curves have σ 120 = 0.75 mmag, which decreases to σ 120 = 0.39 mmag on the stacked data points. The expected noise from Poissonian statistics is 0.75/ √ 4 = 0.375 mmag. By taking also into account that our observations do not cover always the same orbital phases, we are confident that the level of red noise in the IAC80 photometry is very low.</p><p>As the formal errors derived by least squares techniques are known to be underestimated in presence of correlated noise, we took advantage of two techniques implemented in JKTEBOP to estimate realistic errors: a Monte Carlo test (MC) and a bootstrapping method based on the cyclic permutations of the residuals (RP or "prayer bead" algorithm, Southworth 2008). The errors on all parameters obtained with the RP algorithm are on average significantly larger for most of the archival light curves, suggesting a non-negligible amount of red noise. We thus adopted conservatively the RP results in our subsequent analysis. Mean values and error bars can be estimated in two different ways: 1) as the arithmetic mean of the RP distribution associated to its standard error ±σ, and 2) as the median of the RP distribution along with its 15.87 th (σ − ) and 84.13 th percentile (σ + ). The first estimate assumes a Gaussian distribution, while the latter is purely empirical: they should match in absence of red noise.</p><p>We adopted as final results the RP median and uncertainties σ + , σ − for every fitted parameter except T 0 . The estimated T 0 will be analyzed in Section 5.2 with periodogram techniques that cannot deal with asymmetric error bars, thus for this parameter we adopted the RP means with Gaussian errors ±σ. The best-fit values of Σ r , k r , i and u 1 modeled on each individual data set are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>. We show also the theoretical value of the linear LD coefficient u 1,th as interpolated from Claret <ref type="bibr">(2000,</ref><ref type="bibr">2004</ref>). On all subsets, u 1 and u 1,th are in agreement within ∼ 1σ. This holds even for C1-8, L1-3, and G1, demonstrating that assumptions previously made on nonstandard "clear" or R + V photometry are reasonable.</p><p>In an unperturbed system, the transit parameters Σ r , k r , and i are purely geometrical and should not depend on wavelength or observing technique. Even if the system is suspected of being perturbed, one can check the long-term consistency of Σ r , k r , and i by comparing the best-fit values estimated for independent data sets <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2)</ref>. It is then possible to integrate all the extracted information to obtain final quantities of higher precision. We computed the weighted means of all subset estimate of Σ r , k r , and i listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, obtaining the result shown in the last but one line of the same table (weighted mean 1 ). As pointed out from previous works (e.g., Southworth 2008), these three quantities are correlated with each other, as it becomes evident by plotting their individual estimate on planes projected from the three-dimensional parameter space (Σ r , k r , i) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. Apart from this, the consistency among all measurements is assessed within the error bars, and we conclude that no variation of Σ r , k r , or i is detectable over the timescale covered by our data. The data point extracted from subset T1,T3 appears as the only probable outlier in two correlation plots out of three. We re-evaluated the weighted mean after removing that point (weighted mean 2 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). The resulting averages are quite similar to those evaluated without removing the outlier, but the uncertainty on k r is smaller. We adopt the second mean as final estimate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Σ r = 0.2187 ± 0.0098 (5) k r = 0.1058 ± 0.0012 (6) i = 84 • .12 ± 0.82<label>(7)</label></formula><p>More in general, results obtained from subsets T1-3 (Sloan i) and T5-6 (Sloan g) are slightly but significantly in disagreement with each other, a fact already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tripathi et al. (2010)</ref> and then attributed to the presence of residual red noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">TTV analysis</head><p>The best-fit T 0 values for each transit, after being uniformly converted to BJD(TDB), are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> along with their estimated ±1σ uncertainties (second column). For completeness we also tabulated the median value of T 0 estimated from the distribution of the RP residuals (third column of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) along with its 15.87 th (σ − ) and 84.13 th percentile (σ + ). To check which light curves within our sample are significantly affected by red noise, we consider two diagnostic parameters named β and Σ. The first one is defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Winn et al. (2008)</ref>: the light curve is averaged over M bins containing N unbinned points each, then β is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β = σ N ˜ σ N , ˜ σ N = σ √ N M M − 1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>That is, β is the ratio between the scatter σ N measured on a given temporal scale ∆t = Nτ, and the expected noise˜σnoise˜ noise˜σ N estimated by rescaling the unbinned scatter σ assuming Gaussian statistics. Ideally, we expect β ≃ 1 for independent and random errors (i.e. pure "white noise"), larger values meaning presence of red noise at time scales ∼ ∆t. The time scales around ∆t ≃ 25 min are the most important ones to our purposes, because they correspond to the duration of the ingress/egress part of the WASP-3b light curve. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Doyle &amp; Deeg (2004)</ref>, those are the parts having the largest information content about T 0 . We chose to compute β on a set of averaging times between ∆t = 20 and 30 The ID# of each transit (N1, N2, N4, N5) matches the corresponding entry in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Small gray dots represent the data points with the original cadence, while blue circles are binned on 120 s intervals. The red line is the best-fit from JKTEBOP (  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> minutes, then we took their arithmetic mean as a final estimate for β. The second diagnostic is Σ. We mentioned above that the distribution of the RP residuals around the best-fit value should be symmetric if the noise budget is dominated by white noise. Hence a "skewed" distribution could highlight a non-negligible amount of red noise. The opposite is not always true: short-term systematics (∆t τ) do not necessarily lead to skewed RP residual distributions. We parametrized this "skewness" with the ratio Σ between the largest and the smallest error bar σ of a given data point:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Σ = max{σ + , σ − }/ min{σ + , σ − }<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In principle, Σ ≃ 1 for well-behaved transits, and Σ ≫ 1 for transits dominated by long-term systematics. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists Σ for all the employed T 0 . We found 1.01 &lt; Σ &lt; 1.63 for the eleven TASTE transits (N1-6, U1-5). Instead, a few archival data points show unusually large values (e.g., Σ = 8.07 for T2). We investigated this issue by comparing the most significant T 0 published in the literature (T1-5; G1-2; C1-8; M1-6) with those derived by our reanalysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4</ref>, third panel from the top). We concluded that the vast majority of the published estimate agree within the error bars with ours. Notable exceptions are T1, T2, and G2: they all are partial transits, and T2, G2 have also large Σ. This is exactly what we expected. It indeed demonstrates that when a light curve lacks the off-transit part, its normalization becomes tricky, and even a very small difference in the adopted technique can lead to significantly different T 0 measurements. We emphasize this conclusion because many TTV studies employ partial transits (some of them even for the most part: among others, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pál et al. 2011 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fulton et al. 2011</ref>). While this is fine when estimating the orbital and physical parameters of the planet, we demonstrated that partial light curves should be included with extreme caution in a TTV analysis. We note that, on average, our error bars are larger than the published ones -sometimes by a factor of two-confirming our concern that most measurements carried out in the past have been published with underestimated errors due to neglected red noise. We considered two different samples of measurements for our TTV analysis. The first ("ALL") includes all the 49 T 0 listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, plus the T 0 from the ephemeris Eq. (1) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pollacco et al. (2008)</ref>. The second sample ("SELECTED") is a high-quality subset of 36 values, selected by excluding Eq. (1) (it does not correspond to an independent measurement of one single transit) and other 13 data points using the following rejection criteria:</p><p>1. partial light curve: data points lacking between the first and the last contact; 2. large scatter: σ 30 &gt; 1 mmag (σ 30 defined as the RMS of the residuals after averaging over 30-min bins); 3. red noise: Σ &gt; 2 or β &gt; 1.2; 4. presence of systematics during or close to the transit ingress/egress, as determined by visual inspection of the residuals.</p><p>The transits excluded from SELECTED are listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> along with the reason for the exclusion. The first step to plot an O − C diagram is to calculate a "reference" linear ephemeris to predict T 0 at any given epoch. We set the new zero epoch at N2, i.e. our most accurate light curve. The ALL sample was employed to fit a linear model by ordinary weighted least squares, obtaining T 0 (BJD TDB ) = 2 455 702.57993 ± 0.00017 + +N · 1.8468349 ± 0.0000004 (10) <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Geometrical parameters of WASP-3b estimated from individual data (sub-)sets <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2</ref>) plotted as black labeled circles in their twodimensional parameter space, to highlight the sizeable correlation between Σ r , k r , and i. The blue dashed line in each plot is a weighted linear fit of all points; the blue triangles and the associated error ellipse correspond to the weighted mean ±1σ computed on the marginal distribution of Σ r , k r , and i (last but one row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). The red continuous line and squares are computed in the same way as the blue ones, but after removing the outlier labeled "3" from the set (T1,T3; last row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>--</head><p>Notes. The columns give: the reference paper, the number of light curves fitted, the telescope, the ID code of the transits, the filter employed, the fitted sum of the fractional radii (Σ r = R p /a + R ⋆ /a), the fitted ratio of the fractional radii (k r = R p /R ⋆ ), the fitted inclination i, the fitted linear limb darkening (LD) coefficient u 1 , and the theoretical linear LD coefficient u 1,th interpolated from the Claret <ref type="bibr">(2000,</ref><ref type="bibr">2004</ref>) tables. The quoted error bars are derived from the JKTEBOP RP algorithm. The last two rows show the weighted means of all the previous individual estimate (1) and of all of the previous with the exception of the data set T1,T3 (see text for details).</p><p>The uncertainties have been evaluated from the covariance matrix of the fit, and were both rescaled by χ 2 r to take into account the real dispersion of the data points around our best-fit ephemeris. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref> are plotted the O − C diagrams for ALL (first panel from top) and SELECTED samples (second panel, with a smaller baseline). In both diagrams, the reduced χ 2 r = 3.7-4.5 suggests that the measurements are not in full agreement with the linear ephemeris in Eq. (10). Yet, there is no evident periodic pattern in our diagrams. We investigated the possibility that this statistically significant scatter is caused by a genuine TTV, either the TTV claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref> or a different one.</p><p>We exploited two algorithms to search for periodic signals: the Generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zechmeister &amp; Kürster 2009)</ref> and the "Fast χ 2 " algorithm (Fχ 2 ; Palmer 2009). Both these techniques are able to deal with irregularly sampled data with nonuniform weights, and minimize aliasing effects due to the window function. In addition to this, Fχ 2 can also search for an arbitrary number of harmonics.</p><p>We searched for periodic signals with GLS in the period range P = 4-1000 d, the lower limit being imposed by the Nyquist sampling criterion to avoid aliasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Horne &amp; Baliunas 1986</ref>). The resulting periodograms for both samples are plotted in the fourth panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref>. In neither case a prominent peak is visible. The ALL and SELECTED periodograms are quite similar, and their highest peaks stand at P(A) ≃ 6.41 d and P(S) ≃ 11.29 d, respectively. The formal false alarm probability (FAP) as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zechmeister &amp; Kürster (2009)</ref> is 0.023 (2.28σ) for the ALL power peak and 0.076 (1.77 σ) for the SELECTED peak, i. e. only marginally significant. However, the formal FAP is derived under the assumption of pure Gaussian noise, which is not our case. To take into account the intrinsic dispersion of our data, we investigated whether these peaks are statistically significant or not with a resampling algorithm. We generated 10 000 synthetic O − C diagrams with the same temporal coordinates of actual data points, by randomly scrambling the O − C values at each generation. A GLS periodogram was then evaluated on each of them with the same settings of that applied on real data. The power of the highest peak found in the real data for ALL and SELECTED samples lies respectively at the 12 th (−1.17σ) and 38 th percentile (−0.31σ) of the distribution of the maximumpower peaks in the synthetic, randomly-permutated diagrams. We conclude that neither peaks can be considered as statistically significant. In particular, the P(M) ≃ 127 days periodicity claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref> is not consistent with our data. Instead of a peak, the periodogram range where the P(M) peak is expected is characterized by an extremely low GLS power (fourth panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4, blue region)</ref>. On the other hand, tests on synthetic O − C diagrams having the same sampling and noise properties of our sample demonstrate that a P = P(M), ∆(O−C) = 0.0014 days signal corresponding to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al.

(2010)</ref> (0.038 P −1 ) is too low according to the Nyquist criterion. In the range 0.038 &lt; ν &lt; 0.5 P −1 many other maxima are as high as the 0.0145 P −1 peak (lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref>). Following a statistical test similar to the one above described, we discard that peak as not significant, being due to small-sample statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>In the present study, we analyzed eleven unpublished light curves of WASP-3b and re-analyzed other thirty-eight archival light curves, all of them with the same software tools and procedures. We derived improved orbital and physical parameters for this target <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2)</ref>, and computed a refined ephemeris (Eq. 10). All individual measurements of the central instant T 0 have been compared with the new ephemeris to search for changes in the orbital period P of the transiting planet. We concluded that available observations of WASP-3b, spanning more than four years, are not consistent with a linear ephemeris (χ 2 r ≃ 4). A possible explanation for this scatter is the presence of a perturbing body in the WASP-3 planetary system.</p><p>It is known that the impact of red noise on high-precision transit photometry is still not fully understood. Previous claims of TTVs have been disproved on this basis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Southworth et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fulton et al. 2011</ref>). Could the observed scatter in the O − C diagram of WASP-3b be explained in terms of underestimated observational errors or calibration issues? The absolute time calibration of each archival light curve cannot be independently checked. In principle one should trust the authors about that. However, we point out two main clues supporting the autoconsistence of the overall data, and hence the hypothesis of a genuine TTV:</p><p>-on three different epochs (N = 444, 486, 653 following the Pollacco et al. 2008 ephemeris) multiple observations of the same transit are available. As they were carried out by different authors at different facilities, they should represent independent measurements of the same quantity. All these data points (marked with a star in the first column of <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref> agree with each other within their 1σ error bars, suggesting that the uncertainties on T 0 are correctly evaluated by our pipeline; -some anomalous patterns in the O − C diagrams are confirmed by several different data sets. For instance, nearly all points gathered in 2009 within the range N = 440-510 lie ahead of the T 0 predicted by our baseline ephemeris (O − C &lt; 0). The only exception is U4, which essentially lies at O − C ∼ 0 within its error bar. The weighted mean of these twelve measurements from eight different authors is O − C = −0.00118 ± 0.00016 days. This implies a 7.2σ deviation from a constant orbital period. These patterns can also be detected in high-precision data subsets, such as our ones. Among the four best IAC80 transits, the first two (N1-2) are delayed by 4.3σ (i.e. O − C = 48 ± 11 s) compared with the prediction, while the second two (N4-5) are ahead of the ephemeris by 2.8σ (O − C = 35 ± 13 s).</p><p>The available data thus strongly suggest an intrinsic deviation of the actual transit times from the linear ephemeris expected from a Keplerian two-body transiting system. On the other hand, our analysis rules out the periodic TTV claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref>, and failed even at detecting any significant periodicity in the updated O − C diagram. Most TTV studies carried out in the past searched for a periodic signal, but  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.

The periodicity claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maciejewski et al. (2010)</ref> is marked with the M label. here we are dealing with a more complex and non-periodic phenomenon, at least at the time scales we sampled. What kind of dynamical system can induce such a perturbation? <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Veras et al. (2011)</ref> demonstrated that some orbital configurations, especially close to (but not exactly in) mean-motion resonances, can induce quasi-periodic or even chaotic TTVs. In other non-exotic configurations, the periodicity would manifest itself only at time scales &gt; 10 yr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Veras et al. 2011</ref>). Also when more than one perturber are present and their orbital periods are not commensurable, as in the case of our inner Solar System, the resulting TTV would be in general aperiodic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Holman &amp; Murray 2005)</ref>.</p><p>If WASP-3b belongs to one of the above-mentioned cases, careful dynamical modeling and additional follow-up is required to confirm the hypothesis and to constrain the mass and period of the possible perturber(s). Photometric monitoring is still ongoing within the TASTE project, and high-precision RV measurements are foreseen with HARPS-N. As stressed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Meschiari &amp; Laughlin (2010)</ref> and , photometric TTVs and RVs are highly complementary in breaking the degeneracies that are common in the inverse dynamical problem. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.
