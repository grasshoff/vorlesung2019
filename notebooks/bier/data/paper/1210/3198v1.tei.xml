				<p>Aims. We present modeled flux and linear polarisation signals of starlight that is reflected by spatially unresolved, horizontally inhomogeneous planets and discuss the effects of including horizontal inhomogeneities on the flux and polarisation signals of Earth-like exoplanets. Methods. Our code is based on an efficient adding-doubling algorithm, which fully includes multiple scattering by gases and aerosol/cloud particles. We divide a model planet into pixels that are small enough for the local properties of the atmosphere and surface (if present) to be horizontally homogeneous. Given a planetary phase angle, we sum up the reflected total and linearly polarised fluxes across the illuminated and visible part of the planetary disk, taking care to properly rotate the polarized flux vectors towards the same reference plane. Results. We compared flux and polarisation signals of simple horizontally inhomogeneous model planets against results of the weighted sum approximation, in which signals of horizontally homogeneous planets are combined. Apart from cases in which the planet has only a minor inhomogeneity, the signals differ significantly. In particular, the shape of the polarisation phase function appears to be sensitive to the horizontal inhomogeneities. The same holds true for Earth-like model planets with patchy clouds above an ocean and a sandy continent. Our simulations clearly show that horizontal inhomogeneities leave different traces in flux and polarisation signals. Combining flux with polarisation measurements would help retrieving the atmospheric and surface patterns on a planet.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mayor &amp; Queloz (1995)</ref> discovered the first planet orbiting another main sequence star almost two decades ago, the rapid improvement of detection methods and instruments has yielded hundreds of exoplanets, including several tens of so-called super-Earths (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Léger et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charbonneau et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miller-Ricci &amp; Fortney 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beaulieu et al. 2006</ref>), and many more will follow in the coming years. The next step in exoplanet research is the characterisation of the atmospheres and surfaces (if present) of detected exoplanets: what is their composition and structure? Currently, exoplanet atmospheres are being characterised using the transit method (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beaulieu et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miller-Ricci &amp; Fortney 2010)</ref>. This method is based on measurements of the wavelength dependendence of starlight that filters through the upper planetary atmosphere during the primary transit, or of the planetary flux just before or after the secondary eclipse. The transit method is mostly applied to gaseous planets that orbit close to their star. The chances to catch gaseous planets in wide orbits, such as Jupiter and Saturn in our Solar System, transiting their star are extremely small, because their orbital plane should be perfectly aligned with our line of sight and because their transits are very rare. Earthsized exoplanets in the habitable zone of a solar-type star are probably too small and transit too seldom to reach a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to do transit spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kaltenegger &amp; Traub 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A promising method to characterise atmospheres and surfaces (if present) of exoplanets that are small and/or in wide orbits, is direct detection, in which the starlight that a planet reflects and/or the thermal radiation that a planet emits is measured separately from the stellar light (except for some background starlight). Some instruments that are being designed for such direct detections are SPHERE (for the VLT) and EPICS (for the European Extremely Large Telescope, or E-ELT). An example for a space telescope for direct detection is the New Worlds Observer (NWO) <ref type="bibr">(Cash &amp; New Worlds Study Team 2010)</ref>, which is under study by NASA. Through direct detections, broadband images and/or spectra of various types of exoplanets will become available in the near future.</p><p>Knowing the Solar System planets, it is to be expected that exoplanets that will be observed are horizontally inhomogeneous, e.g. with clouds and hazes in patches, such as on Earth and Mars, or in banded structures, such as, for example, on Jupiter and Saturn. And there will undoubtedly be solid exoplanets with significant local variations in surface reflection properties and texture, such as the Earth with its continents and oceans. Although the lack of spatial resolution in near future exoplanet observations will merge all spatial variation into a single image pixel and/or spectrum, accounting for the existence of horizontal inhomogeneities will be important when trying to retrieve planet characteristics. For example, efforts to identify spectral sig-natures of life on other planets will face various challenges, such as clouds masking or mimicking the signatures of vegetation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinetti et al. 2006</ref>, and references therein). The cloud coverage will also influence the retrieval of mixing ratios of atmospheric gases, such as water vapour and oxygen, from reflected light spectra. In particular, the larger the fraction of clouds across an exoplanetery surface, the smaller the depth of gaseous absorption bands. Absorption band depths are, however, also influenced by the cloud top altitudes, with higher clouds yielding shallower absorption bands (for examples, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam 2008</ref>). The distribution of cloud top altitudes across a planet will thus also be a parameter to take into account.</p><p>Horizontal inhomogenities can have large effects on the flux of starlight that is reflected by a planet. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ford et al. (2001)</ref> have shown that an Earth analogue planet without clouds would show diurnal flux variations of up to 150% due to the variation of the albedo of different regions on the planet. In full agreement, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Oakley &amp; Cash (2009)</ref> have calculated that in absence of an atmosphere, the flux of an Earth-like exoplanet would show a clear diurnal variability as different continents would rotate in and out of the field of view of an observer. The presence of clouds in the Earth's atmosphere significantly complicates the characterisation of various surface types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ford et al. (2001)</ref> show, for example, that an Earth-like cloud pattern would suppress the diurnal flux variations to as little as 20%, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Oakley &amp; Cash (2009)</ref> indicates that characterizing the surface of the planet is possible only for cloud coverages significantly lower than the average coverage on Earth ( 25% versus ∼ 60%). To quantitatively estimate the effects of horizontal inhomogeneities due to clouds or surface features on observed spectra, and to be able to account for such variations in the retrieval of planet characteristics from future observations, numerical codes are essential tools.</p><p>In this paper, we present our numerical code to calculate spectra of starlight that is reflected by spatially unresolved, horizontally inhomogeneous exoplanets. The main difference with other codes for horizontally inhomogeneous planets (such as those used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ford et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Oakley &amp; Cash 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinetti et al. 2006</ref>) is that it can be used to calculate not only the flux of reflected starlight but also its state (degree and direction) of polarisation. Polarimetry promises to play an important role in exoplanet research both for exoplanet detection and characterisation. In particular, because the direct starlight is unpolarized, while the starlight that is reflected by a planet will usually be polarized (see e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zugger et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stam et al. , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Saar &amp; Seager 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Seager et al. 2000)</ref>, polarimetry can increase the planet-to-star contrast ratio by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Keller et al. 2010)</ref>, thus facilitating the detection of an exoplanet that might otherwise be lost in the glare of its parent star. Polarimetry will not only help to detect a planet, it will also confirm the status of the object, since background objects will usually be unpolarized.</p><p>The importance of polarimetry for studying planetary atmospheres and surfaces has been shown many times using observations of the Earth and other Solar System planets (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hansen &amp; Hovenier 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hansen &amp; Travis 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mishchenko 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tomasko et al. 2009</ref>), as well as by modeling of Solar System planets or giant exoplanets (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Stam , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stam et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Saar &amp; Seager 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Seager et al. 2000</ref>). In particular the sensitivity of polarisation to the microphysical properties of the scatterers in the planetary atmosphere, make it a crucial tool for braking degeneracies that flux only observations can have.</p><p>The radiative transfer calculations in our code are based on an efficient adding-doubling algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Haan et al. 1987</ref>) which fully includes multiple scattering by gases and aerosol/cloud particles, that was used before for flux and polarisation calculations for gaseous and terrestrial exoplanets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Stam (2003)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stam et al. (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Karalidi et al. (2011)</ref>. These authors, however, assumed each exoplanet to be horizontally homogeneous, such that it could be treated as a single starlight scattering 'particle', which allowed for a very fast integration of the reflected flux and polarisation signals across the planet's disk for the whole planetary phase angle range (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. 2006</ref>, for a description of this disk-integration algorithm). With this horizontally homogeneous code, the signals of horizontally inhomogeneous planets can be simulated using the socalled weighted sum approximation: signals of homogeneous planets are multiplied by a weighting factor and summed to yield the final signal. We, on the other hand, divide a horizontally inhomogeneous model planet into pixels that are small enough for the local properties of the atmosphere and surface (if present) to be horizontally homogeneous. For each type of pixel, we perform adding-doubling radiative transfer calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Haan et al. 1987)</ref> and, given the planetary phase angle, we sum up the reflected total and polarised fluxes across the illuminated and visible part of the planetary disk. Our code for horizontally inhomogeneous planets allows investiging the applicability of the weighted sum approximation, and the effects of horizontal inhomogeneities on the flux and in particular the polarisation signals of exoplanets. This paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe our numerical method to calculate the flux and polarisation of starlight that is reflected by a horizontally inhomogeneous planet, and in Sec. 3, we present simulations of flux and polarisation for different types of horizontal inhomogeneities. In Sec. 4, we present flux and polarisation signals of horizontally inhomogeneous Earth-like planets and compare them to signals for horizontally homogeneous planets. Finally, in Sec. 5, we discuss and summarize our results. Appendix A contains the results of testing our code for horizontally inhomogeneous planets against an existing code for horizontally homogeneous planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Calculating reflected starlight</head><p>Light can fully be described by a flux vector πF , as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">πF = π    F Q U V    ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with πF the total, πQ and πU the linearly and πV the circularly polarised fluxes (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hansen &amp; Travis 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hovenier et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam 2008)</ref>. Parameters πF , πQ, πU and πV depend on the wavelength λ, and have dimensions W m −2 m −1 . Parameters πQ and πU are defined with respect to a reference plane, for which we choose the planetary scattering plane, i.e. the plane through the centers of the planet, star and observer. Note that this plane is usually not the same as the planetary orbital plane; only for orbits that are seen edge-on, the two planes coincide at all phase angles. In the following, we will ignore πV , because it is usually very small <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hansen &amp; Travis 1974)</ref>, and because the errors in calculated values of πF , πQ, and πU due to ignoring πV are negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Stam &amp; Hovenier 2005)</ref>. The degree of polarisation P of vector πF is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = Q 2 + U 2 F ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which is independent of the choice of reference plane. For planets that are mirror-symmetric with respect to the planetary scattering plane (i.e. horizontally homogeneous planets), Stokes parameter U equals zero. In that case, we can use an alternative definition of the degree of polarisation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P s = − Q F ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with the sign indicating the direction of the polarisation, i.e. if P s &gt; 0 (P s &lt; 0) the light is polarized perpendicular (parallel) to the planetary scattering plane. The absolute value of P s is just equal to P . We calculate the flux vector of starlight that has been reflected by a spherical planet with radius r at a distance d from the observer using (d ≫ r) as (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. 2006</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">πF (α) = 1 4 r 2 d 2 S(α)πF 0 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with α the planetary phase angle, i.e. the angle between the star and the observer as seen from the planet's center. Furthermore, πF 0 is the flux vector of the incident starlight and S the 4 × 4 planetary scattering matrix. In the following, we normalise Eq. 4 assuming r = 1 and d = 1. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. (2006)</ref>, the planetary scattering matrix S can be calculated by integrating local reflection matrices R across the illuminated and visible part of the planetary disk, as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S(α) = 4 π µ µ 0 L(β 2 ) R(µ, µ 0 , ∆φ)L(β 1 ) dO,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where dO is a surface element on the planet, and R is the local reflection matrix, which describes how starlight that is incident on a given location of the planet is reflected towards the observer. The reference planes for R are the local meridian planes, which contain the direction of propagation of the incident and reflected light, respectively, and the local vertical direction. The matrices L are so-called rotation matrices (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hovenier et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovenier &amp; van der Mee 1983</ref>) that are used to rotate from the planetary scattering plane to the local meridian planes and back:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L(β) =    1 0 0 0 0 cos 2β sin 2β 0 0 − sin 2β cos 2β 0 0 0 0 1    ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Angle β is measured in the anti-clockwise direction from the old to the new reference plane when looking in the direction of propagation of the light.</p><p>In Eq. 5, we assume that the planetary atmosphere and surface (if present) are locally plane-parallel and rotationally symmetric with respect to the local vertical direction. Therefore, each matrix R depends on µ 0 = cos θ 0 , with θ 0 the angle between the local zenith and the direction towards the star, on µ = cos θ, with θ the angle between the local zenith and the direction towards the observer, and on ∆φ = φ− φ 0 , the angle between the azimuthal angles of the incident and the reflected light, respectively. Azimuthal angles are measured rotating clockwise when looking up from an arbitrary, local vertical plane towards the local vertical plane containing the direction of propagation of the light.</p><p>For horizontally homogeneous planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. (2006)</ref> present an efficient method for evaluating Eq. 5 that uses an adding-doubling radiative transfer algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Haan et al. 1987)</ref> to calculate the coefficients of the expansion of the local reflection matrix (which is the same across the planet) into a Fourier series. These coefficients are then used to compute coefficients of the expansion of matrix S into generalized spherical functions. With these expansion coefficients, S can be calculated rapidly for any phase angle α. Since with this method, a planet is basically treated as a single light-scattering particle, it cannot be used for horizontally inhomogeneous planets.</p><p>To calculate S for horizontally inhomogeneous planets, we divide a planet into pixels small enough for the local atmosphere and surface (if present) to be considered both plane-parallel and horizontally homogeneous. For each type of pixel (a combination of surface and atmosphere properties), we first calculate the coefficients of the expansion of the local reflection matrix R into a Fourier series, using the adding-doubling algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Haan et al. 1987)</ref>. Then, for each given planetary phase angle and each pixel, we use the respective Fourier coefficients to calculate the local reflection matrices (see de <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haan et al. 1987</ref>). The local matrices are summed up according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S(α) = 4 π N i=1 µ i µ 0i L(β 2i )R i (µ i , µ 0i , ∆φ i )L(β 1i )dO i , (7)</formula><p>with N the total number of pixels on the illuminated and visible part of the planetary disk.</p><p>In the following, we assume unpolarised incident starlight, since integrated over the stellar disk, light of solartype stars can be assumed to be unpolarised ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kemp et al. 1987)</ref>. In this case, πF 0 = πF 0 1, with 1 the unit column vector and πF 0 the total incident stellar flux (measured perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light), for which we assume a normalized value of 1 W m −2 m −1 . Thanks to the assumption of unpolarized incident starlight, rotation matrix L(β 1i ) can be ignored in Eq. 7.</p><p>Because of the normalizations and the assumption of unpolarized incident light, the total flux that is reflected by a planet (cf. Eq. 4) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">πF n (λ, α) = 1 4 a 11 (λ, α),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with a 11 the (1,1)-element of matrix S (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Karalidi et al. 2011</ref>). The subscript n indicates the normalization. When α = 0 • , the hence normalized total flux equals the planet's geometric albedo A G . Our normalized total and polarized fluxes πF n , πQ n and πU n can straightforwardly be scaled to any given planetary system using Eq. 4 and inserting the appropriate values for r, d and πF 0 . The degree of polarization (P or P s ) is independent of r, d and πF 0 , and would thus not require any scaling.</p><p>We have tested our disk-integration code by comparing its results with those of the code for horizontally homogeneous planets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. (2006)</ref> (see Appendix A). We have not compared it against other codes for modelling signals of horizontally inhomogeneous planets (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ford et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Oakley &amp; Cash 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tinetti et al. 2006</ref>), because these codes ignore polarisation, which is the most interesting feature of our code. A comparison between calculated total fluxes would require us to disable the polarisation calculations in our adding-doubling code, since ignoring polarisation introduces errors of up to several percent in total flux calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Stam &amp; Hovenier 2005)</ref>. From the comparison with the code for horizontally homogeneous planets applied to horizontally inhomogeneous planets using the weighted sum approximation, in which weighted sums of flux vectors reflected by horizontally homogeneous planets are used to approximate the flux vectors of horizontally inhomogeneous planets (see Appendix A), we conclude that our code is accurate enough for application to horizontally inhomogeneous planets, provided enough pixels are used across the disk, not only for resolving the spatial variations but also the variations in illumination and viewing angles across pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Sensitivity to horizontal inhomogeneities</head><p>In this section, we present flux and polarisation (degree and angle) signals of planets with different types of horizontal inhomogeneities on their surfaces as calculated using our code to show the signatures of inhomogeneities and the differences with signatures of horizontally homogeneous planets with similar surface albedos. Unless stated otherwise, each planet has a gaseous, Rayleigh scattering atmosphere with a total optical thickness of ∼ 0.1 (no absorption), and a flat surface. For the surface albedo, we choose the extreme values of 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white), since they give the largest contrast in flux and polarisation.</p><p>Establishing which types of inhomogeneities could still be handled with e.g. a weighted sum approximation and which would need a full scale horizontally inhomogeneous approach with e.g. our code (from hereon: the HI-code), is interesting for saving computing time when possible. The disadvantage of our HI-code is namely the large amount of computing time it requires as compared to the horizontally homogeneous code of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. (2006)</ref> (from hereon: the HH-code). For example, the HI-code takes about 10 5 times more time than the HH-code for calculating the flux vectors of a horizontally homogeneous planet covered by a cloud layer with optical thickness 2, for phase angles α from 0 • to 180 • in steps of 2 • , with the planet having been divided into pixels of 2 • × 2 • , and for a single wavelength.</p><p>The difference in computation times would be irrelevant if the computing time of the HI-code were negligible. Unfortunately this is not the case. This time depends strongly on the properties of the model atmosphere, especially on the absorption and scattering optical thickness of the gases and particles in the atmosphere and on the angular variation of the single scattering properties of the scattering particles. In particular adding polarization to the flux calculations increases the time by at least an order of magnitude, and of course, the timing increases almost linearly with the number of wavelengths at which calculations are required (since these calculations are independent of each other, they could easily be done in parallel). For the cloudy model planet calculations described in the previous paragraph, the HH-code takes about a minute on an average workstation.</p><p>The difference in computing time is not spent in the radiative transfer calculations themselves, since the two codes use the same adding-doubling radiative transfer algorithm (based on de <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haan et al. 1987</ref>) and were run with the same numerical accuracy. Also, because both planets were horizontally homogeneous, the radiative transfer calculation had to be performed only once for each code. Indeed, in the HI-code, the additional computing time is mostly spent in the integration of the flux vectors across the planetary disk. In particular, for α = 0 • , the number of 2 • × 2 • pixels across the disk is more than 8000. For each pixel, the appropriate Fourier coefficients have to be determined from the list of calculated coefficients, they have to be summed to calculate the local reflection matrix, and with that the locally reflected flux vectors. Then, the locally reflected flux vectors have to be rotated to the planetary scattering plane in order to be summed up to calculate the reflected flux vector of the planet. Even though the computing time per pixel can be relatively small, the mere number of pixels (which of course depends on the planetary phase angle) can result in long computing times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Planets with spots</head><p>The first type of horizontally inhomogeneous planets have black surfaces with homogeneously distributed white spots. We start with spots consisting of single white pixels that cover 4% of the planet's surface, and let the area of each spot grow until the spots cover 68% of the surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows πF n and P s (see Eq. 3) as calculated using the HIcode as functions of the planetary phase angle α for these planets. As can be seen, increasing the percentage of white pixels from 4% to 68%, increases πF n smoothly from 0.09 to 0.58 at α = 0 • , while P s decreases from 0.6 to 0.08 at α = 90 • (this phase angle does not coincide with the maximum of P s ). With increasing surface brightness, the peak value of P s shifts from α = 98 • (4% white) to α = 116 • (68% white). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the difference between the results from the HI-code and those from the HH-code (the latter combined with with the weighted sum approximation, as described in Appendix A). In <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, it is clear that when the planet is almost horizontally homogeneous (only 4% covered by white pixels), the maximum relative difference in flux, ∆πF n is very small (∼ 0.64% for α = 0 • ), with the HI-code giving the slightly higher values. With increasing coverage, ∆πF n increases, showing a maximum value of 10% for 57% coverage in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, to decrease again when the planet is almost homogeneously white.</p><p>Because the degree of polarisation is itself a relative measure, we show the differences in P s between the HI-code and the HH-code as absolute differences.

The polarisation phase function is quite symmetric for small caps, and P decreases from almost 0.55 for 23% coverage to 0.08 for 77% coverage at α = 90 • (note that the maxima of the polarisation phase functions occur at somewhat smaller and larger phase angles, respectively).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>, we show ∆πF n and ∆P for the planets in age, increases up to -0.21 for 43% coverage, and decreases again to -0.07 for 77% coverage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Surface inhomogeneities</head><p>First, we present the signals of a planet with a sandy continent surrounded by ocean. The continent extends between longitudes of ±22 • and latitudes of ±50 • (measured with respect to the subobserver point). The sand surface reflects Lambertian (unpolarized and isotropically) with an albedo of 0.25. This albedo is taken from the ASTER spectral library and should be representative for a sand surface on Earth at λ = 0.55 µm. The ocean is black. The planetary atmosphere is cloud-free, with a total gas optical thickness of 0.1 (no absorption), which corresponds to a wavelength of 0.55 µm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows πF n and P s as functions of α for the model planet as calculated with our HI-code and the HHcode (combined with the weighted averages method), and, to compare, for model planets that are completely covered by sand or ocean. Both in πF n and in P s , there are significant differences between the signals from the HI-code and the HH-code, depending on the phase angle. At α = 0 • , the difference ∆πF s is ∼ 30%. With increasing phase angle, the fraction of the continent on the planet's nightside increases, and πF n calculated with the HI-code decreases faster than that calculated with the HH-code. The polarisation phase function calculated using the HI-code is more asymmetric than that calculated using the HH-code.

At this phase angle, flux and polarisation observations would thus not help to establish the existence of the continent. However, interpreting flux observations at smaller (larger) phase angles using the HHcode would result in an overestimation (underestimation) of the coverage with sand, while interpreting only polarisation observations at smaller (larger) phase angles using the HHcode would result in an underestimation (overestimation) of the coverage with sand. The interpretation of the combined flux and polarisation observations using the HH-code would fail and thus reveal that assuming a homogeneous mixture of sand and ocean pixels is not realistic. </p></div>

In this case, using the HH-code to interpret the polarisation reflected by the patchy cloudy planet near α = 90 • , would yield a cloud coverage of ∼25%.

The increase will usually depend on the location of the clouds and the continent. In this case, the continent is located in the middle of the planetary disk, and thus has a large influence. Since only a small fraction (∼ 8%) of the pixels on the disk contain sand, the flux calculated with the HH-code is only marginally higher than that calculated with the HH-code and without a continent (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and conclusions</head><p>We have presented a numerical code that can be used to calculate disk integrated total and polarised fluxes of starlight that is reflected by horizontally inhomogeneous exoplanets, e.g. planets that are covered by oceans and continents, and/or overlaid by a patchy cloud deck.</p><p>For most types of model planets, our code for horizontally inhomogeneous planets (the HI-code) is computationally much more expensive than the code for horizontally homogeneous planets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. (2006)</ref> combined with the so-called weighted sum approximation to simulate fluxes of horizontally inhomogeneous planets (the HH-code). In the latter method, total and polarized flux signals of different horizontally homogeneous planets are summed using weighting factors depending on which fraction of the illuminated and visible part of the horizontally inhomogeneous planet is represented by each type of planet. Only for planets with a large variation of horizontal inhomogeneities, such as a large number of different surface and cloud coverages, the computing time for the HH-code approaches that for the HI-code.</p><p>The main advantage of using the HI-code instead of the HH-code is obviously the ability to simulate signals of horizontally inhomogeneous planets. Other advantages of the HI-code are that since every pixel on the planet is treated separately, it allows taking into account effects of e.g. the non-sphericity of a planet, shadowing by planetary rings, and a spatial extension of the illuminating source.</p><p>Since for most model planets, our HI-code consumes much more computing time than the HH-code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stam et al. 2006</ref>), it is interesting to investigate the influences of horizontal inhomogeneities on the total and polarized fluxes of starlight that is reflected by a planet. For three types of horizontally inhomogeneous planets covered by black and white surface pixels and overlaid by a gaseous atmosphere, we have calculated the fluxes and the degree of polarisation as functions of the planetary phase angle α and compared them with results from the HH-code assuming the same percentage of black and white surface pixels and the same model atmosphere. Horizontal inhomogeneities can leave significant traces in both the reflected total flux πF n and the degree of linear polarisation. However, while horizontal inhomogeneities appear to mostly influence the total amount of reflected flux and not so much the shape of the planet's flux phase functions, they can strongly change the planet's polarisation phase functions in shape and strength. Indeed, fitting a planet's polarisation phase function using the HH-code would yield very different fractions of disk coverage (up to several tens of percent).</p><p>We also used the HI-code to calculate flux and polarisation signals of Earth-like planets with surface and/or patchy clouds. These calculations confirmed that the shape of a planet's flux phase function is fairly independent of the horizontal inhomogeneities. Obviously, the absolute values of the flux phase function does depend on the inhomogeneities, but it will also depend on the radius of the planet (in this paper we assumed a planetary radius equal to one), which thus would have to been known accurately to fit the flux phase function. The polarisation phase function appears to be rather sensitive to the inhomogeneities, both its absolute values and the shape of the curve (e.g. location maximum value). Because the degree of polarisation is a ratio, it is independent of the radius of a planet. The flux and polarisation signals of planets are wavelength dependent (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stam 2008</ref>), therefore the observability of horizontal inhomogeneities will also depend on the wavelength. In particular, at short wavelengths, the gas optical thickness is larger than at longer wavelengths, and will thus hamper the observations of the surface. Future studies could focus on which spectral bands should be combined to optimize retrieval schemes.</p><p>In the presence of liquid water clouds, the strength of the primary rainbow in the flux phase functions of Earth-like planets increases with increasing cloud coverage. Whether or not it would be detectable depends strongly on the sensitivity and stability of the observing instrument. In the polarisation phase function, the strength of the rainbow is almost independent of the cloud coverage as long as the planet's surface is very dark (i.e. does not add too much unpolarized flux to the total signal). A bright surface, such as a sandy continent, decreases the strength of the rainbow feature.</p><p>Properly accounting for horizontal inhomogeneities appears to significantly influence reflected fluxes and polarisation signals, and should eventually be applied to interpret observations of horizontally inhomogeneous exoplanets or e.g. observations of Earth-shine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sterzik et al. 2012</ref>). The HH-code (horizontally homogeneous planets combined with the weighted sum approximation), however, is still a strong tool for simulating signals to be used for the design and optimization of exoplanet observations, because its simulations cover the range of total and polarized fluxes that we can expect to observe. Because flux and polarisation phase functions have different sensitivities to the inhomogeneities, a combination of flux and polarisation observations would help to retrieve the actual planetary parameters.</p><p>Our results, and especially the differences between the fluxes and degrees of polarization of the reflected starlight, indicate which accuracies should be reached with flux and/or polarization observations in order to detect horizontal inhomogeneities on a planet. As such they can drive the design of instruments for exoplanet characterization. Assuming a super-Earth exoplanet (with a radius of 1.5 r ⊕ ) orbiting a Sun-like star at 1 pc from the observer at a 40-meter telescope (such as the E-ELT), a back-of-theenvelope calculation shows that a few nights of integration time (a total of 20 hours) could yield an accuracy of 10 −3 . The phase angle of a planet in an Earth-like orbit would change by ∼3 • during that time. For this calculation we ignored the influence of stellar background light on the observation, and we didn't include any actual instrument parameters, such as spectral bandwidths. Until results such as ours are combined with a realistic instrument and telescope simulator, the integration time estimate should thus be considered as a rough value. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Horizontally homogeneous planets</head><p>For the first comparison between our HI-code and the HHcode, we used both codes to calculate the light reflected by a model planet with a black surface and a gaseous, Rayleigh scattering atmosphere with a total optical thickness of about 0.1. For the HI-code, the planet was divided into pixels of 2 • × 2 • (latitude × longitude). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the excellent agreement between the reflected fluxes πF n and πQ n as functions of phase angle α calculated using the two codes (because the planet is mirror-symmetric with respect to the reference plane, πU n = 0). The absolute difference between the fluxes calculated by the two codes is smaller than 10 −5 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows the degree of polarisation P s (= −Q/F ) (see Eq. 3) calculated using both codes, and the absolute difference ∆P s between the curves. ∆P s is largest around small (15 • ) and large (160 • ) phase angles, which is due to the size of the pixels. Since in the HI-code, we use one set of angles θ 0 , θ, ∆φ, and β 2 for each pixel, the larger a pixel, the less this set of angles represents the range of angles across the pixel. The error is largest for pixels along the planetary limb and terminator, and thus for the large and small phase angles (at the small angles, the degree of polarisation in the centre of the disk is close to zero, making the contribution of the limb pixels thus significant). At α = 0 • and 180 • , P s of the planet is zero and thus ∆P s , too.</p><p>For a model planet with a gaseous atmosphere, the differences between the results of the two codes appear to be fairly independent of the albedo of a (Lambertian reflecting) surface: with a white surface, the absolute differences in πF n and πQ n , and ∆P s are similar to those with a black sur- face. For a model planet with a horizontally homogeneous cloud layer of optical thickness 1, composed of the model A cloud particles of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Karalidi et al. (2011)</ref>, and a surface albedo of 0.1, the absolute difference in the fluxes increased slightly to a maximum value of 5×10 −5 and the maximum ∆P s increased to ∼ 0.0062. These differences didn't change significantly when other (e.g. larger) cloud particles were used.</p><p>The comparison with the HH-code shows that the integration across the disk by our HI-code is accurate enough for application to horizontally homogeneous planets, provided small enough pixels are used across the disk.</p></div>

Horizontally inhomogeneous planets</head><p>For a second test of our HI-code, we used model planets with surfaces covered by two types of 2 • × 2 • pixels that alternate in longitude and latitude (they thus look like chess boards). The equator of each planet coincides with the planetary scattering plane. The planetary atmospheres are gaseous, Rayleigh scattering and have an optical thickness of 0.1. While our HI-code can handle these types of planets, the HH-code cannot.
