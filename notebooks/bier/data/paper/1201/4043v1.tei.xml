				<p>High-accuracy multicolor light curves of the binary system HD 189733, which contains an exoplanet, are analyzed. We have determined the radii of the star and the planet in the binary system, as well as the orbital inclination. The limb-darkening coefficients of the stellar disk were obtained in 10 filters in the wavelength interval λλ = 5500 − 10500Å10500Å. The uncertainties of the fitted parameters were estimated using the differential-correction and confidence-area methods. The wavelength dependence of the limb-darkening coefficients is compared to the corresponding theoretical function for a model thin stellar atmosphere. We confirm the wavelength dependence of the exoplanet&apos;s radius found by Pont et al. [6] (at the 1σ level). The exoplanet radius increases with decreasing wavelength, which seems to argue for the presence of an atmosphere around the planet.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The results of fitting high-accuracy multicolor light curves for the star HD 209458, which is eclipsed by an exoplanet, were provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. There was a significant deviation between the observed and theoretical limb-darkening coefficients, even though the most conservative values were used to estimate the "external" uncertainties in the model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. This confirms the discrepancy between observations and the theory of thin stellar atmospheres found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It is important to analyze limb darkening across other stellar disks that are eclipsed by their exoplanets to further study this effect. Pont et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> obtained high-accuracy multicolor light curves of HD 189733, which is eclipsed by an exoplanet, and examined the spotted disk of the star. Pont et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> indicated that the exoplanet could have an atmosphere. The purpose of the current paper is to study the limb darkening of the star in the eclipsing system HD 189733 as a function of wavelength in detail using the data obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We analyze in detail the effect of uncertainties in the parameters determined using different methods to fit the eclipsing light curves, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FITTING METHOD</head><p>The method used to fit transit light curves observed in eclipsing binary systems containing exoplanets is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and we will only consider the main concepts of the method here. We used a model consisting of two spherical stars in circular orbits, without any reflection effect or ellipsoidal effect. There are no spots on the surfaces of the stars. If the masses of a star and planet are m s = 0.825M ⊙ and m p = 1.15M Jup <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the mean relative radius of the Roche lobe for the planet calculated using the formula of Eggleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is R R /a = 0.0531, where a is the radius of the relative orbit of the system.</p><p>Since the relative radius of the planet is r p = R p /a ≃ 0.0175 (see below), the planet fills its Roche lobe only to the degree µ p ≃ 0.33, which is considerably less than 0.5. Therefore, a spherical approximation is quite satisfactory for the planet (neglecting flattening of the planet due to its axial rotation). The same can be said for the optical star.</p><p>The amplitude of brightness changes due to the reflection effect in the optical should be less than 10 −5 magnitude at eclipse phases, which is negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A weak wavelength dependance of the radius of the exoplanet in HD 189733 was suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which could be indicative that the planet has an atmosphere. The refraction of the stellar light in the exoplanets atmosphere can distort the light curve when the star is eclipsed by the exoplanet. The effects of light refraction in eclipsing binary systems were calculated by Kudzei <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These effects should result in small humps (brightenings) in the light curve before and after the eclipse, as well as in the middle of the eclipse. Since there are no such humps in the light curves of HD 189733, refraction effects in these light curves can be assumed to be negligible.</p><p>When the star is eclipsed by its exoplanet, the light curve could be affected by gravitational microlensing. Such effects were studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Microlensing was shown to be significant only for the stars with exoplanets whose orbital sizes exceed 10 AU (with corresponding orbital periods of P &gt; 10 yr). Therefore, our model with two spherical components is quite applicable to the light curves of HD 189733.</p><p>We calculated the light curve using linear and quadratic limb-darkening laws to describe the brightness distribution across the stellar disk:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(ρ) = I 0 1 − x + x 1 − ρ 2 r 2 s ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">I(ρ) = I 0   1 − x 1 − 1 − ρ 2 r 2 s − y 1 − 1 − ρ 2 r 2 s 2   .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, ρ is the polar distance from the center of the stellar disk, I 0 the brightness at the center of the disk, r s the radius of the stellar disk in radii of the relative orbit, and x the limb-darkening coefficient. The brightness at the center of the planetary disk, and accordingly the brightness at any point of this disk, are assumed to be zero. The planet eclipses the star when the orbital phase is θ = π. The orbit is taken to be circular, and the radius of the relative orbit a to be unity. The model does not include third light. The radius of the planet in relative orbital radii is denoted r p . The desired parameters of our model are the radius of the star r s , the radius of the planet r p , the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky i, and the limb-darkening coefficient x; if the limb darkening is described by the quadratic function, the parameters also include the coefficient y.</p><p>The total light of the system is taken to be unity, and the observed brightness values to be normally distrubuted. The rms deviations of the observed brightnesses σ are assumed to be known.</p><p>To search for the optimal (central) values of the model parameters and generate their confidence intervals, we used a residual equal to the sum of the squared differences between the observed and theoretical brightnesses (as functions of the desired parameters), divided by the dispersions of the observed brightnesses (the squares of the rms deviations σ). If amodel fits the observational data, this residual is distributed according to a χ 2 M law for the exact parameter values, where M is the number of observational points. This residual (which is a convex function of the parameters) achieves its minimum for certain parameters values r c s , r c p , i c , x c , y c , referred to as the central (or optimal) parameters. When the model fits the observational data, the distribution of the central parameter values can be considered to be normal in some vicinity of their mean values, if we neglect nonlinearity of the parameter-dependent brightness in this neighbourhood. This is justified when σ is small and the number of observational points M is large.</p><p>The central parameter values are random values distributed normally in this approximation. They can be used as a statistic in the differential-correction method or Monte-Carlo method (which, in a sense, is equivalent to the differential-correctionmethod <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>). The error intervals for the parameters are chosen to be centered on the optimal values of the corresponding parameters; their half-widths are equal to the mean square estimates of the rms deviations of the current parameters σ est from their central values, multiplied by a coefficient corresponding to the chosen confidence level γ (1σ, 2σ, 3σ, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this case, the model is considered to be perfectly valid; if we have more than one parameter, each individual parameter is characterized by its individual confidence interval, which encompasses the true value of that parameter with a given probability γ (independent of whether or not the true values of the other fitted parameters fall into their confidence intervals). We also assume that we can neglect non-linearity of the function describing the dependence of the brightness on the parameters within approximately one rms deviation around the central parameters. Numerical experiments carried out for eclipsing systems show that the probability for all the true parameter values to simultaneously fall into their confidence intervals is a factor of 1.2 ÷ 1.5 lower than the given confidence level γ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Since in the differential-correction method (or Monte-Carlo method) the obtained central parameter values are distributed statistically according to a normal law with the strict a priori assumption that the model is perfectly valid, and information on the dispersion of the observed brightnesses is not used here (the confidence intervals are constructed using the mean square estimates of the central parameters σ 2 est rather than the dispersions of their central values), the uncertainties of the parameters in the differentialcorrection method (or Monte-Carlo method) are internal uncertainties. As a rule, these are substantially underestimated. Popper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> indicated that this underestimation can reach a factor of three to five for eclipsing systems.</p><p>In view of the above, we also used the confidencearea method to estimate the parameter uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The advantage of this method is that the obtained confidence intervals for the parameters ensure that the exact values of all the parameters simultaneous fall into the corresponding confidence area (in a multidimensional parametric space) with the given probability γ. The probability that the exact value of an individual parameter falls into the corresponding confidence interval is greater than the given probability γ. In addition, the probability for the exact solution (a combination of all fitted parameters) to be covered simultaneously by all the confidence intervals is also greater than γ, since the volume of the parallelepiped in which the confidence area D is inscribed exceeds the volume of this area. Therefore, the confidence-area method yields more conservative external estimates of the parameter uncertainties, which are a factor of a few greater than the error estimates obtained using the differentialcorrection method orMonte-Carlo method.</p><p>We will use either a χ 2 P or a χ 2 M distribution to find the confidence area D <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. We will use the difference between the residual distributed according to the χ 2 M law (M is the number of observational points) and the minimal value achieved with the central parameter values as the χ 2 P statistic, where P is the number of fitted parameters. If we neglect the non-linearity in the dependence of the brightness on the parameters (which is justified when there are many observational points M), these differences can be considered to be distributed according to the χ 2 P law for the exact parameter values, where P = 4 with linear limb darkening and P = 5 with quadratic limb darkening.</p><p>When using statistics distributed according to χ 2 M or χ 2 P , the confidence area D is taken to be a multidimensional set in the parameter space, for which the specified statistics are less than the quantile corresponding to the given confidence level γ. The probability for D to encompass the combined exact parameter values is then γ. The confidence intervals (uncertainties) for the parameters corresponding to a given confidence level γ are the projections of the sides of the P -dimensional parallelepiped (in which the confidence area D is inscribed) onto the coordinate axes in the parameter space <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As was noted above, this method for constructing the confidence intervals ensures that they will simultaneously encompass the exact values of all the parameters with the given probability γ (or higher). Therefore, when specifying the confidence intervals (uncertainties) for the parameters, we should bear in mind that the adopted γ (for the differential-correction or Monte-Carlo method) is equal to the probability for the exact value of each fixed parameter to be encompassed by the corresponding confidence interval; at the same time, the probability for the exact solution to be encompassed simultaneously in the all confidence intervals is less than γ. When we use the confidence area method, the probability for the exact value of a fixed parameter to be included in each individual confidence interval is greater than the adopted γ, whereas the probability that the confidence area D encompasses the combined exact values of all the parameters is γ. Therefore, the adopted confidence level γ specifies each of the individual confidence levels in the differential-correction method and Monte-Carlo method, and is related to the total confidence area D in the confidence-area method.</p><p>Similar to the differential-correction method, using the χ 2 P statistic assumes that a model is perfectly valid, and that the obtained asymptotic confidence area D never degenerates into an empty set. The confidence area D does not depend on the sample size, and the probability γ can be specified for an area D that includes the exact solution (this probability is referred to as the confidence level). Since it is strictly assumed that the model is perfectly valid (the residuals are minimized over the parameters), the parameter uncertainties obtained using the χ 2 P statistic can also be considered to be internal, though these are more conservative than the uncertainties obtained using the differentialcorrection or Monte-Carlo method. We must bear in mind, however, that the dispersions of the observational data are used to construct the χ 2 P statistic; this is a significant difference between the use of the χ 2 P distribution and the differential-correction method. This difference can also be qualitatively significant if the rms dispersion with unit weighting (distributed according to a reduced χ 2 law) differs significantly from unity; that is, when there is a basis to think that the model does not fit the observational data well, or a strong correlation is suspected in the observational data. The parameter uncertainties obtained using the χ 2 P distribution can also be considered external, since the dispersions of the external observational data are used here.</p><p>The most conservative "external" parameter uncertainties are obtained using the χ 2 M statistic, which does not assume the model to be perfectly valid and uses the dispersions of the observational data. It is also important that the same residual (the χ 2 M statistic) is used both to search for the central parameter values and to find their confidence intervals. However, the confidence set D can be empty for certain significance levels α when using the χ 2 M statistic. As a result of fitting the observations, only a less strong statement can be made concerning the true parameter values, since we did not assume by default that the model is perfectly valid when using the χ 2 M statistic; namely, we can only indicate the probability (the significance level α) that wemistakenly reject the hypothesis that the combined true parameter values belong to a certain area D (rather than, strictly speaking, the probability γ with which the confidence area D encompasses this combination of parameters). If we suppose that the model fits the observational data, the probability for the area D to encompass the exact values of all the parameters is γ = 1 − α, where the probabilty γ = 1 is referred to as the confidence level for the confidence area D. If, however, the model does not fit the observational data, this may mean that we make a second-order error in accepting the model (i.e., the model is false, but is accepted according to the statistical criterion). In this case, the equality γ = 1 − α is only approximate for the confidence area.</p><p>However, we must remember that, in most cases, we are dealing with a specific realization (a sample) of a light curve rather than the entire observed light curve (a general population). Therefore, difficulties that arise when trying to demonstrate the adequacy of a model may be associated with considerable statistical deviations of a specific observational data, rather than shortcomings of the model itself. A light curve obtained at another epoch may match the model adequately, with no difficulties arising when fitting the observations. Therefore, strictly speaking, a specific realization used in fitting does not necessarily imply that the model is inadequate; it implies only that the available observational data are not sufficient to ascertain whether the model is adequate or not. It is this that enables us to estimate the model parameters and their uncertainties even when the reduced χ 2 , χ 2 red , is significantly greater than unity. It follows from these considerations that searches for model parameters and their uncertainties in such problems should be accompanied by testing of the model adequacy. The χ 2 M statistic can be used to test the adequacy of a model and verify how it fits the observational data (since the model is not assumed to be perfectly valid). Here, we must bear in mind that we accept the model according to a statistical criterion not because it is perfectly valid, but because there is no reason to reject it.</p><p>We can judge how well the model fits the obesrvational data (whether the model is adequate enough) by estimating the significance level α = α 0 starting from which the model can be rejected (the value α 0 is called the critical value of the significance level). The higher the critical value α 0 , the greater the probability that we make a first-order error when rejecting a model (that is, the weaker the basis for us to reject the model). The critical significance level α 0 is associated with the reduced χ 2 for the minimal residual,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ 2 red = (χ 2 M −P ) min M −P</formula><p>, which decreases with increasing α 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Strictly speaking, the residual minimized over nonlinear parameters in nonlinear parametric problems is not distributed according to a χ 2 M −P law, and only asymptotically approaches this law as M → ∞ <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, the criterion for an adequate model that the χ 2 red red is close to unity can be used only when the number of observational points M is sufficiently large. It was indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that, if χ 2 red = 1, the critical significance level is α 0 ≃ 50%, which corresponds to a very good model. In fact, we have the possibility in this case (when choosing a corresponding significance level α) to make up to 50% first-order errors in fitting if we reject the model; that is, we can err in every second case in rejecting the model. Hence, we have no reason to reject the model, and it can be accepted. When χ 2 red exceeds unity, the corresponding critical significance level is α 0 &lt; 50%. In this case, we do not make a large number of firstorder errors in rejecting the model; i.e., we are correct in most cases when we reject the model, and we therefore have a basis to reject the model. If, however, we obtain χ 2 red &lt; 1, the corresponding significance level is α 0 &gt; 50%. When the observational data are normally distributed, this situation is very unlikely, even for a model that is perfectly valid (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>); therefore, the value χ 2 red &lt; 1, and the corresponding value α 0 &gt; 50%, can indicate the presence of a correlation in the input observational data, which may include not only random but also systematic errors.</p><p>Finally, let us illustrate again why it is necessary to verify the model adequacy when deriving parameters from fits. An independent way of verifying the model adequacy follows from the fact that the number of observational points M usually greatly exceeds the number of parameters P , i.e., as a rule, the problem is highly overdetermined. Strictly speaking, one should have an exact light curve corresponding to the true parameter values to estimate their uncertainties. However, an exact light curve (corresponding to the perfect parameter values) is not available in reality; we have only an observed light curve, subject to observational uncertainties. The question thus arises of how well the observed light curvematches the perfect light curve. In other words, before finding the solution from a fit, we must answer the question of whether we have a sufficient basis to substitute the observed light curve for an exact light curve that is unknown a priori.</p><p>We can answer this fundamentally important question after checking the models adequacy. If χ 2 red ≃ 1, that is, α 0 ≃ 50%, there is no reason to reject the model, and the model can be accepted. An imagined perfectly exact light curve would optimally pass through the observational points of the real light curve, and we would have a firm basis to substitute the observed light curve for the perfectly exact light curve. The obtained values of the model parameters are close to their true values. Moreover, since the observed light curve optimally matches the perfectly exact curve and the contribution of systematic errors to the "exact" curve is negligible, we can obtain reliable uncertainty estimates that encompass the true parameter values with the given probability γ. We can estimate the parameter uncertainties using various methods, depending on the strictness with which we wish to judge the solution. These include the differential-correction or Monte-Carlo methods, which enable us to obtain "internal" uncertainties, the confidence-area method based on the χ 2 M statistic, which yields "external" uncertainties, or the confidence-area method based on the χ 2 P statistic (the intermediate case). However,if we obtain χ 2 red &gt; 1 and, correspondingly, α 0 &lt; 50%, we cannot make an unambiguous judgement about whether or not to accept the model. The modelmay prove to be "bad" since we can adopt for the model only a significance level α for which the probability to make a first-order error is small; i.e., we must only rarely be mistaken when rejecting the model. In this case, the statistical criterion suggests that the model should be rejected, and we construct a new and more perfect model. It is often the case in practice that χ 2 red &gt; 1 and the corresponding critical significance level is α 0 &lt; 10%. In this case, if we accept the model, we must remember that the obtained parameters and their confidence intervals are subject to systematic errors due to either the fact that the perfectly exact light curve does not optimally pass through the observed light curve, or the presence of a strong correlation in the observational data (note that, in this case, we cannot unambiguously judge the systematic error to be due to a correlation in the observational data, in contrast to the case when α 0 &gt; 50%). Of course, the obtained model parameters and their uncertainties will be less reliable in these cases. The questions raised above are considered in more detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p></div>

There is an appreciable shift in brightness between the right and left parts of the light curve due to either a spot on the surface of the star or systematic errors in the observations. These features required careful analysis and some corrections to the light curve.</p><p>We assumed that the observational uncertainties could be described by a normal distribution. The dispersions σ 2 of the individual points in the light curve were assumed to be the same for all points in the light-curve section used for the fitting.

Moreover, even if this effect is excluded from consideration, the light curve remains appreciably distorted near the minimum at θ ∼ 180 • .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential-Correction Method</head><p>The results of fitting of the left and right parts of the transit light curve and the light curve as a whole are given in <ref type="table">Tables 2, 3</ref>, and 4, respectively. The central parameter values and their 2σ uncertainties were obtained using the differential-correction method.</p><p>Since we used a model that most often proved to be "bad" (see below), we must provide 2σ parameter uncertainties, corresponding to γ = 95.5%. Moreover, when we determine the parameter uncertainties using the differential-correctionmethod in a multiparametric model, the true value of each parameter falls into the corresponding error interval with the given probability regardless of whether the true values of the other parameters fall into their error intervals.</p><p>The question thus arises: what is the probability of all the parameters falling into their error intervals? It is natural that we want this probability to be at least at the specified confidence level. If we consider the combined central parameter values to be a P-dimensional random value varying in the P-dimensional parameter space β 1 . . . β P , then, when the true value ¯ β i of one parameter β i falls into the corresponding error interval, the point associated with the combined true values will fall into the area between the two (P-1)-dimensional hyperplanes β i = β c i − κσ i and β i = β c i + κσ i (κ is a coefficient corresponding to the chosen confidence level).</p><p>Therefore, the differential-correctionmethod is essentially equivalent to finding a Pdimensional confidence area of this type. When the true parameter values fall into their corresponding error intervals, the point associated with the combined true parameter values falls into the P-dimensional parallelepiped centered on the point β c 1 , . . . , β c P and with sides of length 2κσ 1 , . . . , 2κσ P . It is obvious that the probability for the combined true values to fall into this parallelepiped will be less than the probability for the true parameter values to independently fall into their error intervals, that is, less than the given probability. To ensure that a point in the P-dimensional parameter space corresponding to the combined true parameter values falls into the P-dimensional parallelepiped centered on the point β c 1 , . . . , β c P and with sides proportional to σ 1 , . . . , σ P with the given probability γ (i.e., to achieve a situation where the true parameter values all fall simultaneously into their corresponding intervals with the given probability γ), we must choose the intervals (dimensions of the P-dimensional parallelepiped) to be kκσ i , where k &gt; 1.</p><p>The probability for a P-dimensional random point to fall into the P-dimensional parallelepiped is equal to the P-fold integral of the multidimensional density distribution over the specified parallelepiped. It is not only the rms deviations of the random values β c 1 , . . . , β c P that we need to know before defining the type of density function (and determining the integral of the function). If a model is a linear function of the parameters β 1 , . . . , β P (which have the Gaussiandistributed central values β c 1 , . . . , β c P ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), this distribution function will be written where K is a normalizing coefficient and the matrix A is the inverse of the covariance matrix cov(β i , β j ) 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The exponent in (3) is the difference between the residual functional as a function of the parameters and the minimum value of this functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and each level surface of the function f (which is a Pdimensional ellipsoid) bounds a confidence area obtainedwith a certain confidence level using the χ 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P distribution. f(β 1 , . . . , β P ) = Ke P i,j=1 A ij (β i − ¯ β i )(β j − ¯ β j )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Therefore, even if we use a linear model (or a linear approximation) to determine the probability for the true parameter values to jointly fall into their error intervals (or if we wish to solve for the coefficient k), we must know the covariances of the central values. The same values of the rms deviations σ 1 , . . . , σ P can correspond to different joint probabilities (different coefficients k) in different cases. In any case, however, kκσ i will be less than the corresponding projections of the confidence area obtained using the χ 2 P distribution for the given γ 1</p><p>For example, for γ = 0.955.. (that is, with κ = 2), the projection of the confidence area obtained using the χ 2 P distribution is ∆ P = 3.12σ for a four-parameter model and ∆ P = 3.36σ for a five-parameter model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Hence, at the "2σ" (γ = 0.955..) confidence level, k 1.56 for a four-parameter linear model and k 1.68 for a fiveparameter linear model. Note that k 2.17 for a fourparameter model and k 2.42 for a five-parameter model at the 1 confidence level (γ = 0.68).</p><p>In addition to the parameter values, </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= (χ 2 M −P ) min /(M − P )</formula><p>, and the critical significance levels α 0 . As was already noted, the χ 2 red values can be used to test whether the model adequately fits the observational data. This indicates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Tables 2, 3, 4</ref>) that our model was "bad" in most cases. When fitting the right branch of the light curve <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>.</p><p>Fitting of the left branch of the light curve <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref> yielded χ 2 red &lt; 1 for three of ten wavelengths, with the corresponding α 0 &gt; 50%. This suggests that systematic errors strongly affect the left branch of the light curve. As was noted above, it is these difficulties ((χ 2 red &lt; 1 and χ 2 red ) with fitting the light curves of the HD 189733 system that force us to adopt the confidence level γ = 95.5% (which corresponds to 2σ in the differentialcorrection method) rather than 68%, indicative of "good" models. For the same reason, we were not able to construct "exact" confidence areas D using the χ 2 M distribution and to provide the most conservative estimates of the "external" parameter uncertainties for the right branch of the light curve <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref> and for the entire light curve <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. We restricted our consideration to producing asymptotic confidence areas for the parameters using the χ 2 P statistic. We were able to construct the confidence areas for the left branch of the light curve using both the χ 2 P and the χ 2 M distributions.</p></div>

Moreover, we paid special attention to checking the adequacy of our model and verifying how well it agrees with the observational data. Our model proved to be formally "bad". When fitting the left and right branches of the light curve separately, our model is rejected at a high significance level of α 0 &gt; 50% at some wavelengths; this most likely indicates a correlation of the individual observational points in the light curve.

Since our model includes four or five parameters instead of only one, we choose the error intervals in the confidence-area method such that the probability for them to encompass the true parameter values is undoubtedly higher than the given probability (in this case, the given confidence level γ = 95.5% is associated with the entire confidence area D rather than only one confidence interval).
