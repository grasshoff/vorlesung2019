<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In its all-sky survey, Gaia will monitor astrometrically hundreds of thousands of main-sequence stars within ≈ 200 pc, looking for the presence of giant planetary companions within a few AUs from their host stars. Indeed, Gaia observations will have great impact is the astrophysics of planetary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Casertano et al. 2008)</ref>, in particular when seen as a complement to other techniques for planet detection and characterization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Sozzetti 2011</ref>). In this paper, I briefly address some of the relevant technical issues associated with the precise and accurate determination of astrometric orbits of planetary systems using Gaia data. I then highlight some of the important synergies between Gaia high-precision astrometry and other ongoing and planned, indirect and direct planet-finding and characterization programs, both from the ground and in space, and over a broad range of wavelengths, providing preliminary results related to one specific example of such synergies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Exoplanet Orbits with Gaia Astrometry: The Challenge</head><p>We are about to enter the age of micro-arcsecond (µas) astrometry with Gaia. In the matter of astrometric detection of planetary-mass companions around nearby stars, the improvement of over two orders of magnitude in single-measurement precision with respect to present-day Hipparcos astrometry is absolutely mandatory to finally put an end to the long list of 'blunders' that this technique has delivered (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Sozzetti 2010</ref>). However, the improved accuracy of the Gaia measurements will not resolve by itself the technical problems associated with the modeling of the astrometric signatures of planetary systems, which will have to be carefully dealt with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Orbital Fits of Planetary Systems</head><p>The problem of the correct determination of the astrometric orbits of planetary systems using Gaia data (highly non-linear orbital fitting procedures, with a large number of model parameters) will present many difficulties. For example, it will be necessary to assess the relative robustness and reliability of different procedures for orbital fits. Consistency checks between different solution algorithms will be mandatory as a way of learning the lessons of radial-velocity surveys, that are showing us, particularly in the case of multiple-planet systems, how disagreement on orbital solution details, and sometime number of planets!, based on the same datasets is not that uncommon (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Forveille et al. 2011, and references therein;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hatzes et al. 2011</ref>, and references therein). A detailed understanding of the statistical properties of the uncertainties associated with the model parameters will have to be developed, based on the relative merit of different metrics tailored to this task, such as covariance matrices, χ 2 surface mapping, and bootstrapping procedures. For multiple systems, a trade-off will have to be found between accuracy in the determination of the mutual inclination angles between pairs of planetary orbits, singlemeasurement precision and redundancy in the number of observations with respect to the number of estimated model parameters. It will constitute a challenge to correctly identify signals (and the associated) with amplitude close to the measurement uncertainties, particularly in the presence of larger signals induced by other companions and/or sources of astrophysical noise of comparable magnitude. Finally, in cases of multiple-component systems where dynamical interactions are important (a situation ex-perienced already by radial-velocity surveys), fully dynamical (Newtonian) fits involving an n-body code might have to be used to properly model the Gaia astrometric data and to ensure the short-and long-term stability of the solution (see Sozzetti 2005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Exoplanets Treatment in the Gaia Data Processing Pipeline</head><p>All the above issues could have a significant impact on Gaia's capability to detect and characterize planetary systems. For these reasons, within the pipeline of Coordination Unit 4 (object processing) of the Gaia Data Pro- cessing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), in charge of the scientific processing of the Gaia data and production of the final Gaia catalogue to be released sometime in 2021, a Development Unit (DU437) has been specifically devoted to the modelling of the astrometric signals produced by planetary systems. The DU is composed of several tasks, which implement multiple robust procedures for (single and multiple) astrometric orbit fitting (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and genetic algorithms) and the determination of the degree of dynamical stability of multiple-component systems. I provide here a quick-look view of the software and its status. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the activity diagram of DU437. The main feature of this software module consists of the use of two different solution algorithms for fitting astrometric orbits of planetary systems to Gaia data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Fitting Algorithms: Highlights</head><p>The first algorithm is based on a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The global nonlinear least-square problem is partially linearized in then paramters a j , ω j , Ω j , and i j (for j = 1, . . . , n, where n is the number of planets) using the Thiele-Innes elements representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Green 1985</ref>). An iterative period search provides seeds for initializing the MCMC procedure (a parallel-tempering algorithm upgrade is in the works). An MCMC chain is then run on the non linear parameters (e j , P j , τ j ), drawing from Gaussian independent distributions. Each step of the chain drives a linear LSQ solver (SVD). Multiple MCMC chains are run (one is used for inference), and convergence is checked via the Gelman-Rubin test. Finally, the set of parameters with the highest likelihood is the seed for a local non-linear minimization in the least-squares sense using the LevembergMarquardt algorithm.</p><p>The second otbital solution module implements an approach based on a genetic algorithm (GA). The first step consists of the generation of a population of 7 * n chromosomes. The fitness of each chromosome in the population is evaluated, and the selection of 'parent' chromosome pairs is made from the population according to their fitness. The next step includes the iterative modeling using a set of operators such as mutation, cross-over, Levemberg-Marquardt, and period scan. Finally, acceptance of new offsprings in the population is realized, and further iterations of the algorithm using the new population are carried out.</p><p>The last important element of the DU437 software module is constituted by its orbital stability analysis component. At present, a simple Hill stability criterion is applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Marchal &amp; Bozis 1982)</ref>. For a two-planet configuration, the system will be considered Hill-stable if the following inequality is satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">− 2M G 2 M 3 ⋆ c 2 h &gt; 1 + 3 4/3 m 1 m 2 m 2/3 3 (m 1 + m 2 ) 4/3 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where M is the total mass of the system, m 1 and m 2 are the planet masses (the subscript 1 refers to the inner </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M ⋆ = (m 1 m 2 + m 1 m 3 + m 2 m 3 )</formula><p>, c is the total angular momentum of the system, and h is the energy This is sufficient to double-check dynamically pathologic (while potentially correct in a χ 2 sense!) solution sets (e.g., orbit-crossing due to e ∼ 1.0) obtained by the MCMC and GA algorithms. Limited use of an N-body integrator (e.g., Burlisch-Stöer) is being tested at the time of writing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">A Readiness Test</head><p>I show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> some results from the application of the MCMC algorithm on a simulated Gaia data for a stellar sample of 100 nearby (d &lt; 100 pc) solar-mass stars with Gaia magnitude G &lt; 10 mag and orbited by two planets with periods up to twice the nominal 5-yr missione duration. Given the present-day Gaia astrometric error model, inclusive of the effects of a gate scheme to avoid saturation at the bright end (G &lt; 13 mag), in this sample ≈ 1/3 of the systems were not detectable in Gaia astrometry, ≈ 1/3 had one detectable planet, and ≈ 1/3 had two detectable companions. For example, in a two-planet system with a long-period planet identified in the initial periodogram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2, left panel)</ref>, the correct removal of the outer planet's orbit unveils in the periodogram the clear signal of the second, inner planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2, right panel)</ref>. Similarly, in the case of a system with two planets inducing low-S/N signatures of comparable magnitude, the periodicity analysis correctly identifies the periods of both components already in the first pass <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3, left panel)</ref>. The resulting quality of the fitted periods (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, right panel) in detectable two-planet systems is in good agreement with earlier results <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Casertano et al. 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Gaia -Exoplanets Synergy Potential</head><p>Gaia's main contribution to exoplanet science will be its unbiased census of planetary systems orbiting hundreds of thousands nearby (d &lt; 200 pc), relatively bright (G &lt; 13) stars across all spectral types, screened with constant astrometric sensitivity. As a result, the actual impact of Gaia measurements in exoplanets science is broad, and rather structured. The Gaia data have the potential to: a) significantly refine our understanding of the statistical properties of extrasolar planets; b) help crucially test theoretical models of gas giant planet formation and migration; c) achieve key improvements in our comprehension of important aspects of the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple-planet systems; d) aid in the understanding of direct detections of giant extrasolar planets; e) provide important supplementary data for the optimization of the target selection for future observatories aiming at the direct detection and spectral characterization of habitable terrestrial planets. For a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Sozzetti (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The broad range of applications to exoplanets science is such that Gaia data can be seen as an ideal complement to (and in synergy with) many ongoing and future observing programs devoted to the indirect and direct detection and characterization of planetary systems, both from the ground and in space, and across a broad range of wavelengths. Gaia will contribute critically, for example, to the definition of input catalogues for proposed quasi-all-sky photometric transit surveys (PLATO, TESS); it will inform ground-based direct imaging programs (e.g., SPHERE/VLT, EPICS/E-ELT) and spectroscopic characterization projects (e.g., EChO, FINESSE) about the epoch and location of maximum brightness of (primarily non transiting) exoplanets, in order to estimate their op- timal visibility, and will help in the modeling and interpretation of giant planets' phase functions and light curves. Another critical aspect will concern the large effort in terms of ground-based follow-up activities to improve the characterization of astrometrically detected systems (and possibly those found transiting by Gaia photometry). For example, high-precision radial-velocity campaigns (both at visible and infrared wavelengths) will be a necessary complement, with the three-folded aim of improving the phase sampling of the astrometric orbits found by Gaia, extending the time baseline of the observations (to put stringent constraints on or actually characterize long-period companions), and search for additional, low-mass and/or short-period components which might have been missed by Gaia due to lack of sensitivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A Synergetic Example: The Gaia survey of Nearby M Dwarfs</head><p>Cool, nearby M dwarfs within a few tens of parsecs from the Sun are becoming the focus of dedicated experiments in the realm of exoplanets astrophysics. This is due to the shift in theoretical paradigms in light of new observations, and to the improved understanding of the observational opportunities for planet detection and characterization provided by this sample. Gaia, in its all-sky survey, will deliver precision astrometry for a magnitudelimited (G = 20) sample of M dwarfs, providing an inventory of cool nearby stars with a much higher degree of completeness (particularly for late sub-types) with respect to currently available catalogs.</p><p>I present here preliminary findings of a simulation experiment aimed at gauging the Gaia potential for precision astrometry of exoplanets orbiting a sample of known, nearby dM stars <ref type="bibr">(Lépine 2005)</ref>. Gaia sensitivity thresholds are expressed as a function of system parameters and in view of the latest mission profile, including the most up-todate astrometric error model. The simulations also provide insight on the capability of high-precision astrometry to reconstruct the underlying orbital elements and mass distributions of the generated companions. These results will help in evaluating the complete expected Gaia planet population around late-type stars.</p><p>The synergy between the Gaia data on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for planet detection and characterization is also investigated, with a particular focus on: a) the potential for Gaia to precisely determine the orbital inclination, which might indicate the existence of transiting long-period planets; b) the ability of Gaia to carefully predict the ephemerides of (transiting and non-transiting) planets around M stars; and c) its potential to help in the precise determination of the emergent flux, for systematic spectroscopic characterization of their atmospheres with dedicated observatories in space, such as EChO.   were uniformly distributed within their respective ranges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results</head><p>The main findings in this experiment can be summarized as follows: 1) For detected giant planets with periods in the range 0.2 − 5 yr (i.e., with accurately determined masses and orbits), inclination angles will be determined with enough precision (&lt;1%, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, left panel) so that it will be possible to identify long-period planets which are likely to transit; 2) for well-sampled orbits (P &lt; T ), the uncertainties on planetary ephemerides, separation ρ and position angle ϑ , will degrade at typical rates of ∆ρ &lt; 0.01 AU/yr (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, right panel) and ∆ϑ &lt; 1 deg/yr, respectively. These are over an order of magnitude smaller than the degradation levels attained by present-day ephemerides predictions based on milli-arcsec precision HST/FGS astrometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Benedict et al. 2006</ref>); 3) Planetary phases will be measured with typical uncertainties ∆α of a few degrees, resulting (assuming a simple purely scattering atmosphere) in average errors on the phase function ∆Φ(α) ≈ 0.1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, left panel), and expected uncertainties in the determination of the emergent flux of wide-separation (a &gt; 0.3 AU) giant planets of ∼ 15% ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, right panel). All the above conclusions help to quantify the actual relevance of the Gaia observations of the large sample of nearby M dwarfs for in a synergetic effort to optimize the planning and interpretation of follow-up/characterization measurements of the discovered systems by means of transit survey programs, and upcoming and planned groundbased as well as space-borne observatories for direct imaging (e.g., SPHERE, EPICS) and simultaneous multiwavelength spectroscopy (e.g., EChO).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The largest compilation of high-accuracy astrometric orbits of giant planets, unbiased across all spectral types up to d &lt; 200 pc, will allow Gaia to crucially contribute to several aspects of planetary systems astrophysics (formation theories, dynamical evolution), in combination with present-day and future extrasolar planet search programs.</p><p>In this paper, I have first discussed some of the relevant issue related to the robust assessment of astrometric orbits of planetary systems detected by Gaia, with a focus on readiness tests of the DU437 software module in charge of providing (single and multiple) orbital solutions for exoplanets within the context of the Gaia data processing pipeline. Then, I have presented preliminary results on an investigation of the synergy between Gaia astrometry on nearby M dwarfs and other ground-based and space-borne programs for exoplanet characterization, focusing on: a) the potential for Gaia to precisely determine the orbital inclination, which might indicate the existence of transiting long-period planets; b) the ability of Gaia to carefully predict the ephemerides of (transiting and non-transiting) planets around M stars; and c) its potential to help in the precise determination of the emergent flux, for systematic spectroscopic characterization of their atmospheres with dedicated observatories in space.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: DU 437 Activity Diagram.</figDesc></figure>
