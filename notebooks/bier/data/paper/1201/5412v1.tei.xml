				<p>We present a method to confirm the planetary nature of objects in systems with multiple transiting exoplanet candidates. This method involves a Fourier-Domain analysis of the deviations in the transit times from a constant period that result from dynamical interactions within the system. The combination of observed anti-correlations in the transit times and mass constraints from dynami-cal stability allow us to claim the discovery of four planetary systems Kepler-25, Kepler-26, Kepler-27, and Kepler-28, containing eight planets and one additional planet candidate.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>To date, NASA's Kepler mission has announced the discovery of nearly a thousand candidate exoplanet systems including a significant number of systems with multiple transiting objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Borucki et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Steffen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Latham et al. 2011</ref>). Such a large sample of exoplanet candidates can provide valuable insight into the nature of the general population of planets and planetary systems, even if there were a sizeable fraction that are falsepositive signals. Nevertheless, a sample of systems that are known with high confidence to be planetary enables a significant amount of additional science both for individual objects and for the planet population generally. Moreover, it yields more efficient use of resources in these endeavors by indicating those systems where supplementary observations will likely be most fruitful.</p><p>Historically, planetary systems have been confirmed primarily by making dynamical measurements of the planet mass and orbital properties via radial velocity (RV) measurements. More recently ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>), this mass measurement has been accomplished by detailed modeling of transit timing variations, or TTVs-the deviations from a constant period that result from gravitational perturbations among multiple planets and their host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Holman and Murray 2005)</ref>. Another contemporary development is the validation of planets by the process of eliminationexcluding false positive signals by scrutinizing a wide variety of data on individual systems (e.g., BLENDER Torres et al. (2011); <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fressin et al. (2011)</ref>). Yet detailed dynamical modeling of systems, the gathering of RV and other complementary data, and the synthesis of this information is time consuming for individual systems and is prohibitive for the entirety of the list of Kepler objects of interest (KOIs). The development of simpler, and more rapid, validation techniques is crucial for the timely advancement of the exoplanetary science enabled by <ref type="bibr">Kepler.</ref> In this work, we present a method to confirm the planetary nature of candidates in multiple transiting systems. Complementary methods with the same goal are simultaneously being developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ford et al. (2011a)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fabrycky et al. (2011)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lissauer et al. (2011c)</ref>. These methods are specifically intended to confirm planetary systems using a small number of assumptions and easily implemented analysis. The method presented here broadly uses conservation of energy and dynamical stability to show that alternative (non-planetary) explanations of the observed photometric data are excluded with high confidence and that the objects must be both dynamically interacting and planetary in mass. Specifically, the properties of the TTV signature for the multiple candidates and the maximum allowed masses for objects in the systems demonstrate that exoplanet candidates in several Kepler systems are indeed planets. Generally speaking, it is difficult to construct astrophysical false positives that can mimic a multi-transiting system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lissauer et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ragozzine and Holman 2010</ref>). Yet, the analysis presented herein does not invoke this enhancement in planet likelihood, and we confirm the discovery of 8 total planets in the systems <ref type="bibr">Kepler-25 (KOI 244, KIC 4349452)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-26 (KOI 250, KIC 9757613)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-27 (KOI 841, KIC 5792202)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-28 (KOI 870, KIC 6949607)</ref>. This paper will proceed as follows. First, we discuss the essential components of the photometric data reduction and the stellar properties ( Â§2). The analysis method is discussed in Â§3. The results of the analysis for the various systems is found in Â§4. We discuss the implications of these results in Â§5. Finally, additional obervational information and photometric diagnostics for some of the systems are given in Â§A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">KEPLER DATA AND PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS</head><p>The Kepler mission was designed to detect terrestrialsize planets in the habitable zone of the host star, necessitating both a large sample size and sensitivity to a much larger range of orbital distances than groundbased surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>). The instrument is a differential photometer with a wide (â¼ 100 square degrees) field-of-view (FOV) that continuously and simultaneously monitors the brightness of approximately 150,000 main-sequence stars. A discussion of the characteristics and on-orbit performance of the instrument and spacecraft is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Koch et al. (2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Transit identification and data validation</head><p>Each of the systems considered here was found using the Transiting Planet Search Pipeline (TPS) which identi-  <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. 2010</ref>). The DV pipeline fits a transiting planet model to the data, removes it from the light curve, and returns the result to TPS in an effort to find additional transit features. DV also completes a suite of statistical tests that are applied to the data after all TCEs are identified in an effort to assess the likelihood of false-positives. The results of these diagnostic tests are consistent with the planet interpretation and do not warn of potential pitfalls.</p><p>After pipeline data processing and the photometry extraction, the time series is detrended as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ford et al. (2011b)</ref> in order to measure important stellar and planet candidate parameters. A first estimate for the stellar mass and radius (M * and R * ) is obtained by comparing the stellar T eff and log g values derived from an analysis of the stellar spectrum or from the Kepler Input Catalog <ref type="bibr">(KIC, Brown et al. 2011</ref>) to a set of CE-SAM (Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Morel (1997)</ref>) stellar evolution models computed in steps of 0.1 M for solar composition.</p><p>With M * and R * fixed to their initial values, a transit fit is then computed to determine the orbital inclination, planetary radius, and depth of the occultation (passing behind the star) assuming a circular orbit. The transit lightcurve is modeled using the analytic expressions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mandel and Agol (2002)</ref> using non-linear limb darkening parameters derived for the Kepler bandpass <ref type="bibr">(Claret 2000)</ref>. The best fit model is found using a LevenbergMarquardt minimization algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Press et al. 1992</ref>). The best fit transit model is then removed from the lightcurve and the residuals are used to fit for the characteristics of next transiting candidate identified by TPS. The transit times obtained from these model fits are used in our analysis below and a brief excerpt is given in Table 1. Since these systems show visible TTVs we display their light curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1, 2, 3</ref>, and 4, where data are prepared (with TTVs corrected) as described in . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Centroid analysis</head><p>A centroid measurement, which gives the displacement of the flux centroid during transit compared with the flux centroid in data taken out of transit, is calculated for each candidate planet. The proper interpretation of the value derived for the centroid motion requires knowledge of the positions and brightnesses of the stars near the target. Motion can result in two different ways; a nearby star with the transit signature or a nearby star (or stars) that dilute the light from the target star, which has the transit signal. An analysis of the centroid motion can give important information in identifying the host of the transiting object and can help disentangle complicated, projected systems blended within the target aperture.</p><p>One target star Kepler-25 is very bright (Kp = 10.7) and saturates the central pixels of its image on the photometer. Thus, the centroid information can only identify displacements of the size of a pixel and is of limited use. The centroid of a second target, Kepler-27, does displace significantly from the nominal location during transit. The dimness of Kepler-27 (Kp = 15.9) presents a challenge to the centroid analysis. A higher-resolution image of the target taken in the J band with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) shows a faint, neighboring star (Kp = 19.5) that is 2 arcseconds to the northeast of the target and that is not identified in the KIC (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). The centroid motion induced by this faint star is consistent with the interpretation that the faint star has constant brightness and the transit event arises from the target. The centroid analysis of the remainder of the eight planets shows no displacement beyond the 3Ï radius of confusion for each target and therefore do not raise concern. When modeling the planet and stellar properties for each of these systems, additional light from neighboring stars has been accounted for.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Stellar properties</head><p>The Kepler Follow-up Observing Program (FOP) has obtained spectra of the host stars for three of the four systems <ref type="bibr">(Kepler-25, Kepler-26, and Kepler-27)</ref>. The spectra were inspected for a prominent second set of spectral lines which would indicate the presence of an additional star. For host stars with modest SNR follow-up spectroscopy (roughly 20 per resolution element from the 1.5m Tillinghast Reflector at FLWO), we fit spectra to a library of theoretical spectra using the tools of <ref type="bibr">Buch- have et al. (2011)</ref>. For host stars with high-SNR follow-up spectroscopy from Keck, we also report stellar parameters derived from a Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Valenti and Piskunov 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fischer and Valenti 2005)</ref> with mass and radius estimates generated from YonseiYale isochrones. In cases without follow-up spectroscopy, we adopt the stellar parameters from the KIC ( ). The adopted stellar parameters are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> along with the estimate of contamination from nearby stars derived from the KIC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PLANET CONFIRMATION METHOD</head><p>In a system with multiple planets, those planets in close proximity to or librating within mean-motion resonance (MMR) will induce the largest TTV signals on each other. The effects of other nonresonant or more distant planets will generally be smaller. In many instances, conservation of energy implies that for a given pair of planets, the change in the orbital period of one planet due to a second planet will be met by a simultaneous change in the orbital period of the second planet but with opposite sign. The relative size of these changes is characterized by the ratio of the masses of the objects. Thus, in a system where multiple planets are transiting, the presence of anti-correlated TTVs between two objects is an indicator-sufficient, though not necessesary-that they are in the same system and are interacting. If one couples a stability requirement to this observation, the demonstration that you are observing a planetary system as opposed to an astrophysical system is much simplified. Showing that the masses of two interacting planet candi-  dates must be planetary gives enough evidence to claim a planet confirmation.</p><p>When planets interact, their interactions can be manifest at a variety of natural frequencies (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>; NesvornÂ´yNesvornÂ´y and Morbidelli <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>) and the obital period changes at all of those frequencies may show anticorrelation. Nevertheless, near MMR only a few such frequencies will dominate the TTV signal. In the presence of timing noise, the largest signal will be the first to appear with corresponding signals at other frequencies emerging over time. With this in mind, we set out to identify the dominant frequencies in the transit time residuals for all of the objects in multiply-transiting systems. After first calculating the residuals from a linear ephemeris (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>, a sinusoidal function is fit to the data, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, at a variety of periods:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">fi = A sin 2ÏtPi P + B cos 2ÏtPi P + C<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A, B, and C are model parameters, P is the mean orbital period of the planet in question, and Pi is the test timescale. The fitted values for A and B are stored along with their measured uncertainties, ÏA and ÏB, derived from the covariance matrix of the three parameter fit-the constant component (typically very small) is discarded, having no information at the specified frequency. This is essentially a Fourier transform of the (non-uniformly sampled) data. Next, a quantity Î</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Î = â A1A2 ÏA1ÏA2 + B1B2 ÏB1ÏB2 (2)</formula><p>is calculated for each of the sampled periods 1 , where the "1" and "2" subscripts correspond to the two objects. If 1 For computational reasons there are small differences between the periods (P i ) sampled in the application of equation 1 to each KOI as the algorithm is applied as a pipeline to data on all KOIs at a set of fixed periods relative to each KOI's orbital period. Consequently, when calculating Î, the closest the TTV signal from each object is anticorrelated at a particular period (or frequency), then Î will be a large positive number (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8)</ref>. Finally, the maximum value that Î has for a given candidate pair, Îmax, is the statistic we choose to demonstrate that the planets are interacting. Once Îmax has been found for a candidate pair, we use a Monte Carlo test to find the probability that the observed anticorrelation is caused by random fluctuations. To do this, we randomly shuffle the O-C residuals (and their errors), assigning them without replacement to the different transit epochs. We then refit the period and offset, and apply equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> to the shuffled data (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). The goal here is not to maintain correlations (hence the data are not rotated, Rosary-style, when shuffled) but to identify the probability that data with the observed variance in the O-C residuals can reproduce or exceed the observed Îmax.</p><p>Should additional correlation (or anticorrelation) in the O-C residuals beyond the frequency corresponding to Îmax exist, the most likely explanation is additional terms in the equations describing the dynamical interactions (see, for example, Equations (A7) and (A8) in Agol et al. <ref type="formula">(2005)</ref>) or interactions with other planets in the system. The generation of an anticorrelated TTV signal among two planets from star spots or correlated photometric noise (red noise) is virtually impossible as the dynamical signal occurs over very long timescales, involves two different orbital periods (hence two different noise frequencies are required), and is only sampled on the relatively short timescales of ingress/egress and the transit duration.</p><p>We run 10 4 realizations of the Monte Carlo test. Any system where fewer than 10 random realizations have a Îmax greater than the nominal data is considered to be interacting with a false alarm probability FAP &lt; 10 â3 . In the four cases confirmed in this manuscript, there were no examples where random data had a more significant anticorrelation than the original data. An extrapolation of the tail of the distribution of Îmax for each system allows for an estimate of the false alarm probability. Such estimates are generally much more significant than what can be obtained with our 10 4 realizations.</p><p>Once the systems have been established as interacting via the Monte Carlo simulation, we run dynamical simulations to test the stability of the system. We are particularly interested in the maximum allowed masses of the objects in the system on stability grounds. Starting with nominal masses of Mp = R 2.06 p , where Mp is in Earth masses and Rp is in Earth radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lissauer et al. 2011b</ref>), we scale the masses to large values with a common multiplier (see Fabrycky et al. (2011) for additional details). We integrate these systems until they become unstable and then reduce the mass multiplier and re-run the integration-iterating until the systems are long-term relevant periods are used when comparing objects in the same system. As the periods sampled initially with equation 1 are very dense compared to the dynamical periods of the systems in question, there is negligible effect on the calculation of Î except at the shortest few periods, P i . <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Results of stability tests for the various systems. We adopt as the maximum allowed mass, the smallest mass that was observed to cause the system to be unstable. In all cases, the maximum allowed mass is planetary.</p><p>stable (for â¼ 10 7 years). The smallest mass that is shown to be unstable is chosen as the maximum allowed planet mass in the system. If a system is shown to be both interacting via the observed anticorrelation of the O-C residuals and has a maximum allowed mass that is planetary, we claim that the objects are confirmed planets.</p><p>We note that in several cases the mass of the planets is very likely to be much smaller than the stated limits. Other considerations with bearing on mass limits, but which might take additional care in their application, include mass limits based upon the observed TTV amplitudes and constraints on physically plausible densities (in the absence of significant and highly contrived contamination sources, some of the densities of these planets at the stated mass limits exceed 1000 g cm â3 ). Thus, while there may be some misestimation of the upper mass limits (e.g., caused by using a common multiplier or from uncertainties in the planet radius), there are other quantities that can be brought to bear on systems where stability does not yield sufficiently low masses.</p></div>

In all cases the masses are certainly substellar with only two objects being near the 13 Jupiter mass (MJ ) gray area-the rest have maximum masses smaller than 10 MJ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results: Kepler-25</head><p>The two planets in Kepler-25 have a period ratio of 2.039, just outside the 2:1 MMR and the O-C residuals are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. Even if not actually resonating, one would expect large orbital perturbations in such a system. The observed anticorrelation in the TTV signal is indeed quite large. A plot of Î is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>. The Monte Carlo analysis of the transit times shows that the probability of observing an anticorrelation as large as observed is much smaller than the chosen 10 â3 threshold. The distribution in the Îmax statistic for Kepler-25 is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Extrapolating the tail of the observed distribution in Îmax by eye shows that the actual false alarm probability is likely much smaller than 10 â32 . Dynamical stability tests, described above and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fabrycky et al. (2011)</ref>, were run on this system in order to establish that the objects must have planetary masses. The maximum allowed mass for the two planets in this system (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>) are 4.16 MJ (3.97Ã10 â3 M) for Kepler-25c and 12.7 MJ (1.21Ã10 â2 M) for Kepler25b-meaning that a system with these masses and the observed orbital phases is predicted to be unstable on a timescale of roughly 10 7 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results: Kepler-26</head><p>The two planets in Kepler-26 have a period ratio of 1.4045, in this case slightly inside the 3:2 MMR. Here again one would expect large orbital perturbations. The Monte Carlo analysis of this system shows the probability of a spurious anticorrelation to be below our threshold (a rough extrapolation places it near 10 â5 ). The transit times for the two planets in Kepler-26 are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> and a plot of Î is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> An interesting feature in this system is a smaller peak in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> near a period of 90 days. Taken alone, this might not warrant much notice. However, a similar peak in Î, at the same period is evident for the interaction between the planet Kepler-26b and the planet candidate KOI-250.03 and a trough in Î is found at that period in the analysis of Kepler-26c and KOI-250.03-indicating that they have a correlated TTV signal at that frequency  instead of an anti-correlated one (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 13 and 14)</ref>. This is a hint that these three objects may be mutually interacting such that when the middle planet's period increases, the periods of the two outer objects both decrease-and vice versa. The current analysis is not sufficient to demonstrate that KOI-250.03 is a real planet, but with additional data or with a more sophisticated, three-body analysis such a goal may well be achieved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>The    of which are found in systems with multiple transiting objects. One challenge presented by such a rich yield is confirming or validating the planetary nature of these candidates-especially since many of the Kepler systems are very dim (Kp &gt; 15) and are very small (R &lt; 4Râ), and are therefore not amenable to the traditional spectroscopic methods that have been the workhorse of exoplanet discovery. In this paper (and its companion papers) we present a method that can fill this need. We claim that, in multitransiting systems, the demonstration that two objects are in the same system and that their masses must be planetary are a sufficient criteria to confirm the objects as planetary. The first criterion effectively eliminates background astrophysical false positive scenarios while the second shows that the objects are of planetary mass. We have shown that anti-correlated transit timing variations of sufficient significance can satisfy the first criterion. We developed a Fourier-based analysis and defined a statistic Îmax that can be used to calculate this significance of an anti-correlation observed for a pair of TTV signals.</p><p>We use dynamical stability as our primary means to constrain the mass of the transiting objects. These tests demonstrate that the object's masses in four Kepler systems satisfy our second criterion given above. Another means to constrain planetary masses comes from the TTV signals themselves. If the masses of the transit-  ing objects are too large, then the associated TTV signal will also be too large to be consistent with the observed variation.</p><p>The application of this method to Kepler data confirms the planetary systems <ref type="bibr">Kepler-25, Kepler-26, Kepler-27, and Kepler-28</ref>. This method is also applied to the systems announced in   the conclusions found in those studies. The fact that there are some differences among the three methods presented in this set of papers shows the importance of complementary analysis-particularly now at the early stages of the application of TTV methods to large quantities of data.</p><p>As this, and other methods continue to be refined, there is a significant opportunity for both the discovery of new planetary systems, for the elimination of astrophysical false positive explanations for observed transit signatures, and for the identification of systems that merit additional, more detailed characterization. The benefits to exoplanetary science of transiting exoplanets, and particularly of multi-transiting exoplanetary systems, are well known ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ragozzine and Holman 2010)</ref>. A fast and reliable method to identify exoplanet systems from large quantities of photometric data (specifically Kepler data) is an essential element for rapid advancement in the field. Methods such as that presented here can inform and economize a wide variety of supplemental (generally ground-based) observational efforts.  ticipating Scientist Program. D. C. F. and J. A.

These images can be used to identify the presence of stars that would either cause contamination or be the source of a false positive system. For Kepler-25, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref> shows a Ks-band image that is 20" on a side (north is up and east is to the left) taken at the Palomar Observatory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure A2</ref> is a speckle image taken at 692nm with the WIYN telescope.

We converted the pixel intensities to electrons using the information given in the detector gain and exposure time provided in the FITS headers; this facilitates the evaluation of the photometric errors. We adopt photometric apertures which provide the smallest errors; the optimal apertures are found to be at 3.0 pixels. We find that the transit depths and errors vary only weakly with the aperture radius for all of the light-curves. Outliers in flux and positions greater than 5 Ï were rejected using a sliding median filter and the first half-hour of observa- tions, which are affected by a significant telescope jitter before stabilization, are alse rejected.</p><p>We estimate the background by fitting a Gaussian to the central region of the histogram of counts from the full array. Telescope pointing drift results in fluctuations of the stellar centroid position, which, in combination with intra-pixel sensitivity variations, produces systematic noise in the raw light curves. The final photometric measurements used in the analysis are presented in Table A1 and the raw time series are presented in the top panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures A4, A5</ref>, and A7.</p><p>We correct the light curves for instrumental effects and measure the transit depths and their uncertainties as described in <ref type="bibr">DÃ©sert et al. (2011)</ref>. The transit light curves model used is the IDL transit routine OCCULTSMALL from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mandel and Agol (2002)</ref>. Only the ratio Rp/R is allowed to vary while the other model parameters are set to their value derived from the Kepler lightcurve and the midtransit times are fixed at the measured central transit time. We simultaneously fit the instrumental functions with the transit for each individual visit, and report the values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>. The errors on each photometric point were assumed to be identical, and were set to the rms of the residuals of the initial best-fit obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A3 Study of possible blend scenarios</head><p>One issue that can arise with systems like those we present is that, while the transiting objects are known to be planets, there is a small probability that they orbit a background or physically associated star rather than the Kepler target star. The centroid offsets alone can eliminate a significant amount of blend scenarios. However, other types of analysis can boost confidence that the target star is indeed the planetary host star.</p><p>A more detailed analysis with BLENDER folds in data from a number of sources and is sufficiently powerful to validate the planetary nature of an object on its own by  the elimination of possible scenarios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Torres et al. 2011</ref>). However, such a study consumes a significant amount of human and computer resources. We conducted a smallscale analysis for blend scenarios for the systems presented here, though given the expense of even these studies we anticipate that future applications of the planet confirmation method described herein will not include a similar blend analysis. In this less exhaustive blend study, we quantify the likelihood that the planets we see transit an unresolved star in the photometric aperture whether by the chance alignment of a background star, or a physical companion to the target.</p><p>The TTV signal provides a strong constraint on the maximum mass ratio planets could have with the star they orbit. This maximum mass ratio translates to a max-  <ref type="figure">Figure A6</ref>. Observations of the transit of Kepler-26c with Spitzer. The formatting is the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure A4</ref>.</p><p>imum radius allowed as a function of the spectral type of the blend. We use the upper envelope of the known exoplanets mass-radius diagram to estimate the maximum radius-from which we get the maximum dilution factor (or magnitude difference) per spectral type that would match the observed transit depth. When the maximum allowed magnitude difference is small, it excludes a large fraction of background blends as well as the reddest stellar companions. Stellar companions can also be constrained by the color of the target. We verify that simple stellar models using T eff and the Solar isochrone are consistent with the r â K color (using r from the KIC and 2MASS K). This excludes blends that are significantly redder than the target (having a â(r â K) &gt; 0.1). For Kepler-25 and Kepler-26, the Spitzer observations are consistent with a planetary transit and show no evidence for a false positive scenario. We exclude the scenario of a larger planet transiting a significantly redder star for both physical companions and for background stars for systems where there would be a 3Ï discrepancy between the Spitzer and Kepler observations.</p><p>We compute the frequency of blends using a targetspecific (magnitude and position) BesanÃ§on model of the galaxy for background stars with a cut on the maximum magnitude difference and spectral type. For the frequency of physical companions, we use the rates given in Ragha- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure A7</ref>. Observations of the transit of Kepler-26c with Spitzer. The formatting is the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure A4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">van et al. (2010)</ref> and draw, for our samples, the mass ratio between the companion and primary from the distributions given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Duquennoy and Mayor (1991)</ref>.</p><p>For Kepler-25 and Kepler-26, we estimate that it is 300 times more likely that the planets transit the target star than they transit an unresolved companion or background star. For <ref type="bibr">Kepler-27 and Kepler-28</ref>, it is more difficult to exclude the scenario where the planets transit an unresolved stellar companion. The centroid shift does not help with this issue, leaving the maximum mass ratio and color as the remaining constraints. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A2</ref> shows the results of our analysis for blend scenarios. Even for cases where companion stars remain a possibility, this does not affect the planetary nature of these systemsnor does it affect the system where the planets are located (only the star within that system). Indeed, if these planets happen to orbit a smaller star the maximum allowed mass from out stability study would, in turn, be smaller as the dynamics cares about the ratio of the masses and not the actual masses; and the anticorrelated TTV signal already demonstrates that these are not planets orbiting different stars.

a The Kepler system number is given in parenthese (e.g., 25 means Kepler-25). 
b Contamination values come from the KIC except KOI-841 which includes the effects of the non-KIC star seen in high resolution imaging. 
c Quoted uncertainties do not include systematic uncertainties due to stellar models. Values with no stated uncertainties are from KIC.
