				<p>Context. Long-baseline optical interferometry uses the power spectrum and bispectrum constructs as fundamental observables. Noise arising in the detection of the fringe pattern results in both variance and biases in the power spectrum and bispectrum. Previous work on correcting the biases and estimating the variances for these quantities typically includes restrictive assumptions about the sampling of the interferogram and/or about the relative importance of Poisson and Gaussian noise sources. Until now it has been difficult to accurately compensate for systematic biases in data which violates these assumptions. Aims. We seek a formalism to allow the construction of bias-free estimators of the bispectrum and power spectrum, and to estimate their variances, under less restrictive conditions which include both unevenly-sampled data and measurements affected by a combination of noise sources with Poisson and Gaussian statistics. Methods. We used a method based on the moments of the noise distributions to derive formulae for the biases introduced to the power spectrum and bispectrum when the complex fringe amplitude is derived from an arbitrary linear combination of a set of discrete interferogram measurements. Results. We have derived formulae for bias-free estimators of the power spectrum and bispectrum which can be used with any linear estimator of the fringe complex amplitude. We have demonstrated the importance of bias-free estimators for the case of the detection of faint companions (for example exoplanets) using closure phase nulling. We have derived formulae for the variance of the power spectrum and have shown how the variance of the bispectrum can be calculated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Astronomical interferometers combine the light from multiple telescopes to form interference fringes. The amplitude and phase of the fringes corresponding to interference between a given pair of telescopes can be combined into a single complex number, the fringe complex amplitude, which in an ideal interferometer is proportional to a single Fourier component of the object brightness distribution.</p><p>The complex amplitude forms the fundamental observable in phase-stable interferometric experiments, for example at radio wavelengths, but at optical wavelengths the phase of the fringes is unstable on timescales of order milliseconds, because of optical pathlength perturbations introduced by the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, observers need to combine the information from multiple short-exposure interferograms to recover the desired science data. Since the phase of the fringes is randomly fluctuating, simply averaging the complex amplitude over multiple interferograms would lead to a vanishingly small result. Instead two observables, the power spectrum and bispectrum, are calculated from each interferogram and these can be averaged over frames as both are immune (to first order) to the atmospheric and instrumental phase perturbations. The power spectrum serves to capture information about the modulus of the complex amplitude, while the phase of the bispectrum (also known as the "closure phase") captures information about the phase of the complex amplitude on closed triplets of baselines.</p><p>At the low light levels typically encountered in astronomical interferometry, the effects of the noise arising in the detection process become important. This noise can usually be modelled as a mixture of Poisson noise, for example photon noise, and signal-independent Gaussian noise, for example readout noise in the detector electronics. We use the term "detection noise" to refer to the combination of all the noise processes in the detection process including the photon noise.</p><p>Detection noise produces random measurement errors which can be reduced by averaging over many interferograms, but in the case of the power spectrum and bispectrum it also produces systematic biases in the averaged estimates. There has been considerable study in the literature on these biases (see for example <ref type="bibr">Goodman &amp; Belsher (1976a,b)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sibille et al. (1979)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wirnitzer (1985)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beletic (1989)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Perrin (2003)</ref>). Some authors have derived formulae for the power spectrum bias which allow for both Poisson and Gaussian noise sources, but existing bispectrum bias estimates have been derived under the assumption of Poisson noise only. As a result, it is difficult to derive an unbiased estimate of the closure phase from observations where both Poisson and Gaussian noise are significant. Such conditions are increasingly present in interferometric observations made at near-infrared wavelengths so the absence of such an estimator is becoming a critical limitation to the acquisition of accurate interferometric data as we will demonstrate in Section 8.</p><p>Much of the existing power spectrum and bispectrum analysis relies on the direct Fourier transform of the interferogram to recover the fringe complex amplitudes. Even under noise-free conditions the use of a Fourier-based estimator will return inaccurate estimates of the fringe complex amplitude if the interferogram is, for example, non-uniformly sampled. To account for this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Tatulli &amp; LeBouquin (2006)</ref> introduced a pixel-to-visibility transformation matrix (P2VM) for deriving fringe amplitude estimates in circumstances where the Fourier-based estimators are inaccurate, which includes the Fourier estimators as a special case.</p><p>There has been considerable study of the variance of the power spectrum and bispectrum <ref type="bibr">(Goodman &amp; Belsher 1976a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dainty &amp; Greenaway 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sibille et al. 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wirnitzer 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Roddier 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ayers et al. 1988</ref>), but only the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Tatulli &amp; LeBouquin (2006)</ref> applies the more general P2VM approach, and in this case the variance is calculated under assumptions valid only for purely Gaussian noise processes. Knowing the variance, and hence the signal-to-noise ratio is important for predicting the integration times and detection limits prior to an observation run.</p><p>This paper builds on the introduction by <ref type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2010)</ref> and previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Thorsteinsson &amp; Buscher (2004)</ref> to present a general formalism for computing biases and variances in the presence of detection noise. Our formalism has two advantages over current treatments: (a) it can be applied when the fringe complex amplitudes are derived using any linear estimator, including the P2VM and Fourier transform as special cases and (b) it yields accurate answers for any additive mixture of Poisson noise and Gaussian noise. We derive formulae for the biases affecting both the power spectrum and bispectrum under these conditions and show how our results allow the construction of bias-free estimators. We present simulations to show that using our new bispectrum estimator can significantly enhance the accuracy of measuring the closure phase under realistic observation conditions. We also use our formalism to derive expressions for the variance of the power spectrum, and explain the method by which the reader can calculate the bispectrum variance if required.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Interferogram</head><p>We will start from a specific idealised example and use this to introduce our more general model which will be applicable to a wide range of realistic scenarios. In our example, the light from N tel telescopes is combined to produce a 1-dimensional interference pattern, which consists of the superposition of a set of sinusoidal fringes at different fringe frequencies f i j corresponding to the interference between telescopes i and j. The interference pattern is sampled to produce a set of N pix intensity measurements {i p }. We shall call this discrete set of intensity measurements the "interferogram". In our example the interferogram is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">i p = C 00 N pix + 1 N pix N tel i&lt; j ℜ C i j e 2πiα p f i j + noise,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where C i j denotes the complex amplitude of the fringes corresponding to interference between light from telescopes i and j, C 00 denotes an offset due to the light from all the telescopes (we shall call this the "zero-spacing flux"), and α p is the coordinate of pixel p.</p><p>Recognising that Eq. (1) represents a sum over a set of Fourier components, we can derive an estimate c i j of the complex amplitudes from the sampled intensity data using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c i j = N pix p=1 i p e 2πiα p f i j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where we note that this equation can also be used to estimate the zero-spacing flux by setting f 00 = 0. In noise-free conditions, the estimator c i j will be equal to the true amplitudes C i j provided that the samples are evenly spaced in the coordinate α and the frequencies f i j are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency given by f fundamental = 1/[N pix (α 2 − α 1 )]. We will call this set of conditions the "DFT conditions". We can rewrite the above equations in the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">i = WC + noise,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and: . .] is a vector describing the estimated complex amplitudes, W is a matrix known as the "visibility-to-pixel matrix" (V2PM) and H is the pixel-tovisibility matrix (P2VM) mentioned before. When the DFT conditions hold, the matrices W and H will consist of sine and cosine terms.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c = Hi,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>If we now assume that the DFT conditions do not hold, for example if the samples are not evenly spaced or there are "dead" pixels, then it is often still possible to set up a linear set of equations in the form of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> by modifying the matrix W. For the case of any "working" beam combiner, we can always find the corresponding matrix H such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">HW = I,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where I is the identity matrix, ie. Eq. (5) is the condition that H is a pseudo-inverse of W. It is then clear that Eq. (4) can be used to derive a value for c such that c = C under noise-free conditions. The pseudo-inverse generalises the Fourier inverse to the cases in which the DFT conditions may not hold; in general the pseudo-inverse matrix will not consist of simple Fourier terms. Equation (4) serves to define the basis of our more general model for an interferometric measurement. We assume only a discrete set of intensity measurements {i p } related to a set of complex fringe amplitudes {C i j }. We do not require a simple Fourier relationship between the amplitudes and the pixel intensities; we only require that there exists a set of estimators for {C i j } which are linear in {i p }. In other words we require only that there exists at least one set of complex weights {H i j p } such that the complex amplitude estimators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">c i j = p i p H i j p ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>have the property that c i j = C i j in the limit where detection noise can be neglected. This generalised model can be applied to a wide variety of beam combination scenarios: the interferograms can be sampled temporally or spatially or a combination of the two, and multiple telescopes can be combined "all-in-one" into a single multiplexed fringe pattern or pairwise onto separate detectors.</p><p>Note that pseudo-inverse techniques are only presented as one possible route to deriving {H i j p }; under circumstances where the forward matrix W is not known or not fixed (for example if the fringe pattern has not been spatially filtered) alternative techniques to derive {H i j p }, perhaps based on knowing the statistical properties of W, may be needed. Nevertheless, the results presented here will be valid independent of the technique used to derive values for H i j p .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Interferometric observables</head><p>Under phase-unstable conditions, it is common to choose the power spectrum, S i j and bispectrum, B i jk as the interferometric observables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S i j = C i j 2 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B i jk = C i j C jk C ki .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Typically the values of C i j will change randomly from interferogram to interferogram due to atmospheric disturbances, but the values of S i j and B i jk will be more stable. However, unless otherwise specified, we do not assume any particular distribution for the values of C i j ; for example the results will apply equally well under incoherent conditions where the average value of C i j is zero or conditions where a fringe tracker is being used and the value of C i j is stable from frame to frame. Our aim is to determine suitable estimators, S i j 0 , B i jk 0 , for the power spectrum and bispectrum respectively that do not suffer from bias in the presence of noise. For this analysis these observables are calculated on an interferogram-by-interferogram basis and then averaged. Derived quantities, such as the closure phase, are calculated using the averaged observables, rather than on an interferogramby-interferogram basis themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Noise Model</head><p>The signal recorded by a real detector system will always have some noise component, which becomes especially important at low light levels. We model two distinct sources of noise, photon shot noise and detector read noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Photon Noise</head><p>Photon noise is always present in a real interferogram as a result of the quantum nature of the detection process which converts the incoming photons to an electrical signal. For a given pixel p, the probability of N p photoevents occurring is given by the Poisson distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P Poisson N p |Λ p = ∞ n δ N p − n Λ N p p N p ! exp −Λ p . (9)</formula><p>where Λ p is the ideal noise-free intensity, also called the "classical intensity" or "high-light-level intensity". Note that this equation implicitly defines the normalisation of Λ p in units of photoevents, and we require that i p = Λ p under noise-free conditions, thereby defining the normalisation of i p .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Read Noise</head><p>Read noise is present in all optical and IR detectors and is often significant at low light levels. Assuming the read noise is independent of the number of photoevents, the probability of a given measurement error ǫ p = i p − N p is given by the Gaussian distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P Gaussian ǫ p |σ p , N p = 1 2πσ 2 p exp           − ǫ p 2 2σ 2 p           .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where σ 2 p is the variance of the noise on pixel p; note that the variance is not assumed to be the same on all pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Other Sources of Noise</head><p>There are additional noise sources that follow the same statistics as photon or read noise. Detector dark current, D p , for example is also described by the Poisson distribution and could be included in our formalism by replacing Λ p with Λ p +D p in Eq. (9). For the sake of readability dark current will not be explicitly included in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Combined Noise Model</head><p>If the photon noise and read noise are statistically independent then the probability of obtaining the noisy data, i p , from the underlying ideal data, Λ p , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P i p |Λ p , σ p = i p 0 P Poisson N p |Λ p P Gaussian ǫ p |σ p , N p dN p .</formula><p>(11) The combined noise distribution is a convolution of the Poisson noise and Gaussian noise distributions, so it is convenient to derive the moments of our noise model via the momentgenerating function of the probability distribution. The momentgenerating function for the combined noise model probability density P i p |Λ p , σ p is proportional to the product of the moment-generating functions M Poisson and M Gaussian of the individual distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">M (ν) = M Poisson (ν) M Gaussian (ν) = exp        σ 2 p ν 2 2        exp −Λ p + Λ p e ν .</formula><p>(12) The first four moments of the noise model as required to derive the results given in this paper are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">i p = d dν M (ν) ν=0 = Λ p ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">i 2 p = d 2 dν 2 M (ν) ν=0 = Λ 2 p + Λ p + σ 2 p ,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">i 3 p = d 3 dν 3 M (ν) ν=0 = Λ 3 p + 3Λ 2 p + Λ p + 3Λ p σ 2 p ,<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">i 4 p = d 4 dν 4 M (ν) ν=0 = Λ 4 p + 6Λ 3 p + 7Λ 2 p + Λ p + 6Λ 2 p σ 2 p + 6Λ p σ 2 p + 3σ 4 p ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where . . . denotes taking the expectation over the probability distribution of the detection noise. For simplicity, only the statistics of the measured data for fixed {Λ p } is considered at first; averaging over multiple interferograms will be considered later. As such the angle brackets do not denote taking an average over the distribution of possible values of {Λ p }, due to, for example, atmospheric distortions to the interferograms. An important assumption of the following analysis is that the detection noise on different pixels is statistically independent so that for example i p1 i p2 = i p1 i p2 for p1 p2. It should be noted that this assumption will not be true in all cases of practical interest. For example when temporally-sampling an interferogram with a near-IR detector, it is common not to reset the charge accumulation capacitors at each pixel between successive time samples, so that a flux measurement i p is derived from the difference between the voltage readings on two successive samples; in this case the final reading for one sample represents the initial reading for the next sample and so the noise on the two samples is correlated. Treating such readout schemes is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Bias-free power spectrum estimator</head><p>We seek an estimator S i j 0 for the noise-free power spectrum S i j that does not suffer from statistical bias introduced by the noise on the interferogram. A bias-free estimator was calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tatulli &amp; Duvert (2007)</ref> in the presence of photon noise and read noise, but we present an alternative derivation here to demonstrate our analysis method. For the purposes of evaluating the power spectrum, we drop all telescope-pair-dependent superscripts, for example writing H i j p as H p . We start by evaluating the expectation value of the biased estimator |c| 2 . Combining Eqs. (6) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">|c| 2 = p1 p2 i p1 i p2 H p1 H * p2 .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>We split the sum in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> for the cases where p1 = p2 (≡ p) and for p1 p2 which gives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">|c| 2 = p i 2 p H p 2 + p1 p2 i p1 i p2 H p1 H * p2 ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>noting that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">i p1 i p2 = i p1 i p2</formula><p>for p1 p2. Substitution of the moments of the noise model given in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> leads to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">|c| 2 = p Λ 2 p + Λ p + σ 2 p H p 2 + p1 p2 Λ p1 Λ p2 H p1 H * p2 .</formula><p>(19) The noise-free power spectrum, S , can be expressed in terms of the noise-free interferogram, Λ p , as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">S = |C| 2 = p1 p2 Λ p1 Λ p2 H p1 H * p2 ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>This can be split into terms equivalent to those in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">S = p Λ 2 p H p 2 + p1 p2 Λ p1 Λ p2 H p1 H * p2 ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>which can be substituted into Eq. (19) to give:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">|c| 2 = S + p Λ p H p 2 ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>and written in terms of the noisy interferograms we see:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">S = |c| 2 − p i p + σ 2 p H p 2 .<label>(23)</label></formula><p>The bias-free power spectrum estimator, S 0 , is then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">S 0 = |c| 2 − p i p + σ 2 p H p 2 .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>It needs to be remembered that S 0 is intended to be evaluated on a per-interferogram, ie. frame-by-frame basis as atmospheric turbulence changes the shape of the interferogram between frames. It is straightforward to show that when this estimator is averaged over a number of frames that the average is itself unbiased. This is because taking the average over frames commutes with taking the expectation over the detection statistics, so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">1 N f f S 0 = 1 N f f S 0 = 1 N f f S<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where N f denotes the number of frames over which the average is taken. This result depends on the assumption that the detection noise is dependent only on the value of the flux Λ p in each pixel and is statistically independent of the particular shape of the interferogram and hence of the atmospheric distortions affecting a particular interferogram.</p><p>For the case where read noise is negligible (σ p = 0e − and H is the DFT ( H p 2 = e 2πiα p f 2 = 1) Eq. (24) reduces to the estimator reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goodman &amp; Belsher (1976a)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">S 1 = |c| 2 − N,<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where N = p i p , is the total number of photons in an interferogram. For high light levels (negligible photon noise and read noise), the |c| 2 term dominates (as this goes as N 2 ), and we reduce our estimator further to the uncorrected estimator (correct only under zero noise conditions):</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">S 2 = |c| 2 .<label>(27)</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Closure phase bias</head><p>To illustrate the magnitude of the systematic bias in a realistic observation we present the closure phase data from a set of simple simulations. We created ideal interferograms resulting from a three telescope interferometer observing a target with a known and controllable closure phase. Photon noise and read noise were added, and the bispectrum (and hence closure phase) extracted using each of the three estimators presented above. The interferograms were created under either DFT or non-DFT conditions. The fringe frequency on the detector for each baseline was set at a ratio {1 : 2 : 3} for the DFT case, and 1.1 × {1 : 2 : 3} for the non-DFT conditions. To simulate non-DFT conditions we rewrite Eq. (1) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">i p = b p C 00 + b p N tel i&lt; j ℜ C i j e i2πα p f i j + noise,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>where the beam profile, b p is either flat: b p = 1/N pix for DFT conditions (as in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>), or a cropped Gaussian of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">b p = exp − (p−µ) 2 2ς 2 N pix p ′ exp − (p ′ −µ) 2 2ς 2 ,<label>(35)</label></formula><p>where ς = 22 pixels and µ is centered on the 64 pixel detector. From Eq. (34) we can construct a V2PM, W, which is correct under DFT and non-DFT conditions. The form of W is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> for the non-DFT conditions described. We use the Singular Value Decomposition method to find the optimum (in terms of least squares) pseudo-inverse of W, which gives us H. An instrumental visibility loss was introduced such that the maximum visibility on a baseline is |V i | = 1/3. The results presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>   <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The transform matrix, W under non-DFT conditions. The DC term shows the beam profile adopted, and the cosine (solid lines) and sine (dotted lines) components of the fringe pattern for each baseline show the deviation from integer number of fringe periods across the detector (with frequencies in the ratio 1.1×{1 : 2 : 3}).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Zero read noise</head><p>In the situation where photon noise dominates the noise model (σ p = 0e − ) and the instrument is setup such that the interferograms are formed under DFT conditions, B i jk 0 and B i jk 1 both return the correct closure phase, however B i jk 2 is affected by a bias term resulting from photon noise. At these light levels, the bias in B i jk 2 becomes significant for the majority of source closure phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Non-zero read noise</head><p>At low light levels the read noise on the detector becomes important and comparable to the photon noise. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3b</ref> shows simulations under DFT conditions, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3a</ref>, but with σ p = 3e − read noise included. This level of read noise is quite low compared to many of the optical detectors in use today. We see that failing to account for read noise introduces a significant bias in closure phase estimates for both B i jk 1 and B i jk 2 . It is clear that the magnitude of the bias term is strongly dependent on the source brightness, and that B i jk 2 is preferable to B i jk 1 under certain combinations of noise and photon flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Non-DFT Conditions</head><p>Deviation from DFT conditions changes the way statistical bias affects the bispectrum. Inspection of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref> shows that the statistical bias can affect both the real and imaginary parts of the bispectrum when H is not the DFT. If the measurement system conforms to DFT conditions, and the read noise is negligible or constant across all pixels, the bias only affects the real part of the bispectrum estimators as shown when applying Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> to <ref type="bibr">Eq. (30)</ref>. It is also apparent that the magnitude of the bias is no longer dependent only on the value of the closure phase, but on the value of the individual phase of each baseline. The nonuniform beam profile causes an overlap of the fringe components in frequency space, and the non-integral fringe frequency on the detector invalidates the assumption that H  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>.c is provided as an example of the impact of non-DFT conditions on the closure phase bias for a photon noise dominated instrument (σ p = 0). Note that the non-DFT conditions change the bias terms, meaning B i jk 1 is now biased when it was not under DFT conditions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>.d shows the effect of non-DFT conditions on a system with photon and read noise and again there is an alteration of the bias terms which B i jk 0 corrects but the other estimators do not. The grey regions on the non-DFT plots show the range of biases associated with each estimator depending on the individual phases of the triplet producing a given closure phase. The lines within the shaded regions represent the expectation of the closure phase bias over all possible individual phases.</p><p>We see that the bias on the closure phase does not cancel when accumulating frames; specifically, that there is no advantage to observing in phase-unstable conditions over phase-stable conditions as a means of reducing bias. Therefore, bias-wise, one should always favor fringe-tracker assisted observations whereby the longer discrete integration times result in higher SNR, even in the photon-rich regime where fringe tracking is not strictly necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Closure phase bias and statistical uncertainty</head><p>The bias is only significant at low light levels, and tends to zero as the light level increases.

The presence of a companion becomes evident as a deviation from an instantaneous phase jump. The profile of the phase jump gives information about the projected separation and flux ratio of the system components. We show that statistical bias in the closure phase leads directly to incorrect estimation of the system properties.</p><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chelli et al. (2009)</ref> and simulate a binary system where the primary is described by a uniform disk of radius, R ⋆ , with a point source companion at a separation, s, with flux ratio, r. For simplicity we simulate a three telescope interferometer such that the position angle of the binary system is parallel to the frequency axis of the interferometer. The interferometer samples three frequencies {u 12 , u 23 , u 13 } such that u 13 = u 12 + u 23 . The instrumental parameters are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref> and we assume the instrument is functioning under DFT conditions. The complex visibility, C i j (u), at a given frequency, u, is described by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">C i j (u) = V ⋆ (u) + re i2πus 1 + r ,<label>(41)</label></formula><p>which is the visibility function, V ⋆ (u), of the primary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">V ⋆ (u) = 2 J 1 (2πuR ⋆ ) 2πuR ⋆ ,<label>(42)</label></formula><p>plus the contribution of the secondary with a phase modulation related to the projected separation, s, and flux ratio, r. J 1 is the first order Bessel function and R ⋆ is the radius of the primary. The ideal bispectrum is extracted from Eq. (41) using Eq. (8) and the closure phase is taken as the argument of the averaged bispectrum. The closure phase signal around the first null in the visibility profile is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chelli et al.

The closure phase is wrapped modulo 2π and the frequencies {u 12 , u 23 , u 13 } are set to the ratio {1 : 2 : 3} on the detector and scaled by the radius of the primary, R ⋆ . For simplicity, the baseline to fringe-frequency mapping is chosen such that it preserves the ratios of the two. The specifics of the mapping is not expected to have a significant impact on the bias. The closure phase of the primary alone (single source) is shown for comparison.</p><p>We present in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5b</ref> a simulation of the closure phase from a 100R ⋆ separation binary with flux ratio 0.01.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions</head><p>Interferometry offers exceptional angular resolution at the expense of sensitivity, as the collecting area is, by necessity, smaller than that of a single dish with the same resolution. In ground-based optical interferometry these sensitivity limitations are accentuated by the need for short observations to reduce the phase perturbations introduced by the atmosphere. The result is that noise levels on individual observation frames are often high, exacerbated by the need for fast read-out of the detector. Without understanding the statistical properties of the noise, bias terms are introduced when extracting information from the interferogram using the non-linear power spectrum and bispectrum constructs. We have shown in this paper that:</p><p>1. Neglecting the cross terms that arise in the presence of both read noise and photon noise leads to bias on the extraction of interferometric observables resulting from the statistics of the noise. 2. The statistical bias on the observables results in incorrect phisical parameters being extracted from observation data, for example the flux ratio of binary pairs or the diameter of a target as shown for the case of closure phase nulling.</p><p>To remedy this we have presented bias-free estimators for both the power spectrum and bispectrum (and hence the closure phase) which can be used in the presence of any combination of photon and read noise under any fringe encoding scheme in which the measurement equation is linear. Our bias-free estimators are presented in a format allowing easy implementation into current data reduction pipelines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.
