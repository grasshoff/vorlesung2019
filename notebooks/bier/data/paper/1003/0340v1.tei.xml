			<abstract>
				<p>Several authors have shown that precise measurements of transit time variations of exoplanets can be sensitive to other planetary bodies, such as exo-moons. In addition, the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest to their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory. These studies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars driven by stellar activity. In this paper we investigate and estimate the likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on timescales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-time travel effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting exoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to constraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the discovery of the first exoplanet around a solarlike star by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mayor &amp; Queloz (1995)</ref>, the exoplanet field has bloomed with over 400 currently known. While the majority of exoplanets have been discovered through radial velocity measurements of the Doppler wobble effect, it is the systems that exhibit transits that are most highly prized. These planets are crucial for determining exoplanet bulk densities (via radii and mass measurements) as well as their atmospheric properties (via infrared measurements of their day/night variations and transmission spectroscopy).</p><p>Transiting exoplanets, however, also offer the opportunity to detect other planets within the system since an additional planet may alter the period of the observed transits. This can occur in two ways. In the first case the gravitational influence of the perturbing body can can alter the orbital period of the transiting exoplanet directly. This effect is particularly strong for planets in mean motion resonances and can even allow Earth-massed objects to be detected, while 'exo-moons' orbiting the transiting planet itself also induce ⋆ E-mail: c.a.watson@qub.ac.uk a similar effect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Simon et al. 2007</ref>). In the second case, a perturbing mass in a wider orbit can cause the transiting planet / star system to wobble around the barycentre, again altering the observed transit times but by changing the light travel-time.</p><p>Although searching for transit timing variations (hereafter, TTVs) can potentially uncover the existence of Earthmass objects (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gibson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rabus et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bean 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gibson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miller-Ricci et al. 2008</ref>, and references therein for recent observational studies), there are other effects that can lead to TTVs. These include the precession of orbits due to general relativistic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pál &amp; Kocsis 2008)</ref>, tidal dissipation, torques due to the spin-induced quadrupole moment of the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miralda-Escudé 2002)</ref>, perturbations of transit times due to star spots, as well as reorientation of the planetary orbit with respect to the Earth as a result of proper motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rafikov 2009</ref>). However, there is a wealth of observations of many different eclipsing binary stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hall &amp; Kreiner 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glownia 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bond &amp; Freeth 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Warner 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baptista, Jablonski &amp; Steiner 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Echevarría &amp; Alvarez 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wolf et al. 1993</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baptista, Catalán &amp; Costa 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baptista et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baptista et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Borges et al. 2008</ref>) that have shown quasi-periodic variations in eclipse times over timescales of years to decades that are comparable to, or larger than, the effects being searched for amongst transiting exoplanets.</p><p>The favoured explanation for these observed variations in the orbital periods of eclipsing binary stars is known as the Applegate effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Applegate 1992)</ref>. This mechanism invokes magnetic activity cycles in the low-mass components of such binaries to redistribute angular momentum within the interior of the star, thereby changing the stellar quadrupole moment which leads to changes in the orbital period of the components. <ref type="bibr">Later, Lanza, Rodonó &amp; Rosner (1998)</ref> proposed that the Applegate mechanism could also be driven by effectively converting rotational kinetic energy and magnetic energy back and forth. Regardless of the details of the exact physical mechanism at work, the Applegate effect should also operate in most exoplanet systems since the host stars are (by selection) low-mass stars with a convective outer layer which should exhibit some form of dynamo activity. It will therefore be important to know the magnitude of the Applegate effect for exoplanet systems when interpreting any TTVs. In this paper we briefly review the Applegate mechanism in the next section, before applying the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref> to estimate the effects on known transiting exoplanet systems. Finally, we look at the implications that the Applegate effect has for TTV work in detecting additional planets as well as for the measurement of the level of tidal dissipation in very-hot Jupiter's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PERIOD CHANGES IN BINARY STARS -THE APPLEGATE EFFECT</head><p>Many types of binary stars show evidence for changes in their orbital periods revealed most easily through eclipse times. If a star suddenly increases its orbital period P by an amount ∆P , then the eclipses will arrive progressively later and later until, after a time T , they are delayed by an amount ∆t = T ∆P/P with respect to an ephemeris based upon the initial period. These variations can be tracked through comparison of observed times to those calculated assuming linear ephemerides via the so-called 'O − C diagrams'. The period changes observed in close binary stars have typical magnitudes of ∆P/P ∼ 10 −5 (which can take on either sign), and thus significant deviations can build up over time. One famous example is the 2.87 day-period binary Algol, which has exhibited deviations from linearity of the order of 3 hours over the 200 years it has been followed. Cataclysmic variable stars, detached white dwarf/main-sequence binaries, RS CVn stars and W UMa stars all exhibit similar variations on timescales of years to decades. These variations, which are at best quasi-periodic, are more often than not too large to be explained by long-term effects such as nuclear evolution of the stars, mass loss through winds or angular momentum loss from gravitational radiation or magnetic braking. The latter in particular struggles when confronted with orbital periods that increase as well as decrease.</p><p>Applegate &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Patterson (1987)</ref> realised that period changes in binary systems without either mass or angular momentum loss could be driven by variations in the quadrupole moment of one or both stars. Taking just one star to have a quadrupole moment Q (in the equatorial plane) and mass M then, as shown in equation 4 of Applegate (1992), its companion orbits in a gravitational potential of the form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">φ(r) = − GM r − 3 2 GQ r 3 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where r is the distance from the star. The orbital speed is given by v 2 = rdφ/dr and therefore, from equation 1, if Q increases (the star becomes more oblate) then the gravitational field in the equatorial plane of the star also increases. In order to balance for the increased gravity, the companion then requires to increase its centrifugal acceleration v 2 /r at constant angular momentum (rv is constant). Thus v must increase and r must decrease and hence the orbital period decreases. The opposite is true if Q decreases. Under this scenario, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref> showed that the resulting period changes are given by (their equation 7):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆P P = −9 R a 2 ∆Q M R 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R is the radius of the star and a is the orbital separation of the components. The common denominator in all the binaries that exhibit period variations of the type described above is that at least one of the components is a low-mass star with a convective envelope capable of sustaining a magnetic field generating dynamo. Given that the variation timescales are of the order of years to decades, stellar activity cycles are the prime candidate for effecting the changes in the stellar quadrupole moment. Models of the 1980's <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Applegate &amp; Patterson 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Warner 1988</ref>) supposed that dynamo-generated magnetic fields distorted the star from its equilibrium shape. These were criticised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marsh &amp; Pringle (1990)</ref> since such distortions leave the pressure and gravity gradients unbalanced (the star is driven from hydrostatic equilibrium). This unbalanced force needs to be balanced by the magnetic field, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marsh &amp; Pringle (1990)</ref> showed that the stars had insufficient luminosity to drive such changes on the observed timescales.</p><p>This issue was quickly resolved by Applegate (1992) where magnetic activity was still invoked to drive the Q variations but rather than forcing the star from hydrostatic equilibrium, the magnetic fields are supposed to drive angular momentum transfer within the star. For instance, if angular momentum is transported from the core to the envelope of the star, the star will become more oblate overall. This required much less energy than the earlier models since the star performs a transition from one state of hydrostatic equilibrium to another. With this model Applegate (1992) was able to explain the observed period changes in binary stars, and the Applegate effect has continued to survive the test of time apart from a few refinements (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. 1998</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ESTIMATING THE PERIOD CHANGES IN EXOPLANET SYSTEMS</head><p>The same process that occurs in binary stars will also occur in exoplanet systems in the case where the host star is magnetically active. Since the majority of exoplanet hosting stars known to date are lower main-sequence stars with convective outer layers, these stars should harbour some form of magnetic field generating stellar dynamo.</p><p>For any given energy budget (∆E), the equations of Applegate (1992) allow the magnitude of the period change,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆P P ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>to be calculated numerically which, for the sake of completeness, we outline here. Applegate (1992) adopted a simple stellar model in which a thin outer shell of mass Ms is spun up by addition of angular momentum ∆J from the interior of the star. The energy required to do this is given by his equation 28,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∆E = Ω dr ∆J + (∆J) 2 2I ef f ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Ω dr = Ωs − Ω * is the angular velocity of differential rotation between the outer shell (Ωs) and the stellar interior (Ω * ). I ef f is the effective moment of inertia given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I ef f = IsI * Is + I *<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Is and I * are the moments of inertia of the outer shell and the stellar interior, respectively. Typically, for an outer shell mass of Ms = 0.1M , Is = I * and therefore in equation 4 we can substitute 2I ef f = Is, where Is = 2/3MsR 2 .</p><p>The Ω dr term on the left-hand side of equation 4 is normally small (but see later) and can be set to zero. We can therefore re-express equation 4 as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∆E = 3 (∆J) 2 2MsR 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In the model outlined in Applegate (1992), variations in the quadrupole moment, Q, of the star are driven by the stellar activity cycle. Magnetic fields are supposed to drive the angular momentum transfer from within the star. For instance, if angular momentum is transported from the core of the star to its envelope, the star will become more oblate and its quadrupole moment will increase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref> computes the rate of change of the stellar quadrupole as a function of the angular momentum transport in his equation 26,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dQ dJ = 1 3 ΩR 3 GM (7)</formula><p>where Ω is the stellar angular rotation velocity. As outlined in Section 2, a change in the stellar quadrupole moment leads to a corresponding change in the orbital period given by equation 2, where a is the orbital separation between, in this case, the star and the planet. We now have three equations, with equation 6 relating ∆E to ∆J, equation 7 relating ∆Q to ∆J, and finally equation 2 relating ∆P to ∆Q. Given that stellar activity cycles are rather variable, there is no well-defined amplitude or period of variation to be expected from Applegate's models. The one constraint that we can invoke is a restriction on the energy budget allowed to drive the quadrupole moment. With this in mind, we can use the last 3 equations to relate the (as yet undefined) energy budget to the change in the orbital period ∆P giving,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆E = 1 6 M Ms G 2 M 3 a 4 Ω 2 R 8 ∆P P 2 (8)</formula><p>which can be rearranged to give</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆P P = √ 6 Ms M 1 2 ΩR 4 GM 3/2 a 2 (∆E) 1 2 .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>If we assume that the power available to drive the quadrupole changes is some fraction, f , of the stellar luminosity then we obtain a total energy budget of ∆E = f LT , where T is the timescale over which the quadrupole changes occur. Since stellar activity cycles tend to be of the order of years or decades (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saar &amp; Brandenburg 1999</ref>), there is potentially a large energy budget available for driving orbital period changes. If this energy is supplied by the nuclear luminosity of the star with no energy storage in the convection zone then (Applegate 1992) the star will exhibit RMS luminosity variations of</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆Lrms = π ∆E T .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We set the available energy budget such that the luminosity variations never exceed some fraction α of the total stellar luminosity. This sets our energy budget as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆E &lt; αLT π .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>While we have used luminosity variations to set our energy budget we note that such variations will be strict upper limits. Indeed, it is not clear that any luminosity changes would be observable. If the thermal timescale of the envelope is much larger than the timescale of activity cycles then the observed luminosity may hardly vary. To test this, we have examined the standard solar model (SSM) used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boothroyd &amp; Sackmann (2003)</ref> and estimated the thermal timescale of the convective envelope (the lower boundary of which we have taken to lie at a radius R = 0.713863R⊙).</p><p>For each shell in the SSM the thermal energy due to fully ionised hydrogen, helium and associated free electrons was calculated (hydrogen and helium are fully ionised except for the very uppermost regions near the photosphere). From this we determine a thermal timescale of 73,000 years for the Sun's convective envelope. This is likely to be a lower limit (but a reasonable estimate nonetheless) since we have not included the thermal energy from metals. We conclude, therefore, that any luminosity variations on the timescale of 10's or 100's of years may be damped considerably, and would be potentially unobservable. Armed with a prescription for defining the energy budget available to the star to drive ∆Q (but being aware of the possible reservations so far described), we can calculate orbital period modulations via equation 9. Following Applegate (1992), the amplitude of the orbital period mod-ulation and the amplitude of the oscillation observed in an O − C diagram are related by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∆P P = 2π O − C T<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This, combined with equation 9 and setting β = Ms/M , leads to potential O −C variations in the observed planetary transit times of the order, <ref type="bibr">(1992)</ref> showed that the period changes observed in binaries, with just one exception, can be explained assuming outer shell masses of Ms = 0.1M , and that a total energy budget of the order of 10% of the stellar luminosity is available to drive the quadrupole changes. In calculating the orbital period changes in this work we have also adopted Ms = 0.1M which sets β = 0.1 in equation 13. We have set α = 0.1, constraining the total energy budget such that any RMS luminosity variations are less than 10 per cent of the total stellar luminosity (but note our previous comments that such luminosity variations are likely to be heavily damped). From equation 11, this is a factor of π lower than the energy budgets required by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref>. We should also add that the prescription by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. (1998)</ref> is more energy efficient than that proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref>. The refinements by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. (1998)</ref> would, therefore, be able to drive larger variations than those predicted here. Indeed, quasi-periodic variations larger than those that the Applegate (1992) prescription could sustain may have been observed in a few binary systems (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brinkworth et al. 2006</ref>; Lanza 2005 and references therein).</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">δt s ≤ k Ω Ω⊙ M M⊙ − 3 2 R R⊙ 4 L L⊙ 1 2 a AU −2 T yr 3 2 (13) where k = 2.172 × 10 −4 α 1 2 β 1 2 .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applegate</head><p>Taking our conservative energy budget, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the expected O-C variations estimated from equation 13 for the parameters of 59 known transiting exoplanets. These values should be seen as an order of magnitude estimate of the Applegate effect in exoplanet systems. Stellar rotation periods are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Watson et al. (2010)</ref> where available, and have been obtained from measurements of the Ca H &amp; K emission lines. Other stellar rotation periods indicated by '∼' are deduced from projected equatorial rotation velocities, v sin i and published stellar radii from the exoplanet encyclopedia. Where only upper limits to v sin i exist we can only place lower limits on the stellar rotation periods. Where we are unable to determine a stellar rotation period we have adopted 30 days in order to derive a reasonable estimate of the amplitude of the Applegate effect assuming the star has solar-like rotation. The other parameters, stellar mass, luminosity, orbital period and orbital separation are taken/derived from the exoplanet encyclopedia.</p><p>The remaining variable in equation 13 that has not been discussed is the modulation timescale, T , which is related to the period of the stellar activity cycle. For our Sun, T could be equal to 11 or 22 years depending on the dynamo at work (see Section 4.4 for a discussion). Since, in general, most of the host stars of exoplanets are solar-like we have calculated the deviations due to the Applegate mechanism for both of these timescales. In addition, we have also calculated the variations over a 50 year modulation period since many of the orbital period variations in active binaries occur on longer timescales. The O − C variations derived assuming 11, 22 and 50 year modulation timescales are denoted δt11, δt22 and δt50, respectively.</p><p>In addition, we have calculated the angular velocity of differential rotation between the outer shell and the stellar interior as defined in equation 4. These are expressed as the fractional change in angular rotation rate ∆Ω/Ω11,22,50 over the 11, 22 or 50 year modulation period. While the additional energy required to drive this differential rotation is not included in equation 13 (since it would complicate the equation) we have included it in an additional code. For the majority of the systems in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> this extra energy requirement has little effect on the results. Only for those systems with differential rotation rates above 10 −2 does equation 13 start to break down. However, these still provide good 'order of magnitude' estimates for the amplitude of the O − C variations that may be driven by the Applegate mechanism in these systems. For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ulrich &amp; Bertello (1996)</ref> have derived an upper limit of δΩ/Ω ∼ 70 × 10 −3 over the course of the Sun's 11 year cycle.</p><p>Inspection of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that the Applegate effect can produce large, measurable transit time variations in several systems. These are generally of the order of a few seconds over 11 year modulation periods, up to minutes for systems with 50 year stellar activity periods. Given these results, we now discuss the potential implications these findings have on dynamical studies of exoplanet systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Implications for planet detections using TTVs caused by orbital perturbations by a second planet</head><p>In transiting systems, the presence of a second planet will induce variations in the transit times (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref>) and also durations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kipping 2009</ref>). The Applegate effect, however, will also produce variations in the transit times and durations since it modulates the orbital period over the course of the stellar activity cycle. While the variations due to the Applegate mechanism are at best quasiperiodic, there has been regular confusion as to whether period variations observed in some binaries are due to the presence of an orbiting third body or the Applegate mechanism (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Soydugan 2008</ref>). Similarly, in exoplanet systems, it is possible that TTVs caused by the Applegate mechanism could mimic the perturbations caused by the presence of a second planet.</p><p>To assess the possibility of confusion between TTVs caused by the Applegate effect and those from a bona-fide additional planet, we need to consider the form of the TTVs caused by the Applegate mechanism. First, the magnitude of the TTVs introduced by the Applegate mechanism drop off as a −2 (from equation 13). Thus the mechanism is only strong for transiting planets with orbital periods of a few days (which encompasses most transiting systems). Second, the Applegate effect will cause TTVs that are modulated <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Summary of the estimated O-C variations induced by the Applegate mechanism for currently known transiting exoplanets. The first 5 columns list the system name as well as the host stars' rotation period, mass, radius and luminosity. Columns 6 and 7 list the planets' orbital period and orbital separation to 4 decimal places, respectively. For stars where no constraint could be placed on the rotation period we have assumed (for demonstrative purposes) a value of 30 days and indicated these entries with an asterisk. The next columns indicate the differential surface shear and expected O-C variations for stars with modulation periods of 11, 22 and 50 years, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planet</head><p>Prot over the timescale of the stellar activity cycle, most likely over the course of years to decades. The question then becomes, are there any possible mechanisms by which a second planet can modulate the transit times of short period planets by a few seconds over the course of ∼10 years? <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref> outline a number of mechanisms by which a second planet can cause TTVs. Confusion with interior perturbing planets can be immediately rejected since the modulation of the orbital period will occur on far too short a timescale, in order to cause TTVs modulated on decade timescales requires an exterior planet on a relatively wide orbit. Furthermore, TTVs caused by an additional planet in a mean-motion resonance orbit generally drive significantly larger transit-time variations than those possible by the Applegate mechanism. However, for exterior planets on eccentric orbits with much larger orbital periods (and not in mean-motion resonance), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref> found that deviations in the transit times accumulate over the orbital period, Pout, of the outer planet to give,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">δt = µouteout ain aout 3 Pout (14)</formula><p>where µout is the star/planet mass ratio for the outer planet, eout is the eccentricity of the outer planet, and ain and aout are the orbital separations of the inner and outer planets, respectively. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the magnitude, δt, of the transit timing variations caused by the Applegate mechanism (solid lines) compared to gravitational perturbation by an exterior planet (dashed line) as a function of the orbital radius, ain, of the interior transiting planet. For the Applegate deviations we have taken the example of a solar-like host star (M * = 1M⊙, R * = 1R⊙, L * = 1L⊙) and, as before, set the parameters α = 0.1 and β = 0.1 and assumed a modulation timescale, P mod , of 11 years. We have then plotted three curves corresponding to stellar rotation rates of 5, 10 and 20 days. To calculate the maximum deviations expected as a result of gravitational perturbations by a second planet we have assumed a 13MJ exterior planet (the accepted upper mass-limit for a planet) in a highly eccentric (eout = 0.9) orbit (dashed line in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) with an orbital period of 11 years (matching the modulation period assumed in the Applegate calculation). This, therefore, represents the maximum deviations expected from a second planet. For comparison, a Jovian-mass object in a Jupiter-like orbit would cause deviations with an amplitude 1/208th that of the object considered here. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows that, for even modest stellar rotation rates, the Applegate mechanism is likely to dominate over TTVs of short period (a ≤ 0.03AU) transiting systems around solarlike stars caused by the gravitational perturbations of a second planet on a long period, non-resonant orbit. For modulation timescales longer than 11 years (corresponding to longer activity cycles or longer exterior planet orbital periods) the crossover points of the curves occurs at larger inner-planet orbital separations, scaling as ain,xover ∝ P 1/2 mod . Since the Applegate mechanism becomes less efficient as the stellar mass (and luminosity) decreases, while gravitational perturbations due to a second planet will increase (due to the µout factor in equation 14) this situation is likely to reverse for planetary systems around lower-mass host stars. Thus, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The magnitude, δt, of the transit timing variations caused by the Applegate mechanism (solid lines) compared to gravitational perturbation by an exterior planet (dashed line) as a function of the orbital radius, a in , of the interior transiting planet. The deviations caused by the Applegate mechanism assume a Sun-like host star with rotation rates (indicated on the plot) corresponding to a 5, 10 and 20 day stellar rotation period, respectively, and a modulation period P mod = 11 yrs. The dashed line represents the TTVs caused by a 13M J mass planet with an 11 year orbital period (aout = 4.95AU) on a highly eccentric (eout = 0.9) orbit.</p><p>searches for TTVs around M-dwarf stars may not only be more sensitive to the presence of planetary companions, but may also be less prone to 'confusion' with TTVs caused by the Applegate effect. (In addition, M-dwarfs may not have an appreciable dynamo mechanism to drive the Applegate effect).</p><p>We have not considered TTVs for planets in meanmotion resonance orbits which, under the right conditions, can drive significantly larger deviations than those described above. The conditions for possible confusion with the Applegate mechanism (we require long modulation timescales of years to decades and a short orbital period for the transiting planet) restricts the perturbing exterior planet to long orbital periods. The large difference between the orbital periods of the interior and exterior planets means that there will be no strong resonance between the components. Mean motion resonances are unlikely to provide significantly increased gravitational perturbations since the examples considered here have period ratios &gt;150 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beaugé et al. 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implications for planet detections using TTVs caused by light travel time effects</head><p>The presence of a second planet in a long period may also cause TTVs through the variation of the light travel time due to the reflex motion of the host-star. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deeg et al. (2000)</ref> claim tentative evidence for a Jovian mass object in the eclipsing binary CM Dra by observing this effect. For an exterior planet of mass Mp on an orbit with a semi-major axis aout, the amplitude of the timing deviation is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">δt = a c Mp M * ≈ Mp MJ aout AU ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>for a solar-mass star. These periodic variations naturally occur over a timescale equal to the orbital period of the outer planet. For a Jovian-mass object in a Jupiter-like orbit this amounts to a periodic deviation of ∼5 seconds over the course of ∼12 years. This is of a similar magnitude and timescale as those potentially driven by the Applegate effect. There is, therefore, considerable scope for confusion between TTVs caused by light travel time delays due to the presence of a second planet and those caused by the Applegate effect. The only secure means of distinguishing between these two effect is to look for strictly periodic variations since the Applegate mechanism will be quasi-periodic at best.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implications for measuring tidal dissipation</head><p>Recently a subset of exoplanets orbiting extremely close to their host stars with periods less than 1 day have been discovered. Prime examples of these are the planets WASP-18b, which was discovered to be orbiting a 1.24M⊙ star every 0.94 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hellier et al. 2009</ref>); WASP-19b (orbital period = 0.79 days; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hebb et al. 2010)</ref>; and Corot-7b (orbital period = 0.85 days; <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2009</ref>). These planets are subject to large tidal forces and can be used as tests of tidal dissipation theory. In this scenario, the close proximity of the exoplanet to the host star raises a tidal bulge on the stellar surface. This in turn exerts an additional torque which drains angular momentum from the planetary orbit for systems where the orbital period is shorter than the stellar rotation period.</p><p>In the case of WASP-18, the tidal dissipation is such that assuming a tidal quality factor D (this is normally denoted Q but we have changed this to distinguish it from the quadrupole moment used earlier) found from studies of binaries and the giant planets in our Solar System means that the planet would be tidally disrupted in ∼1 Myr. Since the system's age is ∼5 Gyr, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hellier et al. (2009)</ref> conclude that either they have caught WASP-18b in an extremely rare state, or that D is much higher than expected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hellier et al. (2009)</ref> quote a period change of -0.00073 (10 6 /D) s yr −1 . For our solar system, D = 10 5 − 10 6 leading to orbital period changes of 28 s after 10 yr for D = 10 6 . Therefore, transit timing studies of WASP-18b are vitally important since the tidal decay should be directly measurable in this system. This would allow our understanding of tidal dissipation to be tested and would also allow the stellar interior to be probed since the value of D depends on how waves generated by tides are dissipated.</p><p>The magnitude of the Applegate effect we have estimated for WASP-18 leads to O-C variations of the order of 10's of seconds on decade timescales -approximately the same as predicted due to tidal decay. Such variations could easily either mask, or mimic (briefly), or even temporarily reverse any period change caused by tidal decay, especially if the tidal quality factor is higher than 10 6 . Thus, for WASP18b, caution has to be exercised in interpreting the nature of any detected transit-time variations, since these will consist of a quasi-periodic variation on the timescale of the stellar activity cycle super-imposed on a steady trend of decreasing period due to orbital decay. Only by observing over the course of an activity cycle could one begin to reliably distinguish between the two mechanisms. Thus, WASP-18 is unlikely to reveal its tidal dissipation history (or future) for several years yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Implications for stellar dynamo theory</head><p>Finally, we discuss the use of accurate transit timing as a means to probe the nature of the magnetic field generating dynamo operating in the host stars' interior. The study of the Applegate mechanism via eclipse timings of eclipsing binaries is often confused with orbital period variations caused by angular momentum losses or exchanges. These include effects due to magnetic braking and mass transfer. We propose that transiting exoplanet systems, by comparison, provide much cleaner laboratories in which to study such effects. Furthermore, unlike in the tidally locked binary systems, exoplanet systems have the crucial ingredient of a difference between the stellar rotation period and its orbital period (the orbital period of the exoplanet). If variations are seen at a level that correlates with the predictions of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for two stars with similar orbital periods but different rotation periods, then this would provide good evidence that the Applegate mechanism is at work. Naturally, however, one should be aware that gravitational perturbations caused by an additional long-period planet in the system could initially be confused with variations due to the Applegate mechanism. Thus, the quasi-periodic nature of such variations has to be firmly established before one can be confident that such TTVs can be used to probe the stellar dynamo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. (1998)</ref> showed that different dynamo mechanisms result in different observable manifestations of the Applegate effect. If an αΩ dynamo is in operation then the quasi-cyclic orbital period modulations should occur on the same timescale as the spot coverage modulation (e.g. over 11 years in the case of our Sun). In contrast, if an α 2 Ω dynamo operates then the observed orbital period modulation should occur over a timescale twice as long as the period of the spot modulation (∼ 22 years in the case of our Sun). Given the large number of transiting exoplanet systems with host stars (with widely varying fundamental parameters such as age, rotation rate, masses etc.) that will be discovered by space-missions such as Kepler and Plato, long-term systematic monitoring for TTVs may reveal the nature of the dynamo mechanism at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have estimated the likely transit timing variations induced by changes in the quadrupole moment of the host star in transiting exoplanet systems driven by the Applegate effect. Depending on the length of the activity cycle, TTVs of several minutes are plausible for a number of the currently known transiting exoplanets. While the timescales and sizes of Applegate driven TTVs are of the wrong magnitude to be confused with TTVs driven by additional planets in mean motion resonances, there appears to be much scope for confusion with TTVs caused by light travel time effects caused by massive, Jupiter-like planets on wide orbits.</p><p>The magnitude of TTVs driven by the Applegate mechanism also grow as the star-planet separation decreases (assuming all other factors are equal). Indeed, for the shortest period transiting exoplanets, such as WASP-18b, the Applegate mechanism could potentially be mistaken for orbital period changes due to tidal dissipation. Indeed, the orbital decay due to tidal dissipation could even be temporarily reversed since the orbital period variations due to the Applegate effect can take on either sign. We therefore urge caution when interpreting TTVs, especially those that appear to be occurring on timescales of years to decades. In all cases, the clear signature that the Applegate effect is at work is that the TTVs are quasi-periodic. Only once the strict periodicity of any TTV has been ascertained should investigators be confident in their final interpretation.</p><p>Finally, an alternative mechanism for driving quasiperiodic stellar quadrupole variations (and hence orbital period variations) was put forward by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. (1998)</ref>. This rests on the principle that changes in the azimuthal magnetic field intensity can change the stellar quadrupole moment by altering the effective centrifugal acceleration, the stellar dynamo effectively interchanges magnetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. The main feature of note in this prescription is that relative changes in the angular velocity required to drive orbital period changes are a factor of 2 smaller than that required by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate (1992)</ref>. While it is difficult to assess what TTVs may be expected from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lanza et al. (1998)</ref> work, it is quite possible that nonperiodic TTVs with magnitudes exceeding those outlined in this paper could be observed. This latter point should also be taken in light of the fact that we have been very conservative (in comparison to Applegate 1992) in the energy budget we have assumed to be available for driving the stellar quadrupole variations. Indeed, as outlined earlier, quasiperiodic variations larger than those that the Applegate (1992) prescription could sustain may already have been observed in a few binary systems. Studies of the long-term trends in the transit times of short-period exoplanets could provide crucial evidence for settling may of the points above, presenting valuable insights into the working of stellar dynamos across a broad range of fundamental stellar properties.</p></div>		</body>
