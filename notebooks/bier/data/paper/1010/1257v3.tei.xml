				<p>The rapid pace of extrasolar planet discovery and characterization is legitimizing the study of their atmospheres via three-dimensional numerical simulations. The complexity of atmospheric modelling and its inherent non-linearity, together with the limited amount of data available, motivate model intercomparisons and benchmark tests. In the geophysical community , the Held-Suarez test is a standard benchmark for comparing dynamical core simulations of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere with different solvers, based on statistically-averaged flow quantities. In the present study, we perform analogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral and finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests, including the standard benchmark for Earth, a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth, a &quot;shallow&quot; hot Jupiter model and a &quot;deep&quot; model of HD 209458b. We find qualitative and quantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth and shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks, but the agreement is less than satisfactory for the deep model of HD 209458b. Further investigation reveals that closer agreement may be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal dissipation parameters in the two solvers, but it remains the case that the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation is not easily specified from first principles. Irrespective of radiative transfer or chemical composition considerations, our study points to limitations in our ability to accurately model hot Jupiter atmospheres with meteorological solvers at the level of ten percent for the temperature field and several tens of percent for the velocity field. Direct wind measurements should thus be particularly constraining for the models. Our suite of benchmark tests also provides a reference point for researchers wishing to adapt their codes to study the atmospheric circulation regimes of tidally-locked Earths/Neptunes/Jupiters.</p>

In a pair of benchmark calculations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref> demonstrated that Earth-like simulations using two different methods -spectral and finite difference solvers -produced quantitatively similar profiles of the temporally-averaged, zonal-mean temperature and zonal wind, as functions of vertical height (or pressure). Attempts have been made (e.g., <ref type="bibr">versus Cooper &amp; Showman 2006</ref>) to compare hot Jupiter models, but these were performed via different simulation platforms. In this study, we generalize Held-Suarez-type benchmarks to include tidally-locked exoplanets, using a single simulation platform -namely the dynamical cores of the Flexible Modeling System (FMS).</p><p>Our main finding is that while we can achieve qualitative and quantitative agreement for the Earth (and shallow hot Jupiter) tests, noticeable differences appear when we simulate the deep atmospheric circulation of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. Closer agreement may be attained by specifying arbitrary values for the horizontal dissipation parameters -by trial and error -but it remains the case that the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation cannot be rigorously specified. Dynamical uncertainties at the level of 10% therefore exist both between simulations utilizing different methods of solutions and also within the same method of solution, which may ultimately have implications for studies attempting to match observed versus simulated atmospheres of extrasolar planets.</p><p>Operationally, we implement both the spectral and finite difference cores of the FMS and subject them to a battery of tests, including the Held-Suarez benchmark for Earth ( §4.1), a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth ( §4.2; Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010), a "shallow" hot Jupiter model ( §4.3; Menou &amp; Rauscher 2009) and a "deep" model for HD 209458b <ref type="bibr">( §4.4;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cooper &amp; Showman 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, 2006</ref>.

Our results are collectively stated in §4 and we discuss their implications in §5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists the parameters and commonly used symbols in our study, while <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> describes the resolutions of the simulations. Appendices A, B and C contain technical details and useful fitting functions relevant to simulating the atmospheric circulation on the hot Jupiter HD 209458b.</p><p>which results in a set of equations known as the "primitive 1 equations of meteorology" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Smagorinsky 1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Smagorinsky , 1964</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 3 of Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 2 of Vallis 2006</ref>). The first simplification involves the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂P ∂z = −ρg ⇐⇒ ∂φ ∂ ln P = −RT,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P denotes the pressure, z is the vertical/radial coordinate, ρ is the mass density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to the gravity of the planet, φ ≡ gz is the geopotential, R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature. The hydrostatic approximation filters out vertically propagating sound waves, but allows for vertically propagating gravity and Rossby waves as well as horizontally propagating waves in general. On large scales, hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation because the vertical pressure scale height H is much less than the planetary radius Rp,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H Rp = kBT ¯ mgRp ≈ 6 × 10 −3 T 1000 K ¯ m 2mH g 10 m s −2 Rp RJ −1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where kB is the Boltzmann constant, ¯ m is the mean molecular mass, mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom and RJ ≈ 71492 km is the (mean) radius of Jupiter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE GFDL-PRINCETON FLEXIBLE MODELING SYSTEM</head><p>The Flexible Modeling System (FMS) is an open source, parallel simulation platform developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of Princeton University. The FMS has three core options: finite difference, spectral and finite volume. In this study, we implement the Memphis release of FMS and utilize both the spectral and finite difference ("B-grid") 2 dynamical cores. As the FMS utilizes MKS units, some of the discussion in the paper will follow suit. In this section, we describe some salient features of the FMS.</p><p>Readers interested in more technical details may consult http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms. For an overview of the various simulation platforms which are publicly available, please refer to Chapter 5 of <ref type="bibr">Washington &amp; Parkinson (2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Spectral Core</head><p>In the spectral 3 dynamical core of the FMS, the hydrodynamic variables are described as a sum of spherical harmonics truncated at N h terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gordon &amp; Stern 1982)</ref>. Triangular truncation is used in our implementation of the FMS, such that the truncation is rotationally symmetric -a function and its rotated counterpart are both expressible within this truncation (see §13.6.2 of Holton 2004). On a sphere, the number of zonal and meridional waves retained are N h and N h + 1, respectively, to prevent aliasing. The corresponding number of longitudinal grid points (N lon ) is always twice that of the latitudinal grid points (N lat ). Domain decomposition is 1D in the spectral core: the number of processors allocatable to computing a given model is N lat /2.</p><p>A key aspect of any spectral model is spectral blocking, which is the accumulation of numerical noise -specifically, enstrophy -at the smallest grid scales, since spectral codes are intrinsically non-dissipative <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stephenson 1994)</ref>. Numerical "hyperviscosity" is needed to mimick enstrophy dissipation at the smallest length scales, analogous to a two-dimensional turbulent cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shapiro 1971</ref>). The hyperviscous term takes the form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D hyper = −ν (−1) nν ∇ 2nν (∇ × v) z ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where nν is the hyperviscosity damping order and (∇ × v)z is the relative vorticity. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Menou &amp; Rauscher (2009)</ref> and , we adopt nν = 4. Within the FMS, one may either specify the hyperviscosity coefficient (ν) or the dissipation rate (∼ ν∇ 2nν ); we will discuss this issue further in §3.3. The spectral core has an optional switch to ensure global energy conservation, which we enforce for all of our simulations. The conventional shorthand notation used to describe the resolution of the spectral models is TN h LNv, where N h is the horizontal resolution while Nv is the number of vertical levels. The fiducial resolution we will adopt for our spectral simulations is T63, which corresponds to N lon = 192 and N lat = 96. Finite differencing is used for the vertical grid by employing the Simmons-Burridge scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Simmons &amp; Burridge 1981)</ref>. For example, the lowest layer modelled within such a scheme has σ = 0.95-1; the boundaries between the layer are called the "half levels" (i.e., σ = 0.95 and 1). A noteworthy feature of the Simmons-Burridge scheme is that the simulation output is not exactly at the midpoint between the half levels (i.e., not at σ = 0.975 in this example). Therefore, it should be noted that when we present our results, we usually quote the pressure level P as the larger of the pair of half level values (e.g., for P = 0.95-1 bar layer, we label it "P = 1 bar").</p><p>A key advantage of the spectral method described here is that it does not require special (damping) treatment at the poles. This is not the case for the finite difference core.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Finite Difference Core</head><p>The finite difference dynamical core of the FMS uses a "Arakawa B-grid" (see Chapter 4.2 of <ref type="bibr">Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005</ref>) for the horizontal coordinates, which belongs to a family of finite difference grids where the temperature and velocity are solved at staggered points <ref type="bibr">(Wyman 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al. 2004</ref>). The vertical grid uses a hybrid σ-P coordinate system; the labelling of the different model layers again follows the larger of the pair of half level values (see §3.1). Finite differencing is used for both the horizontal and vertical grids. Analogous to the case of the spectral core, small-scale noise accumulates in the B-grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shapiro 1970</ref>) and has to be damped via a "horizontal mixing" 4 algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Roeckner &amp; von Storch 1980)</ref>. In the finite difference core, the second-order operator for horizontal mixing is defined asˆH</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">asˆ asˆH (F) = 1 AF ∆Pj i ˆ Ii Kî Ii (F) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where F denotes the temperature or zonal/meridional velocity components (i.e., T or v), AF is the area of each grid box (for either the temperature or velocity fields),</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Ki ≡ K ∆î Ji (AF ) ˆ Ji (∆Pj ) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>and the index i = Φ, Θ. Denoting an arbitrary quantity by Q, the operatorsˆIioperatorsˆ operatorsˆIi(Q) andˆJiandˆ andˆJi(Q) yield the difference and average between adjacent grid points along the i-axis, respectively. The difference in pressure between half-levels at an index j is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆Pj ≡ P j+1/2 − P j−1/2 .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The quantity ∆i is a constant that describes the strength of the horizontal mixing with latitude and must satisfy the numerical stability condition: ∆iK 1/8. It is important to note that the operator defined in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(8)</ref> is essentially a Laplacian and is applied twice to the Atmospheric circulation of tidally-locked exoplanets 5 temperature and velocity fields,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂F ∂t ≈ − 1 ∆tˆHˆH ∆tˆ ∆tˆH ∆tˆHˆ ∆tˆHˆH (F) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ∆t denotes the time step, implying that the horizontal mixing scheme is fourth order in nature. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The horizontal mixing coefficient has a range of values of 0 K 1. Its default value within the FMS is K = 0.35, which we will adopt throughout unless otherwise stated. Damping is increased for |Φ| &gt; 80 • but is uniform with longitude. The common problem faced by any finite difference code which solves the fluid equations on a sphere using the longitude-latitude coordinate system is that, for numerical convergence to be attained, the minimum time step needed is proportional to the zonal grid spacing ∆Θ via the Courant-Fredricks-Levy (CFL) condition. This implies that ∆t → 0 towards the poles. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dobbs-Dixon et al. (2010)</ref> truncate their latitudinal grid at Φ = ±70 • in their simulations. To alleviate this problem, a technique known as "polar filtering" is applied at high latitudes to damp the shortest resolvable waves such that a non-zero time step can be taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shapiro 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asselin 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Takacs &amp; Balgovind 1983)</ref>. Like in the spectral core, the finite difference core has a switch to ensure global energy conservation, which we set to "on" for all of our simulations. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The shorthand notation used for resolution is GN h LNv where N h now refers to half of the number of grid points in longitude (i.e., around a latitude circle). Alternatively, one can use the notation NN ′ h LNv where N ′ h is the number of latitudinal points between the north/south pole and equator. Domain decomposition is 2D in the finite difference core. The fiducial resolution for our finite difference simulations is G72/N45, which corresponds to N lon = 144 and N lat =90.</p><p>Finally, we note that an alternative approach within grid-based methods is to adopt a "cubed-sphere" grid, which circumvents the problems at the poles at the price of dealing with a non-orthogonal grid (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adcroft et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Showman et al. 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Horizontal Dissipation</head><p>It is important to note that the horizontal dissipation schemes described above are reasonably well-motivated but nevertheless nonrigourous. Hyperviscosity and horizontal mixing are numerical tools unsupported by any fundamental physical theory, yet are routinely used by research groups studying terrestrial and exoplanetary atmospheric circulation. There is no rigourous way to choose their magnitudes. On Earth, the magnitude of horizontal dissipation can be calibrated on the basis of the known flow, but this is not (yet) -and may never bethe case for extrasolar planets. The use of horizontal dissipation is related to the notion that turbulent cascades of hydrodynamical quantities (energy, enstrophy) are only partially modelled. As such, both ν and K should be regarded as free parameters in any model of atmospheric circulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stephenson 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In practice, the pragmatic aim is to dissipate small-scale numerical noise within a fraction of a planetary rotation (i.e., one day on a tidally-locked planet). For the spectral core, the dissipation time on the scale of a resolution element is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">tν ∼ 1 ν Rp N lat 2nν ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where nν = 4 is usually adopted. Spectral simulations with smaller values of tν are generally more dissipative. To meaningfully compare spectral simulations with different numerical resolutions, we need to keep the hyperviscosity ν fixed by using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> to scale the dissipation rate 7 assumed,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">t −1 ν = N lat 96 8 t −1 ν,T63 .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>For example, the dissipation rate used in the T63L33 run, for the deep model of HD 209458b, is t −1 ν,T63 ≈ 0.33 s −1 (≈ 10 −5 HD 209458b day). Therefore, a T31L33 run would use tν ≈ 3 × 10 −3 HD 209458b day. Within the FMS, specifying the dissipation rate as an input parameter is thus termed a "resolution dependent" run. Alternatively, specifying the hyperviscosity ν constitutes a "resolution independent" run. In general, we find that dealing with a dissipation rate (with units of s −1 ) is somewhat more intuitive than having to vary ν (with units of m 8 s −1 ).</p><p>In the original <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref> T63L20 (N lat = 96) spectral simulations, the dissipation rate was chosen to be 1. day. For our Earth-like simulations, we choose tν = 0.1 day following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref>. For our hot Jupiter simulations, we choose  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">&amp; Suarez (1994)</ref>; HMP G24 48×30 tν = 10 −5 hot Jupiter day such that to within a factor of a few, our chosen value for tν is consistent with those used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Menou &amp; Rauscher (2009)</ref> and . <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists our choices for t −1 ν , which were made to match the values in the original publications as closely as possible, while bearing in mind that all of these choices have no strict justification beyond the requirement that the model can be integrated without the detrimental accumulation of small-scale noise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(7.5 • , 6.0 • ) HMP G36 72×45 (5.0 • , 4.0 • ) Cooper &amp; Showman (2005, 2006); HMP G48 96×60 (3.75 • , 3.0 • ) - G72 144×90 (2.5 • , 2.0 • ) Held &amp;</formula><p>For the finite difference (B-grid) core, the horizontal mixing coefficient K plays the analogous role of tν -and not ν -in the spectral core (see Appendix C). Its default value within the FMS is K = 0.35, which we adopt unless otherwise stated. Varying K is in effect changing the value of the analogue of tν. Conversely, keeping K fixed and varying the resolution of the simulation effectively varies the value of the analogue of ν. We are unable to write down a simple analytical expression relating K and ν, but note that it is possible to measure the analogue of tν in a finite difference simulation (see Appendix C). While a correspondence between the dissipation parameters in the spectral and finite difference cores may exist, we do not consider it to be straightforward. Our main intention is to demonstrate that it is possible to find equivalent pairs of values for tν (or ν) and K by trial and error (see §4.4), which has implications for researchers wishing to adapt existing simulation platforms implementing different solution methods (and numerical dissipation schemes) to study the atmospheric circulation on exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Initial Conditions</head><p>The default initialization in both the spectral and finite difference cores uses the simplest assumption: isothermality with no wind. Every temperature point on the solution grid is set to T = Tinit where Tinit is an initial temperature and may be regarded as a free parameter. The tests we will describe in §4 use values of Tinit which are tabulated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We will see that the active (τ −1 rad = 0) layers of the atmosphere, where the temperature rapidly relaxes towards Teq, are somewhat insensitive to the choice of Tinit and produce results that are broadly consistent with previous studies. The simulations are started with a small initial perturbation in the vorticity field. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Thrastarson &amp; Cho (2010)</ref> have argued that initializing the simulations with non-zero winds can produce both qualitative and quantitative differences in the results, because the applied thermal forcing is projected differently onto the normal modes of the atmosphere under different initial wind conditions. We consider this issue to be beyond the scope of the present study.</p></div>

The temperature difference between the night and day sides, ∆Teq, is set equal to 1000 K for P 1 mbar and 530 K at P = 10 bar. In between, ∆Teq is equally spaced at uniform intervals in log P . Our polynomial fits for T night and T day are given in Appendix B. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows the radiative relaxation time and thermal forcing function used in our simulations of HD 209458b. The initial temperature is set to TIro(P = 10 bar) = 1759 K, which is the value of Teq at P = 10 bar. Our use of a constant initial temperature is simpler than what  implement, which is Tinit = T night for P &lt; 10 bar and Tinit = TIro otherwise. In their T31L33 simulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Menou &amp; Rauscher (2009)</ref> used N lat = 48 such that small-scale numerical noise is dissipated on a time scale tν ∼ 9 × 10 −4 HD 209458b day. For the spectral simulations, we set the dissipation rate to be exactly t −1 ν = 0.32785918 s −1 (tν = 10 −5 HD 209458b day) which is consistent with the  value (to within a factor of a few) if the scaling relation in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> is considered. For the finite difference simulations, we initially adopt K = 0.35 for the horizontal mixing coefficient. We will explore variations in tν and K as well as in N h and Nv. The hyperviscosity ν is kept fixed such that the dissipation time varies and scales up when the resolution coarsens (see equation <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>). Colors indicate temperature in K, while arrows represent the velocity vectors. In these plots, the color bar range is fixed for clarity of comparison. mbar, a chevron-shaped feature is displaced eastwards of the substellar point and should be compared to the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> of . At P = 4.69 bar (bottom left panel), the advective time scales start to become shorter than τ rad , resulting in the longitudinal homogenization of temperature. At P = 21.9 bar (bottom right panel), the equatorial wind becomes more counter-rotating than super-rotating, partly as a result of the conservation of total angular momentum (which is set by starting the simulation from a windless initial state, in the absence of drag). Overall, there is a good degree of qualitative and quantitative agreement between our computed flow fields and those presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 1 and 2</ref> of , despite the snapshots being taken at different times. However, some discrepancies remain: the velocity features in our simulations are stronger at the various vertical heights; the temperature ranges are discrepant from those shown in , especially at P = 2.13 and 216 mbar. Figure 9 focuses on the P = 216 mbar snapshot at about 340 HD 209458b days, but for six different simulation resolutions: T21L33, T21L66, T31L33, T31L66, T63L33 and T63L66. We note that P ∼ 0.1 bar is the pressure/height at which the infrared emission emerges and where the stratosphere (if any) begins. Details concerning the numerical resolution are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. In general, the chevron-shaped flow feature is seen at all six resolutions -its substructure shows up in all of the simulations and is (expectedly) most clearly visible at T63. There are hints that the details of the flow, such as zonal wind speed, depend on the simulation resolution. The same conclusions may be drawn from the finite difference simulations presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref>, but we note that comparing B-grid simulations at different resolutions, with the same value of K, may not constitute a fair exercise (see Appendix C). In other words, <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> displays results from spectral simulations which are equally dissipative (same value of ν) and at progressively finer resolutions, whereas <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> shows results from finite difference simulations which are more dissipative (numerically viscous) at lower resolutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Results</head><p>Other points deserve to be emphasized. Firstly, the spectral simulations manifestly capture the details of fine flow features better than  the finite difference simulations, which is likely because the latter (with K = 0.35) are more dissipative than the former (with tν = 10 −5 HD 209458b day). Secondly, there are clear qualitative differences between the snapshots from the spectral and finite difference simulations, which show ∼ 10% variations in the temperature field. The third point concerns model variations and the level of variability in the temperature field at P = 216 mbar, which we illustrate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>. For the spectral simulations (left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>), it is apparent that there are ∼ 10% variations in the temperature field as a function of time and the magnitudes of the variations are roughly equal across resolution (T21-T63). For the finite difference simulations (right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>), the G72 simulations also show ∼ 10% variations in the temperature field c 2018 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-23 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref>. Maximum values of the temporally averaged, zonal-mean zonal wind speeds, from different simulations, as functions of the vertical pressure, for various magnitudes of the horizontal dissipation. Here, "day" refers to one HD 209458b day which is about 3.5 Earth days. at P = 216 mbar whereas the G24 and G36 simulations show less variation, consistent with our earlier statement that the latter simulations are more dissipative (compared to their G72 counterpart). It is worth noting that numerical noise may contribute to these variations and thus complicate the comparisons. The level of variability present and its dependence on the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation applied will have implications for the study of variability in these model atmospheres for hot Jupiters. The discrepancies in the predicted temperature fields may be due to the different temporal evolutions within each simulation -even a pair of identical models seeded with slightly different (and random) initial perturbations may lead to different temporal evolutions. Furthermore, the time taken to reach quasi-equilibrium is different for each method of solution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> shows the usual Held-Suarez statistics for HD 209458b. The temporally-averaged, zonal-mean zonal wind profiles depict an equatorial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> should be compared to <ref type="bibr">Figure 3 of Rauscher &amp; Menou (2010)</ref>. While the temporally averaged and zonal-mean temperatures are not presented in , we still present these figures (bottom row) for comparison between the spectral and finite difference simulations. The temperature profiles between our pair of simulations are in good agreement. The similarity of the temperature profiles indicates that we have chosen t discard (=200 Earth days) to be sufficiently large, such that differences due to initialization have been erased. However, noticeable differences exist particularly with respect to the wind field -the maximum speed of the equatorial, super-rotating wind is about 5 km s −1 in the finite difference simulation, but is only about 3.6 km s −1 in the spectral simulation.</p><note type="other">, super-rotating wind down to ∼ 10 bar, flanked by counter-rotating jets at mid-latitude. Wind speeds have typical magnitudes ∼ 1 km s −1 . The top row of</note><p>The discrepancies in the predictions for the zonal wind profile and the maximum speed of the super-rotating jet motivate us to explore the issue further by varying the values of tν and K -the magnitude of horizontal dissipation (see §3.3) -and subsequently varying the simulation resolution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> shows T63L33 and G72L33 simulations with various values of tν = 10 −7 -10 −3 HD 209458b day and K = 0.1-1, respectively. We note that K = 1 is not used in normal circumstances, except near the poles to prevent the numerical problems previously described. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The key point is that there are 10% uncertainties associated with the predictions for the zonal wind profiles within each method of solution and also between them. The wind profile from the finite difference simulation with K = 0.9 appears to approximately match that from the spectral simulation with tν = 10 −6 HD 209458b day. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> shows the Held-Suarez statistics with these adjusted values of the horizontal dissipation parameters -it is clear that there is now closer agreement between the pairs of simulations, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 13 and 14</ref> demonstrate that one can, by trial and error, obtain consistent results for arbitrarily adjusted values of tν and K, but there is still no rigorous way to choose these dissipation times/rates.</p><p>To investigate the effects of varying the numerical resolution, we revert to the fiducial values of K and the hyperviscosity ν for the finite difference and spectral simulations, respectively. Keeping ν constant while varying the resolution results in the variation of the numerical dissipation time/rate, thus allowing the spectral simulations to be compared on an equal footing (see equation <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>). However, keeping K at a fixed value is strictly speaking analogous to varying ν (see Appendix C), so examining finite difference simulations at different resolutions, with the same value of K, may not constitute a fair comparison. Nevertheless, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> the results of our resolution studies from both the spectral and finite difference simulations, where we record the maximum speed of the temporally averaged, zonal-mean zonal wind as a function of P . For the spectral simulations, there is a spread of about 50% in the predicted wind speeds. The T31 and T63 simulations agree reasonably well with one another at a given vertical resolution (L33 or L66), whereas the wind speed predictions from the T21 simulations are discrepant with the T31 and T63 ones, suggesting that the T21 simulations are under-resolved. For the finite difference simulations, the predictions for the wind speeds are also in agreement at a given vertical resolution (L33 versus L66). Simulations with lower horizontal resolution predict lower wind speeds, consistent with our earlier statement that they are more dissipative (at a fixed value of K). Nevertheless, the depth at which the super-rotating wind is the fastest is a robust feature of the simulations, occurring at about 0.05 bar in the finite difference simulations (versus about 0.08 in the corresponding set of spectral simulations).</p><p>We note that inter-comparison of the results between each panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> does not constitute a fair exercise, because the assumed magnitude of horizontal dissipation is different for each suite of simulations. Even the intra-comparison of results within the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> may not be straightforward, because as we discussed previously keeping K fixed while varying the resolution in effect changes the analogue of the hyperviscosity, but we do not know of a clear way of varying K in a "resolution independent" manner (see Appendix C). The best we can conclude from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> is that the predictions for the maximum zonal wind speed, from both the spectral and finite difference simulations, are resolution-dependent. In tandem with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref>, one may also conclude that since the specification of horizontal dissipation is a more lucid endeavour within the spectral core, comparing results from the spectral and finite difference simulations should only be performed when Held-Suarez statistics from the latter are calibrated to match those produced by the former. In this sense, the spectral simulations are more robust.</p><p>We conclude that while we have achieved a rather satisfactory level of agreement between our spectral and finite difference simulations of HD 209458b, discrepancies arise in the quantitative predictions which may limit our ability to accurately model these extreme atmospheres, especially in terms of wind speeds. The main lessons we learn are that there are ∼ 10% uncertainties associated with the temperature field and 10% uncertainties associated with the velocity field, due to the choice of the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation as well as the resolution of the simulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Broader Implications</head><p>Using a single and consistent simulation platform, we have performed a suite of benchmark tests concerning the atmospheric circulation of Earth and tidally-locked extrasolar planets. We find that while the dynamical cores of the FMS produce qualitative and quantitative agreement for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth and shallow hot Jupiter tests, the agreement is less than satisfactory for a deep model of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. Further investigation reveals that closer agreement can be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal dissipation parameters in the two dynamical cores, but there is no rigorous way to pick the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation in these models.</p><p>Our findings suggest that even without dealing with additional physics such as radiative transfer or atmospheric chemistry, discrepancies in the temperature and velocity fields, at the level of 10% and several tens of percent respectively, already exist for the dynamics alone. In this context, direct measurements of wind velocity in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, as recently reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Snellen et al. (2010)</ref>, are important as they could prove to be particularly constraining for the models.</p><p>In general, weakly-dissipative spectral simulations are expected to be sensitive to the choice of horizontal dissipation parameter (tν), in the sense that they tend to fail as a result of small-scale noise accumulation ("spectral blocking") if the horizontal dissipation is not chosen to be strong enough. Therefore, to the extent that spectral simulations with the largest possible value of tν (i.e., the weakest possible horizontal dissipation) are more trustworthy -as conventional wisdom would suggest -our findings could also be interpreted as indicating that results in the literature based on finite difference methods may somewhat over-estimate the magnitude of wind speeds in hot Jupiter atmospheres (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13)</ref>. However, until the nature of horizontal dissipation in these atmospheres is better understood (e.g., Goodman 2009), one should probably not interpret these trends as more than suggestive.</p><p>Operationally, our suite of benchmark tests provides a reference for researchers wishing to adapt their codes to simulate atmospheric circulation on tidally-locked extrasolar planets, regardless of whether the codes solve the primitive or full Navier-Stokes equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Summary</head><p>The salient points of our study are:</p><p>• We have generalized the Held-Suarez dynamical benchmark for Earth to include tidally-locked exoplanets using a single simulation platform (the FMS). Our suite of benchmark tests provides a reference for researchers wishing to adapt their codes to study atmospheric circulation on tidally-locked Earths/Neptunes/Jupiters.</p><p>• We have found that the differences in the HD 209458b simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cooper &amp; Showman (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, 2006</ref>) and Rauscher &amp; Menou (2010) are probably due to initial/boundary conditions and setup, and not due to the method of solution utilized.</p><p>• Qualitative and quantitative agreement between the spectral and finite difference simulations of the deep-atmosphere benchmark test for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b can be attained if arbitrarily adjusted values of the horizontal dissipation parameters are adopted. However, the difficulty remains that the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation cannot (yet) be specified from first principles. This in turn leads to dynamical uncertainties at the level of 10% which limit our ability to accurately model these atmospheres, especially with respect to wind velocities. Direct wind measurements from transit observations of extrasolar planets should thus be particularly constraining for the models. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: IMPLEMENTING UNEVEN VERTICAL LEVELS</head><p>The ability to perform dynamical core simulations with arbitrary spacing of the vertical levels comes as a default in the FMS, accomplished using the following prescription:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ζ = 1 − (i − 1) /Nv, ˜ ζ = Aζ + (1 − A) ζ B , σ = exp − ˜ ζC ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>where the index i runs from 1 to Nv + 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C: E-FOLDING TIME FOR DECAY OF INITIAL GRID-SCALE NOISE (B-GRID CORE)</head><p>A plausible way of determining the analogue of the numerical dissipation time tν (for the spectral core) in the case of the finite difference core -we shall denote this by tK -is to turn off all of the dynamical terms in the simulation except for damping and record the e-folding time for initial grid-scale noise (in velocity) to decay away. For completeness, we perform this task for a horizontal mixing scheme of both second and fourth order in wind, while retaining a fourth order temperature scheme at all times. Note that the simulation results presented in the paper are all associated with a fourth order scheme in both wind and temperature. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure C1</ref> shows our measurements of tK as a function of the horizontal mixing coefficient K. As expected, the horizontal mixing scheme of second order in wind is more dissipative (smaller tK values) than the fourth order one. For convenience, we provide fitting functions to these results: </p><p>The fits are valid for 0.1 K 0.95 and only for the deep model of HD 209458b (cf. §4.4 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). For example, with the wind scheme being fourth order, we get tK ≈ 3 × 10 −3 HD 209458b day for the fiducial value of K = 0.35.</p><p>It is important to note that the measurements of tK are identical for the G24, G36 and G72 simulations, implying that K is strictly speaking the analogue of the dissipation time tν and not the hyperviscosity ν, further implying that comparing spectral and finite difference simulations with different values of K and tν ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13)</ref> is a meaningful exercise. Within the FMS, specifying K constitutes a "resolution dependent" approach in that the smallest resolvable waves in the simulation are damped with a strength that is equal for every resolution. Unfortunately, there is no way within the FMS B-grid core (Memphis release) to switch to a "resolution independent" approach of specifying the magnitude of horizontal mixing, unlike in the case of the spectral core. It is also not clear how to convert K into a quantity that is the true analogue of the hyperviscosity. The implication is that comparing simulations at different resolutions, with the same value of K, may not be a fair exercise since the analogue of the hyperviscosity is different in each of these runs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> and the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref>).</p><p>Even if we take <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure C1</ref> at face value, the correspondence between tν and tK is not straightforward. For example, the pair of simulations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> use tν = 10 −6 HD 209458b day and K = 0.9, but <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure C1</ref> informs us that K = 0.9 corresponds to tK ≈ 4 × 10 −4 HD 209458b day (using the horiziontal mixing scheme of fourth order in wind). If we insist on matching the K = 0.9 simulation with the tν = 10 −5 -10 −4 HD 209458 day simulations, then <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> informs us that we are now faced with the original problem of the predictions for the maximum zonal wind speeds being discrepant.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>15741 × 10 −4 s −1 which corresponds to a dissipation time of about 0.1 Earth day.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> From a historical viewpoint, the term &quot;primitive&quot; is a misnomer, since it means &quot;full&quot; rather than &quot;simple&quot; (see Chapter 3.2 of Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005). 2 We note that the B-grid finite difference scheme is an old one and is known to be less accurate than the more commonly-used &quot;C-grid&quot; scheme, e.g., as employed by Held &amp; Suarez (1994), Cooper &amp; Showman (2005, 2006) and Showman et al. (2009). c 2018 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-23 4 Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Strictly speaking, the code is pseudo-spectral because only the linear terms in the governing equations are transformed to the spectral domain, while the non-linear terms are computed on a finite difference grid. This statement is independent of the method of solution for the vertical coordinate. 4 Also termed &quot;horizontal diffusion&quot;.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> The Memphis release of the FMS uses defaults of second and fourth order for the wind and temperature horizontal mixing schemes, respectively. We have performed two separate suites of simulations where the wind scheme is set to second or fourth order and find little difference between the Held-Suarez statistics generated. 6 We note that the application of horizontal mixing and polar filtering result in small violations to the conservation of mass and energy. 7 From an operational standpoint, we note that when the dissipation rate is too small, the simulations will crash even when very small time steps (e.g., ∆t = 1 s) are taken. Therefore, there is a practical upper limit to the value of tν assumed. c 2018 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-23 6 Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> We also examined a simulation with no horizontal mixing applied (K = 0), which did not complete successfully (produced multiple output values of NaNs). c 2018 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-23</note>
