				<p>Context. CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its high mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet&apos;s parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with with spots covering a large fraction (7-20%) of its visible surface. Aims. We attempt to constrain the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet&apos;s inferred large size may be caused a systematic error in the inferred parameters, and if not, how it can be explained. Methods. We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results. We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would cause a ∼ 10% reduction in size of the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main-sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67 ± 0.13 M J , a radius of 1.55 ± 0.03 R J for an age that is at least 130 Ma and should be younger than 500 Ma given the star&apos;s rapid rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, for which the planet&apos;s mass is 3.45 ± 0.27 M J and its radius is 1.50 ± 0.06 R J for an age of 30 to 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation of the planet&apos;s size that can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, if the atmospheric opacities are larger by a factor of ∼ 3 than usually assumed for solar composition atmospheres. Other solutions imply that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago, i.e., a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system that caused a significant rise in the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions. Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help us to understand this system include searches for an infrared excess, a debris disk, and additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet&apos;s atmospheric properties and determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors caused by stellar activity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>CoRoT-2b is the second transiting planet discovered by the space mission CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bouchy et al. 2008)</ref>. It is noteworthy because of its relatively large mass and large size. As such, it belongs to the class of anomalously large extrasolar giant planets, i.e. planets that are larger than predicted by standard theoretical models for the evolution of an irradiated, solarcomposition gas giant ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Guillot et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Anomalously large planets require additional heat sources (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bodenheimer et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Guillot et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>) to explain their radii. It is now clear that these objects are common, representing about half of the presently known transiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guillot 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller et al. 2009</ref>). However the properties of CoRoT-2b are probably the most difficult to explain: it has one of the largest radius anomalies (defined as the difference between observed and modeled for a solar-composition irradiated planet), and yet is massive, meaning that modifying its evolution to slow its contraction is difficult and requires significant deviations from the standard models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Send offprint requests to: T. Guillot</head><p>Secondary transits of CoRoT-2b have been detected by several instruments providing puzzling results: Measured brightness temperatures have been found to vary from 1325±180 K at 8 µm to 1805 ± 70 K at 4.5 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010)</ref>, and up to 2170 ± 50 K in the visible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alonso et al. 2010b</ref>), significantly higher than the zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of the planet 1530 ± 140 K.</p><p>The star CoRoT-2 is also remarkable because of its unusual variability and spot coverage: analyses of the CoRoT lightcurve for this system -spanning 152 days of nearlycontinuous observations-led to a precise determination of the star's rotation period, 4.52 ± 0.14 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lanza et al. 2009)</ref>, and estimates of the spot coverage that range between 7% and 20%, for a spot contrast of between ∼ 0.3 and 0.7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lanza et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Silva-Valio et al. 2010</ref>). The spot coverage (i.e. the fraction of the stellar surface that is occupied by starspots) may even locally reach 37% for a contrast of 0.7 (similar to the average value for sunspots) at the latitudes where the planetary eclipses occur ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Could the peculiarities of the star account for the unusually large inferred size of the planet or do we require additional heat sources in the planet? We address this question by first revisiting the star's evolution by accounting for the presence of spots (Sect. 2), then applying these results to planetary evolution models (Sect. 3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Constraints derived from spectroscopic and transit photometry analyses</head><p>The star CoRoT-2 has been identified as a G7 dwarf of solar composition by spectroscopic analyses. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists its known physical properties inferred from spectroscopy, radial velocimetry, and the analysis of its transit lightcurve. The effective temperature of CoRoT-2 differs slightly between measurements: <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bouchy et al. (2008)</ref> report a low value from H α bands and relatively low signal-to-noise HARPS spectra, and a high value, also from HARPS but using Fe spectral lines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ammler-von Eiff et al. (2009)</ref> essentially confirm this last value with Fe lines and UVES, but with a smaller error bar (which does not however include systematic effects).</p><p>The spectral determination of the star's gravity is, as commonly found for stars, quite uncertain. Measurements inferred from HARPS and UVES data differ slightly, there being one σ error bars that barely overlap.</p><p>As is typical of a star with a transiting planet, the most stringent constraint is that on the stellar density. For CoRoT-2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref> are able to determine the duration of the transit so precisely that the stellar density is constrained to within only 1.4%.</p><p>Given these measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref> infer planetary parameters, M p = 3.31 ± 0.16 M J and R p = 1.465 ± 0.029 R J . This implies that CoRoT-2b is extremely inflated even relative to other large transiting planets. Before we attempt to model it, we estimate the accuracy to which the stellar parameters can really be derived. For example, this initial estimate by Alonso et al. assumes a circular orbit and no influence by spots on the photometric determination.</p><p>A subsequent analysis of the CoRoT-2 lightcurves <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Czesla et al. 2009)</ref> shows that the presence of spots during the transits affects the photometry and in particular the depth k 2 of the transits: when the planet transits, it occasionally occults star spots, thereby blocking a smaller fraction of the stellar light. On average, the transits appear less deep than for a star without spots, implying that the planetary radius is underestimated when neglecting the effect of spots.</p><p>The effect of a non-zero eccentricity is to modify the relation between transit duration and stellar density in a non-trivial way relative to a circular orbit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tingley &amp; Sackett 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref> refined the analysis of Alonso et al. using constraints on the eccentricity and argument of the periastron from the radial velocity data within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. They found that solutions with a slight eccentricity (e ∼ 0.015) are more likely and thus inferred a lower stellar density ρ and a slightly smaller value of k.</p><p>Most of the parameters used for this work are based on the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref> (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). However, to account for the effect of spots on the transit depths, and because the Czesla et al. (2009) study did not allow for the possibility of an eccentric planet, we choose to derive a probable value of k that accounts for both spots and a non-circular orbit by a simple proportionality relation between the different studies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k = k Czesla /k Alonso × k Gillon .</formula><p>The error bar in k is calculated to be the quadratic mean between the values of k found by the Czesla et al. and Gillon et al. studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Evolution models</head><p>Stellar evolution models are needed to derive the star's and planet's masses and radii. In most of this work, we use a grid of quasi-static evolutions for stars with masses between 0.6 and 1.3 M (∆M = 0.005M ) calculated with the CESAM evolution code <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Morel &amp; Lebreton 2008)</ref>. The grid has been calibrated with respect to the Sun, which is most accurately described (&lt; 10 −4 relative precision) by mass fractions of hydrogen X = 0.7065, helium Y = 0.2740, and heavy elements Z = 0.0195, based on the actual Z/X = 0.0245 ratio of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Grevesse &amp; Noels (1993)</ref>, and spectroscopic parameters T eff, = 5778 K, and L = 3.846 × 10 26 W for an age of 4.57 Ga. A standard mixing-length approach without overshooting is used in the energy transport equation. Our calibrated Sun has a mixing length parameter α = 2.052. The atmospheric boundary is calculated using a T (τ) relation derived from MARCS models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gustafsson et al. 2008</ref>), and we consider the microscopic diffusion of chemical elements in the radiative zone (therefore the atmospheric metallicity varies as a function of time). We chose the abundances of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Grevesse &amp; Noels (1993)</ref> because the seismological constraints are not met when using other, more recent abundances.</p><p>For comparison, we also use the grid of models calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref> (hereafter BCAH98) for solar-composition stars. Those models assume a non-grey atmosphere, and the convection is treated in the context of the mixing-length theory with no core-overshooting and no diffusion. The tables assume that X = 0.716, Y = 0.282, Z = 0.020, and α = 1.9. For a solar model (1 M , 1 R ), the tables yield an effective temperature T eff, = 5797 K and luminosity L = 3.801 × 10 26 W for an assumed age of 4.61 Ga.</p><p>Finally, results are also compared to the so-called Y 2 stellar evolution tracks (hereafter YY) for solar composition stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Demarque et al. 2004</ref>). These models include convectionovershoot and diffusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The effect of spots and activity</head><p>By definition, the effective temperature of a star T eff is linked to its total luminosity L and radius R by the well-known relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = 4πR 2 σT 4 eff (1)</formula><p>However, in the presence of spots and activity, this relation has to be revised, because the correspondence between the effective temperature derived from a spectroscopic analysis (which we refer to as T eff, spectro ) and that obtained from Eq. 1 no longer holds.</p><p>Across the face of the Sun, spots are indicative of high magnetic activity: although the spots block a fraction (∼ 0.1%) of the starlight, their appearance is connected to a global increase in the total solar irradiance by about 0.1%, from ∼ 1365.5 to 1366.5 W m −2 due to the presence of bright faculae (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fröhlich &amp; Lean 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Krivova &amp; Solanki 2008)</ref>. This implies that the flux emitted in the visible and most importantly in the UV increases. Secular variations in the total solar irradiance based on models and a ∼ 300 year record of the solar activity also amount to about 0.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Solanki &amp; Fligge 2000)</ref>.</p><p>For stars with activity levels comparable to that of the Sun or lower, this level of uncertainty is much smaller than that attainable from spectroscopic measurements. In the case of CoRoT-2, the area covered by starspots is 70 to 200 times larger than for the active Sun and thus can potentially affect what may be inferred about the star properties, i.e. its luminosity, radius and mass.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the effective temperature of CoRoT-2 was determined from either the H−α line at 656.3 nm or fits in the visible (450 to 740 nm). For comparison, between minimum and maximum of activity, the Sun increases its relative flux ∆F λ /F λ by about 0.1%, 0.05%, and 0.07% at wavelengths in the range of 400-500 nm, 500-700 nm, and 700-800 nm, respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Krivova et al. 2006</ref>). Variations in the brightness temperatures at these wavelengths (proportional to σT 4 ) are 4 times smaller. If we assume that these number indeed scale with the surface area covered by spots (a big if, arguably), the potential mismatch between the spectroscopically inferred T eff, spectro and the true T eff amounts to up to 5%.</p><p>To see how the results may be affected by stellar activity, we first compare standard evolution models to evolution models calculated with CESAM and a modified atmospheric boundary condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L = (1 − χ s )4πR 2 σT 4 eff, spectro ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where χ s is a factor that accounts for emission from only part of the surface of the star. For purely black spots with no faculae it corresponds to the surface fraction of spots. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the result for a given luminosity and age, a star with spots simply has a higher "spectroscopic" effective temperature T eff, spectro as inferred from spectroscopic measurements than a star without spots. The evolution is simply displaced to the left of the HR diagram by an almost constant ratio (1 − χ s ) 1/4 in T eff . Quantitatively, the mean deviation amounts to 5 × 10 −5 on T eff , with a standard deviation σ = 4.6 × 10 −4 T eff and a maximum deviation 6.7 × 10 −3 T eff . The small departures from this constant displacement are due to slight modifications of the atmospheric properties (opacities) with temperature, but they can safely be neglected in this study.</p><p>When considering a star's evolution, that a star has spots is therefore equivalent to an added uncertainty in the measurement of its effective temperature. Activity also has the same consequence because it implies that both the present spectroscopically-determined effective temperature and the present luminosity may differ from their value averaged over one stellar magnetic cycle. A larger error bar in T eff may be used as a proxy for the added uncertainty due to activity and starspots. Although this uncertainty may be either positive (if the luminosity of CoRoT-2 is lower than its mean value and/or the contribution of faculae is larger than that of spots) or negative (if CoRoT-2 is more luminous than average and/or the spots are dark) we choose to only study the latter possibility. As shown in the following section, only lower T eff values can yield smaller radii for the star and the planet and hence help to solve the inflation puzzle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Constraints on the star's physical parameters</head><p>The star's physical parameters (M , R , age) are obtained by matching the constraints from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> to a grid of evolution models, as depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The two most important constraints of the problem are the star's effective temperature and density. A third constraint (not shown on the plot) is the star's present metallicity, which should be compared to the one obtained from the evolution models that include diffusion. One could include other constraints (such as that on log g), but in the present case, they are too weak to be useful.</p><p>The quality of the fit of any given model is given by its distance n σ to the ellipsoid of constraints, measured in units of the standard error in the constraints given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">n σ =        i X i σ i 2        1/2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where X i are the constraints and σ i their standard deviation (assumed Gaussian). The ellipsoid of constraints (of dimension 2) is centered on (T eff , ρ ) and has semi-minor and semi-major axes k 2D,n σ n σ (σ T eff , σ ρ ), respectively, where k 2D,n σ is the quantile of a 2D gaussian law at the equivalent level of confidence n σ . In addition, k 2D,n σ ∼ 1.52, 2.49, 3.44 for n σ = 1, 2, 3 respectively. This normalization ensures that our solutions at 1,2,3 σ have <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Evolution tracks for stars of masses between 0.85 and 1.0M in the effective temperature vs. stellar density space. The 1σ observational constraints are shown as boxes: the box to the left (blue) corresponds to solutions that neglect the effect of spots. The two boxes (blue and yellow) correspond to the added uncertainty obtained when assuming that from 0 to 20% of the stellar surface is covered by spots. CESAM tracks (plain) are compared to BCAH98 tracks (dashed). The models assume solar composition. Dots on the CEPAM tracks correspond to the following ages (small to large circles): 20, 32, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 Ma, respectively.</p><p>the correct probability of occurrence. However, for the metallicity we adopt a relatively crude simplification: we consider as valid only solutions for which the <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> value is within 1σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> of the measured one. We tested that in the particular case of CoRoT-2, considering yet larger errors in [Fe/H] has a negligible effect. In the remainder of the paper, we present models for which n σ ≤ 1, 2, 3, corresponding to confidence levels of 68.3%, 95.4%, and 99.7%, respectively.</p><p>Two possible values of the effective temperature are used: (i) in the no-spot case, we assume that obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ammler-von Eiff et al. (2009)</ref> but with a slightly larger error to account for possible systematic errors (T eff, spectro = 5608 ± 80 K); (ii) when including the effect of spots, we define a new temperature and its associated error ∆ T eff to take into account the presence of spots (from 0% to 20% of the area of the star)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T eff = T eff, spectro 1 + (1 − χ s ) 1/4 2 , ∆ T eff (n σ ) = T eff, spectro − T eff + n σ σ T eff, spectro .</formula><p>We thus derive T eff = 5224 − 5688 K at 1σ, T eff = 5144 − 5768 K at 2σ, and T eff = 5064 − 5848 K at 3σ. The errors are thus intrinsically non-Gaussian. The constraints used for the stellar density and metallicity are those derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref>, respectively (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows evolution tracks in the (log T eff , log ρ ) plane for solar-composition stars of between 0.85 and 1.0 M . For about 100 Ma, the stars contract and heat up from a lowtemperature, low-density initial state, the so-called pre-mainsequence phase (PMS). They then reach a maximum in their density and very gradually expand while on the main-sequence (MS). In the case of CoRoT-2, the observational constraints on T eff and ρ are met either on the PMS, for ages ∼ 30 Ma, or at much older ages in the MS phase. Only stars with masses  between roughly 0.84 and 1.04 M intercept the box of constraints at some point in their evolution. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> also shows that the presence of spots yields solutions at smaller masses than when spots are not taken into account. The agreement between CESAM and BCAH98 models is generally very good, with differences in T eff of generally ∼ 1% or less, and differences in ρ that can reach ∼ 10% but in only a limited region of the PMS evolution phase.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, we explore the effect of a "reasonable" (±15%) modification of the mixing length parameter α on the evolution tracks. The effect is not negligible in terms of its impact on both the effective temperature and the stellar density. A higher value of α implies a more efficient energy transport and therefore higher effective temperatures and generally a faster evolution. Less intuitively perhaps, it leads to a higher maximal stellar density at the early stages of the MS phase. However, we emphasize that these models with modified mixing lengths have not been calibrated and do not properly reproduce the present Sun.</p><p>The consequences of metallicity variations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. An increase in the <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> value by a factor 1/3 leads to a global decrease in the effective temperature by about 2%, larger than the 1σ error in the measurements, but slightly smaller than the uncertainty in T eff obtained when including spots. This effect is thus significant and shoud be included in the search for solutions matching the observational constraints.</p><p>We present in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> the ensemble of solutions in the (R , age) space obtained with various assumptions. The top panels correspond to our preferred solutions using our calibrated CESAM evolution model and including all metallicities. At 3σ, a wide range of solutions is found that extends from ages between 30 Ma and more than 10 Ga. Within 1σ, two classes of solutions are found, either on the PMS (30 − 40 Ma) or on the MS (for ages &gt; 800 Ma with no spots, or &gt; 100 Ma when including spots). The range of stellar radii (which are directly proportional to the planetary radii that are inferred) extend from 0.88 to 0.93 R at 1σ, but the smallest values are obtained for either the youngest or oldest solutions.</p><p>The other panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> highlight the consequences of the different hypotheses on the solutions, when considering only solar composition models. Varying the mixing length parameter has consequences for the 1σ solutions: a lower α value leads to a wider range of solutions at intermediate ages, while a higher α increases the separation between the very young and the very old solutions. However, when considering the global 3σ envelope and accounting for spots, the solutions are very similar.</p><p>The solutions obtained by using the ρ value of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al.

All models appear to be in excellent agreement at least to the 2σ level. A minor difference is the absence of 1σ PMS solutions in the no-spot case for BCAH98, contrary to the CESAM and YY results.</p><p>Additional constraints on the stellar age may be derived from CoRoT-2 being a rapid rotator. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand (2008)</ref>, the 4.5 day rotation period with B − V = 0.854 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lanza et al. 2009</ref>) implies an age typical of that of the Pleiades, i.e., ∼ 130 Ma. Given the absence of stars with similar B-V and periods shorter than 8 days in the Hyades (∼ 625 Ma), we estimate that CoRoT-2 is less than 500 Ma old, which thus restricts the ensemble of solutions from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> quite significantly.</p><p>We now focus on the young (&lt; 500 Ma) solutions and compare CESAM with BCAH98 in the (R , M , age) parameter space.

At 2 and 3σ, the solutions span the entire age range and both models yield very similar results. We note that MS solutions imply stellar masses slightly above that of the Sun, whereas PMS solutions are distributed between ∼ 0.9 and 1.0 M . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> compares the solutions in the (R , M ) space. There is a clear positive correlation between the two quantities. For ages older than 50 Ma, the solutions are confined to high mass values and there is a very good agreement between CESAM and BCAH98. At young ages however, as seen in previous diagrams, the CESAM and BCAH98 solutions differ.

We adopt the same two hypotheses as models of other transiting exoplanets (e.g. Guillot 2008), namely: (i) We use the equation of state for hydrogen and helium from <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> and a slightly larger value of the helium mass-mixing ratio (Y = 0.30) to account for the presence of heavy elements; and (ii) interior Rosseland opacities are calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allard et al. (2001)</ref>. The outer boundary condition is slightly modified however to allow for the determination of the impact of atmospheric properties on the planetary evolution.

In addition, we assume that P = (κ th /g)τ, and link atmospheric to interior models at the 10 bar pressure level.</p><p>The values of the coefficients κ th and κ v are parameterized from detailed radiative transfer calculations, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Guillot (2010)</ref>. These, and hence the atmospheric models in general are very uncertain due to the weak constraints on the chemical composition of these atmospheres, the unknown cloudcoverage, the difficulty in estimating how atmospheric dynamics transports heat and chemical elements...etc. In any case, the values that most closely reproduce the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> in similar irradiation conditions are κ th = 10 −2 g cm −2 and κ v = 4 × 10 −3 g cm −2 . These values yield evolution models that closely match our previous calculations (e.g. Guillot 2008). However, to match the observational constraints from measured brightness temperatures we adopt as a baseline scenario with an increased thermal opacity κ th = 1.5 × 10 −2 g cm −2 (see Sect. 3.4).</p><p>The transit radius corresponding to the level for which the chord optical depth is equal to 2/3 is calculated as in Guillot (2010) using our assumed visible opacity coefficient κ v . Because of the large size of CoRoT-2b and its relatively significant mass, we choose to ignore the possibility that a central dense core is present and only consider a fully gaseous planet of approximately solar composition. An increase in the mean molecular weight and/or presence of a core would generally lead to a smaller planet size and thus increase the problem in reproducing the observations. When considering models that include explicit tidal dissipation, we also solve the combined dynamical and structural evolution of the star/planet system including tides as described in the Appendix. We follow changes in the structural planetary parameters (radius R, pressure P, temperature T , intrinsic luminosity L) as well as in the dynamical parameters of the system (semimajor axis a, orbital eccentricity e, stellar spin Ω 1 , planetary spin Ω 2 ). At each evolution timestep, a new value of the tidal heating rate H 2 is calculated by solving implicitly the equations for the dynamical evolution of the system. This heating rate is used for the subsequent structural calculations, and assumed to be dissipated at the center of the planet, so that L(r = 0) = H 2 . (For a discussion of how the depth of the dissipation affects the planet's structure and evolution, see .) The orbital evolution also modifies the atmospheric boundary condition by altering the irradiation flux. The equilibrium temperature T eq is hence recalculated at each timestep. Our approach to the tidal dissipation calculation is thus similar to that chosen in other calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ibgui &amp; Burrows 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller et al. 2009</ref>), but it is based on the equations derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barker &amp; Ogilvie (2009)</ref> instead of those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jackson et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Standard evolution models</head><p>We compare in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> observational constraints on age and planetary size to standard evolution models with slightly different assumptions about mass, initial planetary radius, and helium content. The standard models are defined by the planet only contracting from an initial radius R ini as a result of the loss of its internal entropy: the only reservoir of energy is the initial gravitational energy Gm/r dm. The atmospheric boundary condition corresponds to our baseline case.</p><p>Our fiducial model has a mass of M = 3.5 M J , an initial radius R ini = 2 R J , and an equivalent helium mass mixing ratio Y = 0.30. It falls short of reproducing the inferred radius by ∼ 20% or more, except at young ages: for pre-main-sequence solutions at 30 − 40 Ma, the discrepancy is reduced to about 10%. Within the error bars, models with different masses have almost identical evolutions and therefore planetary mass is not a significant parameter in the problem (this is because CoRoT-2b lies in the particular regime of mass for which the radius is almost independent of mass, which for isolated objects corresponds to a maximum in the mass-radius relation -see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Guillot (2005)</ref>). In a similar way, changing the initial radius affects the evolution only in the first million years: the initial conditions are rapidly forgotten. One may wonder whether a different composition, in particular a different helium abundance, would have a stronger effect on evolution? As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, models with Y = 0.25 indeed yield a ∼ 4% larger size than for Y = 0.30, but this again falls short in explaining the large size of the planet.</p><p>These calculations confirm that CoRoT-2b is an anomalously large planet, a result already obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Leconte et al. (2009)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller et al. (2009)</ref>. However it also demonstrates the fact that the planet's young age is likely to be a crucial factor in explaining its size, both because of the possibility that the planet is initially quite large, and because our stellar evolution models yield solutions at 30-40 Ma that are closer to the theoretical evolution tracks than at any later times.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Contraction of CoRoT-2b compared to its measured radius and inferred age. Our fiducial model has an initial radius R ini = 2 R J , mass M p = 3.5 M J , and equivalent helium massmixing ratio Y = 0.30. The evolution for models with different initial radii R ini (3 to 6 R J ), different masses (3.3 to 3.7 M J ), or a different value of Y (0.25) are shown as labeled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">CoRoT-2b among its peers</head><p>It is instructive to compare CoRoT-2b to an ensemble of other transiting giant planets. Among these, CoRoT-2b may not be the largest (it is smaller than CoRoT-1b, HAT-P-8b, TrES-4b, and the present record-holder WASP-12b), but it remains the most difficult to reconcile with present-day models. This is most easily shown by ranking the planets in terms of their radius anomaly, i.e. the difference between its measured radius and the one predicted by models of a pure solar-composition planet of the same mass and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Guillot et al. 2006</ref>). As shown by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>, when using standard models, CoRoT-2b has a positive, large radius anomaly of 20000 km, but still smaller than that of HAT-P-8b, TrES-4b, and WASP-12b. However, for these last three planets, their large radius can be explained within the error bars by an additional heat source equivalent to 1% of the incoming stellar luminosity deposited at the planet's center (see Guillot 2005 and references therein). As shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>, this is not true for CoRoT-2b: because of its large mass, the planet tends to contract rapidly and therefore requires special conditions to explain its large size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">CoRoT-2b's atmosphere</head><p>We now consider how models of the planet's atmosphere affect its evolution. Remarkably, secondary transits of CoRoT-2b were detected in the optical from CoRoT lightcurves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alonso et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>) and in the infrared from Spitzer IRAC observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010</ref>) as well as ground-based measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alonso et al. 2010a</ref>). These directly probe the planetary atmosphere and are thus key constraints of the outer boundary conditions used in the evolution modeling.</p><p>The fluxes inferred from these measurements are equivalent to brightness temperatures of 1325 ± 180 K at 8 µm and 1805 ± 70 K at 4.5 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>). Additional ground-based measurements yield T b = 1890 +260 −350 K in the K s band (∼ 2.1 µm) and an upper limit of 2250 K in the H band (∼ 1.6 µm) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alonso et al. 2010a</ref>). In the optical, independent studies yield brightness temperatures that are very similar  within error bars, i.e. 2120 +90 −110 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alonso et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alonso et al. , 2010b</ref>) and 2170 ± 50 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010)</ref>. A crucial consequence that can be derived is that independently of hypotheses about the atmospheric composition and opacity sources, the day-side atmosphere of CoRoT-2b is characterized by physical temperatures that are as low as 1325 ± 180 K, and at least as high as 1805 ± 70 K. The case of the optical brightness measurements are more complex to interpret because they may arise from either direct emission or a reflection of the incoming stellar flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alonso et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>). In the limit of a geometric albedo of 0.2, the flux would be entirely due to direct reflection and thus provide no information about the atmospheric temperature profile. In contrast, a zero albedo would imply that the flux in the optical is thermal emission from the planet, and that the corresponding temperatures are high.</p><p>These temperature constraints are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> to temperature profiles calculated for CoRoT-2b in the framework of our semi-gray analytical model assuming a full redistribution of the incoming stellar flux (see Eq. (6) and Guillot 2010). The value of the intrinsic flux T int = 1000 K was chosen to match that of models with a size ∼ 1.5 R Jup , as observed. Using values of the thermal and visible opacities calibrated to detailed atmospheric models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) (labeled κ * th , κ * v in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>, we derive a temperature profile that is difficult to reconcile with the Spitzer and CoRoT brightness temperatures: the temperature range spanned by the atmosphere at mean optical levels smaller than unity is small: from about 1400 to 1600 K. This implies that to explain the observations with this model, one needs to invoke (i) an albedo of ∼ 0.2, (ii) a high-opacity at 8 µm, and (iii) a verylow opacity (lower than at visible wavelengths) at 4.5 µm. This combination of factors appears to be unlikely. Furthermore, one should consider that the low 8 µm temperature has to be emitted from high levels in the atmosphere. Because the radiative timescale is shorter at high altitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Iro et al. 2005</ref>), its temperature may have to be closer to the dayside than global average, which would make the problem even worse. For these reasons, we consider alternative models. We restrict ourselves to models without a temperature inversion, both because this is not predicted by dedicated radiative transfer models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snellen et al. 2010)</ref>, and it would make the planetary radius problem more severe. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> presents a variety of alternative profiles. The temperature range in the lowoptical thickness part of the atmosphere is directly related to the factor γ ≡ κ v /κ th , with a low Γ value implying a strong greenhouse effect. We find that models that can more readily reproduce both the infrared and visible brightness temperatures are those with γ ≈ 0.2 to 0.4. These models are also consistent with the secondary transit of CoRoT-2b being detected in CoRoT's red channel and not in the blue and green channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Snellen et al. 2010)</ref>, implying that it indeed originates mostly from direct planetary emission rather than stellar light reflection. They are also consistent with their smaller implied albedos, in line with the low limit A g = 0.038 ± 0.045 obtained for HD209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rowe et al. 2008</ref>), a planet with a similar equilibrium temperature. Larger greenhouse effects (i.e. the red curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">fig. 11</ref>) are not consistent with the models because they would tend to yield brightness temperatures that are larger than inferred.</p><p>Compared to traditional atmospheric models, this larger greenhouse effect may be achieved by several means: the presence of clouds, of photochemical products, or generally of minor species that are efficient infrared absorbers but are transparent at visible wavelengths. Complications arising from chromatic and The colored areas indicate constraints obtained from photometric, spectroscopic, radial-velocity data and stellar evolution models. The colors are a function of the distance to the effective temperature-stellar density constraint ellipse in standard error units: within 1σ (red), 2σ (yellow) and 3σ (blue). The star's activity implies an age smaller than ∼ 0.5 Ga, which indicated by solutions in shades of grey. The main constraint is obtained for a lightcurve analysis that includes the presence of spots. An analysis that does not account for spots yields a ∼ 3% smaller radius, indicated by a dotted area (see text). The plain curves are obtained from standard evolution models using atmospheric boundary conditions that are parameterized by mean infrared κ th and visible κ v opacity coefficients, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Impact of atmospheric models on the planetary evolution</head><p>Planetary evolution models calculated with different atmospheric boundary conditions are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> to standard evolution models for this planet available in the literature and to our inferred age/size constraints for CoRoT-2b. We first note that our baseline models (with opacities κ * th and κ * v ) are a close match to the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref> after about 20 Ma, and that they reproduce relatively well the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Leconte et al. (2009)</ref>, within 5%, over the whole age range. In this last case, the differences in behavior may be attributed to our fiducial model having slightly lower infrared opacities and a smaller γ value. Because the internal structure part of the calculation should be very similar, this highlights that even with similar hypotheses (a solar composition cloud-free atmosphere), detailed radiative transfer atmospheric models yield predictions that differ in a relatively significant way (see also Guillot 2010).</p><p>As previously, most models are unable to reproduce the constraints. However, two of them do intersect the constraint area at young ages between 30 and 40 Ma. These are models for which the thermal atmospheric opacity has been increased by a factor 3.5 to 4, relatively independently of visible opacities. The consequence of the larger κ th is to reduce the amount of initial heat lost by the planet at young ages. The intersection is small, but could become larger if we considered that non-grey models may enable the deep atmospheric temperatures to increase while the visible brightness temperature remains constant, and also that the planet probably formed at least a few million years after the star. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>, for an even stronger greenhouse effect (a smaller γ), the present size of the planet may be reached at even older ages. However, this extreme model is unlikely because it disagrees with the inferred visible brightness temperature (see § 3.4).</p><p>The present size of CoRoT-2b can thus be explained by the combination of a young age of between 30 and 40 Ma, and additional opacity sources (gases/clouds) in the atmosphere. We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. (2007)</ref> also proposed an increase in atmospheric opacities to explain the large sizes of exoplanets. Our solution is similar, but we emphasize that this increase should concern more particularly the opacities at infrared wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Alternative recipes</head><p>Alternative models invoked to explain the large sizes of other exoplanets are unlikely to work.

This is also the case of a considerable -30 fold-increase in interior opacities that would also explain the sizes of most transiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guillot 2008</ref>). In fact, as already noted ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010</ref>), the energy dissipation deep inside the planet required to explain the present-day radius is enormous, on the order of 10 29 erg s −1 . This is about 30000 times the present intrinsic luminosity of Jupiter. It is also about 1/4th of the power that the planet receives from its parent star.</p><p>After that provided by stellar radiation, the most important potential source of energy is that taken from the planetary orbit. When moving CoRoT-2b from infinity to its present orbit, ∆E = GM * M p /2a ≈ 10 45 erg have to be dissipated.

Models coupling the equations governing the dynamical evolution of the star+planet system with the physical planetary evolution rely however on a crucial assumption: that dissipation occurs at a sufficient depth in the planet interior, i.e. roughly within the planet's convective zone, deeper than a few 100 bars or so (see , for a discussion).

This implies that any initially high eccentricity value causes a rapid evolution of the system which is hardly predicted by models developed only to second order in eccentricity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jackson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ibgui &amp; Burrows 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010</ref>). We find that a 10% asynchronous planet would dissipate the required luminosity, but the corresponding synchronization timescale is extremely short, about 10, 000 years.</p><p>At low eccentricities, an inward migration with a timescale ∼ 1 Ga (Q * /10 6 ) results from tides raised by the planet onto the star.At high eccentricities and for our choice of Q factors, tides raised by the star onto the planet begin to dominate and cause a decrease in the semi-major axis that is concomitant to the circularization of stellar tides on the planet. The orbit circularization is mostly caused by the planet, unless Q p &gt; 10Q * . While the planet is synchronized efficiently, the star is found to be spun up by the planet relatively slowly ∼ 1 Ga for eccentricities e &lt; 0.2.</p><p>Given its inferred eccentricity, the present size of CoRoT2b may be explained by tides only within two scenarios: (i) By a very low Q p value and a forced eccentricity due to the presence of another planet. (ii) By an initial stage of high-dissipation followed by a rapid circularization and contraction. The former case is unlikely (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. 2010</ref>). The last possibility requires that the circularization proceeds faster than the planet's contraction.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref> we explore the constraints that can be derived on Q p . Using the equations in the Appendix, we calculate the minimum eccentricity required for tides to dissipate 10 29 erg s −1 in the planet (top panel). We then calculate the time required for the eccentricity to decline from this value to the observed one (we assumed e = 0.02). This time is compared to the time required to contract from 2 to 1.5 R J based on our different atmospheric  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>. Heating rates and dynamical timescales for the orbital evolution of the CoRoT-2 system as a function of the orbital eccentricity. The star and planet are assumed to have their present mass and orbital period, and tidal dissipation factors Q * = 10 6 , Q p = 10 5 . The blue curves refer to the star, the red curves to the planet. The planet is assumed to be either synchronously rotating (spin period=orbital period) (plain lines), or to rotate 10% faster than synchronous rotation (dashed lines). From top to bottom, the panels show various important quantities: (a) Heating rates due to tidal dissipation in the planet and in the star. (b) Migration timescale due to the star and the planet. Migration is inward except in the asynchronous case due to the planet's spin down for eccentricities smaller than ∼ 0.12. (c) Spin-up timescale: The star is spun up by the planet in all cases. The planet is generally spun up, except in the asynchronous case (see text). (d) Circularisation timescale: The evolution towards a circular orbit is due to both stellar and planetary tides. models (bottom panels). We thus derive an upper limit to the planetary tidal factor Q p ∼ 10 6 that is similar to the 10 5.5 quoted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref>. This estimate does not account for the effect of migration but we propose that it should be relatively realistic.</p><p>We show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref> a few example results of the full dynamical calculation. One problem we faced was the existence of a runaway inflation of the planet especially for high values of the eccentricity. In order to maximize the ensemble of solutions (and ease the calculation), we set an arbitrary saturation value Bottom panel: Time to evolve from the minimum eccentricity to the observed e ∼ 0.02 for two values of the stellar tidal factor, ∞ (dashed) and 10 6 (plain).

Using this recipe, we are able to reproduce approximately the solutions found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref>, but find that the contraction is too fast compared to our age constraints. We were unable in general to find solutions when starting from a fixed initial eccentricity at time t = 0. We can obtain transient solutions instead when including inward migration or a late increase in the eccentricity. A plausible scenario could thus be that CoRoT-2b had a recent ( ∼ &lt; 20 Ma) planetary encounter leaving it into an eccentric orbit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ford &amp; Rasio 2008)</ref>. Another similar possibility is that the planet had a Kozai interaction with another distant body (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref>, its orbit was changed to one of high eccentricity, and circularization began less than 20 Ma ago.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">A recent planetary impact?</head><p>Another alternative is of course that CoRoT-2b experienced a planetary impact in the past ∼ 20 Ma.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We have combined stellar and planetary evolution models to help us develop a consistent scenario to understand the formation and evolution of the CoRoT-2 system. Although stellar spots are important in the lightcurve analysis and do have an important impact when deriving the planetary radius, we have demonstrated that their consequences on the derived stellar properties are modest and can be modeled as an additional uncertainty in the derived effective temperature of the star.</p><p>We have presented evidence for the youth of the CoRoT-2 system. The rapid ∼ 4.5 day spin of the star is of course a strong indication of a young age, but we have also shown that a very promising ensemble of solutions occurs on the pre-mainsequence phase of the parent star, yielding ages of between 30 and 40 Ma. By combining constraints obtained on the atmosphere from both brightness temperature measurements and stellar and planetary evolution models, we found that three scenarios can explain the present large size of planet CoRoT-2b. All these imply a recent event that took place less than 40 Ma ago.</p><p>1. Its atmosphere is about 3 to 4 times more opaque in the infrared than usually thought, and the system is indeed 30 to 40 Ma old. 2. The CoRoT-2 system involved multiple planets and less than 20 Ma ago, close encounters between the planets brought two into collision. The CoRoT-2b impactor would need to have had a relatively significant fraction of the total planetary mass. 3. The CoRoT-2 system involved multiple planets and less than 20 Ma ago, close encounters between the planets left CoRoT2b on an eccentric orbit. This orbit has been almost circularized, but remains in the transient heating phase. The parameter space required in terms of initial eccentricities and orbital  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">. 12</ref>). For visibility purposes, the constraint on the orbital period has been increased by a factor 10 5 . Three models are shown: Black lines:</p><p>A model with Q p = 3 × 10 5 , Q * = 10 5 , e ini = 0.4, a ini = 0.04 AU, corresponding to a preferred model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gillon et al. (2010)</ref>. Purple lines: A model including migration for the first 10 Ma, and Q p = 10 6 , Q * = 10 6 , e ini = 0.4, a ini = 0.13 AU. Blue lines: A close-encounter model, for which the eccentricity is suddenly raised to e ∼ 0.77 after 300 Ma, presumably due to close encounters with another planet. This assumes Q p = 10 5 , Q * = 10 6 , a ini = 0.1 AU. The thick parts of the lines corresponds to epochs for which the eccentricity and orbital periods are in agreement with the observations (see text). distances for this to have occurred is small, and we found that it generally requires a saturation of the tidal heating to avoid the complete loss of the planet.</p><p>The detection of abundant lithium in CoRoT-2 confirms that the star is young: the comparison with data obtained for open clusters indicate that its age should be between <ref type="bibr">30 and 320 Ma (Gillon et al. 2010</ref>). However, this may be an overestimation because lithium may be more easily destroyed in the presence of a massive protoplanetary disk (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bouvier 2008)</ref>. Several kinds of observations of CoRoT-2 would shed light on its nature. The detection of an infrared excess or a debris disk would be an indication that the system is young even though there is a wide spread in disk ages (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hillenbrand et al. 2008)</ref>. Searching for distant companions would also help especially given the possibility that the planet's eccentricity may have been pumped up by Kozai interactions with a third body before being efficiently damped by tides. Last but not least, the determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and the secondary transit would be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties, in particular its day-night heat redistribution efficiency. It would also help us to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in way that is less affected by systematic errors due to stellar activity. With similar observations in the visible, one would be able to test our assumption that the signal detected in the CoRoT lightcurves is due to thermal emission from deep levels in the planet. Since the radiative timescales rapidly increase with depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Iro et al. 2005</ref>), we would expect that phase variations in the visible are smaller than in the infrared. </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">− e 1 − e 2 ˙ e + 1 2a ˙ a,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The heating rate in the planet H 2 may then be applied to the planetary evolution calculations.

For models in which tidal dissipation in the planet is assumed to saturate at a fixed value H 2 = H 2,max , we proceed as follows: when the dissipation in the planet is found to exceed H 2,max , we increase the value of Q 2 until we reach the maximal allowed dissipation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
