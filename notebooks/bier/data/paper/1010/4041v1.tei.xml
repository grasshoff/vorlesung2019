<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A technique has been developed to obtain high precision (35 µas) astrometry of close stellar pairs (separation less than 1 arcsec; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lane and Muterspaugh 2004</ref>) using long-baseline infrared interferometry at the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Colavita et al. 1999</ref>). This technique was applied to 51 binary systems as the Palomar High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES) program during <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2004]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2005]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2006]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2007]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref>. PHASES science results included precision binary orbits and component masses, studies of the geometries of and physical properties of stars in triple and quadruple star systems, and limits on the presence of giant planet companions to the binaries. This paper is the first in a series analyzing the final results of the PHASES project as of its completion in late 2008. This paper describes the observing method, sources of measurement uncertainties, limits of observing precisions, derives empirical scaling rules to account for noise sources beyond those predicted by the standard reduction algorithms, and presents the full catalog of astrometric measurements from PHASES. The second paper combines PHASES astrometry, astrometric measurements made by other methods, and radial velocity observations (where available) to determine orbital solutions to several binaries' Keplerian motions, determining physical properties such as component masses and system distance when possible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Muterspaugh et al. 2010b</ref>). The third paper presents limits on the existence of substellar tertiary companions orbiting either the primary or secondary stars in those systems that are found to be consistent with being simple binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Muterspaugh et al. 2010c</ref>). Paper four presents orbital solutions to a known triple star system (63 Gem A = HD 58728) and a newly discovered triple system (HR 2896 = HD 60318) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Muterspaugh et al. 2010a</ref>). Finally, paper five presents candidate substellar companions to PHASES binaries as detected by astrometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Muterspaugh et al. 2010d</ref>).</p><p>Astrometric measurements were made at PTI, which was located on Palomar Mountain near San Diego, CA. It was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology for NASA, as a testbed for interferometric techniques applicable to the Keck Interferometer and other missions such as the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). It operated in the J (1.2µm), H (1.6µm), and K (2.2µm) bands, and combined starlight from two out of three available 40-cm apertures. The apertures formed a triangle with one 110 and two 87 meter baselines. PHASES observations began in 2002 and continued through 2008 November when PTI ceased routine operations.</p></div>

The final observing procedure and data processing algorithm is presented in complete form here. All astrometry measurements were reprocessed using the final algorithm presented here. Measurements taken with different instrumental configurations than the standard one presented here (for example, those lacking longitudinal dispersion compensation) are noted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Optical Interferometers</head><p>In an optical interferometer, light is collected at two or more apertures and brought to a central location where the beams are combined and a fringe pattern produced on a detector (at PTI, the detectors were NICMOS and HAWAII infrared arrays, of which only a few pixels were used). For a broadband source of central wavelength λ and optical bandwidth ∆λ (for PTI ∆λ = 0.4µm), the fringe pattern is limited in extent and appears only when the optical paths through the arms of the interferometer are equalized to within a coherence length (Λ = λ 2 /∆λ). For a two-aperture interferometer, neglecting dispersion, the intensity measured at one of the combined beams is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(x) = I 0 1 + V sin (πx/Λ) πx/Λ sin (2πx/λ) (1)</formula><p>where V is the fringe contrast or "visibility", which can be related to the morphology of the source, and x is the optical path difference between arms of the interferometer. More detailed analysis of the operation of optical interferometers can be found in Principles of Long Baseline Stellar Interferometry (Lawson 2000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Interferometric Astrometry</head><p>The location of the resulting interference fringes is related to the position of the target star and the observing geometry via</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d = − → B · − → S + δ a − → S , t + c<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where d is the optical path length one must introduce between the two arms of the interferometer to find fringes. This quantity is often called the "delay." − → B is the baseline-the vector connecting the two apertures.</p><p>− → S is the unit vector in the source direction, and c is a constant additional scalar delay introduced by the instrument. The term δ a − → S , t is related to the differential amount of path introduced by the atmosphere over each telescope due to variations in refractive index. For a 100-m baseline interferometer an astrometric precision of 10 µas corresponds to knowing d to 5 nm; while difficult, this is achievable for all terms except that related to the atmospheric delay. Atmospheric turbulence, which changes over distances of tens of centimeters and on millisecond timescales, forces one to use very short exposures (to maintain fringe contrast) and limits the sensitivity of the instrument. It also severely limits the astrometric accuracy of a simple interferometer, at least over large sky-angles.</p><p>However, in narrow-angle astrometry one is concerned with a close pair of stars, and the observable is a differential astrometric measurement, i.e. one is interested in knowing the angle between the two stars ( − → ∆ s = − → s 2 − − → s 1 ). The atmospheric turbulence is correlated over small angles. If the measurements of the two stars are simultaneous, or nearly so, the atmospheric term cancels out. Hence, it is still possible to obtain high precision "narrow-angle" astrometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Sub-Arcsecond Differential Astrometry</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the light path of the PHASES astrometry program was as follows:</p><p>1. Light was collected by two of the three siderostats at PTI. The siderostats had diameter 50 cm and fed 40 cm beam compressing telescopes. These collimated the 40 cm input into a 7.5 cm beam.</p><p>2. At the siderostat enclosure, a fast steering mirror (FSM) provided tip-tilt correction for low-order adaptive optics improvement. The feedback sensor for the tip-tilt system was located in the beam combining facility (see step <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(9)</ref>), to include both atmospheric and instrumental sources of tip-tilt variations.</p><p>3. The collimated beams propagated through pipes to the central beam combining building. For the north and south siderostats, the pipes were held at vacuum; for the west siderostat, the pipe was filled with air.</p><p>4. Each collimated beam was directed to a long delay line (DL) which tracks the sidereal delay rate and receives feedback from the fringe tracking beam combiner for removing some of the atmospheric turbulent delay variations. There were roughly ±38 m of optical delay available in the long DLs.</p><p>5. The collimated beams were recompressed to 2.5 cm collimated beams.</p><p>6. Each beam passed through a pair of matched prisms. In one arm, one prism was on a linear stage to vary the total glass thickness the starlight passed through. The positions of these prisms were calibrated using fringes from an internal light source to minimize the combined longitudinal dispersion of air path and glass. This calibration also determined the glass-to-air dispersion correction rate. The linear stage was operated in open-loop mode to minimize longitudinal dispersion even as the air path was varied by the long DLs. Some early measurements were made before this dispersion compensator was available, as marked in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5.</ref> 7. The 2.5 cm collimated beams were split ∼ 70/30 by plate beam splitters. The reflected ∼ 30% of the light was directed to the "secondary" beam combiner which made the astrometric science measurement. Red He-Ne LASER metrology signals were injected at these beam splitters and propagated through both beam combiners before being extracted just before the infrared array detectors to monitor path variations.</p><p>8. The ∼ 70% transmitted light from each beam was directed through a short DL. These were smaller versions of the long DLs with a few ten's of centimeters of travel. The short DLs allowed one to set the delay offset between the fringe-tracking and the science beam combiners such that both are near zero optical delay simultaneously. It also introduced the 50-100 Hz sawtooth modulation required for sampling fringes in the fringe tracker, without being in the science camera's optical path.</p><p>9. After the short DL, the ∼ 70% of the original light to be used for fringe tracking was directed to the "primary" beam combiner. I-band light was extracted using a dichroic beamsplitter and focused <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Configuration and light path used at PTI for the PHASES experiment is shown in schematic form; the corresponding description is described in Section 2.1.3. Note that the path for only one telescope is shown; light from the second telescope travels a similar path.</p><p>onto quad-cell APD's. The signal was used as feedback to the fast tip-tilt mirrors in step 2.</p><p>10. The longer-wavelength light was combined using a plate beam splitter. Half the light was focused on a single pixel of the NICMOS infrared array for highsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) phase tracking. The other half passed through a single-mode fiber to improve wavefront quality (and system visibility), then through a low-resolution prism to disperse the light onto ∼ 5 pixels for slower group-delay tracking. Phase and group-delay signals were fed to the long DLs to reduce jitter from atmospheric piston motions. This beam combiner was the same as used for PTI's standard visibility mode observations.</p><p>11. The ∼ 30% of the light redirected to the "secondary" table was used for the astrometric science measurement. The secondary beam combiner was identical to the first with the following exceptions.</p><p>(a) A piezo-driven scanning mirror added up to ±300 µm of optical delay to allow scanning within the arcsecond field of view. The scan was close-loop controlled using the LASER metrology signal. (b) No single-mode fiber was used for spatial filtering. (c) A HAWAII array was used instead of NIC-MOS.</p><p>The entire optical system was realigned at the beginning of the night and usually updated in the middle of the night, once per night. Alignment drifts from one night to the next were small. Standard detector calibrations (gain, bias and background) were acquired at the beginning of the night for both infrared array detectors; background levels were re-measured with each star acquisition.</p><p>The operating sequence began by acquiring the stars and locking star trackers for tip-tilt corrections on both telescopes. The 50-100 Hz fringe-tracking modulation was applied to the long DLs, which were moved until fringes were found with the "primary" beam combiner. Once fringe lock was made, the long and short DLs were moved simultaneously to maintain primary fringes until fringes were detected on the "secondary" beam combiner. Once fringes were found simultaneously on both beam combiners, (1) the zero-point offset for the short DLs was recorded, (2) the 50-100 Hz fringe tracking modulation was moved from the long to short DLs so that only the "primary" beam combiner was affected by the modulation, (3) the "secondary" detector's read-out pattern was adjusted from one optimized for fringe tracking to a faster and more evenly spaced one that was better for scanning between fringe packets, and (4) the scanning mirror in the "secondary" beam combiner initiated its ∼Hz, ∼ 100 µm triangle modulation. The speed and amplitude of the triangle pattern wer user-settable according to the predicted projected binary separation. Conservative values were used with larger amplitudes than predicted to ensure good coverage of the fringe packets. Observing a binary when its baseline projected separation ( − → B · −→ ∆S) was of order the interferometric coherence length (Λ = λ 2 /∆λ ≈ 20µm) or less was avoided due to potential biases associated with an imperfect template fringe packet.</p><p>This setup resulted in a special astrometry mode designed to work on pairs of stars separated by no more than ∼ 1 arcsec, the diffraction limit of the 40 cm apertures at λ = 2.2 µm. In this mode, the small separation of the binary resulted in both binary components being in the field of view of a single interferometric beam combiner. The fringe positions were measured by modulating the instrumental delay with an amplitude large enough to record both fringe packets. This eliminated the need for a complex internal metrology system to measure the entire optical path of the interferometer, and dramatically reduced the effect of systematic error sources such as uncertainty in the baseline vector (error sources which scale with the binary separation). The same instrumental configuration could be used for double Fourier spectroscopy.</p><p>However, since the fringe position measurement of the two stars was no longer truly simultaneous it was possible for the atmosphere to introduce path-length changes (and hence positional error) in the time between measurements of the separate fringes. To reduce this effect a fraction of the incoming starlight was redirected to a separate beam-combiner, as described above. This beam-combiner was used in a "fringe-tracking" mode ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Shao and Staelin 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Colavita et al. 1999</ref>) where it rapidly (10-20 ms) measured the phase of one of the starlight fringes and adjusted the internal delay to keep that phase constant. The fringe tracking data were used both in real-time (operating in a feed-back servo, after which a small-but measurable-residual phase error remained) and in post-processing (the measured residual error was applied to the data as a feed-forward servo). This technique-known as phase referencing-had the effect of stabilizing the fringe measured by the astrometric beam-combiner. For this observing mode, LASER metrology was only required between the two beam combiners through the location of the light split (which occurred after the optical delay has been introduced), rather than throughout the entire array. This greatly reduced system complexity and increased the percentage of time on-sky. Extra efforts in system reliability and automation allowed most PHASES measurements to be acquired by a single night assistant with high (&gt; 90%, not counting weather) on-sky efficiency.</p><p>In making an astrometric measurement the optical delay was modulated in a triangle-wave pattern around the stabilized fringe position, while measuring the intensity of the combined starlight beams. The range of the delay sweep was set to include both fringe packets; typically this required a scan amplitude on the order of 150 µm. Typically one such "scan" was obtained every second, consisting of up to 1000 intensity samples (the scan rate was limited by the source brightness and the requirement that &gt; 2 samples are made per fringe modulation period). A double fringe packet based on Equation 1 was then fit to the data, and the differential optical path between fringe packets was measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Astrometric Data Reduction Algorithm</head><p>The intensity versus delay position measurements produced by the interferometer were processed into astrometric measurements as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Detector calibrations (gain, bias, and background)</head><p>were applied to the intensity measurements.</p><p>2. The residual phase errors from the primary fringe tracker were converted to delay and applied to the data. Note that while the intensity measurements were spaced regularly in time, and the delay scanned linearly in time, the variable amount of delay correction applied from the fringe tracker resulted in the intensity measurements being unevenly spaced in delay. This somewhat complicated the downstream processing, in that FFT-based algorithms could not be used.</p><p>3. The data were broken up into "scans" either when the delay sweep changed direction or when the fringe tracker lost lock. Only scans for which at least 90% of the scan was continuously recorded (without fringe lock loss) were used in processing.</p><p>4. For each scan, a power spectrum was calculated using a Lomb-Scargle algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Scargle 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Press et al. 1992</ref>). This spectrum provided an S/N estimate based on the ratio of the power in and out of the instrument bandpass. Only the scans with an S/N greater than unity were kept.</p><p>5. For a range of values of differential optical delays between fringe packets, a model of a double-fringe packet was calculated and compared to the observed scan to derive a χ 2 value versus differential delay.</p><p>6. A two-dimensional grid in differential R.A. and decl. over which to search was constructed (in ICRS 2000.0 coordinates). For each point in the search grid the expected differential delay was calculated based on the interferometer location, baseline geometry, and time of observation for each scan.</p><p>These conversions were simplified using the routines from the Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Subroutines C Language Version 2.0 (NOVAS-C; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kaplan et al. (1989)</ref>). The value of χ 2 for the grid point's differential delay as determined by the previous step was co-added to an R.A./decl. χ 2 grid.</p><p>7. After co-adding the R.A./decl χ 2 over all the scans in one night, all resulting values of χ 2 within 4σ of the minimum point were used to fit a twodimensional quadratic function to interpolate the location of the best minimum χ 2 value as the final astrometric solution, and the widths of the quadratics determined the formal uncertainties as discussed in detail below. The final product was a measurement of the apparent vector between the stars and associated uncertainty ellipse. Because the data were obtained with a single-baseline instrument, the resulting error contours are very elliptical, with aspect ratios at times ≥ 10.</p><p>Sample illustrations of several of these stages are plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>In previous data reductions, the scans were optionally digitally bandpass filtered before being processed for astrometry. This resulted in astrometric measurements that differed from those derived without filtering by much less than the measurement uncertainties. In this final analysis, the scans were not bandpass filtered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Probability Distribution Function Sidelobes</head><p>One potential complication with fitting a fringe to the data was that there were many local minima spaced at multiples of the operating wavelength. If one were to fit a fringe model to each scan separately and average (or fit an astrometric model to) the resulting delays, one would be severely limited by this fringe ambiguity (for a 110-m baseline interferometer operating at 2.2µm, the resulting positional ambiguity is ∼ 4.1 mas). However, by using the χ 2 -surface approach, and co-adding the probabilities associated with all possible delays for each scan, the ambiguity disappeared. This was due to two things, the first being that co-adding simply improved the S/N. Second, since the observations usually lasted for an hour or even longer, the associated baseline change due to Earth rotation also had the effect of "smearing" out all but the true global minimum. The final χ 2 -surfaces did have dips separated by ∼ 4.1 mas from the true location, but any data sets for which these showed up at the 4σ level were rejected. The 4σ region is that for which the properly normalized χ 2 function has a value less than the number of degrees of freedom plus 19.33, the latter being the value appropriate for two-dimensional χ 2 distributions. The final astrometry measurement and related uncertainties were derived by fitting only the 4σ region of the surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Residual Unmonitored Phase Noise</head><p>Unmonitored system phase noise can affect the χ 2 surface in two ways. First, components of the phase noise that operated at frequencies faster than the scan rate caused the two fringe packets to be smeared an extra amount, and to first order this appeared as extra noise in the intensity measurements. This affected the width of the χ 2 fit for each individual scan (which is designated as σ m , the "measurement" noise), and thus appeared directly in the co-added χ 2 contour.</p><p>If instead the instrumental noise was much slower than an individual scan, it was essentially "frozen into" the scan-for the duration of that scan, the stars really did appear to have a different separation than their true separation. The χ 2 surface for the fit to an individual scan takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (d − d j ) = (d − d j ) 2 σ 2 m + n (3)</formula><p>where d j is the value of the star separation that minimizes f = χ 2 , and n is the number of degrees of freedom of the fit (typical values for n are 400-1000; for this derivation, it suffices to assume a one-dimensional χ 2 surface as it has no curvature in the direction perpendicular to the sky-projected baseline-only Earth-rotation synthesis lifts this degeneracy). The low-frequency components of the phase noise cause d j to vary from d o , the true star separation, by more than one expects from measurement noise alone. By taking many such scans, one can determine this instrumental scatter (which is designated as σ i , the "instrument" noise for an individual scan) and add (in quadrature) the instrumental noise to the measurement noise as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F (d − d o ) = (d − d o ) 2 (σ 2 m + σ 2 i ) /N + nN (4)</formula><p>where N is the number of scans (N was typically hundreds to thousands). Consider a function f (d − d oj ) with position of the minimum at d oj ; this centroid position is distributed with probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P d oj = e −(do−do j ) 2 /2σ 2 i √ 2πσ i .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>One may naively hope that summing several instances of this function with variable d oj together would properly add the instrumental and measurement noises in quadrature. However, the summation results in</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N j=0 f d − d oj = N ∞ −∞ f (d − x) P (x) dx (6) = (d − d o ) 2 (σ 2 m ) /N + nN + N σ 2 i σ 2 m (7) = (d − d o ) 2 (σ 2 m + σ 2 i ) /N + nN.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Even if one renormalizes so that the additive term equals nN (i.e. multiply by n/(n + σ 2 i /σ 2 m )), this is still:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">N j=0 f d − d oj = (d − d o ) 2 (σ 2 m + σ 2 i /n) /N + nN.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note the extra factor of n dividing σ 2 i ; this effectively underestimates the scan-to-scan instrumental noise by a very large amount-roughly 20× for typical PHASES data. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Several steps of the data processing pipeline are shown for an observation of HD 13872 (21 Ari) from MJD 54385.33270. Upper left: raw interferograms show two distinct fringe packets, one from each star in the over-resolved binary. One star was found near zero delay, the other at ∼ ±70 µm. The flipping from side-to-side was a result of the fringe tracker first tracking on one star for some scans, then the other. Upper right: the periodogram of one scan, used to evaluate the fringe S/N within the optical passband used (K-band, 2.0-2.4 µm). The power in the passband is not flat, but rather oscillates, a result of the object being a binary star (visibility changes with wavelength). Lower left: the likelihood metric χ 2 as a function of delay separation of the binaries, for two scans. Note there are multiple minima separated by the fringe modulation period, and the noise is large enough to prevent high confidence identification of the correct local minimum. Lower right: Tthe coadded χ 2 surface in differential R.A./decl., with contours corresponding to 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-σ confidence regions. Note that in this case sidelobes appeared at the 4-σ confidence level, so the measurement was rejected as ambiguous.</p><p>Instead, the appropriate way to determine the scanto-scan fit is by noticing that the minimum value of the co-added χ 2 surface is greater than the total number of degrees of freedom nN by the amount:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">N σ 2 i σ 2 m .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The quantity σ m was measured directly from the shape of the surface, which remained unchanged, and the number of scans N was known. Thus, one could derive σ i and apply it to the formal uncertainties. For all observations the average value of σ 2 i /σ 2 m was 1.29; values ranged from 0.0042 (for bright sources and good weather conditions) to 7.2.</p><p>Phase-referencing was used to decrease the amount of unmonitored phase noise during narrow-angle astrometry observations (see Section 3.1), but some residual phase noise remained, so the correction outlined here had to be applied to the astrometric data. Synthetic data were constructed both with and without unmonitored phase noise of the actual spectrum observed, and the data reduction algorithm determined measurement uncertainties consistent with the actual scatters in the measurements between multiple synthetic data sets. Without the additional phase-noise correction outlined here, the formal uncertainties significantly underestimated the scatter in the results.</p></div>

The details of a few of these terms were described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lane and Muterspaugh (2004)</ref>; here, a more complete summary of the PHASES error budget is presented. Note. -Sources of astrometric noise vary in magnitude from tens of micro-arcseconds to sub-microarcsecond levels. Differential dispersion depends on color difference between binary components; for many targets, this is nearly zero, but for extreme color differences, this can be hundreds of microarcseconds. This is not the case for any of the PHASES targets. Photometric variability accompanies star spots, of a magnitude that is easily detected for astrometric signatures of 8 µas or larger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Astrometric Observational Noise</head><p>In calculating the expected astrometric performance three major sources of error were taken into account: errors caused by fringe motion during the delay sweep between fringes (loss of coherence with time), errors caused by differential atmospheric turbulence (loss of coherence with sky angle, i.e., anisoplanatism), and measurement noise in the fringe position. Each is quantified in turn below, and the expected measurement precision is the root-sum-squared of the terms.</p></div>

The sampling of the double fringe packet took a finite amount of time, first sampling one fringe, then the other. In the time domain the sampling function can be represented as a "top-hat" function convolved with a pair of delta functions (one positive, one negative).

The fringe packets of astrophysical sources were dispersed by an amount that depends on the difference in air paths between arms of the interferometer; this changed the shape and overall location of the fringe packets; see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. If two stars were in the same beam and identical in color, the change in location was common to both and canceled; similarly, the distortions of the fringe packets are common and canceled to first order in a differential measurement. Simulated data and reanalysis of real data with modified fringe templates showed that higher order terms in the fringe packet shape are negligible at the microarcsecond level. If, however, the two stars were of differing colors, each would be dispersed by a slightly different amount, and their apparent separation would be biased. The shift in the apparent position of each star's fringes can be approximated by evaluating the dispersion at the effective average wavelength of the star in the passband. The effective average wavelength was calculated by multiplying the instrumental bandpass by the stellar spectrum. For an order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect of differential dispersion, one can model the instrumental bandpass as a tophat function passing wavelengths 2 − 2.4µm (nominal K-band) and the stellar spectra as blackbodies. The shifts in apparent positions for several spectral types over 40 m of differential air path (a maximum amount for PTI) are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Note that for G5-K5 binaries, the amount is 35.8 µas and for B5-A5 it is 30.6 µas. For much more extreme color ratios, the effect can be as large as 150.6 µas for B5-M5 binaries; the PHASES sample did not include such systems, as their high contrast ratios prevented observation.</p><p>Because the stars were often observed at the same hour angles from one night to the next (and thus the delay positions are relatively common between nights), this effect introduced a much smaller scatter than that listed in the table. However, it may have introduced biases in the stellar separations and introduced scatter between observations taken in multiple baselines (for which the delay positions differed). These biases and scatters were of order the amounts given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The binaries in the PHASES sample were generally of components with equal brightnesses and thus similar colors. No hour-angle dependent biases significant on the level of the precision of the observations were observed. This effect is likely to be important for traditional narrow angle astrometry methods at the Keck Interferometer or Very Large Telescope Interferometer, which aim to use field stars as astrometric references for nearby stars, and reference and target will often have very different colors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Baseline Errors</head><p>The baseline vector used in the differential delay equation to determine astrometric quantities was derived by inversion of the delay equation from the fringe locations of point-like sources with known global astrometric positions. Uncertainties and variability of the baseline vector were sources of differential astrometry uncertainties via the differential delay equation. An incorrect baseline model would show up as an hour-angle dependent error term that would potentially increase night-to-night scatter beyond that predicted by the formal uncertainties; this was tested by dividing data sets within single nights into multiple sets by hour-angle range and the results were self-consistent.</p><p>No evidence of hour-angle dependent error terms was seen in the PHASES data, supporting evidence that the baseline models are correct. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>, except for a few outliers (likely due to using point sources with poor global astrometry values or a night's observation only covering a small range of hour angles or declinations) the night-to-night drift in baseline model solutions were less than 1 mm in north-south and east-west directions for the two primary baselines used for PHASES observations (NS and SW).

Of course, the baseline uncertainty vector − → σ B need not be oriented with − → B itself; its components σ Bx and σ By tangent to and σ Bz normal to the Earth (also referred to as the "U" or "Up" component) are introduced.

Though the measured component of ∆S continually varies as the Earth rotates the baseline vector, the above derivation is true at any given instant. Earth rotation causes errors to appear in both astrometric dimensions. A slightly more subtle baseline effect was that there can be differences between the wide-angle ("astrometric") and narrow-angle ("imaging") baselines. When determining the baseline vector via the delay positions for stars with known global astrometry solutions spread across the sky, the siderostats are repointed for each observation to place the target star on-axis. Thus, one was measuring the vector between the pivot points of the siderostats, about which the siderostats were repointed for each target. When measuring the separations between two stars in a single field with a single pointing of the telescopes, at least one of the stars would be off axis; one instead desired to know the separations between the corresponding points on the surfaces of the two siderostats to get the proper delay scale. Through careful optical design, PTI was built to minimize differences between the astrometric and imaging baselines in order that the original narrow angle astrometry mode would function at the 100 µas level for binaries with separations of tens of arcseconds. Because errors due to baseline uncertainty scale with binary separation, the effect was negligible at the level of a few microarcseconds for subarcsecond binaries in the PHASES sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Fringe Template</head><p>Because the astrometric measurements were differential between two stars, they were relatively insensitive to the model fringe template. The fringe model used in the astrometric analysis was determined by observing interferograms of single stars. An effective bandpass was constructed from an incoherent averaging of the periodograms of many such interferograms, and used to recompute a standard interferogram template, to be applied to the data. This effective bandpass was only an approximation for most stars, as there were variations in source temperature and spectra. However, reanalysis with several different fringe models showed variations only at the single microarcsecond level.</p></div>

Roughly an equal number of scans were obtained in each scan direction (to within 10%), and this effect canceled to first order (to the same level, 10% or 1 µas).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5.">Beam Walk</head><p>The interferometer telescopes imaged a sky field and then recollimated the light. Through this process, light from two stars separated on the sky by angle α was partially sheared with respect to each other and proceeded to illuminate slightly different parts of the optics that guide the light to the detector. Starlight in a recollimated beam that originated from different sky positions also developed relative shear equal to the path traveled multiplied by their angular separation (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). To the extent that the optics were imperfect (had rough surfaces), the light from each star traveled slightly different path-lengths from telescope to detector. This process is known as beam walk.</p><p>Colavita (2009) determined the extent to which beam walk introduces astrometric errors. That approximate stochastic analysis yielded an rms pathlength error ǫ given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ǫ ∼ w δ q q z 1/4 , δ ≪ q,</formula><p>where w is the rms wavefront error over an optic of diameter z, q is the diameter of the starlight footprint, and δ is the linear beamwalk. For optics with a surface quality of λ/20 peak-to-valley (like those used at PTI), the wavefront rms is w ≃ λ/40. The actual error is ∼ √ 2 larger than this due to the presence of two telescopes in the interferometer.</p><p>The first place where beam walk could occur was within the telescope itself. The beam was collimated at the telescope primary, focused by the primary, and recollimated to a q = 0.075 m beam by a z = 0.1 m diameter mirror to be fed to the "Fast Steering Mirror" (FSM; this mirror corrected for tip-tilt wavefront errors across the telescope, providing low-order adaptive optics). The distance from primary mirror to this mirror was the sum of their focal lengths, 4.75 m. The beam walk over 0.1 arcsec (4.8 × 10 −7 rad) was thus δ = 2.3 µm. Beam walk on the FSM thus contributed an astrometric error of 0.001 µas and was negligible.</p><p>The relative angles of starlight in the recollimated beam were increased by a factor of the ratio of the primary mirror and FSM focal lengths (5.33), thus light from sky locations separated by 0.1 arcsec had a differential angle of 0.533 arcsec (2.6 × 10 −6 rad).

This total travel is of order 50 m; the mirrors are typically z = 0.1 m diameter. The beam walk over 0.533 arcsec was δ = 130 µm, which contributed an astrometric error of 0.07 µas. There were a few mirrors along this path, and the total astrometric error would be determined by considering the optical qualities of all optics and adding the effects in quadrature. Because this beam walk was so small, the sum total of these remained negligible.</p><p>The movable mirrors were comprised of a parabolic mirror of focal length 1.07 m and a small (z ≈ 0.01 m) flat mirror located near its focus. Collimated light was directed to one side of the parabola, focused onto the flat mirror, then recollimated by the parabola's other side. On the flat mirror, the (diffraction-limited) beam diameter was only q ∼ λf /d = 31 µm where λ is the operating wavelength of light, f is the parabola's focal length, and d is the collimated beam diameter (0.075 m). The beam walk was 2.8 µm. The flat mirrors contributed an astrometric error of 0.9 µas from beam walk. It is concluded that beam walk did not contribute significant measurement errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6.">Global Astrometry Errors</head><p>Uncertainty in the global position of a target binary on the celestial sphere was coupled into the differential astrometric measurement. Errors in right ascension were equivalent to measurement timing errors; declination uncertainties had similar effects. The order of magnitude of this effect can be derived as follows: the fractional error in global astrometry (error in arcseconds divided by total number of arcseconds around a quarter circle) is roughly equal to the fractional error in differential astrometry separation vector (astrometric error divided by binary separation). A 1 arcsec global astrometry error caused differential astrometric errors of less than 3 µas for binaries of separation 1 arcsec or less. Typical uncertainties in global astrometry were much less than an arcsecond, with 10 mas being a much more common value. Effects such as stellar aberration (20 arcsec) were accounted for in the PHASES data reduction software; if ignored, these could cause significant differential astrometry uncertainties.</p></div>

Two reasonable approaches to correct this are to find a multiplicative scale factor by which to increase the formal uncertainties, or a noise floor to be added-inquadrature to the formal uncertainties. Unfortunately, no single multiplicative factor nor noise floor was found that could bring the measurement uncertainties and fit residuals into satisfactory agreement for a majority of the stars. The instrumental changes made in 2005 to introduce a longitudinal dispersion compensator (discussed in Section 3.2.1) and an automated alignment system further complicate this effort. However, upon dividing the measurements into two subsets according to whether or not the instrumental changes were implemented (the subset without the upgrades will be referred to as subset 1, that with the upgrades will be referred to as subset 2), and allowing for different scaling or noise floor factors in each subset, again no single solution was obtained.</p><p>Recognizing that both multiplicative factors and noise floors might be present, and could affect the major and minor axes of the uncertainty ellipses in different ways, a solution was sought to incorporate parameters for both types of terms, allowing for different values in the two axes and in the two subsets.

Three more systems had too few measurements in one or both subsets 1 and 2, and were not included in the analysis. Of the remaining 23 binaries, 15 (∼ 2/3) were selected for evaluation; the other ∼ 1/3 of the systems were not included allowing for the possibility that their increased levels of scatter were the result of astrophysical phenomena; however, the empirical scaling rules have been found to work satisfactorily on many of these as well, as a check of the rules' validities.</p><p>The size of the major and minor axes of each measurement was resized by the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">σ 2 (i,j),c = f 2 (i,j) σ 2 (i,j),raw + σ 2 (i,j),q</formula><p>where i = 1, 2 indicates the subset number, j = 1, 2 indicates whether it is the uncertainty ellipse major (1) or minor (2) axis, σ (i,j),c is the "corrected" 1-σ uncertainty, f (i,j) is a multiplicative scaling factor, σ (i,j),raw is the formal 1-σ uncertainty, and σ (i,j),q is a noise floor added in quadrature. An iterative procedure was used to optimize the values of the eight parameters f (i,j) and σ (i,j),q in order to produce the most statistically reasonable set of uncertainty ellipses to represent the observed scatter about Keplerian models for the 15 stars. The constraints for optimizing those eight parameters were: (1) within each subset, for each axis, the χ 2 r goodness-of-fit statistics computed along that axis should have minimal variance among the binaries (i.e. all the binaries being evaluated should have similarly good fits in a given axis), (2) averaged over all the binaries, the χ 2 r statistic computed within each subset/axis combinations should be equal to the other subset/axis (and unity; i.e. fit residuals should equally distributed among the various subsets and axes), and (3) the fits for as many binaries as possible should have χ 2 r as close to unity as possible. The eight parameters f (i,j) and σ (i,j),q were given nominal values, and the 15 binaries' PHASES measurements were fit to Keplerian models using the replacement uncertainty ellipses. The correction parameters were varied one at a time, each step recalculating the Keplerian models, until the variance of the χ 2 r among the binaries on the affected subset/axis was minimized (criterion 1). This was repeated over the eight parameters, after which the average χ 2 r was calculated in each of the four subset/axis combinations, and the parameters affecting each subset/axis combination were renormalized to force the average χ 2 r = 1 for that combination (criterion 2). This procedure was then iterated, varying the parameters individually to minimize χ 2 r variance followed by renormalizing to χ 2 r = 1 for each axis, until the parameter values converged.</p><p>The final parameter values that produced the best universal uncertainty scaling rules were found to be:</p><p>• f (1,1) = 1.3 (original instrument configuration, major axis);</p><p>• f (1,2) = 3.8 (original instrument configuration, minor axis);</p><p>• f (2,1) = 1.3 (revised instrument configuration, major axis);</p><p>• f (2,2) = 1.0 (revised instrument configuration, minor axis);</p><p>• σ (1,1),q = 140 µas (original instrument configuration, major axis);</p><p>• σ (1,2),q = 35 µas (original instrument configuration, minor axis);</p><p>• σ (2,1),q = 140 µas (revised instrument configuration, major axis);</p><p>• σ (2,2),q = 35 µas (revised instrument configuration, minor axis).</p><p>Only four non-trivial parameters end up being needed to correct the measurement uncertainties: a single multiplicative factor of 1.3 for the major axis (independent of subset), a multiplicative factor of 3.8 for the minor axis of data that lacked the dispersion compensator and/or automatic alignment system (f (2,2) = 1 is a trivial value representing no correction is needed), and noise floors of 140 and 35 µas to be added in quadrature to the major and minor axes, respectively (independent of subset). These values are not entirely surprising: a large multiplicative factor for the minor axis before the instrument revisions disappeared as those changes made the instrument more stable and increased path monitoring. A noise floor of 35 µas in the minor axis, regardless of subset, Note. -Column 1 is the star's HD Catalog Number, Column 2 is the total number of nights the star was observed, and Column 3 is the value of χ 2 r calculated for a Keplerian model. An asterisk appears in the fourth column of stars used to evaluate the uncertainty ellipse scaling rules.</p><p>is reasonably expected from the many noise sources described in Section 3. The root-sum-square of the errors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is 15 µas. Given that some of the simple arguments presented were designed to provide error estimates at only the factor of 2 level, the resulting 35 µas noise floor is not unreasonable. In addition, it is possible some differential dispersion persisted even with the dispersion compensator in place, though it certainly reduced the amount. Because the major axis represents a direction perpendicular to that at which the interferometer baseline was oriented at the average measurement time, the measurement along that axis is slow to build via Earth-rotation synthesis, and it is not surprising to find a small multiplicative factor and larger noise floor in that direction.</p><p>After applying these corrections to the measurement uncertainties, the χ 2 r statistic was calculated for Keplerian fits to the data of all 26 binaries having more than 10 observations. Fourteen of the 26 (54%) evaluate to 0.5 &lt; χ 2 r &lt; 1.5, and an additional two just miss the cutoff (with values of 0.44 and 0.46; including these would bring the total to 62%). Furthermore, four of the systems with too-large values of χ 2 r are much better modeled by a double Keplerian model, indicating an additional component may be present; see Paper V. The 26 binaries, number of observations, the fits' χ 2 r metrics, and which binaries were used to evaluate the scaling rules are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISTRIBUTION OF FIT RESIDUALS</head><p>To use the PHASES measurements for orbit fitting and companion searches, it was important to establish the statistical properties of the measurement residuals to determine whether they are Gaussian. Using uncertainties derived from the process outlined in Section 4, Keplerian orbits were fit for 19 of the 20 binaries presented in Paper II (HD 202444 has been omitted, since there is some evidence to suggest it hosts a substellar companion; see Paper V), as well as δ Equ (HD 202275), which has previously been studied at length ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Muterspaugh et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Muterspaugh et al. , 2008</ref>. The fits included all the non-PHASES and radial velocity measurements as listed in Paper II, rather than just the PHASES measurements, to ensure the residuals represented the best known binary motions. The PHASES measurement residuals along the minor axes of the error ellipses for these 20 binaries were normalized by their minor axis measurement uncertainties and combined into a joint residual distribution; a similar distribution was made for the major axis residuals. Histograms and continuous distribution functions (the latter being the integral of the histogram, which has the advantage of avoiding misinterpretation of the statistics caused by the granularity of bin size used in the histograms, though at the expense of being a less-familiar distribution), of the minor-and major-axis residuals are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, along with the theoretical distributions one would obtain from unit-deviation distribution (a Gaussian and an error function, respectively). The distributions agree quite well with the theoretical distributions, though there might be a slight excess number in the distribution wings. However, any excess is small, and Gaussian statistics are a reasonable approximation for orbit-fitting and companion search applications.</p></div>

An average of 1983 scans was used for each measurement, and the average formal minor-axis uncertainty is 13 µas. After the scaling laws from §4 were applied, the average minor-and major-axis uncertainties were 53 µas and 486 µas, respectively.</p></div>

The differential photometries were measured in the K p filter for faint systems, and a narrow band H 2 2-1 filter centered at 2.2622 µm for brighter binaries. Six systems of moderate brightness were measured with both filters.

Solutions for the three PTI baseline vectors. The three baselines at PTI were named "NS", "NW", and "SW" due to their rough orientations. Each was a three dimensional vector, which was given by components in the "East" (east-west), "North" (north-south), and "Up" (up-down) directions (the first two were tangent to the Earth, the last was perpendicular). Horizontal axes are time in modified Julian Days (MJD), vertical axes are baseline length in meters. Lines represent average baseline fits used for data reduction presented in this paper; points with error bars represent a given night's baseline solution. The baseline solutions were derived from the observed delay positions of single-star sources with known global astrometric positions via inversion of Equation 2. The y-axis tick marks in each plot are all 10 mm. Note that the scatter in the "Up" dimension was much larger than the other dimensions; this was due to preferential observing of targets overhead, for which the "Up" component is highly covariant with the constant term in the delay equation. The baseline solution used for data analysis was a weighted average of the solutions plotted.</figDesc></figure>
