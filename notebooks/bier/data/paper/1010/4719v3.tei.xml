				<p>We use three-dimensional simulations to study the atmospheric circulation on the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of an M star. We treat Gliese 581g as a scaled-up version of Earth by considering increased values for the exoplanetary radius and surface gravity, while retaining terrestrial values for parameters which are unconstrained by current observations. We examine the long-term, global temperature and wind maps near the surface of the exoplanet-the climate. The specific locations for habitability on Gliese 581g depend on whether the exoplanet is tidally-locked and how fast radiative cooling occurs on a global scale. Independent of whether the existence of Gliese 581g is confirmed, our study highlights the use of general circulation models to quantify the atmospheric circulation on potentially habitable, Earth-sized exoplanets, which will be the prime targets of exoplanet discovery and characterization campaigns in the next decade.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The next frontier in extrasolar planet-hunting is the discovery and characterization of Earth-sized exoplanets -"exo-Earths". A particularly promising route is to search for such planets around nearby M stars. M dwarf stars have several unique attributes that are driving exoplanet studies and astrobiology, as well as next-generation interferometry and direct imaging missions; they constitute at least 72% of nearby stars. As the least massive stars, they have the greatest reflex motion due to an orbiting exoplanet. Furthermore, the classical habitable (liquid water) zone around M dwarfs is typically located in the range ∼ 0.1-0.2 AU, corresponding to orbital periods of ∼ 20 to 50 days -well-matched to the capabilities of ground-based precision-Doppler surveys. With such short periods, hundreds of cycles of an exoplanet, with a mass of several times that of Earth, can be obtained within a decade, realizing factors of at least 10 in increased sensitivity for strictly periodic Keplerian signals and enabling Doppler reflex barycentric signals as small as 1 m s −1 to be recovered even in the presence of similar-amplitude stellar jitter and Poisson noise. Although these attributes have only recently become widely recognized by the astronomical community ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Scalo et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tarter et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Charbonneau et al. 2009</ref>), many of the nearest M stars have been prime targets for scrutiny by leading precision-radial-velocity surveys for over a decade now.</p><p>One of the most enticing and proximate exoplanetary systems being scrutinized is Gliese 581, with at least four exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>) orbiting a nearby (6.3 pc) M3V star. Two of the exoplanets announced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mayor et al. (2009)</ref> are apparently "super-Earths" that straddle its habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Selsis et al. 2007</ref>). Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vogt et al. (2010)</ref> announced two more exoplanet candidates orbiting this starone with a minimum mass of 3.1 M⊕ (Gliese 581g) and an orbital distance of about 0.15 AU, placing it squarely within the habitable zone of its parent star. It is generally accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lammer et al. 2010</ref>) that, for stellar masses below 0.6 M⊙, an Earth-mass exoplanet orbiting anywhere in the habitable zone becomes tidally locked 1 or spin-synchronized within the first Gyr of its origin, such that it keeps one face permanently illuminated with the other in perpetual darkness. Such tidal locking will greatly influence the climate across the exoplanet and figures prominently in any discussion of its potential habitability. Mollweide projection of the temperature and velocity fields near the surface (P = 0.95-1 bar) of Gliese 581g as modelled by our atmospheric circulation simulations assuming tidal locking. Left: simulation with the fiducial value of the radiative cooling time used in the Held-Suarez benchmark for Earth. Right: simulation with the radiative cooling time lengthened by the ratio of the orbital period of Gliese 581g to the rotational period of Earth (a factor of 36.562). Colors denote temperature (in K) and the arrows represent the direction of the velocity field. The resolution adopted is T63L20 <ref type="bibr">(192 × 96 × 20)</ref>. The snapshots are taken at 1200 and 3000 Earth days, for the left and right panels respectively, after the start of the simulations.</p><p>Independent of whether the existence of Gliese 581g is eventually confirmed, such discoveries motivate the study of atmospheric circulation on exo-Earths using three-dimensional simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Showman, Cho &amp; Menou 2010)</ref>, which is the focus of the present paper. Our underlying philosophy is to use Gliese 581g as a test bed and explore its atmospheric circulation -in the absence of observational constraints, we assume parameter values appropriate to the terrestrial atmosphere. Unlike in previous work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Joshi, Haberle &amp; Reynolds 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Joshi 2003)</ref>, we study only the essential dynamics of the atmosphere, choosing not to model the radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry, an approach which is commensurate with the quality of data currently available for Gliese 581g. We examine a suite of models both with and without the assumption of tidal locking. By systematically varying a set of physical parameters, we determine the major and minor parameters involved. We are primarily interested in the long-term, quasi-stable, large-scale circulation patterns -the climate -as opposed to the short-term temporal variations (the weather; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peixóto &amp; Oort 1984)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We describe our methods in §2, present our results in §3 and discuss their implications in §4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System</head><p>We implement the spectral dynamical core of the Flexible Modeling System (FMS) developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gordon &amp; Stern 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011)</ref>. Dynamical cores are codes that deal with the essential dynamics of atmospheric circulation, treat radiative cooling in a simplified manner (via Newtonian relaxation) and omit atmospheric chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Held &amp; Suarez 1994)</ref>. The governing equations solved are the primitive equations of meteorology, where the key assumption made is that of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smagorinsky 1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Smagorinsky , 1964</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vallis 2006</ref>). The boundary-layer friction between the terrestrial atmosphere and surface is treated using a simple linear prescription known as Rayleigh drag/friction.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref> and Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>, the first tinit = 200 Earth days of the simulations are discarded (unless otherwise stated); they are then run for trun = 1000 Earth days. Our results do not depend on the choice of tinit as long as it is chosen to be long enough that transient features due to initialization have been disregarded. We have verified this statement by performing multiple simulations with larger values of tinit and witnessed no difference in our results. Choosing a larger value of trun allows zonal-mean flow quantities to be averaged over a longer period of time, thus producing smoother profiles as functions of latitude and vertical pressure but otherwise yielding no qualitative difference in the results.</p><p>The numerical resolution adopted is T63L20 (192×96×20), which corresponds to a horizontal resolution of about 300 km. By contrast, the vertical pressure scale height is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H = kT mgp ≈ 60 km T 200 K m 2mH gp 14.3 m s −2 −1 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, m is the mass of the atmospheric molecule(s), gp is the acceleration due to gravity and mH is the mass of the hydrogen atom. For comparison, we note that the simulations of Joshi, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Haberle &amp; Reynolds (1997)</ref> and Joshi  (2003) use resolutions of T10L10 (32 × 16 × 10) and T21L22 (64 × 32 × 22), respectively. All of the simulations are started from an initial state of windless isothermality ( vinit = 0, Tinit = 264 K) and executed with constant time steps of ∆t = 900 s (i.e., ∼ 10 5 time steps in total). The value of Tinit was again chosen following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref> and Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>. Our conclusions do not depend on this choice as long as quasi-equilibrium is attained. However, we note that in their simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thrastarson &amp; Cho (2010)</ref> find the resulting structure of the atmospheric circulation to be qualitatively different depending on the assumed initial conditions. While it is likely that sensitivity to initial conditions scales with the depth of the atmosphere modelled, we consider such an exploration to be beyond the scope of our study. In their simplest form, the primitive equations collectively describe a frictionless heat engine, where no viscous terms exist to convert mechanical energy back into heat. This is operationally accomplished by the addition of a "hyperviscous" term, which also ensures numerical stability by quenching small-scale noise accumulating at the (horizontal) grid scale (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shapiro 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roeckner &amp; von Storch 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stephenson 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Menou &amp; Rauscher 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Following Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref>, we set the hyperviscous time scale to be 0.1 Earth days in a fourth-order hyperviscosity scheme.</p><p>Readers interested in more technical details of the model are referred to http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Held-Suarez forcing</head><p>The effects of stellar irradiation and geometry, known as the thermal forcing, on the atmosphere are encapsulated in the forcing function T force <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Held &amp; Suarez 1994)</ref>. In the classic Held-Suarez benchmark, the thermal forcing function is designed to reproduce the observed large-scale climate patterns on Earth,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T force = T0 − ∆TEP sin 2 Φ − ∆Tz ln P P0 cos 2 Φ P P0 κ ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where T0 = 315 K is the surface temperature at the equator (which we will scale down later), ∆TEP = 60 K is the temperature difference between the equator and the poles, P represents the vertical pressure and Φ denotes the latitude. The third term in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> is a stabilizing  term where ∆Tz = 10 K. Knowledge of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp and the ideal gas constant R allow for the specification of κ ≡ R/cp. In the absence of observational constraints, we adopt terrestrial values for these quantities: cp = 1004.64 J kg −1 K −1 , R = 287.04 J kg −1 K −1 and κ = 2/7. These values are plausible, since cp ∼ 10 3 J kg −1 K −1 for a wide variety of known gases and κ = 2/7 has been adopted even for simulations of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Menou &amp; Rauscher 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011</ref>). The surface pressure is initially assumed to be P0 = 1 bar, but we will explore variations in this parameter in §3.5. We have initially not considered the presence of a tropopause, but this possibility is examined in §3.6. Thermal forcing for a tidally-locked exoplanet can be mimicked by replacing the − sin 2 Φ term in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> can therefore be modified to become</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T force = T ′ 0 + ∆TEP cos (Θ − 180 • ) cos Φ − ∆Tz ln P P0 cos 2 Φ P P0 κ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where T ′ 0 is now the surface temperature at the poles. Operationally, we find that Gliese 581g simulations with ∆TEP = 60 K and assuming tidal locking do not come to quasi-equilibrium within the duration of the simulations (in the sense that the temperature map produced is discrepant from the forcing function), which is contrary to expectations because radiative cooling occurs quickly and the global temperature map should simply relax to the thermal forcing function (in the absence of initial background flow; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thrastarson &amp; Cho 2010)</ref>. We therefore execute several simulations with different values of ∆TEP to investigate this issue. We find that the global structure of the temperature and wind maps obtained are insensitive to the choice of ∆TEP within the range 10-60 K, a point we will explicitly demonstrate in §3.4. For operational reasons, we therefore select ∆TEP = 10 K for the tidally-locked case because the simulations do attain quasi-equilibrium. Nevertheless, ∆TEP is an unconstrained parameter of the system. Gliese 581g as a scaled-up Earth 5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Physical parameters: scaling</head><p>We next scale the value of T0 in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> to one appropriate to Gliese 581g. Using the scaling,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T0 ∝ L 1/4 a −1/2 , (4)</formula><p>where L is the stellar luminosity and a is the distance from the star, it follows that T0 = 278 K since Gliese 581 has a luminosity of 0.013 L⊙ and a = 0.14601 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mayor et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vogt et al. 2010)</ref>. Using this scaled value of T0 and ∆TEP = 10 K, we get T ′ 0 = 268 K. It is important to note that T0 is not the "equilibrium temperature" (i.e., blackbody equivalent) of the exoplanet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Selsis et al. 2007)</ref>, which is estimated to be Teq ≈ 230 K (assuming a Bond albedo of 0.3, typical for Solar System objects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vogt et al. 2010)</ref>. It is also important to note that typical estimates of Teq assume that energy is not transported from the permanent day to the night side (assuming tidal locking) of the exoplanet. On Earth, the equilibrium temperature is about 280 K, which is lower than the surface temperature of 315 K assumed in the Held-Suarez benchmark. The increased surface temperature is due to a combination of a non-zero surface albedo and the retention of (re-emitted) longwave radiation by greenhouse gases (mostly carbon dioxide and water vapour). Furthermore, the temperature difference between the equator and the poles is determined by a combination of atmospheric dynamics and seasonal variations (e.g., Vallis 2006), so the simple scaling in equation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> cannot be straightforwardly applied to ∆TEP. Therefore, we retain ∆TEP = 60 K in the case of a hypothetical Gliese 581g with a rotational period of one Earth day.</p><p>Only the minimum mass of Gliese 581g is currently known, but the dynamical stability analyses of Mayor et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2009)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Rp = Mp M⊕ 1/3 ρp ρ⊕ −1/3 R⊕,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and the surface gravity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">gp = Mp M⊕ 1/3 ρp ρ⊕ 2/3 g⊕,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where R⊕ = 6371 km and g⊕ = 980 cm s −2 . If Mp = 3.1 M⊕, then the scaling factor associated only with the mass is 1.46. If we instead have Mp = 4.3 M⊕ and 5.0 M⊕, then the scaling factors are 1.63 and 1.71, respectively.</p><p>In the spirit of a scaled-up Earth, we initially assume Gliese 581g to have the same mass density as Earth (ρp/ρ⊕ = 1) and take the minimum mass to be the actual mass, Mp = 3.1 M⊕, but explore the implications of raising the assumed mass to Mp = 4.3 M⊕ and 5.0 M⊕ in §3.2. In §3.3, we vary the assumed value of ρp/ρ⊕ and explore the implications. We may already anticipate that the flow structure is mainly determined by the rotational rate (Ωp) and the details of the gas physics (the frictional and radiative cooling times).</p><p>The observed orbital period of Gliese 581g is 36.562 Earth days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vogt et al. 2010)</ref>. If the exoplanet is tidally-locked, then the angular rotational frequency is Ωp = 1.989 × 10 −6 s −1 . In §3.7, we explore the implications of varying the global radiative cooling time for a tidally-locked Gliese 581g -in essence, we are quantifying the relative importance of cooling versus advection. If we relax the assumption of tidal locking, then we can explore the effect of varying the rotational frequency of the exoplanet ( §3.8). For example, if Gliese 581g has a rotational period of one Earth day, then Ωp = 7.292 × 10 −5 s −1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We begin by presenting results from a trio of baseline models, which we consider to be representative. Subsequently, we present a suite of simulations in which we systematically vary a set of physical parameters in order to determine which of them are significant. We conclude that the major parameters are the radiative cooling time τ rad and the rotational frequency Ωp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline models</head><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the Mollweide projection 3 of a snapshot from the simulation where Gliese 581g is assumed to have a mass of Mp = 3.1 M⊕, a mass density of ρp = ρ⊕, a surface pressure of P0 = 1 bar and is tidally-locked. The Newtonian cooling time is about 4 days, following the Held-Suarez benchmark for Earth (see §3.7). Since the rotational period of about 37 days is much longer than the radiative cooling time, the structure of the flow is sculpted by radiation rather than advection. The flow may also be modified by unresolved gravity waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Watkins &amp; Cho 2010)</ref>. The relatively fast cooling time implies that the global temperature map relaxes approximately to the input thermal forcing function.</p><p>While such visualizations are aesthetically pleasing, more insight is provided by looking at the temporally-averaged temperature and wind maps as functions of longitude and latitude -the long-term, quasi-stable climate. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, where we contrast both the tidally-locked and non-tidally-locked cases. For the tidally-locked case, the permanent day side of the exoplanet is just within the classical T = 0 • -100 • C habitable temperature range. In the non-tidally-locked case where the rotational period is assumed to be equal to one Earth day, the flow is dominated by advection rather than radiation with the temperatures at the equator hovering around a few degrees Celsius. The pair of global temperature maps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> makes the point that conclusions on the exact locations for habitability on the surface of an exo-Earth depend upon whether the assumption of tidal locking is made (see also §3.8). Even on the cold night side, the temperatures are comparable to those experienced in Antarctica where colonies of algae have been discovered and analyzed <ref type="bibr">(Edwards et al. 2004a,b)</ref>. All of these statements are made keeping in mind that temperature is a necessary but insufficient condition for habitability (see §4). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show the global zonal and meridional wind maps, respectively. In the case of a tidally-locked Gliese 581g, fluid is transported across hemispheric scales at speeds ∼ 1 m s −1 , comparable to typical wind speeds on Earth. The wind patterns have a slight asymmetry from west to east due to the rotation of the exoplanet. If the exoplanet instead has a rotational period of one Earth day (and is not tidally locked), there is longitudinal homogenization of the winds with a counter-rotating jet at the equator and super-rotating jets at mid-latitude. The meridional wind map is now characterized by smaller structures. The slightly faster wind speeds recovered from the simulation with a rotational period of one Earth day are artifacts of assuming a higher value of ∆TEP (60 K versus 10 K)-nevertheless, the global structure of the wind maps are robust predictions of the simulations, which we will demonstrate in §3.4.</p><p>To further explore the interplay between radiative cooling and advection, we execute another simulation where the radiative cooling (originally 4 Earth days) and Rayleigh friction (originally 1 Earth day) times are set to be 36.562 times their fiducial values -in essence, we are scaling by the ratio of the observed orbital period of Gliese 581g to the rotational period of Earth. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Basically, we are exploring the possibility that there is an unidentified cooling mechanism with a time scale that scales as the rotational period (assuming tidal locking). The key point is not in the exact value of this lengthening of the cooling time, but that it may well exceed the rotational period on a tidally-locked exoplanet. Due to the longer cooling time assumed, we now run the simulation for 3000 Earth days and discard the first 2000 days so as to attain quasi-equilibrium. The Mollweide snapshot of the temperature and velocity fields, as well as the long-term wind maps, are shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. Since advection occurs somewhat faster than radiative cooling, zonal winds on the exoplanetary surface develop a stronger east-west asymmetry and there are hints of energy transport from the permanent day to the night side. The chevronshaped feature residing around the substellar point is reminiscent of that seen at ∼ 0.1 bar in 3D atmospheric circulation simulations of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Menou &amp; Rauscher 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011)</ref>. Trailing the feature are large-scale vortices spanning about a third of the hemisphere in size -their large sizes are a consequence of the Rossby deformation length scale being relatively larger due to the slower rotation of the exoplanet when tidally locked ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cho et al. 2003</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>, we show the zonally-and temporally-averaged zonal wind speeds obtained from our trio of baseline models. The models with tidal locking both have equatorial, super-rotating winds, where a longer radiative cooling time leads to faster speeds because of the increased effectiveness of advection. The non-tidally-locked model which assumes a rotational period of one Earth day has a counter-rotating wind at the equator; its faster speed is again an artifact of assuming a larger value of ∆TEP. Similar to how the Rossby length scale is increased because of slower rotation, the larger Rhines scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Showman, Cho &amp; Menou 2010</ref>) in the tidally-locked models results in broader jets across latitude.</p><p>The trio of simulations presented here capture the essential physics of our simple model. In the sub-sections that follow, we will explore multiple variations on a theme, so as to ascertain the major and minor physical parameters involved in determining the atmospheric dynamics of an exo-Earth. In doing so, we will explicitly demonstrate some of the statements made in this sub-section.</p><p>Gliese 581g as a scaled-up Earth 7 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Varying the exoplanetary mass Mp</head><p>Assuming the exoplanets orbiting Gliese 581 to be in coplanar orbits, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mayor et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vogt et al. (2010)</ref> were able to set upper limits on Mp of 4.3 M⊕ and 5.0 M⊕, respectively, using stability analyses that considered 4 and 6 orbiting exoplanets. We thus explore the implications of varying Mp/M⊕ while keeping ρp/ρ⊕ = 1. As is evident from equations (5) and (6), raising the exoplanetary mass to the (maximum) values implied by the stability analyses increases both the radius and the surface gravity, but in these cases by less than a factor of 2. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, it is therefore unsurprising that while varying Mp yields minor quantitative differences in the global wind maps near the surface (P = 0.95-1 bar), the qualitative features are largely invariant to Mp.</p></div>

Higher exoplanetary masses generally result in larger radii and higher surface gravities. However, a denser exoplanet has a smaller radius but higher surface gravity (and vice versa). To gain some intuition for the possible range of mass densities involved, we note that Kuiper Belt objects have typical densities ∼ 2 g cm −3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fraser &amp; Brown 2010)</ref>, while the gas giants in our Solar System have densities ∼ 1 g cm −3 . By contrast, the Earth has a density of about 5.5 g cm −3 . It is unlikely that ρp can vary by an order of magnitude or more. Thus, we explore the implications when ρp/ρ⊕ = 1/3 and 3 (i.e., half an order of magnitude lower or higher than ρ⊕) and Mp = 3.1 M⊕.</p><p>Even with marked differences in the radii (6441 km versus 13397.9 km) and surface gravities (690 cm s −2 versus 2970 cm s −2 ) between the pair of simulations, the global wind maps in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> demonstrate that the mass density ρp of the exoplanet is a minor parameter of the system.</p></div>

It is still possible that ∆TEP &gt; 60 K on exo-Earths in general, which will have strong consequences for the climate.

The first retains Tstrat = 200 K as in the case of Earth, while the second uses equation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> to scale the value of Tstrat down to 177 K. The point is not in the exact value of Tstrat adopted but rather the change it causes in the zonal-mean zonal wind profile. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows both the zonal-mean zonal wind profiles and the global wind maps produced by the simulations. The zonal-mean zonal wind profile is characterized by a super-rotating, equatorial jet situated at P ≈ 0.2-0.4 bar (for P0 = 1 bar), where a lower stratospheric temperature corresponds to the jet residing higher up in the atmosphere simply because the tropopause is situated at a greater height in this case. Interestingly, these differences do not translate into any qualitative differences for the global wind maps near the surface (P = 0.95-1 bar) of the exoplanet, leading us to conclude that the presence of a tropopause does not have a major effect unless it reaches down to near the surface of the exoplanet.</p></div>

As the last variation on a theme, we explore models where the assumption of tidal locking is removed and the rotational period is assumed to be 1, 3, 10 and 20 Earth days (and where τ rad and τ fric have been reverted to their fiducial values). Since the observed orbital period of Gliese 581g is about 37 days, we can use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> for the thermal forcing function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have presented three-dimensional simulations of atmospheric circulation using the exo-Earth candidate Gliese 581g as a test bed. Our starting point is a dynamical model that is similar to the Held-Suarez benchmark for Earth, which is calibrated to reproduce terrestrial observations of large-scale climate patterns. Using this model as a baseline, we then present global temperature and wind maps which assume Gliese 581g to be tidally locked. The salient, qualitative conclusion gleaned from our study is that a "dance" occurs between the exoplanet and its host star. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al. 2008</ref>.) When radiative cooling dominates over advection, the star successfully imprints its thermal signature on the exoplanet, which then resembles a sphere painted "half black and half white" (left panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1 and 2)</ref> akin to the way one usually visualizes the permanent day and night sides of a tidally-locked exoplanet in a cartoon or schematic diagram. When advection occurs more efficiently than radiative cooling, the exoplanet leads the dance and smears out the thermal forcing imposed by the star evenly across longitude (right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). In the intermediate regime between these two cases, the exoplanet only partially succeeds in the longitudinal homogenization of temperature, an example of which is shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In this case, the simple picture of the permanent day and night sides becomes more involved.</p><p>In the context of the classical 0 • -100 • C range of temperatures for habitability, our main finding is that the specific locations for c 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-15 habitability on the surface of Gliese 581g -and exo-Earths in general -depend on whether the exoplanet is tidally-locked and how fast radiative cooling occurs on a global scale. A shortcoming of our approach is that we have neglected the effects of radiative transfer, which may have little effect on the large-scale climate patterns but will almost certainly alter the absolute values of the temperaturesfor example, including the effects of CO2 may result in temperatures warmer than what we find (i.e., the greenhouse effect). The age-old question of whether an exoplanet is inhabitable constitutes an active field and a broad range of approaches has been adopted by various researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Selsis et al. (2007)</ref> used 1D radiative-convective atmospheric models to assess the conditions on Gliese 581c and 581d, and find the latter to be potentially the first habitable exoplanet discovered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wordsworth et al. (2011)</ref> also used a 1D radiative-convective scheme, which included CO2 and H2O clouds, to examine the habitability of Gliese 581d. They find CO2 to be an important ingredient in maintaining global temperatures above the freezing point of water -increasing the surface gravity of the exoplanet reduces the CO2 column density, which results in global cooling of its surface. They also find Rayleigh scattering to be less important for the redder spectra of M class stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wordsworth et al. (2010)</ref> followed up with preliminary results from a three-dimensional climate model that focused on a pure CO2 atmosphere, using the early Martian atmosphere as a baseline. They raised the concern that CO2 is able to condense out in the colder regions of the exoplanet and may lead to (CO2) atmospheric collapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dvorak et al. (2010)</ref> examine the interplay between the dynamical stability of systems with multiple stars and/or exoplanets and their habitable zones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lammer et al. (2010)</ref> emphasize the coupling between the geophysical activity of the exoplanet and the properties of its parent star. Even the definition of the inner edge of the habitable zone depends on the amount of cloud cover on the exoplanet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Selsis et al. 2007</ref>). Generally, these studies make the point that an exoplanet found outside of the classical habitable zone may not be uninhabitable -conversely, an exoplanet found within the zone may not be inhabitable. Furthermore, a seemingly inhospitable exoplanetary surface does not exclude the possibility of subsurface habitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gold 1992)</ref>. Although Gliese 581 itself is observed to exhibit weak Ca II H and K emission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>), it is well known that M dwarfs in general are chromospherically active <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stauffer &amp; Hartmann 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Scalo et al. 2007</ref>) and it is likely that stellar activity will modify the exoplanetary atmosphere away from the terrestrial baseline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Selsis et al. 2007)</ref>. It is also plausible that slower rotation results in weaker magnetospheres, which in turn weakens the ability of the exoplanet to shield itself from stellar irradiation -in the most extreme case, no atmosphere may exist at all. One may also study the effects of atmospheric chemistry, cloud cover, oceans and a hydrological cycle on the atmospheric circulation of exo-Earths ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Joshi, Haberle &amp; Reynolds 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Joshi 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pierrehumbert 2011</ref>), but in the absence of observational constraints on the atmosphere of Gliese 581g we have chosen to omit these additional details. As such observational constraints become available, the models should evolve in sophistication to be commensurate with the astronomical data. When astronomical instrumentation becomes advanced enough to measure the phase curves from exo-Earths, then the relative importance of advection versus radiative cooling may be quantified <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cowan &amp; Agol 2011</ref>) and hence a subset of our models may be verified or refuted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
