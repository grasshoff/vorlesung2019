			<abstract>
				<p>The primary science goal of the Kepler Mission is to provide a census of exoplanets in the solar neighborhood , including the identification and characterization of habitable Earth-like planets. The asteroseismic capabilities of the mission are being used to determine precise radii and ages for the target stars from their solar-like oscillations. Chaplin et al. (2010) published observations of three bright G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5 d of science operations. One of these stars, the subgiant KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived asteroseismic estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from Kepler photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of KIC 11026764 with a precision near 1%, and an accuracy near 2% for the radius and 15% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination of its fundamental properties.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In March 2009 NASA launched the Kepler satellite, a mission designed to discover habitable Earth-like planets around distant Sun-like stars. The satellite consists of a 0.95-m telescope with an array of digital cameras that will monitor the brightness of more than 150,000 solar-type stars with a precision of a few parts-per-million for 4-6 years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Borucki et al. 2007</ref>). Some of these stars are expected to have planetary systems, and some of the planets will have orbits such that they periodically pass in front of the host star, causing a brief de- crease in the amount of light recorded by the satellite. The depth of such a transit contains information about the size of the planet relative to the size of the host star.</p><p>Since we do not generally know the precise size of the host star, the mission design includes a revolving selection of 512 stars monitored with the higher cadence that is necessary to detect short period solar-like oscillations, allowing us to apply the techniques of asteroseismology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aerts et al. 2010</ref>). Even a relatively crude analysis of such measurements can lead to reliable determinations of stellar radii to help characterize the extra-solar planetary systems discovered by the mission, and stellar ages to reveal how such systems evolve over time. For the asteroseismic targets that do not contain planetary companions, these data will allow a uniform determination of the physical properties of hundreds of solar-type stars, providing a new window on stellar structure and evolution.</p><p>Initial results from the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation were presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gilliland et al. (2010a)</ref>, while a more detailed analysis of the solar-like oscillations detected in several early targets was published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al. (2010)</ref>. The latter paper includes observations of three bright (V∼9) G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5 d of science operations. One of these stars, the subgiant KIC 11026764 (≡ 2MASS J19212465+4830532 ≡ BD+48 2882 ≡ TYC 3547-12-1), exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly.</p><p>In unevolved stars, the high radial order (n) acoustic oscillation modes (p-modes) with a given spherical degree (l) are almost evenly spaced in frequency. As the star evolves and the envelope expands, the p-mode frequencies gradually decrease. Meanwhile, as the star becomes more centrally condensed, the buoyancy-driven (g-mode) oscillations in the core shift to higher frequencies. This eventually leads to a range of frequencies where the nonradial (l &gt; 0) oscillation modes can take on a mixed character, behaving like g-modes in the core and p-modes in the envelope ("mixed modes"), with their frequencies shifted as they undergo socalled avoided crossings <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Osaki 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aizenman et al. 1977)</ref>. This behavior changes relatively quickly with stellar age, and propagates from one radial order to the next as the star continues to evolve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. Consequently, those modes that deviate significantly from uniform frequency spacing yield a strong (though model-dependent) constraint on the age of the star (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Christensen-Dalsgaard 2004)</ref>. Avoided crossings have been observed in the subgiant stars η Boo ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kjeldsen et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kjeldsen et al. , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Carrier et al. 2005</ref>) and β Hyi ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bedding et al. 2007)</ref>, and possibly also in Procyon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bedding et al. 2010</ref>) and HD 49385 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Deheuvels et al. 2010)</ref>. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gilliland et al. (2010a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al. (2010)</ref> the dipole (l = 1) modes observed in KIC 11026764 show the signature of an avoided crossing, raising the exciting possibility that detailed modeling of this star will provide a very precise determination of its age.</p><p>In this paper we derive the stellar age, radius and other characteristics of KIC 11026764 by matching both the observed oscillation frequencies from Kepler photometry and the best available spectroscopic constraints from ground-based observations. We describe the extraction and identification of the oscillation frequencies in §2, and the analysis of ground-based data for spectroscopic constraints in §3. In §4 we provide the details of the independent codes and analysis methods used for the fitting, and in §5 we describe our final modeling results. We summarize and discuss the broader significance of the results in §6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimal Frequency Set (µHz)</head><p>Maximal Frequency Set (µHz) tions <ref type="bibr">(2009 May 12 to June 14)</ref>. Time series data were then prepared from the raw observations in the manner described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gilliland et al. (2010b)</ref>. The power spectrum is shown in Figures 1 and 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al. (2010)</ref>. Eight teams extracted estimates of the mode frequencies of the star. The teams used slightly different strategies to extract those estimates, but the main idea was to maximize the likelihood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson et al. 1990</ref>) of a multi-parameter model designed to describe the frequency-power spectrum of the time series. The model included Lorentzian peaks to describe the p-modes, with flat and power-law terms in frequency (e.g., Harvey 1985) to describe instrumental and stellar background noise. The fitting strategies followed well-established recipes. Some teams performed a global fit-optimizing simultaneously every free parameter needed to describe the observed spectrum (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Appourchaux et al. 2008</ref>)-while others fit the spectrum a few modes at a time, an approach traditionally adopted for Sun-as-a-star data (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chaplin et al. 1999</ref>). Some teams also incorporated a Bayesian approach, with the inclusion of priors in the optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to map the posterior distributions of the estimated frequencies (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Benomar et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Campante et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n * l = 0 l = 1 l = 2 l = 0 l = 1 l =</formula><p>We then implemented a procedure to select two of the eight sets of frequencies, which would subsequently be passed to the modeling teams. Use of individual sets-as opposed to some average frequency set-meant that the modeling could rely on an easily reproducible set of input frequencies, which would not be the case for an average set. We selected a minimal frequency set to represent the modes that all teams agreed upon within the errors, and a maximal frequency set, which included all possible frequencies identified by at least two of the teams, as explained below.</p><p>From the sets of frequencies ν nl,i provided by the eight teams, we calculated a list of average frequencies ¯ ν nl . For each mode {n, l}, we computed the number of teams returning frequencies that satisfied</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">|ν nl,i − ¯ ν nl | ≤ σ nl,i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with σ nl,i representing the frequency uncertainties returned by each team. We then compiled a minimal list of modes. For each {n, l} we counted the total number of teams with identified frequencies, as well as the number of those frequencies that satisfied Eq.(1). Modes for which all identifications satisfied the inequality were added to the minimal list. We also compiled a maximal list of modes, subject to the much more relaxed criterion that the {n, l} satisfying Eq.(1) should be identified by at least two teams.</p><p>In the final stage of the procedure, we computed for each of the eight frequency sets the normalized root-mean-square (rms) deviations with respect to the ¯ ν nl of the minimal and maximal lists of modes. The frequency set with the smallest rms deviation with respect to the minimal list was chosen to be the minimal frequency set, while the set with the smallest rms deviation with respect to the maximal list was chosen to be the maximal frequency set. The minimal frequency set was also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al. (2010)</ref>, and provided the initial constraints for the modeling teams (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The maximal frequency set was used later for additional validation, as explained in §5. Note that the same modes have slightly different frequencies in these two sets, since they come from individual analyses. The true radial order (n) of the modes can only be determined from a stellar model, so we provide arbitrary reference values for convenience.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Latham et al. 2005</ref>) as derived from photometric observations acquired in the Sloan filters are T eff = 5502 K, log g = 3.896 dex, and [Fe/H] = −0.255 dex. The quoted uncertainties on these values are 200 K in T eff and 0.5 dex in log g and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. Since this level of precision is minimally useful for asteroseismic modeling, we acquired a highresolution spectrum of the star to derive more accurate values of its effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Observations and Data Reduction</head><p>The spectrum was acquired with the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph (FIES) at the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope <ref type="bibr">36</ref> http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kepler_fov/search.php (NOT) on 2009 November 9 <ref type="bibr">(HJD 2455145.3428</ref>). The 1800 s exposure covers the wavelength range 3730-7360 Å at a resolution R∼67000 and signal-to-noise ratio S/N = 80 at 4400 Å. The Th-Ar reference spectrum was acquired immediately after the stellar spectrum. The reduction was performed with the FIESTOOL software, which was developed specifically for the FIES instrument and performs all of the conventional steps of echelle data reduction <ref type="bibr">37</ref> . This includes the subtraction of bias frames, modeling and subtraction of scattered light, flat-field correction, extraction of the orders, normalization of the spectra (including fringe correction), and wavelength calibration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Atmospheric Parameters</head><p>We derived the atmospheric parameters of KIC 11026764 using several methods to provide an estimate of the external errors on T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, which would be used in the asteroseismic modeling. The five independent reductions included: the VWA 38 software package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bruntt et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bruntt et al. , 2010a</ref>, the MOOG 39 code <ref type="bibr">(Sneden 1973)</ref>, the ARES 40 code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Sousa et al. 2007</ref>), the SYNSPEC method <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hubeny 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hubeny &amp; Lanz 1995)</ref>, and the ROTFIT code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Frasca et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Frasca et al. , 2006</ref>). The principal characteristics of the methods employed by each of these codes are described below, and the individual results are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>For the VWA method, the T eff , log g and microturbulence of the adopted MARCS atmospheric models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gustafsson et al. 2008</ref>) are adjusted to minimize the correlations of Fe I with line strength and excitation potential. The atmospheric parameters are then adjusted to ensure agreement between the mean abundances of Fe I and Fe II. Additional constraints on the surface gravity come from the two wide Ca lines at 6122 and 6162 Å, and from the Mg-1b lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bruntt et al. 2010b</ref>). The final value of log g is the weighted mean of the results obtained from these methods. The mean metallicity is calculated only from those elements (Si, Ti, Fe and Ni) exhibiting at least 10 lines in the observed spectrum. The uncertainties in the derived atmospheric parameters are determined by perturbing the computed models, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bruntt et al. (2008)</ref>. Having computed the mean atmospheric parameters for the star, VWA finally determines abundances for all of the elements contained in the spectrum (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). No trace of Li I 6707.8 absorption is seen in the spectrum of KIC 11026764. We estimate an upper limit for the equivalent width EW ≤ 5 mÅ.</p><p>The 2002 version of the MOOG code determines the iron abundance under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), using a grid of 1D model atmospheres by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kurucz (1993)</ref>. The LTE iron abundance was derived from the equivalent widths of 65 Fe I and 10 Fe II lines in the 4830-6810 Å range, measured with a Gaussian fitting procedure in the IRAF 41 task splot. For the analysis, we followed the prescription of <ref type="bibr">Randich et al. (2006)</ref>, using the same list of lines as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Biazzo et al. (2010)</ref>. The effective temperature and microturbulent velocity were determined by requiring that the iron abundance be independent of the excitation potentials and the equivalent widths of Fe I lines. The surface gravity was determined by requiring ionization equilibrium between Fe I and Fe II. The initial values for the effective temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulence were chosen to be solar (T eff = 5770 K, log g = 4.44 dex, and ξ = 1.1 km s −1 ). ARES provides an automated measurement of the equivalent widths of absorption lines in stellar spectra: the LTE abundance is determined differentially relative to the Sun with the help of MOOG and a grid of ATLAS-9 plane-parallel model atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kurucz 1993)</ref>. We used ARES with two different lists of iron lines: a 'short' one composed of isolated iron lines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Sousa et al. 2006</ref>), and a 'long' one composed of iron lines suitable for automatic measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Sousa et al. 2008</ref>). Our computations resulted in two consistent sets of atmospheric parameters for KIC 11026764.</p><p>SYNSPEC provides synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, either calculated by TLUSTY or taken from the literature. We used the new grid of ATLAS-9 models <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kurucz 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Castelli &amp; Kurucz 2003</ref>) to calculate synthetic spectra, which were then compared to the observed spectrum. Based on the list of iron lines from <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Sousa et al. (2008)</ref>, we derived the stellar parameters in two ways to estimate the uncertainty due to the normalization of the observed spectrum. For the first approach we determined the minimum χ 2 of the deviation between the synthetic iron lines and the observed spectrum for a fixed set of stellar parameters. For the second approach, we determined the best fitting effective temperature and surface gravity for each iron line from the list, and adopted stellar parameters from the mean. The primary uncertainty in the final parameters arises from the correlation between the effective temperature and surface gravity: a reduction of the effective temperature can be compensated by a reduction of the gravity. While the χ 2 method results in lower values for both parameters (T eff = 5560 K, log g = 3.62 dex), the averaging approach yields higher values (T eff = 5701 K, log g = 3.95 dex). The differences between the two results exceed the formal errors of each method. We therefore adopt the mean, and assume half of the difference for the uncertainty. The metallicity is determined by minimizing the scatter in the parameters derived from individual lines.</p><p>ROTFIT performs a simultaneous and fast determination of T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] for a star-as well as its projected rotational velocity v sin i-by comparing the observed spectrum with a library of spectra for reference stars (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Katz et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Soubiran et al. 1998</ref>). The adopted estimates for the stellar parameters come from a weighted mean of the pa- rameters for the 10 reference stars that most closely resemble the target spectrum, which is quantified by a χ 2 measure. We applied the ROTFIT code to all echelle orders between 21-69, which cover the range 4320-6770 Å in the observed spectrum. We also derived a projected rotational velocity for KIC 11026764 of 2.8 ± 1.6 km s −1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Adopted Spectroscopic Constraints</head><p>The effective temperature of KIC 11026764 derived from the five methods outlined above generally have overlapping 1σ errors. They all point to a star that is hotter than the KIC estimate by 100-300 K. We find reasonable agreement between the derived values for surface gravity and the KIC estimate. Most of the applied methods result in log g above 4.0 dex, again slightly higher than in the KIC. Only VWA and SYNSPEC yield slightly lower values, which is not surprising considering the correlation between T eff and log g. Finally, all of the methods agree that the star is slightly metalrich compared to the Sun, in contrast to the photometric estimate of [Fe/H] = −0.255 dex from the KIC. The initial set of spectroscopic constraints provided to the modeling teams (see §4) came from a mean of the preliminary results from the analyses discussed above, with uncertainties large enough to cover the full range for each parameter: T eff = 5635 ± 185 K, log g = 3.95 ± 0.25 dex, and [Fe/H] = −0.06 ± 0.25 dex.</p><p>For the final estimate of the atmospheric parameters (see §5) we adopted the results from the VWA method, since it has been carefully tested against direct methods for 10 nearby solar-type stars. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bruntt et al. (2010a)</ref> used VWA to determine T eff from high-quality spectra and these values were compared to a direct method (nearly independent of model atmospheres) using the measured angular diameters from interferometry and bolometric flux measurements. A comparison of the direct (interferometric) and indirect (VWA) methods showed only a slight offset of −40 ± 20 K, and this offset has been removed for KIC 11026764. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bruntt et al. (2010a)</ref> determined the spectroscopic log g parameter, which agrees very well for the three binary stars in their sample where the absolute masses and radii (and hence log g) have been measured. Based on these comparisons of direct and indirect methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bruntt et al. (2010a)</ref> also discuss the issue of realistic uncertainties on spectroscopic parameters, and their estimates of the systematic uncertainties have been incorporated into the adopted values from VWA listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">STELLAR MODEL SEARCH</head><p>Starting with the minimal frequency set described in §2 and the initial set of spectroscopic constraints from §3, eleven teams of modelers performed a "meta-search" of the parameter space. Each modeler had complete freedom to decide on the input physics and fitting strategy to optimize the match to the observations. The results of the individual fits were evaluated in a uniform manner and ranked according to the total χ 2 between the observed and calculated values of the individual oscillation frequencies and the spectroscopic properties. These individual fits are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>, and the details of the codes and fitting strategies employed by each team of modelers are described in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Model A</head><p>We employed the Aarhus stellar evolution code (ASTEC; Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008a) for stellar evolution computations, and the adiabatic pulsation package (ADIPLS; Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008b) for frequency calculations. The input physics for the evolution calculations included the OPAL 2005 equation of state <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Rogers &amp; Nayfonov 2002)</ref>, OPAL opacity tables ) with lowtemperature opacities from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ferguson et al.

We did not include diffusion or convective overshoot in the models.</p><p>We computed several grids of evolutionary tracks spanning the parameter space around the values given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al.

Since the adopted spectroscopic errors are large, they provide much more flexibility for the models compared to the individual frequencies with relatively small errors. Consequently, the fitting algorithm found it advantageous to shift the effective temperature and metallicity by several σ from their target values to achieve significantly better agreement with the 22 oscillation frequencies. The improvement in the frequency match outweighed the degradation in the spectroscopic fit for the calculation of χ 2 . The solution to this problem may be to calculate a separate value of χ 2 for the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints, and then average them to provide more equal weight to the two types of constraints. This is an important lesson for future automated searches, and explains why Model D does not align with either of the two major families of solutions.</p></div>

SEEK uses the large and small separations and the median frequency of the observed modes as asteroseismic inputs. Values of ∆ν 0 = 50.68 ± 1.30 (computed with l = 0 modes only) and δν 0,2 = 4.28 ± 0.73 (computed from l = 0, 2 modes) were derived from Kepler data around a central value 900 µHz. Each separation is the mean of the individual observed separations, while the error is the standard deviation of the individual values from the mean. These values differ slightly from those given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chaplin et al. (2010)</ref> because they are calculated from the individual frequencies rather than derived from the power spectrum. Using these asteroseismic inputs along with the initial spectroscopic constraints, we obtained the parameters listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. For a SEEK analysis of the importance of the asteroseismic constraints, see Appendix B.</p><p>4.11. Model K To investigate how well we can find an appropriate model without comparing individual oscillation frequencies, we used the RADIUS pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stello et al. 2009a</ref>), which takes T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and ∆ν as the only inputs to find the best fitting model. The value of ∆ν = 50.8 ± 0.3 µHz from Chaplin et al. (2010) was adopted. The pipeline is based on a large grid of ASTEC models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008a</ref>) using the EFF equation of state ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Eggleton et al. 1973</ref>). We use the opacity tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rogers &amp; Iglesias (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kurucz (1991)</ref> for T &lt; 10 4 K with the solar mixture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Grevesse &amp; Noels (1993)</ref>. Rotation, overshooting and diffusion were not included. The grid was created with fixed values of the mixing-length parameter (α = 1.8) and the initial hydrogen abundance (X i = 0.7). The resolution in log Z was 0.1 dex between 0.001 &lt; Z &lt; 0.055, and the resolution in mass was 0.01 M ⊙ from 0.5 to 4.0 M ⊙ . The evolution begins at the ZAMS and continues to the tip of the red giant branch.</p><p>To convert between the model values of Z and the observed <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, we used Z ⊙ = 0.0188 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cox 2000)</ref>.</p><p>We made slight modifications to the RADIUS approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stello et al. (2009a)</ref>. First, the large frequency separation was derived by scaling the solar value <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995</ref>) instead of calculating it directly from the model frequencies. Although there is a known systematic difference between these two ways of deriving ∆ν, the effect is probably below the 1% level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Stello et al. 2009b</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Basu et al. 2010</ref>). Second, we pinpointed a single best-fitting model based on a χ 2 formalism that was applied to all models within ±3σ of the observed properties. The properties of the best fitting model are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. This model shows a frequency pattern in the échelle diagram that looks very similar to the observations if we allow a small tweaking of the adopted frequency separation (52.1µHz) used to generate the échelle. This basically means that we found a model that homologously represents the observations quite well. In particular, we see relative positions of the l = 1 mode frequencies that are very similar to those observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">MODEL-FITTING RESULTS</head><p>Based on the value of χ 2 from the initial search in §4, we adopted two reference models (Models A and B in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>) each constructed with a very different set of input physics, but almost equally capable of providing a good match to the observations. Note that Model A does not include overshoot or diffusion, while Model B includes overshoot, diffusion and a full treatment of rotation. These two models differ significantly in the optimal values of the mass, effective temperature, metallicity and luminosity, but they both agree with the observational constraints at approximately the same level (χ 2 ∼ 10). With the exceptions of Models D and I (see subsections above), the other independent analyses generally fall into the two broad families of solutions defined by Models A and B. The lower mass family includes Models A, F, H, J and K, while the higher mass family includes Models B, C, E and G. We identified several additional asteroseismic constraints from the maximal frequency set (see §2) and we adopted revised spectroscopic constraints from VWA (see §3) to refine our analysis of Models A and B using several different codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Refining the Best Models</head><p>Comparing the theoretical frequencies of Models A and B with the maximal frequency set from §2, we identified four of the seven additional oscillation modes that could be used for refined model-fitting (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Recall that the maximal frequency set comes from the individual analysis with the smallest rms deviation with respect to the maximal list, so the frequencies of the modes from the minimal set are slightly different in the maximal set. Without any additional fitting, these subtle frequency differences improve the χ 2 of Models A and B when comparing them to those modes from the maximal set that are also present in the minimal set. There is one additional l = 0 mode (n = 12) and three additional l = 2 modes (n = 11, <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref>) in the maximal set that are within 3σ of frequencies in both Models A and B. Considering the very different input physics of these two models, we took this agreement as evidence of the reliability of these four additional frequencies and we incorporated them as constraints for our refined model-fitting. Two of the remaining frequencies in the maximal set (n = 12, l = 1 and 2) were not present in either Models A or B, while one (n = 10, l = 2) had a close match in Model B but not in Model A. We excluded these three modes from the refined model-fitting. Given that the l = 1 modes provide the strongest constraints on the models (see §5.2), the additional l = 0 and l = 2 modes are expected to perturb the final fit only slightly.</p><p>In addition to the 26 oscillation frequencies from the maximal set, we also included stronger spectroscopic constraints in the refined model-fitting by adopting the results of the VWA analysis instead of using the mean atmospheric parameters from the preliminary analyses (see §3.3). Although the uncertainties on all three parameters are considerably smaller from the VWA analysis, the actual values only differ slightly from the initial spectroscopic constraints. These were just three of the 25 constraints used to calculate the χ 2 and rank the initial search results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. Since the 22 frequencies from the minimal set were orders of magnitude more precise, they dominated the χ 2 determination. Although the spectroscopic constraints from VWA are more precise than the initial atmospheric parameters, they are still much less precise than the frequencies and should only perturb the χ 2 ranking slightly. Consequently, we do not need to perform a new global search after adopting the additional and updated observational constraints.</p><p>Several modeling teams used the updated asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints for refined model-fitting with a variety of codes. Each team started with the parameters of Models A and B from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>, and then performed a local optimization to produce the best match to the observations within each family of solutions. The results of this analysis are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, where the refined Models A and B are ranked separately by their final χ 2 value. Each model is labeled with a letter from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> to identify the modeling team, followed by either A or B to identify the family of solutions. The two pipeline approaches labeled J ′ and K ′ simply adopted the re- vised constraints to evaluate any shift in the optimal parameter estimates and errors. Note that both the SEEK and RA-DIUS pipelines identified parameters in the high-mass family of solutions when using the revised constraints, but the lowmass family was only marginally suboptimal. The apparent bifurcation of results in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> into two values of α arises from the decision of most modelers to fix this parameter in each case to the original value from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. For each family of solutions, the modeling teams adopted the appropriate input physics: neglecting overshoot and diffusion for the refined Models A, while including both ingredients for the refined Models B. One team produced two additional models (labeled AA ′ and AB ′ ) to isolate the effect of input physics on the final results. Model AA ′ started from the parameters of Model A but included overshoot and helium settling, while Model AB ′ searched in the region of Model B but neglected overshoot and diffusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Stellar Properties &amp; Error Analysis</head><p>An inspection of the results in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> reveals that models in either family of solutions can provide a comparable match to the observational constraints. This ambiguity cannot be attributed to the input physics, since the models that sample all four combinations of the input physics and family of solutions (AA, AA ′ , AB, AB ′ ) have comparable χ 2 values. The individual frequencies of these models all provide a good fit to the data, including the l = 1 mixed modes. The observations are compared to two representative models in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> using an échelle diagram, where we divide the frequency spectrum into segments of length ∆ν and plot them against the oscillation frequency. This representation of the data aligns modes with the same spherical degree into roughly vertical columns, with l = 0 modes shown as circles, l = 1 modes shown as triangles, and l = 2 modes shown as squares. The 26 modes from the maximal frequency set that were included in the final fit are indicated with solid points. Open points indicate the model frequencies, with Model AA shown in blue and Model AB shown in red. A greyscale map of the power spectrum (smoothed to 1 µHz resolution) is included in the background for reference. The different models appear to be sampling comparable local minima in a correlated parameter space. Without additional constraints, we have no way of selecting one of these models over the other.</p><p>We can understand the two families of models by considering the general properties of subgiant stars, where a wide range of masses can have the same stellar luminosity with minor adjustments to the input physics and other model parameters-in particular the helium mass fraction. This degeneracy between mass and helium abundance has been discussed in the modeling of specific subgiant stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fernandes &amp; Monteiro 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pinheiro &amp; Fernandes 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yang &amp; Meng 2010)</ref>, and it adds a large uncertainty to the already difficult problem of determining the helium abundance in main-sequence stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Vauclair et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Soriano &amp; Vauclair 2010)</ref>. The luminosity of stellar models on the subgiant branch is mainly determined by the amount of energy produced at the edge of the helium core established during the main-sequence phase. The rate of energy production depends on the temperature and the hydrogen abundance in that layer. As a consequence it is possible to find models at the same luminosity with quite different values of total mass, by adjusting the other parameters to yield the required temperature at the edge of the helium core. Fortunately, for subgiant stars the presence of mixed modes can provide additional constraints on the size of the helium core. For KIC 11026764 this mixed mode constraint significantly reduces the range of possible masses to two specific intervals, where the combination of stellar mass and core size are compatible with the atmospheric parameters and the frequencies of the mixed modes.</p><p>Regardless of which family of solutions is a better representation of KIC 11026764, the parameter values in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> already yield precise determinations of some of the most interesting stellar properties-in particular, the asteroseismic age and radius. If we consider only the four models that were produced by the same modeling team with an identical fitting method (the ASTEC models: AA, AA ′ , AB, AB ′ ), we can calculate the mean value and an internal (statistical) uncertainty in isolation from external (systematic) errors arising from differences between the various codes and methods. The asteroseismic ages of the two families of solutions range from 5.87 to 5.99 Gyr, with a mean value of t = 5.94 ± 0.05 Gyr. The stellar radii of the two families range from 2.03 to 2.08 R ⊙ , with a mean value of R = 2.05 ± 0.03 R ⊙ . The luminosity ranges from 3.45 to 3.80 L ⊙ , with a mean value of L = 3.56 ± 0.14 L ⊙ . These are unprecedented levels of precision for an isolated star, despite the fact that the stellar mass is still ambiguous at the 10% level. Of course, precision does not necessarily translate into accuracy, but we can evaluate the possible systematic errors on these determinations by looking at the distribution of parameter values for the entire sample of modeling results, not just those from ASTEC.</p><p>Considering the full range of the best models (χ 2 &lt; 10) in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, there is broad agreement on the value of the stellar radius. The low value of 2.03 R ⊙ is from one of the ASTEC models considered above, while the high value of 2.09 R ⊙ is from the Catania-GARSTEC code, leading to a systematic offset of +0.04 −0.02 R ⊙ compared to the mean ASTEC value. There is a slightly higher dispersion in the values of the asteroseismic age. Again considering only the best models, we find a full range for the age as low as 4.99 Gyr from Catania-GARSTEC up to 5.99 Gyr from ASTEC, for a systematic offset of +0.05 −0.95 Gyr relative to the ASTEC models. The best models exhibit the highest dispersion in the values of the luminosity, with a low estimate of 3.45 L ⊙ from ASTEC and a high value of 4.44 L ⊙ from Catania-GARSTEC. These models establish a systematic offset of +0.88 −0.11 L ⊙ compared to the ASTEC results.</p><p>To evaluate the relative contribution of each observational constraint to the final parameter determinations, we can study the significance S i using singular value decomposition (SVD; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brown et al. 1994</ref>). An observable with a low value of S i has little influence on the solution, while a high value of S i indicates an observable with greater impact. The significance of each observable in determining the parameters of KIC 11026764 for Model AA is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. From left to right we show the spectroscopic constraints followed by the l = 0, 1 and 2 frequencies labeled with the reference radial order from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and each group of constraints is shown in a different shade. It is immediately clear that the l = 1 and l = 2 frequencies have more weight in determining the parameters. If we examine how the significance of each spectroscopic constraint changes when we combine them with modes of a given spherical degree, we can quantify the impact of each set of frequencies because the information content of the spectroscopic data does not change. The spectroscopic constraints contribute more than 25% of the total significance when combined with the l = 0 modes (13% from the effective temperature alone), indicating that these two sets of constraints contain redundant information. By contrast, the total significance of the spectroscopic constraints drops to 4% for the l = 2 modes, and 7% when combined with the l = 1 modes-confirming that these frequencies contain more independent information than the l = 0 modes, as expected from the short evolutionary timescale for mixed modes. Although the significance of the atmospheric parameters on the final solution appears to be small, we emphasize that accurate spectroscopic constraints are essential for narrowing down the initial parameter space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY &amp; DISCUSSION</head><p>We have determined a precise asteroseismic age and radius for KIC 11026764. Although no planets have yet been detected around this star, similar techniques can be applied to exoplanet host stars to convert the relative planetary radius determined from transit photometry into an accurate absolute radius-and the precise age measurements for field stars can provide important constraints on the evolution of exoplanetary systems. By matching stellar models to the individual oscillation frequencies, and in particular the l = 1 mixed mode pattern, we determined an asteroseismic age and radius of t = 5.94 ± 0.05(stat) +0.05 −0.95 (sys) Gyr and R = 2.05 ± 0.03(stat) +0.04 −0.02 (sys) R ⊙ . This represents an order of magnitude improvement in the age precision over pipeline resultswhich fit only the mean frequency separations-while achieving comparable or slightly better precision on the radius (cf. Models J ′ and K ′ in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The systematic uncertainties on the radius are almost negligible, while the model-dependence of the asteroseismic age yields impressive accuracy compared to other age indicators for field stars (see <ref type="bibr">Soderblom 2010)</ref>. Whatever the limitations on absolute asteroseismic ages, studies utilizing a single stellar evolution code can precisely determine the chronology of stellar and planetary systems.</p><p>The l = 1 mixed modes in KIC 11026764, shifted from regularity by avoided crossings, play a central role in constraining the models. <ref type="bibr">Bedding et al. (in prep.)</ref> have pointed out the utility of considering the frequencies of the avoided crossings themselves, since they reflect the g-mode component of the eigenfunction that is trapped in the core ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aizenman et al. 1977)</ref>. The avoided crossing frequencies are revealed by the distortions in the l = 1 modes, which are visible as rising branches in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. For Model AA, marked by the vertical line, we see that the frequencies of the first four avoided crossings are G 1 ≈ 1270 µHz, G 2 ≈ 920 µHz, G 3 ≈ 710 µHz and G 4 ≈ 600 µHz. Each of these avoided crossings produces a characteristic feature in the échelle diagram that can be matched to the observations. Indeed, the observed power spectrum of KIC 11026764 (greyscale in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref> shows a clear feature that matches G 2 and another, slightly less clear, that matches G 3 . The avoided crossing at G 1 that is predicted by the models lies outside the region of detected modes, but it is possible that additional data expected from the Kepler Mission will confirm its existence. We also note a peak in the observed power spectrum at 586 µHz (greyscale in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>) that lies close to an l = 1 mixed mode in the models, and also at 766 µHz near an l = 2 mixed mode. Again, additional data are needed for confirmation.</p><p>It is interesting to ask whether all of the models discussed in this paper have the same avoided crossing identification. For example, are there any models that fit the observed frequencies but for which the avoided crossing at 920 µHz corresponds to G 1 instead of G 2 ? This would imply a different local minimum in parameter space, and a different location in the p-g diagram introduced by Bedding et al. Although this may be the case for some of the models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> from the initial search, all of the models listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> have the avoided crossing identification described above.</p><p>The observed structure of the l = 1 ridge suggests relatively strong coupling between the oscillation modes. At frequencies above the observed range, the best models suggest that the unperturbed l = 1 ridge would align vertically near 40 µHz in the échelle diagram (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref>. It is evident from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> that at a given age the frequencies of numerous p-modes are affected by the rising g-mode frequency, and this manifests itself in the échelle diagram with several modes deviating from the location of the unperturbed ridge on either side of the avoided crossing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Deheuvels &amp; Michel 2009)</ref>. Stronger coupling suggests a smaller evanescent zone between the gmode cavity in the core and the p-mode cavity in the envelope. Although the evanescent zone will be larger for l = 2 modes, the strength of the coupling for the l = 1 modes raises the possibility that weakly mixed l = 2 modes-like those near 766 µHz in Model AA-may be observable in longer time series data from continued observations by Kepler.</p><p>It is encouraging that with so many oscillation frequencies observed, the impact of an incorrect mode identification appears to be minimal. For example, the models suggest that the lowest frequency l = 0 mode in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> may actually be on the l = 2 ridge-or it could even be an l = 1 mixed mode produced by the G 4 avoided crossing. However, the influence of the other observational constraints is sufficient to prevent any serious bias in the resulting models. Even so, adopting either of these alternate identifications for the lowest frequency l = 0 mode would cut the χ 2 of Model AB nearly in half.</p><p>Despite a 10% ambiguity in the stellar mass, we have determined a luminosity for KIC 11026764 of L = 3.56 ± 0.14(stat) +0.88 −0.11 (sys) L ⊙ . With the radius so well determined from asteroseismology, differences of 200-300 K in the effective temperatures of the models are largely responsible for the uncertainties in the luminosity. These differences are generally correlated with the composition-hotter models at a given mass tend to have a higher helium mass fraction and lower metallicity, while cooler models tend to be relatively metal-rich. The adopted spectroscopic constraints fall in the middle of the range of temperatures and metallicities for the two families of models, and leave little room for substantial improvement. Perhaps the best chance for resolving the mass ambiguity, aside from additional asteroseismic constraints, is a direct measurement of the luminosity. Although Kepler was not optimized for astrometry, it will eventually provide highquality parallaxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Monet et al. 2010</ref>). The resulting luminosity error is expected to be dominated by uncertainties in the bolometric correction (∼0.02 mag) and the amount of interstellar reddening (∼0.01 mag), although saturation from this bright target may present additional difficulties. This should lead to a luminosity precision near 3%, which would be sufficient to distinguish between our two families of solutions for KIC 11026764.  . Normalized probability distributions, showing the correlation of the radius with several spectroscopic constraints when they are excluded from the fit, including (a) the effective temperature T eff , (b) the surface gravity log g and (c) the metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> relative to solar, where the gaps between the islands are caused by the discrete nature of the grid. Dark red indicates the maximum probability, which decreases linearly to white for zero probability. In each panel, the cross shows the observed values from the VWA method (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>) and the final fit for R = 2.10 ± 0.06. We see that log g is determined precisely before any spectroscopic knowledge of its value is included in the fit.</p><p>Quite apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5c</ref> are several local maxima due to the discrete nature of the grid. However, the resolution of the grid is sufficient to see the underlying correlation between the metallicity and the radius. From this figure we see that if the star had a metallicity of [Fe/H] ∼ −0.6 it would have a radius of R ∼ 1.91 R ⊙ . We remark that the uncertainty in radius is mainly caused by the unknown value of the initial helium content Y i which has not been constrained by any of the observables (for more details on the effect of Y i on stellar parameters, see Quirion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Christensen-Dalsgaard &amp; Arentoft 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> both the large and the small separations are left as free parameters. We note that the curved shape of the probability function is typical when the correlation between the large separation and the radius is plotted. In addition to showing that the large separation is the main constraint on the radius, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> illustrates that a star with a large radius, and hence smaller value of the large separation, will have a larger uncertainty on the inferred radius. The larger uncertainty is caused by the changing slope of the correlation, which tends to be flatter for larger radii. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> also shows that without the asteroseismic constraints, the uncertainty in the radius increases dramatically since the most probable region for the radius, in red, spans 1.76 R/R ⊙ 2.36.</p><p>For the mass, SEEK demonstrates that the precision is only slightly improved by including the large an small separations in the fitting process. We find M = 1.25 ± 0.13 M ⊙ when only the spectroscopic input parameters are used and M = 1.27 ± 0.09 M ⊙ when asteroseismic inputs are added. For the age, the results of SEEK without the asteroseismic inputs yield a relatively weak constraint of 40% with t = 5.03 ± 2.02 Gyr. This uncertainty is reduced by nearly a factor of two when the large and small separations are used, which gives t = 4.26 ± 1.22 Gyr. If we compare this result with Quirion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Christensen-Dalsgaard &amp; Arentoft (2010)</ref>, 30% error on the age is unusually large for a star having well measured values of ∆ν and δν. It seems that δν does not provide an additional constraint on the age of the star, since we were able to determine a very similar age t = 4.21 ± 1.25 Gyr when δν was excluded from the fit. <ref type="bibr">Bedding et al. (in prep.</ref>) find this to be generally true for subgiant stars.</p><p>Finally, we stress that the mixing-length parameter α and the initial helium content Y i are not constrained by our fit. For Y i , the output value is simply the central value used in SEEK's grid plus a 1σ uncertainty extending toward the edges of the grid. For α, a value smaller than 1.8 is preferred, but not decisively. Our overall conclusion from SEEK is that the asymptotic asteroseismic inputs can be used to reduce significantly the uncertainty on the radius of KIC 11026764. The age and the mass precision can also be improved, though less substantially.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>, but for ∆ν 0 when the small separation is also excluded from the fit. The point with error bars indicates the result when both the large and small separations are included as constraints.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The tracks are separated into 100 subsets with different combinations of metallicity Z, initial hydrogen content X i and mixing-length parameter α. These combinations are separated into two regularly spaced and interlaced subgrids. The first subgrid comprises tracks with Z = [0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03], X i = [0.68, 0.70, 0.72, 0.74], and α = [0.8, 1.8, 2.8] while the sec- ond subset has Z = [0.0075, 0.0125, 0.0175, 0.0225, 0.0275], X i = [0.69, 0.71, 0.73], α = [1.3, 2.3]. Every subset is com- posed of 73 tracks with masses between 0.6 and 3.0 M ⊙ . The spacing in mass between the tracks is 0.02 M ⊙ from 0.6 to 1.8 M ⊙ and 0.1 from 1.8 to 3.0 M ⊙ . A relatively high value of Y ⊙ = 0.2713 and Z ⊙ = 0.0196 for the Sun has been used for the standard definition of</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. THE INFLUENCE OF ROTATION</head><p>Rotation velocity can have a large influence on the frequencies of a given stellar model, since angular momentum transport can change the internal structure and evolution of the star. Thus, rotation velocity and angular momentum transport processes must be taken into account for accurate modeling. However, if the rotation velocity is not too large, the effect on the frequencies can be comparable to or smaller than the observational accuracy, in which case non-rotating models can be trusted. We have examined two angular momentum transport processes covering the extreme cases to quantify the influence of rotation on the modeling of KIC 11026764.</p><p>The study was performed using the CESAM code <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Morel &amp; Lebreton 2008</ref>). The first-order effects of rotation on the equilibrium models were considered by subtracting the spherically averaged contribution of the centrifugal acceleration to the gravity of the model, g eff = g − A c (r), where g corresponds to the local gravity, and A c (r) represents the radial component of the centrifugal acceleration. This spherically averaged component of the centrifugal acceleration does not change the order of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Such models are referred to as pseudo-rotating (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Soufi et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Suárez et al. 2007</ref>). Since we have only a weak constraint on the rotation velocity of KIC 11026764 (see §3.2), we used an initial rotation velocity that leads to solar rotation at the solar age. Standard physical inputs were used, including the EFF equation of state. The opacity tables were taken from the OPAL package <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rogers &amp; Iglesias 1995</ref>), complemented at low temperatures (T ≤ 10 4 K) with the tables provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alexander &amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref>. The outer boundary conditions were determined by assuming a plane-parallel Eddington grey atmosphere. The model metallicity (Z/X) is derived from the observed [Fe/H] value assuming (Z/X) ⊙ = 0.0245 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Grevesse &amp; Noels 1993)</ref>, Y pr = 0.235 and Z pr = 0 for the primordial helium and heavy-element abundances, and ∆Y /∆Z = 2 for the enrichment ratio. The thermonuclear reactions incorporated the PP and CNO cycles with the NACRE coefficients. No microscopic diffusion was included in the calculation.</p><p>We studied the following angular momentum transport processes: (1) Global Conservation of the angular momentum [GC, solid rigid rotation]: Ω(t, r) = Ω(t), and (2) Local Conservation of the angular momentum [LC, differential rotation]: d r 2 Ω/dt = 0. The GC and LC of angular momentum represent the two extreme cases in nature. The actual rotation profile of the star must fall between these two solutions.</p><p>The theoretical frequencies were calculated using GraCo <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Moya &amp; Garrido 2008)</ref>. We found that for the rotation velocity studied here, rigid rotation yields frequencies closer to the non-rotating case, with differences in the range [−0.01, −0.025] µHz. Differential rotation yields larger differences in the range [−0.051, −0.045] µHz. Considering the large frequency separations, rigid rotation leads to differences relative to the non-rotating case in the range [+0.0025, −0.0045] µHz while differential rotation yields differences in the range [0, −0.004] µHz. All of these differences are much smaller than the observational errors, so rotation can safely be neglected in the frequency analysis of KIC 11026764. However, note that rotational mixing-which has not been considered in this study-may lead to changes in the global and internal properties of the models even for slowly rotating stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Eggenberger et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. THE IMPORTANCE OF ASTEROSEISMIC CONSTRAINTS</head><p>We compared results from SEEK with and without the asteroseismic inputs to see how the large and small separations can help reduce the uncertainty on the inferred stellar properties. We see that the uncertainty in the radius of 3% provided by SEEK is in line with what was expected from simulated data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stello et al. 2009a</ref>). With R = 2.10 ± 0.06 R ⊙ , the precision is a factor of five better than what we could get using only the available spectroscopic input (T eff , log g and [Fe/H]), which resulted in a 14.6% uncertainty (R = 2.06 ± 0.30 R ⊙ ). This dramatic improvement was obtained using the large and small separations as the only seismic constraints, as opposed to fitting individual mode frequencies.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> we show 2D projections of the probability distributions provided by SEEK, which illustrate the correlations between the spectroscopic input parameters and the value of the inferred radius. To produce these figures we fixed all but one of the spectroscopic input parameters to the observed values. Hence, in <ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref> the dark red regions are where we would most likely find the star if we did not know its temperature. The cross marks the observed value of the temperature with its measured uncertainty in the vertical direction while the horizontal direction marks the inferred value of R and its precision. We can see that changing the temperature within the error bars does not greatly affect the value of the radius. Reducing the uncertainty of the temperature would not affect the uncertainty of the radius, since the width of the correlation function is large compared to its slope. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5b</ref> we see that the value of log g is well determined without any spectroscopic measurement. The spectroscopic value of log g has no significant influence in constraining the radius. The constraints from the seismic measurements are simply much stronger than what is found from spectroscopy in this case. We found similar results for the determination of the mass.</p></div>			</div>
