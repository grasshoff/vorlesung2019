			<abstract>
				<p>In recent years we have witnessed an explosion of photometric time-series data, collected for the purpose of finding a small number of rare sources, such as transiting extrasolar planets and gravitational microlenses. Once combed, these data are often set aside, and are not further searched for the many other variable sources that they undoubtedly contain. To this end, we describe a pipeline that is designed to systematically analyze such data, while requiring minimal user interaction. We ran our pipeline on a subset of the TransAtlantic Exoplanet Survey dataset, and used it to identify and model 773 eclipsing binary systems. For each system we conducted a joint analysis of its light curve, colors, and theoretical isochrones. This analysis provided us with estimates of the binary&apos;s absolute physical properties, including the masses and ages of their stellar components, as well as their physical separations and distances. We identified three types of eclipsing binaries that are of particular interest and merit further observations. The first category includes 11 low-mass candidates, which may assist current efforts to explain the discrepancies between the observation and the models of stars at the bottom of the main-sequence. The other two categories include 34 binaries with eccentric orbits, and 20 binaries with abnormal light curves. Finally, this uniform catalog enabled us to identify a number of relations that provide further constraints on binary population models and tidal circularization theory.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the mid 1990s there has been an explosion of large scale photometric variability surveys. The search for gravitational microlensing events, which were predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Paczynski (1986)</ref>, motivated the first wave of surveys [e.g. OGLE: <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Udalski et al. (1994)</ref>; EROS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beaulieu et al. (1995)</ref>; DUO: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alard &amp; Guibert (1997)</ref>; MACHO: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alcock et al. (1998)</ref>]. Encouraged by their success, additional surveys, searching for Gamma-Ray Bursts [e.g. ROTSE: <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akerlof et al. (2000)</ref>] and general photometric variabilities [e.g. ASAS: Pojmanski (1997)] soon followed.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, with the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Charbonneau et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Henry et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mazeh et al. 2000</ref>), a second wave of photometric surveys ensued [e.g. OGLE-III: <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Udalski (2003</ref>  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2006)</ref>; for a review, see <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2007)</ref>]. Each of these projects involved intensive efforts to locate a few proverbial needles hidden in a very large data haystack. With few exceptions, once the "needles" were found, thus fulfilling the survey's original purpose, the many gigabytes of photometric light curves (LCs) collected were not made use of in any other way. In this paper we demonstrate how one can extract a great deal more information from these survey datasets, with comparably little additional effort, using automated pipelines. To this end, we have made all the software tools described in this paper freely available (see web links to the source code and working examples), and they are designed to be used with any LC dataset.</p><p>In the upcoming decade, a third wave of ultra-large ground-based synoptic surveys [e.g. Pan-STARRS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaiser et al. (2002)</ref>; LSST: <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Tyson (2002)</ref>], and ultra-sensitive spacebased surveys [e.g. KEPLER: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Borucki et al. (1997)</ref>; COROT: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baglin &amp; The COROT Team (1998)</ref>; GAIA: <ref type="bibr">Gilmore et al. (1998)</ref>] are expected to come online. These surveys are designed to produce photometric datasets that will dwarf all preceding efforts. To make any efficient use of such large quantities of data, it will become imperative to have in place a large infrastructure of automated pipelines for performing even the most casual data mining query.</p><p>In this paper, we focus exclusively on the identification and analysis of eclipsing binary (EB) systems. EBs provide favorable targets, as they are abundant and can be well modeled using existing modeling programs [e.g. WD: <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wilson &amp; Devinney (1971)</ref>; EBOP: <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Popper &amp; Etzel (1981)</ref>]. Once modeled, EBs can provide a wealth of useful astrophysical information, including constraints on binary component mass distributions, mass-radiusluminosity relations, and theories describing tidal circularization and synchronization. These findings, in turn, will likely have a direct impact on our understanding of star formation, stellar structure, and stellar dynamics. These physical distributions of close binaries may even help solve open questions relating to the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae <ref type="bibr">(Iben &amp; Tutukov</ref> The data that we analyzed originate from 10 fields of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey [TrES ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alonso et al. (2004)</ref>]. TrES employs a network of three automated telescopes to survey 6 • × 6 • fields-of-view. To avoid potential systematic noise we use the data from only one telescope, Sleuth, located at the Palomar Observatory in Southern California (O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2004</ref>). This telescope has a 10 cm physical aperture and a photometric aperture of radius of 30". The number of LCs in each field ranges from 10405 to 26495 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), for a total of 185445 LCs. The LCs consist of ∼2000 r-band photometric measurements at a 9-minute cadence. These measurements were created by binning the image-subtraction results of 5 consecutive 90-second observations, thus improving their nonsystematic photometric noise. As a result ∼16% of the LCs have an RMS &lt;1%, and ∼38% of the LCs have an RMS &lt;2% (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). The calibration of TrES images, identification of stars therein, extraction, and decorrelation of the LCs is described elsewhere ( <ref type="bibr">Dunham et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mandushev et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">O'Donovan et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">O'Donovan et al. , 2007</ref>. TrES is currently an active survey that is continuously observing new fields, though for this paper we have limited ourselves to these 10 fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>The pipeline we have developed is an extended version of the pipeline described by <ref type="bibr">Devor (2005)</ref>. At the heart of this analysis lie two computational routines that we have described in earlier papers: the Detached Eclipsing Binary Light curve fitter 1 [DEBiL ; <ref type="bibr">Devor (2005)]</ref>, and the Method for Eclipsing Component Identification 2 [MECI ; <ref type="bibr">Devor &amp; Charbonneau (2006a,b)</ref>]. DEBiL fits each LC to a geometric model of a detached EB (steps 3 and 5 below). This model consists of two luminous, limb-darkened spheres that orbit in a Newtonian 2-body orbit. MECI restricts the DEBiL fit along theoretical isochrones, and is thus able to create a physical model of each EB (step 9). This second model describes the masses and absolute magnitudes of the EB's stellar components, which are then used to determine the EB's distance and absolute separation.</p><p>The pipeline consists of 10 steps. We elaborate on each of these steps below:</p><p>1. Determine the period.</p><p>2. If a distinct secondary eclipse is not observed, an entry with twice the period is added.</p><p>3. Fit the orbital parameters with DEBiL.</p><p>4. Fine-tune the period using eclipse timing.</p><p>5. Refine the orbital parameters with DEBiL using the revised period.</p><p>6. Remove contaminated LCs.</p><p>7. Visually assess the quality of the EB models.</p><p>8. Match the LC sources with external databases.</p><p>9. Estimate the absolute physical properties of the binary components using MECI.</p><p>10. Classify the resulting systems using both automatic and manual criteria.</p><p>We use the same filtering criteria as described in <ref type="bibr">Devor (2005)</ref>, both for removing LCs that are not periodic (step 1) and then for removing non-EB LCs (step 3). Together, these automated filters remove approximately 97% of the input LCs. In addition to these filters, we perform stringent manual inspections (steps 7 and 10) whereby we removed all the LCs we were not confident were EBs. These inspections ultimately removed approximately 86% of the remaining LCs. Thus only 1 out of every 240 input LCs, were included in the final catalog.</p><p>In step (1) we use both the Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) period finder ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref>, and a version of the analysis of variances (AoV) period finder ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, 1996</ref> to identify the periodic LCs within the dataset and to measure their periods. In our AoV implementation, we scan periods from 0.1 days up to the duration of each LC. We then select the period that minimizes the variance of a linear fit within 8 phase bins. We removed all systems with weak periodicities [see <ref type="bibr">Devor (2005)</ref> for details], and with one exception (T-Lyr1-14413), all the systems whose optimal period was found to be longer than half their LC duration. In this way we were able to filter out many of the non-periodic variables.</p><p>The AoV algorithm is most effective in identifying the periods of LCs with long duration features, such as semi-detached EBs and pulsating stars. The BLS algorithm, in contrast, is effective at identifying periodic systems whose features span only a brief portion of the period, such as detached EBs and transiting planets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1)</ref>. However, the BLS algorithm is easily fooled by outlier data points, identifying them as short duration features. For this reason the BLS algorithm has a significantly higher rate of false positives than AoV, especially for long periods, which have only a few cycles over the duration of the observations. Therefore we limit the search range of the BLS algorithm to periods shorter than 12 days, although as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> illustrates, its efficiency at locating EBs rapidly declines at periods greater than 10 days.</p><p>In step (2), we address the ambiguity between EBs with identical components in a circular orbit, and EBs with extremely disparate components. The phased LC of EBs with identical components contains two identical eclipses, whereas the phased LC of EBs with disparate components will have a secondary eclipse below the photometric noise level. These two cases are degenerate, since doubling the period of a disparate system will result in a LC that looks like an equal-component system. In the pipeline, we handle this problem by doubling such entries; one with the period found in step (1), and another with twice that period. Both of these entries proceed through the pipeline independently. In many cases, after additional processing by the following steps, one of these entries will emerge as being far less likely than the other (see appendix A), at which point it is removed. But in cases where photometry alone cannot determine which is correct, one needs to perform spectroscopic follow up to break the ambiguity. In particular, a double-lined spectrum would support the equal-component hypothesis.</p><p>Step (3) is performed using DEBiL, which fits the fractional radii (r 1,2 ) and observed magnitudes (mag 1,2 ) of the EB's stellar components, their orbital inclination (i) and eccen-tricity (e), and their epoch (t 0 ) and argument of periastron (ω). DEBiL first produces an initial guess for these parameters, and then iteratively improves the fit using the downhill simplex method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nelder 1965</ref>) with simulated annealing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kirkpatrick et al. 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Press et al. 1992</ref>).</p><p>In step (4), we fine-tune the period (P ) using a method based on eclipse timing 3 , which we describe below. In order to produce an accurate EB model in step (9) it is necessary to know the system's period with greater accuracy than that produced in step (1). If we neglect to fine-tune the period, the eclipses may be out of phase with respect to one another, and so the phased eclipses will appear broadened. Our timing method employs the DEBiL model produced in step (3), and uses it to find the difference between the observed and calculated (O − C) eclipse epochs. This is done by minimizing the chi-squared fit of the model to the data points in each eclipse, while varying only the model's epoch of periastron. When the period estimate is off by a small quantity (∆P ), the O − C difference increases by ∆P each period. This change in the O − C over time can be measured from the slope of the linear regression, which is expected to equal ∆P/P . Thus measuring such an O − C slope will yield the desired period correction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>If the EB has an eccentric orbit, the primary and secondary eclipse will separate on the O − C plot, and form two parallel lines with a vertical offset of ∆t (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>). We measure this offset and use it as a sensitive method to detect orbital eccentricities. In particular, the value of ∆t constrains e cos ω, which in turn provides a lower limit for the system's eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tsesevich 1973)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e cos ω ≃ π 2 ∆t P (1)</formula><p>This formula assumes an orbital inclination of i = 90 • , making it a good approximation for eclipsing binaries. We use this method, in combination with DEBiL, to identify the eccentric EBs in the catalog (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). However, in cases where the eclipse timing measures |e cos ω| &lt; 0.005, or when the eccentricity is consistent with zero, we assume that the EB is non-eccentric, and model it using a circular orbit. We further discuss the physics of these systems in §3.2.</p><p>Step (5) is identical to step (3), except that it uses the revised period from step (4). This step provides an improved fit to the LCs, as evidenced by an improved chi-squared value in over 70% of the cases.</p><p>In step (6) we locate and remove non-EB sources that seem to be periodic due to photometric contamination by true EBs. Such contaminations result from overlapping point spread functions (PSF) that cause each source to partially blend into the other. These cases can be easily identified with a program that scans through pairs of targets 4 , and selects the ones that both have similar periods (see description below) and are separated by an angle that is smaller than twice the PSF. We found 14 such pairs, all of which were separated by less than 41", which is well within twice the TrES PSF (60"), while the remaining pairs with similar periods were separated by over 450". Upon inspection, all 14 of the pairs we found had similar eclipse shapes, indicating that we had no false positives. Among each pair, we identify the LC with shallower eclipses (in magnitudes) as being contaminated and remove it from the catalog.</p><p>We define periods as being similar if the difference between them is smaller than their combined uncertainty. We estimate the period uncertainty using the relation: ε P ∝ P 2 /T , where T is the time interval between the initial and the final observations. One arrives at this relation by noticing that when phasing the LC, the effect of any perturbation from the true period will grow linearly with the number of periods in the LC (see step 4). This amplified effect will become evident once it reaches some fraction of the period itself, in other words, when ε P (T /P ) ∝ P . A typical TrES LC with a revised period will have a proportionality constant of approximately 1/1000. In order to avoid missing contaminated pairs (false negatives) we adopt in this step, the extremely liberal proportionality constant of unity.</p><p>In step (7) we conduct a visual inspection of all the LC fits. Most EBs were successfully modeled and were included into the catalog as is. About 1% of the LCs analyzed had misidentified periods, as a result of failures of the period finding method of step (1). In most of these cases the period finder indicated either a harmonic of the true period or a rational multiple of a solar or sidereal day. In such cases we use an interactive periodogram 5 to find the correct period and then reprocess the LCs through the pipeline. Some entries were misidentified at step (2) as being ambiguous, even though they have a detectable secondary eclipse or have slightly unequal eclipses. In these cases the erroneous doubled entry was removed. Lastly, some of the EBs were not fit sufficiently well with DEBiL in step (5). These cases were typically due to clustered outlier data points, systematic noise, or severe activity of a stellar component (e.g. flares or spots), which caused DEBiL to produce erroneous initial model parameters. These cases were typically handled by having DEBiL produce the initial model parameters from a more smoothed version of the LC.</p><p>In step (8) we match each system, through its coordinates, with the corresponding source in the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog [2MASS ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>)]. This was done to obtain both accurate target positions and observational magnitudes. These magnitude measurements are then used to derive the colors of each EB, which are incorporated into the MECI analysis, as well as to estimate the EB's distance modulus (step 9). To this end, 2MASS provides a unique combination of high astrometric accuracy (∼0.1") together with high photometric accuracy (∼0.015 mag) at multiple near-infrared bands, all while maintaining a decent photometric resolving power (∼3"). By employing these near-infrared bands we both inherently reduce the detrimental effects of stellar reddening, and are able to correct for much of the remaining extinction by fitting for the Galactic interstellar absorbtion.</p><p>In order to use the measurements from the 2MASS custom J, H, and K s filters, we converted them to the equivalent ESO-filter values so that they could be compared to the isochrone table values used in the MECI analysis. This conversion was done using approximate linear transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carpenter 2001)</ref>. However, the colors of three EBs (T-And0-10336, T-Cyg1-02304, and T-Per1-05205) were so anomalous that they did not permit a reasonable model solution, thus we chose not to include any color information in their MECI analyses.</p><p>In addition to its brightness, we also look up each EB's proper motion. Although proper motion is not required for any of the pipeline analyses, it provides a useful verification for lowmass candidates (see §3.1). These systems are expected to have large proper motions, since they must be nearby to be observable in this magnitude-limited survey. The most extreme such case in the catalog is CM Draconis (T-Dra0-01363), which has a proper motion of over 1300 mas/yr <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Salim &amp; Gould 2003)</ref>, and is probably the lowest mass system in our catalog. To this end, we match each system to the Second U.S. Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog [UCAC release 2.4 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zacharias et al. (2004)</ref>]. When there was no match with UCAC, we use the more comprehensive but less accurate U.S. Naval Observatory photographic sky survey [USNO-B release 1.0 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Monet et al. (2003)</ref>]. These matches were made using the more accurate aforementioned adopted 2MASS coordinates. However, because of their increased observational depth, and the fact that some high-proper motion targets are expected to have moved multiple arcseconds in the intervening decades, we chose to match each target to the brightest (R-band) source within 7.5". It should be noted that the position of CM Draconis shifted by more than 22" and had to be matched manually, though 90% of the matches were separated by less than 0.6", and 98% were separated by less than 2" (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).</p><p>The proper motions garnered from these databases can be combined with distance es-timates (D), to calculate the absolute transverse velocity (v tr ) of a given EB:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v tr ≃ 4.741 km/sec P M 1 mas/yr D 1 kpc ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P M is the system's angular proper motion. In the catalog we list the right ascension and declination components (P M α and P M δ , respectively), so as to allow one to compute the system's direction of motion in the sky. The value of P M can be computed from its components, using: P M 2 = P M 2 δ + P M 2 α cos 2 δ, where δ is the system's declination. When applying this formula, one should be aware that USNO-B folds the cos δ coefficient into its listed P M α , while UCAC does not.</p><p>Finally, we incorporate the USNO-B photometric B-and R-magnitude measurements into our catalog to provide a rough estimate of the optical brightness of each target. USNO-B lists two independent measurements in each of these filter, however in some cases one or both of these measurements failed. When both measurements are available, we average them for improved accuracy. However, each measurement has a large photometric uncertainty of ∼0.3 mag, thus even these averaged values will have errors that are over an order of magnitude larger that the photometric measurements of 2MASS. For this reason, and because of the increased effect of stellar reddening, we chose not to incorporate these data into the MECI analysis. However, USNO-B's high photometric resolution (∼1") enabled us to detect many sources that blended with our targets in the TrES exposures. By summing the R-band fluxes of all the USNO-B sources within 30" of each target, we estimated the fraction of third-light included in each LC (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Note that this measure provides only a lower bound to the true third-light fraction, as some EBs are expected to have additional close hierarchical components that would not be resolved by USNO-B. For most of the catalog targets, the third-light flux fraction was found to be small (&lt;10%). We therefore conclude that stellar blending will usually have only a minor effect on the MECI analysis results, however users should be aware of the potential biases in the calculated properties of highly blended targets. Though it was not applied to this catalog, in principal, given a third-light flux fraction at a well-determined LC phase, one could correct for the effects of blending.</p><p>In step (9) we analyze the LCs with MECI. We refer the reader to the full description of this method in <ref type="bibr">Devor &amp; Charbonneau (2006a,b)</ref>, and provide here only a brief outline. Given an observed EB LC and out-of-eclipse colors, MECI will iterate through a range of values for the EB age and the masses of its two components. By looking up their radii and luminosities in theoretical isochrone tables, MECI simulates the expected LC and combined colors, and selects the model that best matches the observations, as measured by the chisquared statistic. Or more concisely, MECI searches the (M 1 , M 2 , age)-parameter space for the chi-squared global minimum of each EB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 6 and 7</ref> show constant-age slices through such a parameter space. Once found, the curvature of the global minimum along the parameter space axes is used to determine the uncertainties of the corresponding parameters.</p><p>The MECI analysis makes two important assumptions. The first is that EB stellar components are coeval, which has been shown to generally hold for close binaries <ref type="bibr">(Claret &amp; Willems 2002)</ref>. When this assumption is violated, MECI will often not be able to find an EB model that successfully reproduces the LC eclipses. Such systems, which may be of interest in their own right, make up ∼3% of the catalog and are further discussed later in this section. The second assumption is that there is no significant reddening, or third-light blended into the observations (i.e. from a photometric binary or hierarchical triple). Such blending in the LC will make the eclipses shallower, which produces an effect very similar to that of the EB having a grazing orbit. Thus, it will cause the measured orbital inclination to be erroneous, although it should rarely otherwise affect the results of the MECI analysis significantly. However, the MECI analysis is sensitive to color biases caused by stellar reddening and blending.</p><p>We reduce both these biases by incorporating 2MASS colors (see step 8), which are both less suspectable to reddening than optical colors, and suffers from significantly less blending than TrES, as the radius of the 2MASS photometric aperture is ∼20 times smaller that that of TrES. We then attempt to further mitigate this problem by analyzing each EB twice, using different relative LC/color information weighting values [see Devor &amp; Charbonneau (2006b) for further details]. We first run MECI with the default weighting value (w = 10), and then run MECI again with an increased LC weighting (w = 100) thereby decreasing the relative color weighting. Finally, we adopt the solution that has a smaller reduced chisquare. Typically, the results of the two MECI analyses are very similar, indicating that the observed colors are consistent with the ones predicted by the theoretical isochrones. In such cases, the color information provides an important constraint, which significantly reduces the parameter uncertainties. However, when there is a significant color bias, the default model will not fit the observed data as well as the model that uses a reduced weighting of the color information. In such a case, the reduced color information model, which has a smaller chi-squared, is adopted. Following this procedure, we find that in ∼9% of our EBs, the reduced color information model provided a better fit, indicating that while significant color-bias is uncommon, it is a source of error that should not be ignored.</p><p>By default, we had MECI use the Yonsei-Yale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Yi et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kim et al. 2002)</ref> isochrone tables of solar metallicity stars. Although they successfully describe stars in a wide range of masses, these tables become increasingly inaccurate for low-mass stars, as the stars become increasingly convective. For this reason we re-analyze EBs for which both components were found to have masses below 0.75M ⊙ , using instead the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref> isochrone tables, assuming a convective mixing length equal to the pressure scale height. Our EB models also take into account the effects of the limb darkening of each of the stellar components. To this end we employ the ATLAS (Kurucz 1992) and PHOENIX <ref type="bibr">(Claret 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">(Claret , 2000</ref>) tables of quadratic limb-darkening coefficients.</p><p>As previously mentioned, once we know the absolute properties of an EB system, we are able to estimate its distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Stebbing 1910;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Paczynski 1997)</ref>, and thus such systems can be considered standard candles. We use <ref type="bibr">Cox (2000)</ref> for the extinction coefficients, assuming the standard Galactic ISM optical parameter, R V = 3.1, to create the following system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">mag J − Mag J = ∆Mag + 0.282 · A(V ) (3) mag H − Mag H = ∆Mag + 0.176 · A(V ) (4) mag K − Mag K = ∆Mag + 0.108 · A(V )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Where ∆Mag is the extinction-corrected distance modulus, and A(V ) is the V-mag absorption due to Galactic interstellar extinction. The estimated distance can then be solved using: D = 10pc · 10 ∆M ag/5 . Because we have three equations for only two unknowns, we adopt the solution that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals. In some cases we remove one of the bands as being an outlier (i.e. if it would have resulted in a negative absorption), after which we are still able to solve the systems. But in cases where we need to remove two bands, we set A(V ) = 0 in order to solve for the distance modulus. Although this method has a typical uncertainty of 10% to 20%, it can be applied to EBs that are far more distant and dim than are accessible in other methods, such as parallax measurement. It can be used to map broad features of the Galaxy, and identify binaries that are in the Galactic halo. This method can also be used on large group of systems, so that if the EBs are clustered, one can average their distances, and thus reduce the cluster distance uncertainty as the inverse square root of the number of systems.</p><p>In step (10) we perform a final quality check for the EB model fits, and classify them into 7 groups: I. Eccentric: EBs with unequally-spaced eclipses II. Circular: EBs with equally-spaced but distinct eclipses III. Ambiguous-unequal: EBs with undetected secondary eclipses IV. Ambiguous-equal: EB with equally-spaced and indistinguishable eclipses V. Inverted: detached EBs that are not successfully modeled by MECI VI. Roche-lobe-filling: non-detached EBs that are filling at least one Roche-lobe VII. Abnormal: EBs with atypical out-of-eclipse distortions We list the model parameters for the EBs of groups I-IV in the electronic version of this catalog (see full description in appendix B). The EBs of groups V-VII could not be well modeled by MECI, therefore we list only their coordinates and periods, so that they can be followed-up. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the period distribution of these seven groups. Note however that both the orbital geometry of EBs (eclipse probability ∝ P −2/3 ), and the limited duration of the TrES survey data (≤ 90 days ; varies from field to field ; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), act to suppress the detection of binaries with longer periods. An added complication for single-telescope surveys is that about half of the EBs with periods close to an integer number of days will not be detectable, as they eclipse only during the daytime. This EB distribution is consistent with the far deeper OGLE II field catalog <ref type="bibr">(Devor 2005)</ref>, where the long tail of Roche-lobe-filling systems has recently been explained by <ref type="bibr">Derekas et al. (2007)</ref> as being the result of a strong selection towards detecting eclipsing giant stars.</p><p>Group <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> contains the eccentric EBs identified in step (4) as having centers of eclipse that are separated by a duration significantly different from half an orbital period (see <ref type="bibr">Figures 9, 10, and 11</ref>). This criterion is sufficient for demonstrating eccentricity, but not necessary, since we miss systems for which cos ω ≃ 0 (see equation 1). Fortunately, we are able to detect eccentricities in well-detached EBs with |e cos ω| ≥ 0.005, using eclipse timing. Therefore, assuming that ω is uniformly distributed, we are approximately 67% complete for e = 0.01, and over 92% complete for e = 0.04. In principle, it would be possible to be 100% complete for these systems by measuring the differences in their eclipse durations, however this measurement is known to be unreliable (Etzel 1991) and so would likely contaminate this group with false positives. Group <ref type="bibr">[II]</ref> consists of all such circular-orbit EBs that were successfully fit by a single MECI model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 12</ref>).</p><p>EBs with only one detectable eclipse can potentially be modeled in two alternative ways. One way is to assume very unequal stellar components, which have a very shallow undetected secondary eclipse (group <ref type="bibr">[III]</ref>). Since we cannot estimate the eccentricity of such systems, we assume that they have circular orbits. The other way is to assume that the period at hand is twice the correct value, and that the components are nearly equal (group <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref>). The entries of such ambiguous LCs were doubled in step (2), so that these two solutions would be independently processed through the pipeline (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 13)</ref>. Therefore, these two groups have a one-to-one correspondence between them, although only one entry of each pair can be correct. Resolving this ambiguity may not always be possible without spectroscopic data. In some cases we were able to resolve this ambiguity using either a morphological or a physical approach. The morphological approach consists of manually examining the LCs of group <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref> for any asymmetries in the two eclipses (e.g. width, depth, or shape), or in the two plateaus between the eclipses (e.g. perturbations due to tidal effects, refections, or the "O'Connell effect"). The physical approach consists of applying our understanding of stellar evolution in order to exclude entries that cannot be explained through any coeval star pairing (see appendix A). Either way, once one of the two models has been eliminated, the other model is moved into group <ref type="bibr">[II]</ref> and is adopted as a non-ambiguous solution. It is interesting to note that when analyzing the two models with MECI, the equal-component solution (group <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref>) has masses approximately equal to the primary component of the unequal-component solution (group <ref type="bibr">[III]</ref>). The mass of the unequal-component solution's secondary component will typically be the smallest value listed in the isochrone table, as this configuration will produce the least detectable secondary eclipse.</p><p>Group <ref type="bibr">[V]</ref> consists of detached EBs that cannot be modeled by two coeval stellar components. As mentioned earlier, we can reject the single-eclipse solution for EBs with sufficiently deep eclipses (see appendix A). This argument can be further extended to cases where we can detect both eclipses in the LC, but where one is far shallower than the other. In some cases, no two coeval main-sequence components will reproduce such a LC, but unlike the previous case, since both eclipses are seen, we cannot conclude that the period needs to be doubled. Such systems are likely to have had mass transfer from a sub-giant component onto a main-sequence component through Roche-lobe overflow, to the point where currently the main-sequence component has become significantly more massive and brighter than it was originally <ref type="bibr">(Crawford 1955)</ref>. This process will cause the components to effectively behave as non-coeval stars, even though they have in fact the same chronological age. In extreme cases, the originally lower-mass main-sequence component can become more massive than the sub-giant, and thus swap their original primary/secondary designations, so that the main-sequence component is now the primary component. We call such systems "inverted" EBs, and place them into group <ref type="bibr">[V]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 14)</ref>. This phenomenon is often referred to in the literature as the "Algol paradox", though we chose not to adopt this term so as to avoid confusing it with the term "Algol-type EB" (EA), which is defined by the General Catalogue of Variable Stars [GCVS ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kukarkin 1948</ref>; Samus 2006)] as being the class of all well-detached EBs.</p><p>Group <ref type="bibr">[VI]</ref> contains the EBs that have at least one component filling its Roche-lobe (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref>). Such system cannot be well-fit by either DEBiL or MECI since they assume that the binary components are detached, and so neglect tidal and rotational distortions, gravity darkening, and reflection effects. These systems must be separated from the rest of the catalog since their resulting best-fit models will be poor and therefore their evaluated physical attributes will likely be erroneous. In a similar fashion to <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tamuz et al. (2006)</ref>, we detect these systems automatically by applying the Eggleton (1983) approximation for the Roche-lobe radius, and place in group <ref type="bibr">[VI]</ref> all the systems for which at least one of the EB components has filled its Roche-lobe (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16</ref>), that is, if either one of the following two inequalities occurs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r 1 &gt; 0.49 q −2/3 0.6 q −2/3 + ln (1 + q −1/3 ) or (6) r 2 &gt; 0.49 q 2/3 0.6 q 2/3 + ln (1 + q 1/3 ) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where q = M 2 /M 1 is the EB components' mass ratio. Since we expect non-detached EBs to be biased towards evolving, higher mass stellar components, we estimated q using the early-type mass-radius power law relation found in binaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gorda &amp; Svechnikov 1998)</ref>: q ≃ (r 2 /r 1 ) 1.534 . Although in principle, we could have estimated q directly from the EB component masses resulting from the MECI analysis, we chose not to, since as stated above, the analysis of such systems is inaccurate. The analytic approximation we used, though crude, proved to be remarkably robust, as we found only 5 false negatives and no false positives when visually inspecting the LCs. We found many more false positives/negatives when using the alarm criteria suggested by <ref type="bibr">Devor (2005</ref>, both of which attempt to identify bad model fits by evaluating spatial correlations of the model's residuals.</p><p>Finally, group <ref type="bibr">[VII]</ref> contains systems visually identified as EBs (i.e. having LCs with periodic flux dips), yet having atypical LC perturbations that indicate the existence of additional physical phenomena (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 17 and 18</ref>). For lack of a better descriptor, we call such systems "abnormal" (see further information in §3.3). This group is different from the previous six in that we cannot automate their classification, and their selection is thus inherently subjective. In 15 of the 20 systems, we were able to approximately model the LCs, and included them in one of the aforementioned groups. In these cases users should be aware that these model may be biased by the phenomenon that brought about their LC distortion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We identified and classified a total of 773 EBs 6 . These systems consisted of 734 EBs with circular orbits, 34 detached EBs with eccentric orbits (group <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>), and 5 unclassified abnormal EBs (group <ref type="bibr">[VII]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>). We marked 15 of the detached EBs with circular orbits as also being abnormal. Of the 734 EBs with circular orbits, we classify 290 as unambiguous detached EBs (group <ref type="bibr">[II]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>), 103 as ambiguous detached EBs, for which we could not determine photometrically if they consisted of equal or disparate components (groups <ref type="bibr">[III]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>), 23 as inverted EBs (group <ref type="bibr">[V]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>), and 318 as non-detached (group <ref type="bibr">[VI]</ref> ; <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>). With the exception of the abnormal EBs, which were selected by eye, we use an automated method to classify each of these groups (see §2 for details). Our mass estimates for the primary and secondary components are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 19</ref>.</p><p>The EB discovery yield (the fraction of LCs found to be EBs), varies greatly from field to field, ranging from 0.72% for Cygnus, to 0.15% for Corona Borealis (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). This variation is strongly correlated with Galactic latitude, where fields near the Galactic plane have larger discovery yields than those that are farther from it (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 20)</ref>. This effect is likely due to the fact that fields closer to the Galactic plane contain a higher fraction of early-type stars. These early-type stars are both physically larger, making them more likely to be eclipsed, and are more luminous, which has them produce brighter and less noisy LCs, thereby enabling the detection of EBs with shallower eclipses. Furthermore, much of the residual scatter can be attributed to the variation in the observed duration of each field (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). That is, we find additional EBs, with longer periods, in fields that were observed for a longer duration.</p><p>Currently, 88 of the cataloged EBs (11%) appear in either the International Variable Star Index 7 (VSX), or in the SIMBAD 8 astronomical database <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 9)</ref>. However, only 49 systems (6%) have been identified as being variable. Not surprisingly, with few exceptions, these targets were among the brightest sources of the catalog. Using only photometry, it is often notoriously difficult to distinguish non-detached EBs from pulsating variables that vary sinusoidally in time, such as type-C RR Lyrae. Furthermore, unevenly spotted stars may also cause false positive identifications, especially in surveys with shorter durations. Ultimately, spectroscopic follow-up will always be necessary to confirm the identification of such variables.</p><p>We highlight three groups of EBs as potentially having special importance as test beds for current theory. For more accurate properties, these EBs will likely need to be followed up both photometrically and spectroscopically. The brightness of these EBs will considerably facilitate their follow-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Low-mass EBs</head><p>The first group consists of 11 low-mass EB candidates, including 10 newly discovered EBs with either K or M-dwarf stellar components. Our criteria for selecting these binaries were that they be well-detached, and that both components have estimated masses below 0.75M ⊙ (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 21</ref>). Currently, only 7 such detached low-mass EBs have been confirmed <ref type="bibr">[YY Gem (Kron 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Torres &amp; Ribas 2002)</ref>, CM Dra (Lacy 1977b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Metcalfe et al. 1996</ref>), CU Cnc ( <ref type="bibr">Delfosse et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ribas 2003</ref> Despite a great deal of work that has been done to understand the structure of low-mass stars [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chabrier &amp; Baraffe (2000)]</ref>, models continue to underestimate their radii by as much as 15% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lacy 1977a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Torres &amp; Ribas 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Creevey et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ribas 2006</ref>), a significant discrepancy considering that for solar-type stars the agreement with the observations is typically within 1 − 2% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Andersen 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andersen , 1998</ref>). In recent years an intriguing hypothesis has been put forward that strong magnetic fields may have bloated these stars through chromospheric activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ribas 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Torres et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">López-Morales 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chabrier et al. 2007</ref>). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Torres et al. (2006)</ref> find that such bloating occurs even for stars with nearly a solar mass, and suggest that this effect may also be due to magnetically induced convective disruption. In either case, these radius discrepancies should diminish for widely separated binaries with long periods, as they become non-synchronous and thus rotate slower, which according to dynamo theory would reduce the strength of their magnetic fields.</p><p>Unfortunately, the small number of well characterized low-mass EBs makes it difficult to provide strong observational constraints to theory. Despite the fact that such stars make up the majority of the Galactic stellar population, their intrinsic faintness renders them extremely rare objects in magnitude-limited surveys. In addition, once found, their low flux severely limits the ability of observing their spectra with both sufficiently high resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio. To this end, the fact that the TrES survey was made with smallaperture telescopes is a great advantage, as any low-mass EB candidate found is guaranteed to be bright, and thus require only moderate-aperture telescopes for their follow-up. Thus we propose multi-epoch spectroscopic study of the systems listed here, in order to confirm their low mass and to estimate their physical properties with an accuracy sufficient to test models of stellar structure. Moreover, two of our candidates (T-Cyg1-12664 and T-Cas0-10450), if they are in fact ambiguous-equal (group <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref>), have periods greater than 8 days, making them prime targets for testing the aforementioned magnetic-bloating hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Eccentric EBs</head><p>The second group of EBs consists of 34 binaries with eccentric orbits (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, and Figures 9, 10, and 11). We were able to reliably measure values of |e cos ω| as low as ∼ 0.005 by using the eclipse timing technique (see §2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>). Since this measure provides a lower limit to the eccentricity, it is well-suited to identify eccentric EBs, even though the actual value of the eccentricity may be uncertain. As mentioned earlier, in an effort to avoid false-positives, we do not include in this group EBs whose eclipse timing measures |e cos ω| &lt; 0.005, or EBs with an eccentricity consistent with zero.</p><p>Our interest in these eccentric binaries stems from their potential to constrain tidal circularization theory (Darwin 1879). This theory describes how the eccentricity of a binary orbit decays over time due to tidal dissipation, with a characteristic timescale (t circ ) that is a function of the components' stellar structure and orbital separation. As long as the components' stellar structure remains unchanged, the orbital eccentricity is expected to decay approximately exponentially over time [e ∝ exp(−t/t circ )]. However, once the components evolve off the main sequence, this time scale may vary considerably <ref type="bibr">(Zahn &amp; Bouchet 1989)</ref>. Thus, to understand the circularization history of binaries with circularization timescales similar to or larger than their evolutionary timescales, one must integrate over the evolutionary tracks of both stellar components.</p><p>Three alternate tidal dissipation mechanisms have been proposed: dynamical tides <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zahn 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Zahn , 1977</ref>, equilibrium tides <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Zahn 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hut 1981)</ref>, and hydrodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Tassoul 1988)</ref>. Despite its long period of development, the inherent difficulty of observing tidal dissipation has prevented definitive conclusions. <ref type="bibr">Zahn &amp; Bouchet (1989)</ref> add a further complication by maintaining that most of the orbital circularization process takes place at the beginning of the Hayashi phase, and that the eccentricity of a binary should then remain nearly constant throughout its lifetime on the main sequence.</p><p>Observational tests of these tidal circularization theories, whereby t circ is measured statistically in coeval stellar populations, have so far proved inconclusive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">North &amp; Zahn (2003)</ref> found that short-period binaries in both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds seem to have been circularized in agreement with the theory of dynamical tides. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Meibom &amp; Mathieu (2005)</ref> show that with the exception of the Hyades, the stars in the clusters that they observed were considerably more circularized than any of the known dissipation mechanisms would predict. Furthermore, they find with a high degree of certainty, that older clusters are more circularized than younger ones, thereby contradicting the Hayashi phase circularization model. Encouraged by the statistical effect of circularization that can be seen in our catalog <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 22)</ref>, we further estimated t circ for each of the eccentric systems as follows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zahn (1977</ref><ref type="bibr">Zahn ( , 1978</ref> provides an estimate for the orbital circularization timescale due to turbulent dissipation in stars possessing a convective envelope, assuming that corotation has been achieved:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t circ = 1 21q(1 + q)k 2 MR 2 L 1/3 a R 8<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where M, R, L are the star's mass, radius and luminosity, and k 2 is the apsidal motion constant of the star, which is determined by its internal structure and dynamics.</p><p>More massive stars, which do not have a convective envelope but rather develop a radiative envelope, are thought to circularize their orbit using radiative damping <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zahn 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Claret &amp; Cunha 1997)</ref>. This is a far slower mechanism, whose circularization timescale can be estimated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">t circ = 2 21q(1 + q) 11/6 E 2 R 3 GM 1/2 a R 21/2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where E 2 is the tidal torque constant of the star, and G is the universal gravitational constant. We can greatly simplify these expressions by applying Kepler's law [a 3 = GM(1 + q)(P/2π) 2 ], and adopt the Cox (2000) power law approximations for the main-sequence mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations. For the convective envelope case, we adopt the late-type mass-radius relation (M &lt; 1.3M ⊙ ), and for the radiative envelope case we adopt the early-type mass-radius relation (M ≥ 1.3M ⊙ ), thus arriving at:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">t circ ≃ 0.53Myr (k 2 /0.005) −1 q −1 (1 + q) 5/3 (P/day) 16/3 (M/M ⊙ ) −4.99 , M &lt; 1.3M ⊙ 1370Myr (E 2 /10 −8 ) −1 q −1 (1 + q) 5/3 (P/day) 7 (M/M ⊙ ) −2.76 , M ≥ 1.3M ⊙<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Determining the value of k 2 and E 2 is the most difficult part of this exercise, since their values are a function of the detailed structure and dynamics of the given star, which in turn changes significantly as the star evolves <ref type="bibr">(Claret &amp; Cunha 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Claret &amp; Willems 2002)</ref>. In our calculation, we estimate these values by interpolating published theoretical tables [k 2 : Zahn (1994), E 2 : Zahn (1975); <ref type="bibr">Claret &amp; Cunha (1997)</ref>]. Since both stellar components contribute to the circularization process, the combined circularization timescale becomes t circ = 1/(t −1 circ,1 + t −1 circ,2 ), where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the primary and secondary binary components <ref type="bibr">(Claret &amp; Cunha 1997)</ref>. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, we list the combined circularization timescale for each of the eccentric EBs we identify.</p><p>The value of t circ for most of the eccentric systems (21 of 34) is larger than the Hubble time, indicating that no significant circularization is expected to have taken place since they settled on the main sequence. About a quarter of the eccentric systems (8 of 34) have a t circ smaller than the Hubble time but larger than 1 Gyr. While circularization is underway, the fact that they are still eccentric is consistent with theoretical expectations. The remaining systems (5 of 34) all have t circ &lt; 1 Gyr, have periods less than 3.3 days, and unless they are extremely young, require an explanation for their eccentric orbits. Two of these EBs (T-Tau0-02487 and T-Tau0-03916) are located near the star forming regions of Taurus, supporting the hypothesis that they are indeed young. However, this hypothesis does not seem to be adequate for T-Cas0-02603, which has a period of only 2.2 days and t circ ≃ 0.26 Gyr, while possessing a large eccentricity of e ≃ 0.25. An alternative explanation is that some of these binaries were once further apart, having larger orbital periods, and thus larger circularization timescales. These systems may have been involved in a comparably recent interaction with a third star (a collision or near miss), or have been influenced by repeated resonant perturbations of a tertiary companion.</p><p>Finally, we would like to draw the reader's attention to our shortest-period eccentric EB, T-Cas0-00394, whose period is a mere 1.7 days. Notably, this system is entirely consistent with theory, since its mass falls in a precarious gap, where the stellar envelopes of its components are no longer convective, yet their radiative envelopes are not sufficiently extended to produce significant tidal drag (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 23</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Abnormal EBs</head><p>The third group of EBs consists of 20 abnormal systems (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 17  and 18</ref>). While possessing the distinctive characteristics of EBs, these LCs stood out during manual inspection for a variety of reasons. These systems underline the difficulty of fully automating any LC pipeline, as any such system will inevitably need to recognize atypical EBs that were not encountered before.</p><p>The LCs we listed can be loosely classified into groups according to the way they deviate from a simple EB model. A few cases exhibited pulsation-like fluctuations that were not synchronized with the EB period (shorter-period: T-Dra0-00398, longer-period: T-Lyr1-00359, T-Per1-00750). These fluctuations may be due either to the activity of an EB component, or to a third star whose light is blended with the binary. In principle, one can identify the active star by examining the amplitude of the fluctuations during the eclipses. If the fluctuations originate from one of the components, their observed amplitude will be reduced when the component is being eclipsed. In such a case, if the fluctuations are due to pulsations, they can further provide independent constraints to the stellar properties through astro-seismological models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mkrtichian et al. 2004</ref>). To identify such fluctuating EBs one must subtract the fitted EB model from the LC, and evaluate the residuals [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pilecki &amp; Szczygiel (2007)</ref>]. When the fluctuation period is fixed, one can simply search the residual LC using a periodogram, as was done in step (1) of our pipeline (see §2). However, when the fluctuation period varies (i.e. non-coherent), as in the aforementioned LCs, one must employ alternate methods, since simply phasing their LC will not produce any discernable structure. For LCs with long-period fluctuations one can directly search the residuals for time dependencies, while for LCs with short-period fluctuations one can search the residuals for non-Gaussian distributions. However, in practice these measurements will likely not be robust, as there are many instrumental effects that can produce false positives. Thus, we employ a search for auto-correlations in the residual time series, which overcomes most instrumental effects, while providing a reliable indicator for many types of pseudo-periodic fluctuations.</p><p>The remaining systems had LC distortions that appear to be synchronized with the orbital period. The source of these fluctuations is likely due to long-lasting surface inhomogeneities on one or both of the rotationally synchronized components. When the LC has brief periodic episodes of darkening (T-And0-11476, T-Cas0-13944, T-Cyg1-07584, TDra0-04520), they can usually be explained as stable star spots, but brief periodic episodes of brightening (T-And0-04594, T-Her0-08091), which may indicate the presence of stable hot-spots, are more difficult to interpret. This phenomenon is especially puzzling in the aforementioned two cases, in which the brightening episodes are briefer than one would expect from a persistent surface feature and repeat at the middle of both plateaus.</p><p>When the two plateaus of a LC are not flat, they are usually symmetric about the center of the eclipses. This is due to the physical mirror symmetry about the line intersecting the binary components' centers. When the axis of symmetry does not coincide with the center of eclipse (T-And0-00920, T-Cyg1-08866, T-Dra0-03105, T-Lyr1-07584, T-Lyr1-15595), a phenomenon we term "eclipse offset", we conclude that this symmetry must somehow be broken. This may occur if the EB components are not rotationally synchronized, or have a substantial tidal lag. Another form of this asymmetry can appear as an amplitude difference between the two LC plateaus (T-Her0-03497, T-Lyr1-13166, T-Per1-08789, T-UMa0-03090). This phenomenon, which was originally called the "periastron effect" and has since been renamed the "O'Connell effect", has been known for over a century, and has been extensively studied [e.g. O' <ref type="bibr">Connell (1951)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Milone (1986)</ref>]. Classic hypotheses suggest an uneven distribution of circumstellar material orbiting with the binary (Struve 1948) or surrounding the stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mergentaler 1950</ref>), either of which could induce a preferential H − absorption on one side. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Binnendijk (1960)</ref> was the first of many to suggested that the this asymmetry is due to subluminous regions of the stellar surface (i.e. star spots). However, this explanation also requires the stars to be rotationally synchronized, and for the spots to be stable over the duration of the observations. Alternate models abound, including a hot spot on one side of a component brought about through mass transfer from the other component, persistent star spots created by an off-axis magnetic field, and circumstellar material being captured by the components and heating one side of both stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Liu &amp; Yang 2003)</ref>. As with many phenomena that have multiple possible models, the true answer may involve a combination of a number of these mechanisms, and will likely vary from system to system <ref type="bibr">(Davidge &amp; Milone 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, a few particularly unusual LCs (T-Dra0-03105, T-Lyr1-05984) display a very large difference between their eclipse durations. Although a moderate difference could be explained by an eccentric orbit, such extreme eccentricities in systems with such short orbital periods (0.5 and 1.5 days) are highly unlikely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We presented a catalog of 773 eclipsing binaries found in 10 fields of the TrES survey, identified and analyzed using an automated pipeline. We described the pipeline we used to identify and model them. The pipeline was designed to be mostly automated, with manual inspections taking place only once the vast majority of non-EB LCs had been automatically filtered out. At the final stage of the pipeline we classified the EBs into 7 groups: eccentric, circular, ambiguous-equal, ambiguous-unequal, inverted, Roche-lobe-filling, and abnormal. The former four groups were all successfully modeled with our model fitting program. However, the latter three groups possessed significant additional physical phenomena (tidal distortions, mass-transfer, and surface activity), which did not conform to the simple detached-EB model we employed.</p><p>We highlighted three groups of binaries, which may be of particular interest and warrant follow-up observations. These groups are: low-mass EBs, EBs with eccentric orbits, and abnormal EBs. The low-mass EBs (both components &lt; 0.75M ⊙ ) allow one to probe the mass-radius relation at the bottom of the main-sequence. Only 7 such EBs have previously been confirmed, and the physical properties of many of them are inconsistent with current theoretical models. Our group of 10 new candidates will likely provide considerable additional constraints to the models, and the discovery of 2 long period systems could help confirm a recent hypothesis that this inconsistency is due to stellar magnetic activity. The eccentricorbit EBs may help confirm and constrain tidal circularization theory, as many of them have comparably short circularization timescales. We demonstrated that, as one would predict from the theory, the shortest period systems fall within a narrow range of masses, in which their stellar envelopes cease to be convective yet their envelopes are not extended enough to produce significant tidal drag. The abnormal EBs seem to show a plethora of effects that are indicative of asymmetries, stellar activity, persistent hot and cold spots, and a host of other physical phenomena. Some of these systems may require dedicated study to be properly understood.</p><p>In the future, as LC datasets continue to grow, it will become increasingly necessary to use such automated pipelines to identify rare and interesting targets. Such systematic searches promise a wealth of data that can be used to test and constrain theories in regions of their parameter-space that were previously inaccessible. Furthermore, even once the physics of "vanilla" systems has been solved, more complex cases will emerge to challenge us to achieve a better understanding of how stars form, evolve and interact.</p><p>We would like to thank Tsevi Mazeh for many useful discussions, as well as Søren Meibom for his repeated help.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Rejecting single-eclipse EB Models</head><p>An EB LC comprised of a deep eclipse and a very shallow eclipse, can occur in one of two ways. Either the secondary component is luminous but extremely small (e.g. a white dwarf observed in UV), thus producing a shallow primary eclipse, or the secondary component is comparably large but extremely dim, thus producing a shallow secondary eclipse. The first case, though possible [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Maxted et al. (2004)</ref>], is extremely rare, and will have a signature "flat bottom" to the eclipse. We have not encountered such a LC in our dataset. The second case will have a rounded eclipse bottom, due to the primary component's limb darkening. Assuming this latter contingency, in which the secondary component is dark in comparison to the primary component, we can place a lower bound to its radius (R 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R 2 ≥ R 1 1 − 10 −0.4∆mag 1 ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>where R 1 is the radius of the primary component, and ∆mag 1 is the magnitude depth of the primary eclipse. Thus, if the eclipse is very deep, the size of the secondary component must approach the size of the primary component. However, coeval short-period detached EBs with components of similar sizes yet desperate luminosities are expected to be very rare, assuming they follow normal stelar evolution. Therefore, if only one eclipse is detected, and it is both rounded and sufficiently deep, we may conclude that this configuration entry is likely to be incorrect, and that the correct configuration has double the orbital period and produces two equal eclipses. Only when we cannot apply such a period doubling solution (i.e. when the secondary eclipse is detectable), do we resort to questioning our assumption of normal stelar evolution (see classification group V, described in §2).</p></div>

The BLS method excelled at identifying EBs with short-duration eclipses (compared to the orbital period), which predominately occur at periods &gt; 0.75 days. The AoV method fared better with EBs that have long-duration eclipses, which predominately occur in sub-day periods. The AoV method also does well with EBs with period longer than 10 days, which may be dominated by giant-giant binaries ( <ref type="bibr">Derekas et al. 2007)</ref>, and so also have broad eclipses. This plot demonstrates the importance of using multiple independent methods of identifying EB, otherwise the results will have a significant selection effect that may bias any statistical results. The slope of the residuals indicates that the assumed period is inaccurate. The grey solid line is predicted by the best circular-orbit model, whereas the dashed lines are predicted by the best eccentric-orbit model (compare to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>). After correction, we get a fine-tuned period of 5.712516days. This 0.03% correction is small but significant in that without having had this correction, the eclipses would have smeared out and widened.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>, the slope here is consistent with zero, thus indicating that the period does not need to be fine-tuned. However, the O − C offset between the primary (circles) and secondary (triangle) eclipses is significant (1449 seconds), indicating that this EB has an eccentric orbit. The reduced chi-squared of the best circular-orbit model (grey solid line) is χ 2 ν = 12.9, while the reduced chi-squared of the best eccentric-orbit model (dashed lines) is χ 2 ν = 0.95.

The plots shown here have the ages set to the values that produced the lowest MECI minima. Fig. 8.-The EB orbital period distribution within the catalog. Each bin is subdivided to show the number of binaries belonging to each of the classification groups described in §2. Note that the ambiguous-equal and ambiguous-unequal entries represent the same stars, with entries in the former group having double the period of the latter. Notice also how the Roche-lobe-filling EBs dominate the sub-day bins, and have a long tail stretching well above 10-day periods. Furthermore, the circular orbit EBs have a period distribution peak of at ∼2 days, while the eccentric orbit EBs peak at ∼5 days. This is likely due to the orbital circularization that occurs preferentially in short-period systems (see also <ref type="bibr">Figures 22 and 23)</ref>.</p><p>-51 - <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Eccentric EBs (panel 1).

We included the unsuccessful best-fit MECI model (solid curve) as an approximate reference to illustrate the LC of a corresponding binary that has had no mass transfer.

Some of the ambiguous solutions deviate from these clusters due to poor constraints on the secondary eclipse, which brings about a large uncertainty. Finally, notice the sparsity of EBs populating the low-mass corner of this plot (M 1,2 &lt; 0.75 M ⊙ ). These systems, whose importance is outlined in §3.1, were modeled using the Baraffe isochrones.

The solid line is the linear regression of the log of the EB discovery yield (r 2 = 0.867).

The left-most dot-dash line demarcates the binary contact limit, and the remaining curves mark systems with increasing circularization time (see equation 10). Note the abrupt increase in the circularization time for systems more massive than ∼ 1.25M ⊙ , at which point the stellar convective envelope becomes radiative, and thus far less efficient at tidal dissipation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>); TrES: Alonso et al.
