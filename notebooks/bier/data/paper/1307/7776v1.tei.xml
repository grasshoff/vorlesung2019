				<p>We investigate the condition for capture into first-order mean motion resonances using numerical simulations with a wide range of various parameters. In particular, we focus on deriving the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance; additional numerical experiments for closely spaced resonances (e.g., 3:2) are also performed. We find that the critical migration timescale is determined by the planet-to-stellar mass ratio, and its dependence exhibits power-law behavior with index −4/3. This dependence is also supported by simple analytic arguments. We also find that the critical migration timescale for systems with equal-mass bodies is shorter than that in the restricted problem; for instance, for the 2:1 resonance between two equal-mass bodies, the critical timescale decreases by a factor of 10. In addition, using the obtained formula, the origin of observed systems that include first-order commensurabilities is constrained. Assuming that pairs of planets originally form well separated from each other and then undergo convergent migration and are captured in resonances, it is possible that a number of exoplanets experienced rapid orbital migration. For systems in closely spaced resonances, the differential migration timescale between the resonant pair can be constrained well; it is further suggested that several exoplanets underwent migration that can equal or even exceed the type I migration rate predicted by the linear theory. This implies that some of them may have formed in situ. Future observations and the use of our model will allow us to statistically determine the typical migration speed in a protoplanetary disk.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>When two bodies are in a mean motion resonance, their orbital periods are close to a ratio of two integers, which stabilizes the system in many cases. The Laplace 4:2:1 resonance among the Galilean satellites and the 3:2 resonances between Neptune and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are well-known examples in the solar system.</p><p>More than 30 exoplanet systems also include confirmed planets exhibiting mean motion resonances. In addition, Kepler has detected a large number of planet pairs near mean motion resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baruteau &amp; Papaloizou 2013</ref>), although they are not necessarily in resonances. Many exoplanets are not near mean motion resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>). However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ogihara &amp; Ida (2009)</ref>, such non resonant configurations can be established through orbit crossing among the planets after they are captured in mutual mean motion resonances. Thus, mean motion resonances may have played an important role in the planet formation process.</p><p>To date, mean motion resonances have been studied from many perspectives (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goldreich 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wisdom 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Henrard 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Weidenschilling &amp; Davis 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nelson &amp; Papaloizou 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kley et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Terquem &amp; Papaloizou 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Raymond et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> ogihara@nagoya-u.jp hkobayas@nagoya-u.jp <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ogihara et al. 2010</ref>). Resonant configurations are thought to arise primarily from convergent migration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Snellgrove et al. 2001</ref>). Several efforts have been made to derive a critical differential (relative) migration timescale t a,crit above which mean motion resonances can be formed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Friedland (2001)</ref> analytically studied the restricted three-body problem with adiabatic migrating bodies, where the relative migration timescale is much longer than the resonant libration timescale. In contrast, recent studies have adopted numerical methods. One approach is to perform direct N -body calculations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ida et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wyatt 2003)</ref>, which take a direct summation of the mutual interaction between the bodies. Another approach uses the Hamiltonian model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Quillen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011)</ref>, where the canonical equations of the Hamiltonian are solved numerically with some approximations. These studies examine the dependence of the critical migration timescale on the mass but consider the restricted three-body problem with a massive planet and a massless test particle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rein et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rein et al. ( , 2012</ref> performed direct N -body calculations with equal-mass planets. However, because their goal was to specify the origin of individual systems, the planetary mass was not usually treated as a parameter.</p><p>Our main aim is to derive an empirical formula for the critical migration timescale of capture into first-order p + 1 : p mean motion resonances by performing direct N -body simulations. We handle the physical variables (e.g., mass and damping timescales) as parameters and vary them over wide ranges. In this way, the dependences of the critical migration timescale on the parameters can be obtained. Although the equal-mass case is of primary importance for the study of observed exoplanets in resonances, previous general studies, which are not restricted to particular systems, have not considered this situation; therefore, we examine the case of equal-mass bodies. Captures into 2:1 resonances, which are the outermost first-order resonances, are extensively studied in this paper; in addition, more closely spaced commensurabilities (e.g., 3:2 and 4:3) are also examined. From the empirical formula based on our numerical results, we try to constrain the origin of the orbital architecture of planetary systems exhibiting commensurabilities.</p><p>The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the numerical methods; in Section 3, we present and summarize the results of N -body simulations. In Section 4, we derive the mass dependence of the critical migration time, and in Section 5, we compare our results with those of previous studies. In Section 6, we apply these results to systems with resonances and discuss their origin, and in Section 7, we offer our conclusion.</p><p>2. NUMERICAL MODEL <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> presents the calculation model considered in this work. Initially, two planets with masses of M 1 (inner body) and M 2 (outer body) are placed at semimajor axes a 1 and a 2 , respectively. The initial eccentricity of these bodies is set to e ini , and their inclination is also set to about e ini in radian. Damping forces are applied to the bodies that damp the eccentricity and semimajor axis on timescales of t e and t a , respectively. We apply the a-damping force only to one body (mostly to the outer body); therefore, t a is interpreted as the timescale of differential migration between the bodies. The initial locations are adopted to be separated from the resonance a 2 /a 1 = [(p + 1)/p] 2/3 ; namely, a 2 = 1.8a 1 for 2:1 resonance, and for other closer resonances (e.g., p = 2) the orbits are set just inside the p : p − 1 resonance a 2 /a 1 = [p/(p − 1)] 2/3 . Thus, when t e is much shorter than t a , the eccentricity is negligibly small at the resonant encounter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>.-The model considered in this paper. Two bodies of masses M 1 and M 2 with orbits of semimajor axes a 1 and a 2 , respectively, around a central body with mass M * . The initial eccentricities are set to e ini . The orbits of the inner and outer bodies are circularized on timescales of t e,1 and t e,2 , respectively. We assume the outer body undergoes inward migration on the timescale of ta to see capture into a p + 1 : p mean motion resonance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M * M 1 M 2 0 a 1 a 2 a p+1:p t a t e,2 t e,1 e ini e ini</formula><p>The equation of motion for planet 2 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d 2 r 2 dt 2 = −GM * r 2 |r 2 | 3 − GM 1 r 2 − r 1 |r 2 − r 1 | 3</formula></div>

RESULTS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Procedure for Obtaining Critical Migration Timescale</head><p>We estimate the critical migration timescale in a manner similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wyatt (2003)</ref>. Orbital integrations of two planets are performed with various parameters to determine whether the planets are captured into 2:1 mean motion resonances. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 2</ref> shows the evolution of the semimajor axes and eccentricities of the two planets with a migration timescale t a of 1.59 × 10 7 T K in the fiducial model. When a 2:1 commensurability is formed at t ≃ 1.7 × 10 6 T K , the eccentricities are excited. We also confirm that the two resonant angles 1 librate about fixed values.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 2</ref>.-Example of orbital evolution, where the migration timescale of the outer body is assumed to be 1.59 × 10 7 T K .

Two bodies are captured into the 2:1 mean motion resonance at t ≃ 1.7 × 10 6 T K .</p><p>We made 10 runs for each migration timescale with different initial orbital phase angles and derived the capture probability P of 2:1 resonances . When the period ratio lies within an error of 1%, we call it a resonant capture. Note that the long-term stability of the resonant configuration is not considered. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3(a)</ref> shows the capture probability for the fiducial model as a function of the migration time. The probability P is assumed to have the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P = 1 + t a t a,crit γ −1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where t a,crit is defined as the migration time for which P = 0.5 and γ is a constant. Using a least-squares fit to the data (solid line), we specify t a,crit and γ. The capture probability increases sharply at t a ≃ 1.1 × 10 7 T K , which means that the critical migration time t a,crit can be estimated without introducing large errors (γ −300). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>(b) presents the results for an initial eccentricity of e ini = 0.01. In this case, the eccentricity is 0.01 at the resonant encounter because the inner body does not undergo eccentricity damping. In contrast to low e ini , high eccentricities reduce P at t a = 10 7 -10 8 T K , and P gradually increases with t a (γ ≃ −2.2). This broadening of the capture probability curve at higher eccentricity is also seen in previous studies (e.g., Quillen 2006; Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011). We find that the critical migration timescale can be sharply defined except when the eccentricity is not small (e 0.01) at the resonant encounter. In the following subsections, the value of γ is explicitly described only when the transition is not sharp enough. The eccentricity dependence of P is summarized in Section 3.5. We performed ∼ 100 runs for each set of parameters (∼ 15, 000 runs in total). .-Capture probability versus migration timescale for (a) the fiducial model and (b) the model having relatively high initial eccentricities (e ini ≃ 0.01). A least-squares fit to the data (solid lines) allows the critical migration timescale (ta for P = 0.5) to be specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Dependence on M 1</head><p>We first examine the dependence of the critical migration timescale on the mass of the larger body and 10 2 . In order to keep computational cost reasonable, we also put an upper limit of t a,crit = 10 8 T K . For e ini = 10 −2 , the eccentricity of the inner body is ≃ 0.01 at the resonant encounter and the capture probability curve is broadened (γ ≃ −2-−4).  This survey reveals two features. First, all of the t a,crit values except that for M 1 /M 2 = 1 are within about a factor of two of each other. This suggests that t a,crit depends weakly on t e,1 , t e,2 , and e ini , which can be seen in the following subsections in more detail. Second, all the cases exhibit a similar power-law dependence of t a,crit on M 1 . The gradients are calculated for each case by least-squares fits, and we obtain a typical power index approximately equal to −4/3. A physical interpretation for this dependence is discussed in Section 4.</p><p>3.3. Dependence on M 2 /M 1 Next, we explore the effect of varying M 2 /M 1 . Note that the dependence can be seen more clearly when M 2 /M 1 is used instead of M 2 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> shows t a,crit as a function of M 2 /M 1 . Open squares represent the fiducial case. Filled squares, open circles, filled circles, and open triangles show the results for M 1 /M ⊕ = 10 2 , t e,1 /T K = 10 3 , t e,2 /T K = ∞, and e ini = 10 −2 , respectively. Same as the previous subsection, the capture probability curve is not sharp for e ini = 10 −2 (γ ≃ −1-−3).</p><p>We find that if M 2 /M 1 10 −1 , t a,crit is independent of M 2 /M 1 ; therefore, the restricted three-body approximation is valid for this condition. The difference between t a,crit for M 2 /M 1 = 1 and the value for small M 2 /M 1 is found to be a factor of about 10. Thus, although the restricted three-body approach cannot provide an accurate prediction of t a,crit for bodies with comparable masses, it would be possible to roughly derive t a,crit to an accuracy of a factor of 10. See also discussions in Sections 3.8 and 5 for the reason for the difference. Note that we consider only the migration of the outer planet. Because migration speed depends on planetary mass, the inner planet's migration is not negligible, especially for M 1 ∼ M 2 . However, if we apply the differential </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M 1 /M ⊕ = 10 2 , t e,1 /T K = 10 3 , t e,2 /T K = ∞ and e ini = 10 −2 , respectively.</formula><p>migration speed instead of the migration speed of the outer planet, the critical migration timescales we obtain are valid even considering the migration of both planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the results for various eccentricitydamping timescales for the inner (larger) planet, t e,1 .</p></div>

The rightmost points on the horizontal axis are the cases without eccentricity damping. For e ini = 10 −2 and t e,1 = ∞, the transition from a capture probability of zero to one is not very sharp (γ ≃ −2). There is no systematic change in t a,crit with t e,1 . Even when t e,1 is varied by more than four orders of magnitude, the differences in t a,crit lie within a factor of two or three.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">fiducial M 1 M 1 = 10 2 M = M 2 t e,2 e ini = ∞ = 10 -2 t e,1 (T K )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">M 1 /M ⊕ = 10 2 , M 1 /M 2 = 1, t e,1 /T K = 10 3</formula><p>, and e ini = 10 −2 , respectively. For e ini = 10 −2 , the transition in the capture protability is not sharp (γ ≃ −2-−6). We also do not see any clear trends in t e,2 . Although the case with e = 10 −2 (open triangles) shows a slight variation, it still remains within a factor of a few.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Dependence on e ini</head><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows the results for various initial eccentricities e ini . Open squares represent the fiducial case. Filled squares, open circles, filled circles, and open triangles are the results for M 1 /M ⊕ = 10 2 , M 1 /M 2 = 1, t e,1 /T K = 10 3 , and t e,2 /T K = ∞, respectively. When the eccentricity is not small (e 0.01) at the resonant encounter, in other words, when e ini ≥ 10 −2 and t e &gt; t a , the capture probability curve is not sharp the same as before. Again, no clear trends in t a,crit with e ini are recognized. Note that, for e ini = 10 −1 and M 1 /M 2 = 1 (open circles) and for t e,2 /T K = ∞ (open triangles), t a,crit cannot be determined to have particular values. Because the eccentricity of the smaller body M 2 at a resonant encounter is relatively large, adequate resonant capture does not occur even for long t a ; the capture probability does not exceed about 0.3. Except for large e ini , the dependence is reasonably weak. Several of these features are in agreement with previous studies, which will be discussed in Section 5.</p></div>

Open squares represent the results for M 2 /M 1 = 10 −2 , whereas filled squares represent those for equal-mass bodies (M 2 /M 1 = 1). In each case, the other parameters are set to the fiducial values (M 1 /M ⊕ = 1, t e,1 /T K = ∞, t e,2 /T K = 10 3 , e ini = 10 −4 ). We see that the critical migration time decreases with decreasing separation. The critical migration timescale for equal-mass bodies (M 1 = M 2 ) is always shorter than that with bodies that have a high mass ratio (M 1 = 100M 2 ). The difference in t a,crit is larger at 2:1 resonances than at closely spaced resonances. This is presumably because the strength of the 2:1 external resonance, where "external" means that the inner body is the dominant body, is significantly weakened by indirect terms in the disturbing function, which will also be discussed in Section 3.8.

Note that although C should depend on commensurability, the values are the same between the 5:4 and 6:5 resonances, which suggests that the difference is within the minimum interval of t a that we set for our investigation. The dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> represent fitting results for equal-mass cases (M 1 = M 2 ). Although the approximate fits for closer resonances are considered to be correct within a factor of a few, they should be treated with some caution. We observe that when M 1 /M ⊕ = 100 and p = 3, 4, the bodies undergo close encounters before being captured into resonances; therefore, the bodies do not settle into stable resonant orbits, as indicated by the open symbols in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>.</p><p>According to the analysis of the Hill stability by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gladman (1993)</ref>, dynamical stability is almost guaranteed if ∆ 2 √ 3 r H , where r H is the mutual Hill radius. Note that if the orbital separation is within a few tens of percent beyond the critical Hill separation, Hill-stable planetary systems may manifest Lagrange instability when the outer planet escapes to infinity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes &amp; Greenberg 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Veras &amp; Mustill 2013)</ref>. There is no analytical criteria that describe Lagrange stability, and additional numerical simulation is required to determine whether the system is Lagrange stable or not. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes &amp; Greenberg (2005)</ref> found that the Hill stable condition is a good predictor of Lagrange stability. The Hill stable condition is rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">M 1 + M 2 ≤ 1 √ 3 (p + 1) 2/3 − p 2/3 (p + 1) 2/3 + p 2/3 3 M * .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The critical masses for equal-mass bodies assuming M * = M ⊙ are plotted with crosses connected with by a solid line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>. If the mass of the body is larger than the critical mass, the system becomes Hill unstable, which is consistent with our results that exhibit close encounters (open symbols). Note that even if ∆ 2 √ 3r H , the orbit in a resonance can become stable for specific orbital arguments (some examples are provided in Section 6). This criterion for the instability is a rough estimate, and long-term orbital integration can reveal the instability time of planets in closely spaced mean motion resonances.</p></div>

Assuming M 1 = 10 −2 M ⊕ , M 2 = 1M ⊕ , t e,1 = 10 3 T K , t e,2 = ∞, and e ini = 10 −4 , the critical migration timescales are determined for 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5 resonances, which are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> with crosses.</p><p>We find that no significant difference between the internal and external resonances; in fact, it lies within a factor of two.

For the 2:1 external resonance, the contribution of the direct term is diminished by the indirect term, leading to weakening the strength of the resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Quillen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011)</ref>.

We see that l j for the 2:1 external resonance is large. The fact that the 2:1 internal resonance is stronger than the 2:1 external resonance would also partially explain the decrease in t a,crit for equal-mass bodies in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 5 and 9</ref> although this cannot account for the entire change.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ANALYSIS OF THE DEPENDENCE OF T A,CRIT</head><p>ON M 1 We discuss the numerical results using analytical arguments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES</head><p>We here discuss our results by comparing with previous studies. First, our results for two bodies that have a high mass ratio can be compared to the works that consider the restricted problem (e.g., Quillen 2006; Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011). We find that several features in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>, in which the dependence of t a,crit on the eccentricity is investigated, are in agreement with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 2</ref> in their paper) as follows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref> showed that when the generalized momentum is small enough, which corresponds to small e, the capture probability curve is steep and t a,crit hardly depends on e. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>, we observe that t a,crit is well-defined and almost independent of e when e at the resonant encounter is small (e 10 −3 for M 1 = 1M ⊕ ). In this case, the value of t a,crit is also comparable to that derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref>; that is, their estimate for t a,crit is ≃ 4×10 6 T K for M 1 = 1M ⊕ . We also see another feature of steepening dependence on e at higher e. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref>, t a,crit tends to sensitively depend on e when e is larger than ∼ 0.01 and ∼ 0.05 for M 1 = 1M ⊕ and 100M ⊕ , respectively, which are seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> in the models of t e,2 = ∞ and M 1 = 10 2 M ⊕ . The other feature is that the capture probability has a cutoff at high eccentricity and never exceeds about 0.3 in the case of t e,2 = ∞. In our results, the cutoff eccentricity is e ≃ 0.01, which quantitatively reproduces the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, several similar features are observed even in the results for equal-mass bodies; namely, the weak dependence of t a,crit on e and the existence of the cutoff in the capture probability at high e, which were expected from the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011</ref>). Note, however, that the values of t a,crit differ by a factor of 10 between the restricted problem and the unrestricted problem. Even if we consider the difference between the internal resonance and the unrestricted problem, there is at least a factor of a few difference in t a,crit . Special care would have to be taken when one quantitatively discuss the critical migration timescale for equal-mass bodies.</p><p>Several properties observed in our simulations were also seen in a dynamical study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rein et al. (2012)</ref>. shows their results for two planets of comparable mass, whereas <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 2(c)</ref> shows the case where one body is a test particle. They found that the allowed region for the comparable-mass case is wider than that for the zeromass particle, which suggests that planets with comparable masses are more easily captured into mean motion resonances. In our model, we find that the critical migration timescale for equal-mass planets is shorter than that for systems with high mass ratios. In addition, we also see a weak dependence of the critical migration timescale on the e-damping timescales. This tendency is also seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rein et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Exoplanet Systems</head><p>As of 2013, more than 25 planetary systems that lie in or close to first-order mean motion resonances have been detected (e.g., ). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists the orbital properties of the confirmed planets that could be in first-order resonances 2 . The fourth and fifth columns show the masses and semimajor axes of the planets, respectively; the sixth and seventh columns show the resonant properties. For example, the third row indicates that Gliese 876 c could be in a 2:1 resonance with planet b, where the period ratio of these planets is 2.03. The data are taken from the Open Exoplanet Catalogue 3 . Note that many systems listed have ratios more distant from commensurability than the 1% used to classify resonant captures in our simulations. Although the period ratios are close to commensurate values, not all of the planets necessarily lie in mean motion resonances.</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">C I f g = 0 .0 1 C I f g = 0 .</formula><p>1   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> are also plotted as open circles, which indicate the critical migration timescale for each pair. This means that the pair would be moved in the gas disk on a relative migration timescale longer than the critical value. In addition to ∆ = 2 √ 3r H , ∆ = 10r H is also marked by crosses connected by a solid line, which indicate the typical orbital separation of planets formed via oligarchic growth. The three dotted lines represent the type I migration timescale with different migration efficiencies, C I fg = 1, 0.1, and 0.01.</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">C I f g = 1 Δ = 10</formula><p>The solid and dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, which indicate the critical migration speeds, are the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>. For the resonant-pair exoplanets listed in Table 3, the critical migration timescale, plotted as open circles, is obtained from their resonant commensurability and the mass ratio between the smaller and larger bodies (M 2 /M 1 &lt; 0.1 or not) as a function of the larger planet mass. All pairs except for the pair of Gliese 876 b and e have roughly equal masses M 2 /M 1 &gt; 0.1. The outer planet migration timescale must be longer than the critical migration time for capture into mean motion resonance to occur. We obtained the critical migration timescale in Section 3 while ignoring the migration of inner planets. If the inner planets also migrate inward, the differential (or relative) migration speed between the inner and outer planets should be applied to the critical migration speed.</p><p>Using <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, we can place some constraints on the differential migration speeds that the exoplanets used to have. Note that in the following discussions, we intro-2 This is taken from two papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Szuszkiewicz &amp; Podlewska-Gaca 2012;</ref>) and should not be a complete list.</p><p>3 http://exoplanet.hanno-rein.de/ duce several assumptions: (i) Planets formed widely separated from the 2:1 resonance. (ii) The masses of planets do not evolve after the onset of migration. (iii) Migration is smooth and not subjected to stochastic torques 4 .</p><p>(iv) The eccentricities of planets are low and hence the transition from certain capture to certain failure is welldefined. (v) Once captured in resonance, planets do not subsequently escape from the resonance. The 2:1 mean motion resonance is the outermost firstorder mean motion resonance. The capture probability for the outer, higher-order mean motion resonance is very low. Therefore, if a system has a 2:1 commensurability, the differential migration speed would have been slower than that estimated from the critical migration time. If a system has a 3:2 commensurability, the outer planet passed through the 2:1 mean motion resonance because of the high migration speed and was captured into the 3:2 mean motion resonance; thus, the differential migration speeds is slower than the critical migration speed for the 3:2 mean motion resonance but faster than that for the 2:1 mean motion resonance. We can constrain the differential migration speed for capture in the other mean motion resonances in a similar manner. The pairs of exoplanets in the closely spaced mean motion resonances are expected to have migrated at significantly high speed.</p><p>Note that if two planets in a mean motion resonance formed with a small orbital separation, they may have been captured into closely spaced resonances under slow migration. In addition, if several planets simultaneously exhibit migration as a resonant convoy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McNeil et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009</ref>) rather than the single outer planet migrating inward, the critical migration timescale can be somewhat longer than that derived in Section 3. Nonetheless, our approach provides useful constraints on formation models without the need for further dynamical analyses and calculations for individual systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Overall Trend</head><p>Although the number of observed resonant exoplanets is too small to support a statistical discussion, we see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> that there is a general trend toward a decrease in the number of systems in closely spaced resonances with increasing mass. This trend can be understood in terms of the short critical migration timescale for capture into 2:1 resonances with high-mass planets; 1000-Earthmass planets can capture bodies into 2:1 resonances even if the migration timescale is quite short (≃ 100T K ).</p><p>As stated in Section 3.7, it is predicted that pairs with orbital separations smaller than ≃ 2 √ 3 Hill radii can be Hill unstable, and such configurations are rare. We note that the Hill stability criterion, more properly bodies should be Lagrange stable, gives only a sufficient condition for stability; thus, if the planets are in mean motion resonances, the system can become stable. However, they should experience a configuration where planets are not near resonances at some point during migration phase; therefore, it is possible that such planets undergo close encounters and are scattered away from the system. We find that almost all the pairs have separations larger than ≃ 2 √ 3r H ; however, there are several exceptions. We discuss these systems in Section 6.1.3.</p><p>On the other hand, several pairs have separations larger than ≃ 10 Hill radii, which is the typical orbital separation of planets formed via the oligarchic growth phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kokubo &amp; Ida 1998)</ref>. The location of ∆ = 10r H is also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> by crosses connected by a solid line, in the same way as for ∆ = 2 √ 3 r H . Thus, planets are believed to form in distant orbits, after which they migrate inward one by one, maintaining their orbital separations wider than 10r H <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009)</ref>. These systems include <ref type="bibr">Kepler-18, Kepler-48, Kepler-52, Kepler-53, and Kepler-57</ref>, which all have 2:1 commensurabilities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> gives the lower limits on the migration timescale.</p><p>For example, the Kepler-18 system consists of two lowdensity Neptune-mass planets (c and d) near a 2:1 resonance and an inner super-Earth (b) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cochran et al. 2011</ref>). The orbital separation of planets c and d is ≃ 13r H . The planets are believed to undergo migration with a differential migration speed slower than 2×10 4 T K .</p><p>Next, we focus on super-Earth-mass planets (M ∼ 10M ⊕ ), which have a relatively large number of samples, and compare their histories with the migration theory. Planets with a few tens of the Earth mass or less might have experienced type I migration. Through a linear calculation, the type I migration timescale is given by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tanaka et al. 2002)</ref> t a,lin = 1 2.7 + 1.1q</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">M M * −1 Σ g r 2 M * −1 c s v K 2 Ω K ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where −q denotes the surface density gradient.

If we introduce the type I migration efficiency C I ≡ t a,lin /t a to express the uncertainty in the type I migration theory, the type I migration timescale for q = 3/2 and L * = L ⊙ is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">t a = 5.0 × 10 4 C −1 I f −1 g M M ⊕ −1 T K .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>The type I migration speed is still uncertain 5 . Here, we consider a scenario in which the inner body is stationary and the outer body undergoes inward migration. Then the type I migration timescale (Equation <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>), which is identical to the relative migration timescale between the two bodies, can be drawn as a function of C I f g (dotted line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>).</p><p>Some of the exoplanets with masses of ∼ 10M ⊕ are in 2:1 resonances. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, they would not have undergone rapid migration, so C I f g 0.1. On the other hand, some planets are captured into closely spaced resonances. For them, a short migration time is required, and C I f g ∼ 1.</p><p>In order to reconcile the low migration efficiency (C I f g 0.1) and the linear type I migration theory, the migration of inner planets should be considered. If the inner planets migrate when they are captured into mean motion resonances, the differential migration speeds become much slower than the migration rate estimated from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(18)</ref>. This can explain the planets in the 2:1 mean motion resonances. On the other hand, the migration of inner planets is negligible if the inner planets are much smaller than the outer ones and/or if the inner planets have orbits around the inner edge of the disk. Such pairs of planets can be in closely spaced resonance because of the high relative migration speed.</p><p>In addition, the other possibility for a pileup of planets with masses of ≃ 10M ⊕ is that they are formed near the current resonance locations (e.g., 3:2 and 2:1). The orbital separations for 10-Earth-mass planets in 3:2 and 2:1 resonances are ≃ 10r H and ≃ 15r H , respectively. This is comparable to the typical separation after the oligarchic growth phase: planets are formed in situ and then migrate slightly and are captured in the resonances.</p><p>As argued above, the formation of resonances between two planets can be discussed in terms of two cases of the orbital separation at the time migration begins; namely, the planets are well separated from each other (∆ &gt; 10r H ), or they have relatively close orbits (∆ ≃ 10r H ). The orbital separation of the planets at the onset of migration is characterized by their migration and growth timescales. The growth timescale of a planet t g is determined by the accretion rate of surrounding planetesimals in the classical planet growth model, which is similar to or longer than the type I migration timescale at the time of migration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kokubo &amp; Ida 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009)</ref>. In this case, the inner planet starts to migrate before the outer planet does, resulting in an expansion of the orbital separation (∆ &gt; 10r H ). On the other hand, as planets grow, the surrounding planetesimals stirred by the planets are fragmented by mutual collisions. The resultant fragments effectively accrete onto planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kobayashi et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kobayashi et al. , 2011</ref>); t g depends on the initial planetesimal mass and radial gas density profile, and t g might be shorter than t a in some cases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kobayashi et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kobayashi et al. , 2012</ref>) when migration begins. If t g t a , the two planets can start their migration almost simultaneously, in which case the orbital separation (∆ ≃ 10r H ) is maintained during migration. Detailed calculations that include accretion, fragmentation, and migration are needed to clarify this behavior. Below we discuss some individual systems. First, in this subsection the systems in closely spaced resonances (e.g., 4:3 and 5:4) are considered. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, the differences in t a,crit between adjacent pairs are small; for instance, the t a,crit difference between the 4:3 and 5:4 resonances is only a factor of two. This means that the migration speeds for systems in closer resonances can be constrained well.</p><p>The Kepler-11 system, in which six planets have been confirmed, has a possible pair of planets in a 5:4 mean motion resonance (planets b and c). The critical migration timescales for the 4:3 and 5:4 resonances are 3 × 10 3 T K and 1.5 × 10 3 T K , respectively. Thus, if these planets are formed well separated from each other (∆ &gt; 10r H ) and then undergo convergent migration, the migration timescale would be a few thousand times T K . This migration speed is slightly higher than that of type I migration (C I f g 1). Because the other planets in the Kepler-11 system are not considered in resonances, it may not be natural to suppose that the planets undergo significant migration. Therefore, it seems likely that they are formed in situ and exhibit slight inward migration, which leads to capture into the 5:4 resonance. In addition, the required high type I migration speed is inconsistent with the typical migration speed which is predicted by the population synthesis model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ida &amp; Lin 2008)</ref>, which would also support the in situ formation. The orbital separation is slightly smaller than the typical orbital separation after oligarchic growth at 1 AU (≃ 10r H ); however, it has been shown that planets can be formed with smaller orbital separations near the central star (≃ 7r H ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009)</ref>. It is also possible that the planets formed in situ and planet b exhibited outward migration due to the tidal torque from the central star, resulting in capture into the resonance. Note that the difficulty of in situ accretion was pointed out in an investigation of the accretion and evolution of a hydrogen-rich atmosphere for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Ikoma &amp; Hori 2012)</ref>. Another possibility is that the planets are formed in distant orbits and migrate inward as a resonant convoy, in which the planets can pass through 2:1 resonances as they are pushed inward by the outer bodies in the resonances <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ogihara &amp; Ida 2009</ref>). However, in such a case, it is likely that other planets are also in resonances in the final state.</p><p>The Kepler-60 system consists of three planets: the inner pair (b and c) has 5:4 commensurability, and the outer pair (c and d) seems to be in a 4:3 resonance. If we assume that these planets formed well separated and then migrated inward, the differential migration timescale would be approximately 5 × 10 3 − 1 × 10 4 T K . Using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(21)</ref>, we find that the efficiency of type I migration multiplied by the scaling factor for the gas surface density is C I f g ≃ 1. This means that if the gas surface density is similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the migration speed would be that predicted by the linear theory of type I migration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tanaka et al. 2002)</ref>. We also do not exclude the possibility of an in situ formation model for this system. Next, we discuss resonant systems with small orbital separations (∆ 2 √ 3r H ), which can be Hill unstable. In the HD 200964 system, two Jovian-mass planets lie in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Johnson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wittenmyer et al. 2012</ref>), and their orbital separation is ≃ 1.5r H . If we assume that these planets are stable despite their small separation, the differential migration timescale for passing through the 3:2 resonance would be extremely short (≃ 60T K ). This migration speed is al-most impossible to achieve because a large amount of angular momentum should be delivered to the disk. Thus, it is not easy to provide a formation model that produces the orbital properties of the HD 200964 system. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rein et al. (2012)</ref> have also claimed that no formation scenarios are successful in reproducing 4:3 resonant planets similar to those in the HD 200964 system. Because the pair of planets around HD 200964 have almost crossing orbits, they might be in temporary resonance following orbital instability.</p><p>The HR 8799 system has inner and outer debris disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reidemeister et al. 2009</ref>) and four planets that were discovered by direct imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Marois et al. , 2010</ref>. The masses have not been well constrained; the planets have masses between a few and 13 Jupiter masses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Marley et al. 2012</ref>). Because the orbital separations of the second innermost pair (planets d and c) and the outermost pair (planets c and b) are small (≃ 3r H ), it is plausible that the two pairs of planets are in 2:1 mean motion resonances, which can stabilize the system over the estimated age of the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reidemeister et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fabrycky &amp; Murray-Clay 2010)</ref>. In this case, our model gives a lower limit on the migration timescale of 40T K . This value is quite small, so it may not provide a useful constraint. In addition to this lower limit, the time of passage of the Hill unstable region should be shorter than the orbital unstable time for a system with small orbital separation (∆ 2 √ 3 r H ). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fabrycky &amp; Murray-Clay (2010)</ref>, the crossing time, which is the timescale of the initiation of orbital instability, is ≃ 3 × 10 5 yr = 3 × 10 3 T K ; therefore, the actual migration timescale would be between 40 T K and 3 × 10 3 T K . The type II migration expected for such massive planets cannot bring about the short migration timescale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reidemeister et al. (2009)</ref> pointed out that if the masses of the planets are small, the system can be Hill stable.</p><p>Gliese 876, an M-dwarf star with a mass of 0.33M ⊙ , harbors four planets: planets c and b have comparable masses, and planets d and e are relatively small, with masses of ∼ 10M ⊕ . Planets c-b and b-e are in or close to the 2:1 resonance. The orbital separations for the inner pair (c-b) and the outer pair (b-e) are 3.2r H and 3.5r H , respectively. These planets are believed to be in the 2:1 resonance to stabilize their orbits at such a small orbital separation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marcy et al. 2001</ref>). The lower limits to the differential migration timescales are 40T K for the inner pair and 400T K for the outer pair, which is consistent with the migration timescale obtained from a hydrodynamical simulation of this system by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kley et al. (2004)</ref>.</p><p>Finally in this subsection, we add some comments on planets with small separations that are still Hill stable. The HD 45364 system consists of two planets with masses comparable to those of Saturn and Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Correia et al. 2009)</ref>, which seem to be in a 3:2 mean motion resonance with a separation of 3.9r H . This system should have undergone rapid migration to pass through the 2:1 resonance. The critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance is given by t a,crit ≃ 10 3 T K ; thus, the differential migration timescale should be at least shorter than 10 3 T K . <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rein et al. (2010)</ref> also examined this system both numerically and analytically, and proposed that a relative migration timescale shorter than 800T K is needed to pass through the 2:1 resonance, which is consistent with our results. Our model also provides a lower limit of 200T K on the migration timescale. The planets in this system would have undergone type III migration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Other Systems</head><p>Here we apply our results to resonant systems in the solar system. One good example is the Galilean satellites around Jupiter, where Io-Europa and EuropaGanymede are in the 2:1 mean motion resonance. Replacing the stellar mass (M * ) with the Jupiter mass, our model gives a lower limit of 1 × 10 4 T K on the differential migration speed. This constraint is consistent with the result of N -body work on the formation of the Galilean satellites (Equation <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ogihara &amp; Ida 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Some trans-Neptunian objects are in mean motion resonance with Neptune. The population of objects in the 3:2 resonance is much higher than that in the 2:1 resonance. The objects were captured into the mean motion resonances during outward migration of Neptune. Simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ida et al. (2000)</ref> showed that the tendency could be explained by the migration speed of Neptune. We apply our formula for the inward migration of the outer objects to resonant capture by an outwardly migrating Neptune. The obtained migration timescale of 3-10 Myr is plausible for the high population of the 3:2 resonance, which is roughly consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ida et al. (2000)</ref>. Furthermore, this estimated migration timescale is also consistent with that obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Murray-Clay &amp; Chiang (2005)</ref> of 1-10 Myr, which is derived from studying the proportion of TNOs in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 resonance. Neptune's outward migration, which is caused by interaction with the surrounding planetesimals, and other planets may not be as smooth as we assume ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Levison et al. 2008</ref>). The application of our model to these objects should be done carefully.</p><p>We can further discuss other planet formation models, which assume the establishment of mean motion resonances. In the Grand Tack model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Walsh et al. 2011</ref>), Saturn migrates faster than Jupiter, which results in capture into a 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. For capture into the 3:2 resonance, the differential migration timescale between the two planets should be 100-500T K , which is smaller than the typical type I or II migration timescales. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Walsh et al. (2011)</ref> considered highspeed type III migration, which is necessary to realize the Grand Tack scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We investigated capture into first-order mean motion resonances in a system of two bodies undergoing damping of the eccentricity and semimajor axis using N -body integrations. In some of our calculations, we considered the case in which the mass of one body is negligible. In addition, we also studied systems with equal masses. In fact, orbital calculations were performed with a wide range of parameters; we found that the critical migration timescale can be described using the mass ratio between the larger body and the central object, and depends weakly on the e-damping timescale and initial eccentricity. The empirical formula is given by Equation (4), where the critical migration timescale for equalmass bodies is about an order of magnitude shorter than that for systems with a massless particle. We also confirmed the power-law dependence of the mass with index −4/3. This dependence is also supported by analytical arguments that compare the resonant libration timescale and the migration timescale. Additional simulations of closely spaced resonances were run, and empirical fits to the results were derived. All the fitting formulae from our calculations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The empirical formula we derived can constrain the relative migration speed in systems of two bodies undergoing convergent migration toward capture into mean motion resonances. This means that our model can be useful for understanding the origins of exoplanet systems in resonances. For systems in closely spaced mean motion resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11, Kepler-60)</ref>, the migration timescale can be well constrained. It is also possible that the planets formed in situ. The systems in which the orbital separation is smaller than 2 √ 3r H (e.g., HR 8799, Gliese 876) are believed to become stable owing to resonant effects. Lower limits to the relative migration timescale were placed on several systems in 2:1 resonances. The origin of the HD 200964 system, which is in 4:3 resonance, remains unclear. Our model also provides constraints on the migration timescale of systems other than exoplanets (e.g., the Grand Tack model of the solar system). Furthermore, when the number of discovered exoplanets in resonances increases sufficiently in the future, the typical type I and II migration timescales can be obtained using our results; future observations will allow us to tackle this issue. Note that if the eccentricity at a resonant encounter is large, the capture into resonance becomes probabilistic. In this case, our model can provide only a necessary condition.</p><p>In this work, we considered first-order mean motion resonances, which are certainly important for planets both inside and outside the solar system. In addition, higher-order mean motion resonances (e.g., 3:1 and 5:2) can also be important for specific systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Michtchenko &amp; Ferraz-Mello 2001;</ref>; therefore, it would be worth examining the conditions for capture into these resonances in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.-Capture probability versus migration timescale for (a) the fiducial model and (b) the model having relatively high initial eccentricities (e ini ≃ 0.01).
