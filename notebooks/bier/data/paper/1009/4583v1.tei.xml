				<p>The Gaia astrometric mission-the Hipparcos successor-is described in some detail, with its three instruments: the two (spectro)photometers (BP and RP) covering the range 330-1050 nm, the white light (G-band) imager dedicated to astrometry, and the radial velocity spectrometer (RVS) covering the range 847-874 nm at a resolution R≃11500. The whole sky will be scanned repeatedly providing data for ∼10 9 point-like objects, down to a magnitude of V≃20, aiming to the full 6D reconstruction of the Milky Way kinematical and dinamical structure with unprecendented precision. The horizon of scientific questions that can find an answer with such a set of data is vast, including besides the Galaxy: Solar system studies , stellar astrophysics, exoplanets, supernovae, Local group physics, unresolved galaxies, Quasars, and fundamental physics. The Italian involvement in the mission preparation is briefly outlined.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The Gaia mission</head><p>Gaia is a cornerstone mission of the ESA Space Program, presently scheduled for launch in 2012. The Gaia satellite will perform an allsky survey to obtain parallaxes and proper motions to µas precision for about 10 9 pointlike sources and astrophysical parameters (T eff , log g, E(B − V), metallicity etc.) for stars down to a limiting magnitude of V ≃ 20, plus 2-30 km/s accuracy (depending on spectral type), radial velocities for several millions of stars down to V &lt; 17.</p><p>Such an observational effort has been compared to the mapping of the human genome for</p><p>Send offprint requests to: P. Bonifacio the amount of collected data and for the impact that it will have on all branches of astronomy and astrophysics. The expected end-ofmission astrometric accuracies are almost 100 times better than the HIPPARCOS dataset (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Perryman et al. 1997</ref>). This exquisite precision will allow a full and detailed reconstruction of the 3D spatial structure and 3D velocity field of the Milky Way galaxy within ≃ 10 kpc from the Sun. This will provide answers to longstanding questions about the origin and evolution of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census of its stellar populations, to a detailed characterization of its substructures (as, for instance, tidal streams in the Halo, (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ibata &amp; Gibson 2007)</ref>, to the distribution of dark matter. The accurate 3D motion of more distant Galactic satellites (as distant globular clusters and the Magellanic Clouds) will be also obtained by averaging the proper motions of many thousands of member stars: this will provide an unprecedented leverage to constrain the mass distribution of the Galaxy and/or non-standard theories of gravitation. Gaia will determine direct geometric distances to essentially any kind of standard candle currently used for distance determination, setting the whole cosmological distance scale on extremely firm bases.</p><p>As challenging as it is, the processing and analysis of the huge data-flow incoming from Gaia is the subject of thorough study and preparatory work by the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), in charge of all aspects of the Gaia data reduction. The consortium comprises more than 400 scientists from 25 European institutes.</p><p>In the next Sections, I will describe in some detail the instrument and its capabilities, including a short review of its expected scientific output, its concept and instruments, the organization of data analysis and the Italian contribution to the mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Science goals and capabilities</head><p>For many years, the state of the art in celestial cartography has been the Schmidt surveys of Palomar and ESO, and their digitized counterparts. As will bee detailed in the following Sections, the expected precision of Gaia measurements is unprecedented, and the resulting scientific harvest will be of almost inconceivable extent and implication.</p><p>Gaia will provide detailed information on stellar evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. It will clarify the origin and formation history of our Galaxy. The data will enable to precisely identify relics of tidally-disrupted accretion debris, probe the distribution of dark matter, establish the luminosity function for pre-main sequence stars, detect and categorize rapid evolutionary stellar phases, place unprecedented constraints on the age, internal structure and evolution of all stellar types, establish a rigorous distance scale framework throughout the Galaxy and beyond, and classify star formation and kinematical and dynamical behaviour within the Local Group of galaxies.</p><p>Gaia will pinpoint exotic objects in colossal and almost unimaginable numbers: many thousands of extra-solar planets will be discovered (from both their astrometric wobble and photometric transits) and their detailed orbits and masses determined; tens of thousands of brown dwarfs and white dwarfs will be identified; tens of thousands of extragalactic supernovae will be discovered; Solar System studies will receive a massive impetus through the observation of hundreds of thousands of minor planets; near-Earth objects, inner Trojans and even new trans-Neptunian objects, including Plutinos, may be discovered.</p><p>Gaia will follow the bending of star light by the Sun and major planets over the entire celestial sphere, and therefore directly observe the structure of space-time -the accuracy of its measurement of General Relativistic light bending may reveal the long-sought scalar correction to its tensor form. The PPN parameters γ and β, and the solar quadrupole moment J2, will be determined with unprecedented precision. All this, and more, through the accurate measurement of star positions.</p><p>We summarize some of the most interesting object classes that will be observed by Gaia, with estimates of the expected total number of objects, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>For more information on the Gaia mission: http://www.rssd.esa.int/Gaia. More information for the public on Gaia and its science capabilities are contained in the Gaia information sheets <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . An excellent review of the science possibilities opened by Gaia can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Perryman et al. (1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Launch, timeline and data releases</head><p>The first idea for Gaia began circulating in the early 1990, culminating in a proposal for a cornerstone mission within ESA's science programme submitted in 1993, and a workshop in Cambridge in June 1995. By the time the final catalogue will be released approximately in 2020, almost two decades of work will have elapsed between the orginal concept and mission completion.</p><p>Gaia will be launched by a Soyuz carrier (rather than the initially foreseen Ariane 5) in 2012 from French Guyana and will start operating once it will reach its Lissajus orbit around L2 (the unstable Langrange point of the Sun and Eart-Moon system), in about one month. Two ground stations will receive the compressed Gaia data during the 5 years 2 of operation: Cebreros (Spain) and Perth (Australia). The data will then be transmitted to the main data centers throughout Europe to allow for data processing. We are presently in technical development phase C/D, and the hardware is being built, tested and assembled. Software development started in 2006 and is presently producing and testing pipelines with the aim of delivering to the astrophysical community a full catalogue and dataset ready for scientific investigation (see Section 2).</p><p>Apart from the end-of-mission data release, foreseen around 2020, some intermediate data releases are foreseen. In particular, there should be one first intermediate release covering either the first 6 months or the first year of operation, followed by a second and possibly a third intermediate release, that are presently being discussed. The data analysis will proceed in parallel with observations, the major pipelines re-processing all the data every 6 months, with secondary cycle pipelinesdedicated to specific tasks -operating on different timescales. In particular, verified science alerts, based on unexpected variability in flux and/or radial velocity, are expected to be released within 24 hours from detection, after an initial period of testing and fine-tuning of the detection algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Mission concepts</head><p>During its 5-year operational lifetime, the satellite will continuously spin around its axis, with a constant speed of 60 arcsec/sec. As a result, over a period of 6 hours, the two astrometric fields of view will scan across all objects located along the great circle perpendicular to the spin axis. As a result of the basic angle of 106.5 o separating the astrometric fields of view on the sky, objects transit the second field of view with a delay of 106.5 minutes compared to the first field. Gaia's spin axis does not point to a fixed direction in space, but is carefully controlled so as to precess slowly on the sky. As a result, the great circle that is mapped by the two fields of view every 6 hours changes slowly with time, allowing reapeated full sky coverage over the mission life- The above scanning strategy, referred to as "revolving scanning", was successfully adopted during the Hipparcos mission. Every sky region will be scanned on average 70-80 times, with regions lying at ±45 o from the Ecliptic Poles being scanned on average more often than other locations. Each of the Gaia targets will be therefore scanned (within differently inclined great circles) from a minimum of approximately 10 times to a maximum of 250 times <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Only pointlike sources will be observed, and in some regions of the sky, like the Baade's window, ω Centauri or other globular clusters, the star density of the two combined fields of view will be of the order of 750 000 or more per square degree, exceeding the storage capability of the onboard processors, so Gaia will not study in detail these dense areas. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the focal plane of Gaia, with its 105 CCDs, which are read in TDI (Time Delayed Integration) mode. Objects enter the focal plane from the left and cross one CCD in 4 seconds. Apart from some technical CCDs that are of little interest in this context, the first two CCD columns, the Sky Mappers (SM), perform the on-board detection of point-like sources, each of the two columns being able to see only one of the two lines of sight. After the objects are identified and selected, small windows are assigned, which follow them in the astrometric field (AF) CCDs where white light (or G-band) images are obtained (Section 1.5). Immediately following the AF, two additional columns of CCDs gather light from two slitless prism spectrographs, the blue spectrophotometer (BP) and the red one (RP), which produce dispersed images (Section 1.6). Finally, objects transit on the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) CCDs to produce higher resolution spectra around the Calcium Triplet (CaT) region (Section 1.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Focal plane</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Astrometry</head><p>The AF CCDs will provide G-band images, i.e., white light images where the passband is defined by the telescope optics transmission and the CCDs sensitivity, with a very broad combined passband ranging from 330 to 1050 nm and peaking around 500-600 nm <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). The objective of Gaia's astrometric data reduction system is the construction <ref type="figure">Fig. 3.</ref> The passbands of the G-band, BP and RP. c ESA of core mission products: the five standard astrometric parameters, position (α, δ), parallax (̟), and proper motion (µ α , µ δ ) for all observed stellar objects. The expected end-ofmission precision in the proper motions is expected to be better than 10 µas for G&lt;10 stars, 25 µas for G=15, and 300 µas for G=20. For parallaxes, considering a G=12 star, we can expect to have distances at better than 0.1% within 250 pc, 1% within 2700 pc, and 10% within 10 kpc.</p><p>To reach these end-of-mission precisions, the average 70-80 observations per target gathered during the 5-year mission duration will have to be combined into a single, global, and self-consistent manner. 40 Gb of telemetry data will first pass through the Initial Data Treatment (IDT) which determines the image parameters and centroids, and then performes an object cross-matching. The output forms the so-called One Day Astrometric Solution (ODAS), together with the satellite attitude and calibration, to the sub-milliarcsecond accuracy. The data are then written to the Main Database.</p><p>The next step is the Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) processing. AGIS processes together the attitude and calibration parameters with the source parameters, refining them in an iterative procedure that stops when the adjustments become sufficiently small. As soon as new data come in, on the basis of 6 months cycles, all the data in hand are reprocessed toghether from scratch. This is the only scheme that allows for the quoted precisions, and it is also the philosophy that justifies Gaia as a self-calibrationg mission. The primary AGIS cycle will treat only stars that are flagged as single and nonvariable (expected to be around 500 millions), while other kinds of objects will be computed in secondary AGIS cycles that utilize the main AGIS sulution. Dedicated pipelines for specific kinds of objects (asteroids, slightly extended objects, variable objects and so on) are being put in place to extract the best possible precision. Owing to the large data volume (100 Tb) that Gaia will produce, and to the iterative nature of the processing, the computing challenges are formidable: AGIS processing alone requires some 10 21 FLOPs which translates to runtimes of months on the ESAC computers in Madrid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6.">Spectrophotometry</head><p>The primary aim of the photometric instrument is mission critical in two respects: (i) to correct the measured centroids position in the AF for systematic chromatic effects, and (ii) to classify and determine astrophysical characteristics of all objects, such as temperature, gravity, mass, age and chemical composition (in the case of stars).</p><p>The BP and RP spectrophotometers are based on a dispersive-prism approach such that the incoming light is not focussed in a PSFlike spot, but dispersed along the scan direction in a low-resolution spectrum. The BP operates between 330-680 nm while the RP between 640-1000 nm <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. Both prisms have appropriate broad-band filters to block unwanted light. The two dedicated CCD stripes cover the full height of the AF and, therefore, all objects that are imaged in the AF are also imaged in the BP and RP.</p><p>The resolution is a function of wavelength, ranging from 4 to 32 nm/pix for BP and 7 to 15 nm/pix for RP. The spectral resolution, R=λ/δλ ranges from 20 to 100 approximately. The dispersers have been designed in such a way that BP and RP spectra are of similar sizes (45 pixels). Window extensions meant to measure the sky background are implemented. <ref type="figure">To Fig. 4</ref>. A simulated RP dispersed image, with a red rectangle marking the window assigned for compression and ground telemetry. c ESA compress the amount of data transmitted to the ground, all the BP and RP spectra -except for the brightest stars -are binned on chip in the across-scan direction, and are transmitted to the ground as one-dimensional spectra. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a simulated RP spectrum, unbinned, before windowing, compression, and telemetry. The final data products will be the end-ofmission (or intermediate releases) of global, combined BP and RP spectra and integrated magnitudes M BP and M RP . Epoch spectra will be released only for specific classes of objects, such as variable stars and quasars, for example. The internal flux calibration of integrated magnitudes, including the M G magnitudes as well, is expected at a precision of 0.003 mag for G=13 stars, and for G=20 stars goes down to 0.07 mag in M G , 0.3 mag in M BP and M RP . The external calibration should be performed with a precision of the order of a few percent (with respect to Vega).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7.">High-resolution spectroscopy</head><p>The primary objective of the RVS is the acquisition of radial velocities, which combined with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes will provide the means to decipher the kinematical state and dynamical history of our Galaxy. The RVS will provide the radial velocities of about 100-150 million stars up to 17-th magnitude with precisions ranging from 15 km s −1 at the faint end, to 1 km s −1 or better at the bright end. The spectral resolution, R=λ/δλ will be 11 500. Radial velocities will be obtained by cross-correlating observed spectra with either a template or a mask. An initial estimate of the source atmospheric parameters will be used to select the most appropriate template or mask. On average, 40 transits will be collected for each object during the 5-year lifetime of Gaia, since the RVS does not cover the whole width of the Gaia AF <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). In total, we expect to obtain some 5 billion spectra (single transit) for the brightest stars. The analysis of this huge dataset will be complicated, not only because of the sheer data volume, but also because the spectroscopic data analysis relies on the multi-epoch astrometric and photometric data.</p><p>The covered wavelength range (847-874 nm, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>) is a rich domain, centered on the infrared calcium triplet: it will not only provide radial velocities, but also many stellar and interstellar diagnostics. It has been selected to coincide with the energy distribution peaks of G and K type stars, which are the most abundant targets. In early type stars, RVS spectra may contain also weak Helium lines and N, although they will be dominated by the Paschen lines. The RVS data will effectively complement the astrometric and photometric observations, improving object classification. For stellar objects, it will provide atmospheric parame-ters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and individual abundances of key elements such as Fe, Ca, Mg, Si for millions of stars down to G≃12. Also, Diffuse Intertellar Bands (DIB) around 862 nm will enable the derivation of a 3D map of interstellar reddening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The DPAC</head><p>ESA will take care of the satellite design, build and testing phases, of launch and operation, and of the data telemetry to the ground, managing the ESAC datacenter in Madrid, Spain. The data treatment and analysis is instead responsibility of the European scientific community. In 2006, the announcement of opportunity opened by ESA was successfully answered by the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), a consortium that is presently counting more than 400 scientists in Europe (and outside) and more than 25 scientific institutions.</p><p>The DPAC governing body, or executive (DPACE) oversees the DPAC activities and the work has been organized among a few Coordination Units (CU) in charge of different aspects of data treatment:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">-CU1.

A coordination group (P.I. M. Lattanzi) manages the funding and activities, and contains representatives of the main Italian institutes involved in DPAC activities. In total, approximately 60 Italian scientists work in the DPAC for a total of 36 FTE, who are involved in almost all of the CUs activities outlined in the previous Section.</p><p>To summarize the main contributions, we firstly mention the most numerous group, involved in CU3 and also CU2 activities (INAF-OATO, University of Torino, Politecnico of Torino, University of Padova), dealing mainly with astrometry and fundamental physics. There is also a large group involved in CU5 (INAF-OABO, University of Bologna, INAF-ROMA, INAF-OATE, University of Roma, INAF-OAPD) that is responsible for all aspects of the external flux calibration of Gaia photometry and for other aspects of photometric processing such as crowding issues and image reconstruction. Finally Italian scientists are also involved in CU7 (INAF-OACT, INAF-OABO, INAF-OANA) working on algorithms for the classification and parametrization of particular kinds of variable objects (mainly stellar pulsators), and in CU8 (INAF-OAPD, University of Padova, INAF-OANA, INAF-OACT) dealing mainly with spectral libraries for the classification and parametrization of stellar sources. Apart from these four main groups, there are also smaller groups or individuals that are DPAC active members on other topics.</p><p>All in all, Italy is one of the major DPAC contributors, both in terms of funding and in terms of FTE and responsibilities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
