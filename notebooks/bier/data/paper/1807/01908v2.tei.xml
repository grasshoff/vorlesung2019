			<abstract>
				<p>We report the development of a 4-color simultaneous camera for the 1.52 m Telescopio Carlos Sánchez (TCS) in the Teide Observatory, Canaries, Spain. The new instrument, named MuSCAT2, has a capability of 4-color simultaneous imaging in g (400-550 nm), r (550-700 nm), i (700-820 nm), and z s (820-920 nm) bands. MuSCAT2 equips four 1024×1024 pixel CCDs, having a field of view of 7.4×7.4 arcmin 2 with a pixel scale of 0.44 arcsec per pixel. The principal purpose of MuSCAT2 is to perform high-precision multi-color exoplanet transit photometry. We have demonstrated photometric precisions of 0.057%, 0.050%, 0.060%, and 0.076% as root-mean-square residuals of 60 s binning in g, r, i and z s bands, respectively, for a G0 V star WASP-12 (V = 11.57 ± 0.16). MuSCAT2 has started science operations since January 2018, with over 250 telescope nights per year. MuSCAT2 is expected to become a reference tool for exoplanet transit observations, and will substantially contribute to the follow-up of the TESS and PLATO space missions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Transiting planets, periodically passing in front of their host stars, are valuable targets for exoplanet studies, since one can investigate the true mass, radius, density, orbital obliquity, and atmosphere of such planets. The number of discovered transiting planets are drastically increasing in recent years thanks to intense transit surveys from the ground 1-6 and space <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . Moreover, the NASA's new mission TESS 10 has started operations in 2018, and the future ESA mission PLATO 11 is planned to be launched around 2026. Those missions will especially focus on relatively bright nearby planet host stars. Hence it is expected that hundreds or thousands of new transiting planets, suitable for further characterizations, will be discovered in the vicinity of our Solar system in the near future.</p><p>On the other hand, discovered candidates of transiting planets are not always bona fide planets. This is because eclipsing binaries may mimic transit-like signals in photometric survey data. False positive rates are especially worse for ground-based surveys (e.g., more than 98% for the recent KELT survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ), and still not negligible even for a space-based survey like Kepler <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . This is also true for the upcoming TESS mission, and the false positive rate is predicted as 30-70% 14 depending on the galactic latitude. Thus one needs to distinguish and exclude false positives caused by eclipsing binaries to validate the true planetary nature by additional follow-up observations.</p><p>To validate the bona fide planetary nature of each candidate, we have focused on the capabilities of multi-color transit photometry. Dimming caused by a true planet should be fairly achromatic, while that caused by an eclipsing binary would change significantly with wavelength. We previously developed a multi-color simultaneous camera named MuSCAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> for the 1.88m telescope of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan located in Okayama, Japan, which is capable of 3-color simultaneous imaging in g (400-550 nm), r (550-700 nm), and z s (820-920 nm) bands. MuSCAT has demonstrated high photometric precisions of less than 0.05% as root-mean-square (rms) residuals of 60 s binning for a 10th magnitude star HAT-P-14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , and have successfully validated several transiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . In the upcoming TESS era, high-precision multi-color transit photometry become more important due to the large number of potential candidates of transiting planets. To efficiently validate true transiting planets, it is desired to deploy multiple multi-color simultaneous cameras on 1-2 m class telescopes around the world. We thus decided to develop the second multi-color simultaneous camera for the 1.52 m Telescopio Carlos Sánchez (TCS) in the Teide Observatory, Canaries, Spain, which is located at the longitude difference of about 150 deg from the Okayama observatory.</p><p>In addition to the importance for validating true planets, ground-based instruments for high precision transit photometry will become more important in the TESS era due to the following reasons: First, since the pixel scale of TESS is 21 arcsec <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and a typical aperture size is over 1 arcmin, there is a high possibility of blending nearby stars in the same aperture with targets. For this reason, additional transit observations are necessary to identify which star is indeed dimming and to derive precise radii of discovered transiting planets. Second, the monitoring duration of TESS for each sector is only about 27 days, which is significantly shorter than the Kepler (over 4 years) or K2 (about 80 days) missions. Thus, it is very important to observe additional transits after the TESS observations to improve the transit ephemerides of targets. This is especially important for selecting potential JWST targets, as observing times of such space telescopes are quite valuable <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Third, for multi-transiting planetary systems in mean motion resonance (MMR) like TRAPPIST-1 5 or K2-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , high precision transit observations can determine the masses of the planets via transit timing variations (TTVs). TTVs would become a good alternative method to measure the masses of transiting planets in MMR in the TESS era. Finally, optical transit depths of a true planet surrounded by hydrogen dominated atmosphere have a weak wavelength dependence caused by the nature of the planetary atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . High precision multi-color transit photometry is useful to probe such weak wavelength dependence and efficiently select good targets for further follow-up with larger ground-based or space-based telescopes.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first describe the TCS 1.52 m telescope in the Teide Observatory (Sec. 2). We then detail designs of the optical system of MuSCAT2 and characteristics of its components (Sec. 3). We report the performance of MuSCAT2 based on commissioning observations (Sec. 4). We finally summarize this paper (Sec. 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Carlos Sánchez Telescope (TCS)</head><p>The Carlos Sánchez telescope (Latitude: 28 • 18' 01.8" N, Longitude: 16 • 30' 39.2" W) is located at the Teide Observatory (OT), at 2386.75 m over sea level. The OT is one of the best astronomical observing sites in the world with a typical weather success rate of about 80% and a typical seeing size of about 0.8 arcsec. TCS has a primary mirror with a diameter of 1.52 meters (60"). Originally build by ICSTM in collaboration with other groups from the UK and IAC, it was commissioned in 1971 and started operations in 1972. It was originally designed as a low cost flux collector for infrared astronomy and it was one of the earliest telescopes with a thin mirror. For many years, it was one of the largest telescopes in the world mainly settled for infrared astronomy. In 1983 telescope ownership was transferred to the IAC and major improvements in order to keep the telescope in a competitive status were performed, including automating control and data acquisition, development of instrumentation for common use and improving the pointing precision and tracking.</p><p>The TCS main mirror is fixed in an equatorial structure with a Cassegrain focus and focal length of f/13.8 in a Dall-Kirkham type configuration. Its common user-instrumentation includes two other instruments: CAIN and FastCam. More technical details on the TCS and current instruments can be found at: http://www.iac.es/OOCC/instrumentation/telescopio-carlos-sanchez/ 3 The MuSCAT2 Instrument</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Instrumental Optical Design</head><p>The optical layout of MuSCAT2 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. MuSCAT2 is installed at the Cassegrain focus of the TCS as pictured in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The optical system of MuSCAT2 is composed of F-conversion lenses (Lens-1 and Lens-2) to widen the field-of-view (FoV) and dichroic mirrors (DMs) to separate light into 4 wavelength bands. The F-conversion lenses are placed before and after the DMs, and play roles to make F-number faster (focal image brighter) and to correct offaxis coma aberration characteristic of a Dall-Kirkham type telescope. The Lens-1 roughly correct off-axis coma aberration of all bands, and convert F-number from f/13.8 to f/8. The Lens-2, which are not identical but optimized for each band, further correct coma aberration of each band, and convert F-number from f/8 to f/4.2. All the lenses are applied anti-reflection (AR) coating of less than 1% reflectance ratio. A secondary mirror position is about 34 mm closer from the nominal position to obtain focused images on the detectors of MuSCAT2.</p><p>Simulated spot diagrams on CCD cameras of MuSCAT2 are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> plots spot diagrams for on-focus cases. The figure indicates spot radius of all wavelength bands are well smaller than 0.5 arcsec throughout the FoV. This means the imaging performance of MuSCAT2 is sufficiently good compared to the typical seeing (0.8 arcsec) of the Teide observatory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> does for defocused cases where the secondary mirror is shifted by 5 mm from the focused position, which makes the spot radius expand to 5-6 arcsec. The figure implies that images are nearly circular throughout the FoV and suitable for aperture photometry. . The left side shows ray trace for the whole telescope and instrument system. The right side is an enlarged view of ray trace for MuSCAT2. Incident light is separated into 4 channels by 3 dichroic mirrors (DMs). F-conversion lenses are placed before (Lens-1) and after (Lens-2) the DMs. Plane mirrors (PMs) are inserted in the channels 1-3 to fold optical path. Bandpass filters (BFs) are inserted just before the CCD cameras. Instrument sizes are described in mm.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dichroic Mirrors</head><p>Three dichroic mirrors (DMs) to separate incoming light into 4 wavelength channels are manufactured by Asahi Spectra Co.,Ltd. The sizes and wedge angles of the DMs are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The reflectance of the DMs is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> and the DMs transmit remaining lights almost completely due to anti-reflection coating processed on the back sides of the DMs. All the DMs are inserted with an incident angle of 30 deg. Plain mirrors are placed after DMs for ch. 1, 2, and 3 to optimize mechanical structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Bandpass Filters</head><p>Following the experience on MuSCAT, we adopt commercially-available g , r , and z s band filters of Astrodon Photometrics Generation 2 Sloan filters for ch. 1, 2, and 4, respectively. The three filters are the same with those for MuSCAT on Okayama 1.88m telescope. On the other hand, since the i band filter of Astrodon Photometrics Generation 2 Sloan filters has an unavoidable overlap of transparent wavelength with the r and z s band filters, we adopt a custom-ordered i band filter manufactured by Asahi Spectra Co.,Ltd. For simplicity, hereafter we call those channels as g, r, i, and z s bands, respectively. We note that the reflectance and transmittance of the DMs are optimized for those 4 bandpass filters. The size of those filters are 50 mm by 50 mm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> plots the measured transmittance of the bandpass filters.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">CCD Cameras</head><p>MuSCAT2 equips 4 CCD cameras manufactured by Princeton Instruments: one is PIXIS: 1024B used for the ch 2 (r band) and the others are PIXIS: 1024B eXcelon used for the other 3 channels (g, i, and z s bands). Each PIXIS camera equips an e2v 47-10 AIMO (Advanced Inverted Mode Operation) science grade 1 CCD. The cosmetic quality of the CCD is very high. The CCD specification declares there are less than 200 bad pixels among 10 6 pixels and there is no column defect. Basic specifications (e.g., size, weight, etc) of those CCD cameras are identical with MuSCAT on the Okayama 188cm telescope ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> of the paper for MuSCAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ). Individual characteristics such as values of dark current and readout noise are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, measured by the manufacturer as inspection verification. Total transmittance of the MuSCAT2 instrument, including all the optics and the quantum efficiency of the detectors, is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. Each CCD camera is independently controllable from an instrument operating PC so that observers can set either individually-different exposure times or synchronized ones, depending on science cases. Typical time interval between two exposures due to readout and fits file creation is 1-4 s. Engineering test results for (non-)linearity and saturation level of the individual CCDs are shown in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Instrument Rotator</head><p>As the TCS is not equipped with an instrument rotator at the Cassegrain focus, we installed a custom-made instrument rotator between the telescope flange and MuSCAT2. The reason why the instrument rotator is attached is that it is important to obtain good comparison stars in the field of view to enable high precision transit photometry. The presence of the instrument rotator makes it possible to obtain a potential comparison star located at 1.4 times farther than the length of the side of the field of view. The rotator was designed and manufactured by a limited company, CHUO-OPT, Japan. The rotator is controllable through a serial cable from a Linux-based PC that is attached to MuSCAT2 (the PC also controls the CCD cameras). While the angular resolution of the rotator is 0.89", the absolute accuracy of pointing a certain position angle is about 0.1 degrees, which is limited by the inaccuracy of re-mounting of the rotator to the telescope (together with MuSCAT2 to exchange instruments) and that of determining origin using a photomicro sensor. The range of the angle that the rotator can mechanically rotate is ±90 degrees, however, it is currently operated in the range of ±45 degrees for safety reason. Although the gear train has basically no backlash, it can move a little bit depending on the telescope position due to mechanical flexure, which alters the position of stars on the detectors by up to ∼1".  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g 81% a 70% b 70% b 80% 32% 26% r 89% a 70% b 70% b 81% 35% 33% i 92% a 70% b 70% b 77% 35% 22% z s 95% a 70% b 70% b 51% 24% 15% M1 =</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Field of View</head><p>We have derived pixel scales and corresponding field of view (FoV) of MuSCAT2 based on images of NGC6885 using TOPCAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and ccmap in IRAF. The derived pixel scales and FoV are 0.44 arcsec per pixel and 7.4×7.4 arcmin 2 for all the bands. Thanks to the presence of the instrument rotator, it is possible to obtain a potential comparison star located at about 10 arcmin away from a target star. We have confirmed that centers of FoV of 4 CCD cameras are adjusted within 10 pixels in both x and y directions, and relative rotations of the position angle fit within 1 deg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Sensitivity and Efficiency</head><p>We have estimated zero point magnitudes of MuSCAT2 using the images of M67 as follows. For each band, 300 frames with 2 s exposure were obtained, but 7 frames were discarded because they had split PSF due to large guiding feedback during exposure. Remaining 293 frames were bias-subtracted, flat-fielded, position-aligned, and combined into a master image in each band. We then employed SExtractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , ccmap in IRAF, and TOPCAT 26 to identify stars in the master images and to match them with the SDSS DR7 catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . As a result, we matched about 80 stars in each band. We measured fluxes of the stars and sky background in each band from the master image, and multiplied by 300/293 to make them correspond to 600 s exposure. The fluxes of the stars and sky background were then converted into magnitudes. The magnitudes of sky background were g = 20.4 mag arcsec −2 , r = 19.8 mag arcsec −2 , i = 19.0 mag arcsec −2 , and z = 18.2 mag arcsec −2 , respectively. We fitted relations between MuSCAT2 instrumental magnitudes and the SDSS catalog magnitudes of the stars in each band by a linear function, and derived zero point magnitudes (corresponding to 1 ADU per 600 s) of MuSCAT2 as g = 31.56 mag, r = 31.52 mag, i = 30.58 mag, and z = 29.83 mag, respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>). We note that we neglect color terms and simply approximate that the g, r, i, and z s bands of MuSCAT2 are identical to the SDSS g , r , i , and z bands.</p><p>We then calculated ratios of the stellar noise (n stellar ), the sky noise (n sky ), the readout noise  (n read ) to the signal using the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n stellar /signal = (10 −0.4(m−Z) ) 0.5 / (10 −0.4(m−Z) ),<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">n read /signal = n (A N exp ) 0.5 / (10 −0.4(m−Z) ),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">n sky /signal = (A 10 −0.4(sky−Z) ) 0.5 / (10 −0.4(m−Z) ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where m is the MuSCAT2 instrumental magnitude, Z is the zero point magnitude, n is the readout noise in ADU per pixel (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>), A is the area of the aperture (a circle with the radius of 1.7 times of FWHM), N exp is the number of exposures, and sky is the sky background magnitudes. We compute square sum of those noises (total noises), and plot them in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>. We derive limiting magnitudes of MuSCAT2 giving the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10 with 10-min exposure as g lim = 20.5 mag, r lim = 20.5 mag, i lim = 19.7 mag, and z lim = 19.0 mag. Finally, we estimate total throughput (TP) of the TCS 1.52m telescope and MuSCAT2 by comparing measured fluxes coming from stars with expected fluxes from known magnitudes. The measured total throughput values are 26%, 33%, 22%, and 15%, respectively for in g, r, i, and z s bands. We also estimate expected total throughput as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, considering transmittance of sky, reflectivity of the primary and secondary mirrors, transmittance and reflectivity of MuS-CAT2 optics (including lens, mirror, DMs, filters), and quantum efficiency (QE) of detectors with broadband antireflection (BBAR) coating on the camera window. To calculate the sky transmittance, we employ the libRadtran software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> to model the telluric atmosphere with aerosol at the elevation of 2390 m. Since the aerosol model is not definitive but has large uncertainty, the expected TP has uncertainties of several percent. We also note that we neglect the effect of spiders, which would cause additional a few percent loss of light. Consequently, we found that the TP in g and r bands are roughly in agreement with the expected ones, but that in i band is a bit lower and that in z s band is significantly worse than expected. Although an exact reason is uncertain, we suspect that this is due to degradation of reflectivity of the primary and secondary mirrors due to micron-sized dusts on surfaces of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">CCD Non-linearity</head><p>We have examined the linearity and saturation level of the individual CCDs by taking dome flat images with various exposure times. The illumination source of the dome flat is composed of two types of lamps, one is fluorescent lamp and the other is voltage-controllable filament lamp, both distributed on the wall. Because the illuminance of these lamps is not stable but time variable, we have taken the following procedure to mitigate this effect. First, for each CCD, we adjusted the voltage of the filament lamps so that the average count of a flat image with the exposure time of 10 s became about 30,000 ADU. Second, we obtained a set of dome-flat images with a range of exposure times from 1 s through 23 s, with which most of the pixels are saturated, being incremented by 1 s. In addition to those "experimental" data, we also took "reference" images with the exposure time of 10 s in between two consecutive experimental exposures. We repeated this set of exposures three times for each CCD.</p><p>After subtracting a dark image from all of the exposed images, we have calculated average counts on the individual exposed images. Then, for each experimental image we have estimated the expected count by multiplying the average count of the adjacent reference images by t exp /10, where t exp is the exposure time of an experimental image in seconds. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we show the ratio of the measured average count to the expected one calculated for the experimental images as a function of the measured count for the respective CCDs. In all plots, the measured-to-expected ratio is distributed around unity up to 62,000-64,000 ADU, above which the value drops due to saturation. Below the saturation level, the measured-to-expected ratio gradually decreases with the measured count. We fit the data below 62,000 ADU with a linear function, which gives the following relations: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = −0.00085x + 1.00283 (ch.1),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where x and y are the measured count ×10 −4 (ADU) and the measured-to-expected ratio, respectively. The best-fit models are plotted by an orange solid line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. These results indicate that the non-linearity of all the CCDs are well below 1% up to ∼62,000 ADU. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mann et al. (2011)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , the effect of CCD non-linearity on photometric precision can be written as, rms</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∼ √ 2ασ 2 / √ N ,</formula><p>where α is the level of non-linearity in the pertinent ADU range, σ is the standard deviation of normalized incident flux, and N is the number of pixels in an aperture of interest. In our observation, N is typically 300-1000. If we assume =0.01 (the non-linearity level of 1%) and a conservative atmospheric condition of =0.3 (incident flux varies by 30% rms), the photometric noise arising from the CCD non-linearity is less than 0.008%. Therefore, the CCD non-linearity up to 62,000 ADU is basically negligible for transit photometry with MuSCAT2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Self Auto-guiding and Correction of Periodic Tracking Error</head><p>Tracking accuracy of the TCS is not very good such that telescope pointing drifts up to ∼1' per hour without any guiding (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). Auto guiding is thus essential both to keep the target and comparison stars within the same field of view for a whole night and to fix the stellar positions within several pixels to minimize systematic errors in photometry arising from inter-pixel sensitivity variations.</p><p>Since MuSCAT2 itself has neither on-axis nor off-axis guiding camera, we adopt a self autoguiding system, that is, science images taken by the instrument itself are used for guiding. We implement a self auto-guiding software, the original version of which was developed for MuS-CAT at Okayama 15 . The software calculates the stellar positional shifts between the latest science image and a reference image in one of the four channels immediately, and soon feeds it back to the telescope to correct the telescope position. Note that in the original software the stellar positional shifts are calculated using the centroids of several bright stars, whereas this time we have introduced a different algorithm in which one-dimensional cross correlations in both X and Y directions are calculated between the two images, and the shifts are calculated so as to minimize the cross correlations. This new algorithm is more robust in the events of cloud passing and for stellar crowded fields. The algorithm works for both on-focus and defocused observations. The time lag between the observation of the latest image and the time that the correction signal is sent to the telescope is ∼3-6 + 0.5 × T exp s, where T exp is the exposure time of the current image. To avoid over correction, the guiding frequency is usually set at once in 30-60 s. The channel to be used for guiding is user-selectable, but usually r-or i-band channel is selected to minimize the  effect of differential atmospheric refraction, which causes a gradual positional shift of stars on a different-band channel depending on the airmass. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows a sample of time variations of stellar position with (middle panel) and without (top panel) the self auto-guiding software. With guiding, long-term trends of positional shifts are significantly suppressed. On the other hand, stellar positions also exhibit a periodic variation in the RA direction with the period of ∼169 s and the semi-amplitude of ∼3-6 pixels (depending on declination), which cannot be corrected by the self auto-guiding function because of its high frequency. Even with this periodic drift, the systematic noises in photometry arising from the interpixel sensitivity variations can well be suppressed by applying Gaussian Process (see Section 4.5). However, this periodic motion also makes a stellar PSF significantly elongated when the exposure time is longer than ∼5 s, which makes it difficult to observe faint objects or crowded fields with a long exposure time.</p><p>The cause of this periodic error could be attributed to inhomogeneity of gears in the gear train that drives the RA axis of TCS. Tracking a sidereal object with TCS is achieved by driving a motor for the RA axis, attached to the end of the gear train, at a constant period that corresponds to the sidereal motion. Therefore, any inhomogeneity in one or more of the gears result in periodic acceleration and deceleration in the telescope motion.</p><p>The ultimate solution for this problem would be to renovate the telescope control system by attaching a high-resolution encoder directly to the RA axis and by controlling the motor speed by referring to the encoder value. However, it would be very costly and time-consuming. Alternatively, as a tentative solution, we have added a new function to the telescope control system that can sinusoidally accelerate and decelerate the motor speed so as to cancel out the tracking error. In this function, a new velocity of the telescope V new , which is the velocity that is intended to be driven by the motor on the assumption that the gear train has no error, is given by the following formulae:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">V new = V sidereal + δV, (8) δV = A sin(Bx + C) + D,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where V sidereal is the sidereal speed (15" s −1 ), x is hour angle of a tracking object, and A, B, C, and D are coefficients.</p><p>To decide how to determine the values of coefficients, we have investigated the behavior of the periodic error and found that (1) the period is almost constant (∼169 s) over all telescope position, (2) the period and/or the phase are slightly variable depending on hour angle, and (3) the amplitude does not depend on hour angle but on declination. Due to the complexity of the features (2) and (3), it is difficult to predict the values of coefficients beforehand with sufficient precisions. Instead, we have decided to determine or refine the coefficients during observations. Specifically, in each observation, for the first 5 minutes the target is observed without correcting the periodic error (but with the self guiding function activated) to gather the data of periodicity. Subsequently, the initial values of A, C, and D are determined by fitting the stellar positional data in the RA direction gathered in the initial phase, while B is fixed at a typical value. After applying the periodic correction to the telescope tracking, the values of B, C, and D are re-evaluated every 6 minutes by using the positional data of the last 6 minutes, where the value of A is fixed at the initial value.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows a sample of stellar positional data with the periodic correction applied. In this figure, the initial learning phase started at the time of zero, and the periodic correction function was applied 5 minutes later. Note that the self auto-guiding function was also activated during this observation. As can be seen, the dispersion of stellar position in the RA direction was gradually suppressed after the periodic correction was applied, which finally stabilized at the level of ∼1.8 pixels in rms. To test achievable photometric precision, we observed a full-transit of WASP-12b on January 25, 2018. WASP-12 is a G0 dwarf with V = 11.57 ± 0.16 mag based on the Tycho-2 catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . WASP-12 was observed from 20:46 of January 25 to 02:43 of January 26 in UT (airmass: 1.2-1.0-1.4). Exposure times and numbers of exposures for each band are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Stellar images were defocused to avoid saturation of a brighter comparison star. We note that because the software of correcting periodic tracking error was under development at the time of this observation, only the self auto-guiding software was activated to correct tracking error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Demonstration of High Precision Transit Photometry</head><p>The photometry is calculated using a Python-based photometry pipeline specially developed for MuSCAT2. The pipeline first computes the astrometric solution for each image frame using an offline version of astrometry.net 32 , and then calculates the photometry (carrying out the basic data reductions, such as flat field division and bias subtraction) for the target and comparison stars for a set of aperture size. The pipeline also calculates the usual set of covariates, such as star centroids, background sky level, airmass, etc. for each image frame to be used later in detrending. The pipeline is optimised for defocused photometry, and calculates aperture entropy as a proxy to the PSF FWHM, which can be used in the detrending instead of the FWHM. The aperture entropy is calculated as, E = − i F i log F i , where F are the fluxes inside the photometry aperture normalized by the total aperture flux (that is, we calculate the entropy of the flux distribution). We also derive the effective FWHMs by calculating a table of aperture entropies for a set of Gaussian PSFs with varying FWHM values for all the aperture size, and use the table to map the entropies to FWHMs.</p><p>The light curves are detrended and modelled in two steps. First, a set of optimal apertures are chosen to minimize the relative light curve point-to-point scatter, and a transit model computed using PyTransit <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> is fitted together with a linear baseline model with the centroid x-and y-shifts (dx and dy), sky level, airmass, and aperture entropy as covariates. The fitting is carried out using the light curves for the four filters jointly to minimize the sensitivity to systematics not explained by the covariates. As a final step, we model the light curve as a sum of a transit signal and systematics represented as a Gaussian process (GP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> . The GP uses the same covariates as the linear model, and its hyperparameters are learned from the data by fitting a GP to the light curves with the bestfitting transit model removed. We use a transit model with quadratic limb darkening coefficients.  The limb darkening coefficients are free with uninformative priors so that the parameter estimates are marginalized over all limb darkening profiles allowed by the observations. Finally, the transit model parameter posteriors are estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the GP to represent the systematics. Normalized transit light curves, best-fit detrending+transit light curve models based on the MCMC sampling, and their residuals are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, and detrended transit light curves overlaid with the best-fit transit light curve models are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. We calculate rms of residuals per 1 min for each band, and derived ones are 0.057%, 0.050%, 0.060%, and 0.076%, respectively for g, r, i, and z s bands. To understand how photometric performance is achieved, we roughly estimate error budgets for this observation as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  5</ref>. In the table, σ target , σ comp , and σ sky indicate typical photon noises (Poisson noises) per 1 min arising from fluxes of the target, comparison stars, and sky-background, respectively. σ read is a noise caused by the readout noise (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) within the aperture. Finally, σ expected is a total expected noise per 1 min, which is calculated by the square root of the sum of the squares of above noises. The values of σ expected and rms are in good agreement, meaning the observed photometric precision can be mostly explained by photon noises of the target, comparison stars, and sky-background noises and additional readout noise of the CCDs. The slightly larger rms than σ expected in g and r bands may be due to a scintillation noise caused by the short exposure times in those bands. Finally, to evaluate a possible error caused by telescope guiding, we have also tried to fit the light curves without using dx and dy as covariates. We find that the total rms values become larger by ∼0.02% in all the bands. This means that centroid shifts may cause a potential error of ∼0.05-0.06% unless properly decorrelated. We also note that transit parameters of the WASP-12b data will be presented in a separated paper (Parviainen et al. in prep.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Discussion</head><p>The demonstrated results can be compared with the photometric performance of MuSCAT, which is mounted on the Okayama 1.88 m telescope. WASP-12 was also observed with MuSCAT as a demonstration of photometric precision in   <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , in which the photometric precision per 1 minute was 0.12%, 0.12%, and 0.15% in g, r, and z s bands, respectively. Although one of the dominant noise sources in the MuSCAT observation was sky background, another dominant source was unknown (unpredictable) systematics, probably arising from telluric atmosphere (e.g., the second-order extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> ). As a result, the photometric precisions were twice worse than those achieved here with MuSCAT2, although the expected photon noises from the target star are comparable in both cases. As described above, the photometric noises observed with MuSCAT2 can well be explained by known (predictable) noise sources, and no systematic noise is apparent under favor of the higher elevation of the Teide observatory (2390 m) than the Okayama observatory (372 m).</p><p>Based on the photometric performance of MuSCAT achieved for HAT-P-14,  16 demonstrated that MuSCAT has an ability to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets as small as a super-Earth/mini-Neptune (∼2.5 R ⊕ ) around a nearby M dwarf. Comparing with this result, MuSCAT2 should have a similar, or even better, ability to probe the atmosphere of exoplanets thanks to the better photometric precision and the presence of an extra channel (i band).</p><p>Multi-color transit photometry, combined with a physically-based light contamination model and Bayesian analysis framework, can be also used to estimate the true radius ratio of the transiting object, which allows us to distinguish planetary-size objects from stellar-size objects. The foundations of this approach have been laid out in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> , and the full Bayesian approach will be detailed in Parviainen et al. in prep. MuSCAT2 will become one of the best instruments in the world for the purpose to discriminate whether candidates of transiting planets are real planets or false positives due to eclipsing binaries.</p><p>We finally note how we determine a degree of defocusing and an exposure time for each target. The optimal image size basically depends on the brightness of the target and/or comparison stars and the dead time of the detector. In the case of bright stars ( 14 mag), sky background noise is negligible even with moderate defocusing, while faint stars ( 15 mag) are sensitive to sky background, which makes focused observation essential. On the other hand, CCD cameras have finite dead time (1-4 sec), which makes observation with a short exposure time that is comparable to the dead time inefficient. Therefore we usually set the exposure time at 15 sec or longer for any targets except for very bright targets, and adjust the defocused size so that the target and comparison stars will not saturate with the given exposure time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Summary</head><p>We have developed a new astronomical instrument MuSCAT2 for the TCS 1.52m telescope in the Teide observatory, Tenerife, Spain. MuSCAT2 has a capability of 4-color simultaneous imaging in g (400-550 nm), r (550-700 nm), i (700-820 nm), and z s (820-920 nm) bands with four 1k×1k pixel CCDs. The field of view of MuSCAT2 is 7.4×7.4 arcmin 2 with the pixel scale of 0.44 arcsec per pixel.</p><p>As shown in Section 4.5, MuSCAT2 is able to achieve well better precision than 0.1% for a G0V star with V∼11.6. The capability of demonstrated high photometric precision and 4-color simultaneous imaging would be useful to confirm whether candidates of transiting planets discovered by transit surveys are true planets or false positives due to eclipsing binaries. This is especially powerful in the TESS and PLATO era, which will produce thousands of candidates in upcoming years. MuSCAT2 has started science operations since January 2018, and over 250 nights per year will be allocated for the MuSCAT2 consortium at least until 2022. MuSCAT2 will substantially contribute to follow-up transit observations of the TESS and PLATO space missions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1 Layout of the optical system of TCS and MuSCAT2.
