			<abstract>
				<p>Giant exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars have high temperatures because of the immense stellar irradiation which they receive. The extreme energy input leads to the expansion of the atmosphere and the escape of neutral hydrogen 1 2 3. A particularly intriguing case among the hot giant planets is KELT-9b-an exoplanet orbiting very close to an early A-type star with the highest temperature (∼ 4600 K at day-side) among all the exoplanets known so far 4. The atmospheric composition and dynamic of such a unique planet have been unknown. Here we report the first detection of an extended hot hydrogen atmosphere around KELT-9b. The detection was achieved by measuring the atomic hydrogen absorption during transit with the Balmer H α line, which is unusually strong mainly due to the high level of extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the star. We detected a significant wavelength shift of the H α absorption which is mostly attributed to the planetary orbital motion 5. The obtained transmission spectrum has a significant line contrast (1.15% extra absorption at the H α line centre). The observation implies that the effective radius at the H α line centre is ∼ 1.64 times the size of the planetary radius, indicating the planet has a largely extended hydrogen envelope close to the size of the Roche lobe (1.91 +0.22 −0.26 R planet) and is probably undergoing dramatic atmosphere escape. We observed two transits of KELT-9b on August 6 and September 21, 2017 with the CARMENES instrument 6. CARMENES is a high-resolution (R ∼ 94 600 in the visual channel) spectrograph installed at the 3.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. Each of the observations lasted for ∼ 6 hours covering the 4 hours transit and 1 hour before and after transit. For each transit dataset, we firstly removed the telluric H 2 O lines at the H α wavelength range and then aligned all the spectra to the stellar rest frame. A reference spectrum was obtained by combining all the spectra observed during out-of-transit. This reference spectrum is regarded as the spectrum of the star and each observed spectrum was then divided by the reference spectrum to remove the stellar H α spectrum. In this way, we obtained planetary absorption spectra with telluric and stellar lines removed. We then binned the planetary absorption spectra from both nights with a 0.01 orbital phase step, i. e. the spectra within each 0.01 phase bin were averaged with the spectral 1 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as weight. The obtained planetary absorption spectra are displayed in Fig.1a. The figure shows a black shadow during transit which is the result of the H α absorption. The absorption feature has a significant wavelength shift and this radial velocity (RV) change is mostly attributed to the planetary orbital motion. We modeled the planetary absorption feature assuming it has a Gaussian profile. The semi-amplitude of the planetary orbital motion(K planet) was set as a free parameter in the model. We included an atmosphere wind speed (v wind) in our model since high-altitude wind from day-side to night-side has been observed in exoplanet transmission spectra, for example in HD189733b 7 8 9 and in HD209458b 5. In addition to the planetary H α absorption, there is also variation of the stellar line during transit due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and the Centre-to-Limb Variation (CLV) effect. The RM effect 10 11 12 means that the observed stellar line profile changes during transit because of the stellar rotation. The RM effect of KELT-9b has been observed in ref. 4 with the Doppler tomog-raphy method and the star is rapidly rotating (v sinI = 111.4 km/s) with a spin-orbit alignment (λ) of −84.8 degrees (a nearly polar orbit). We adopted these parameters to model the RM induced variation of the stellar H α line. The CLV effect describes the variation of stellar lines across the stellar disk&apos;s centre to limb 13 14 15. We modeled the stellar H α line variation considering both RM and CLV effects (see Methods). However, the model is for one planetary radius (R planet), the actual effective radius is larger than R planet because of the planetary absorption. Thus we introduced a factor f to account for a larger planetary effective radius. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with the emcee tool 16 to model the observed spectra and to perform the error estimations (see Methods). The best-fit model is presented in Fig.1b. The model consists of two parts: the planetary absorption and the stellar line profile change. The obtained f factor has a value of 1.98. The semi-amplitude of the planetary orbital motion is derived to be K planet = 268.7 +6.2 −6.4 km/s (all the errors are 1 σ errors). This corresponds to a RV change from-91 km/s to +91 km/s during transit (indicated as blue dashed line in Fig.1b). By combining the measured K planet and the orbital motion of the host star K star , one derives directly the masses of the star and the planet using Newton&apos;s law of gravity. The RV of the host star orbiting the mass centre of the star-planet system has been previously observed to have a semi-amplitude of K star = 0.276 ± 0.079 km/s. Considering the orbital period of 1.48112 days, orbital inclination of 86.79 degrees and a zero 2 eccentricity, we derived the stellar mass M star = 3.00 ± 0.21 M Sun and planetary mass M planet = 3.23 ± 0.94 M Jupiter. The stellar mass obtained with this method is generally consistent with the mass derived from stellar spectrum modeling (M star = 2.52 +0.25 −0.20 M Sun). We further obtained the resolved H α absorption line profile by adding up all the fully in-transit (excluding the ingress and egress) transmission spectra with the planetary orbital motion RV corrected. We also corrected the stellar induced line profile change due to RM and CLV effects. The final H α absorption line is presented in Fig.2. A Gaussian profile with parameters obtained from the MCMC analysis is also plotted. The absorption line is well resolved with a line contrast of 1.15 ± 0.05% and a full width half maximum of 51.2 +2.7 −2.5 km/s. The line has a Doppler shift of −1.02 +0.99 −1.00 km/s, indicating we did not detect a significant day-to night-side wind considering the error. Fig.3 shows the time-series equivalent width of the H α absorption (W Hα). The equivalent width is obtained by integrating the absorption feature from-75 km/s to +75 km/s (∼ 3.28Å28˚28Å) (see Methods). The stellar induced line profile change was corrected before the integration. The integrating band is centered at the planetary RV (i. e. orbital motion RV plus wind speed). The W Hα value shows clear implication of absorption during transit. The W Hα quantity for the fully in-transit spectra has an average value of 0.014±0.002Å002˚002Å. We did not detect any significant pre-transit or after transit H α absorption signal. Extended atomic hydrogen atmospheres have been observed for several exoplanets. These observations were mostly performed with Ly α line using the STIS ultraviolet spectrograph mounted on Hubble Space Telescope 3 17 18. However, since KELT-9b has a large distance to Earth, it is not possible to detect Ly α due to the strong interstellar medium absorption. Detecting the hydrogen atmosphere with the H α line is more difficult because it is not a resonant line like the Ly α and requires a large number of excited atoms in the atmosphere. There are H α detections in one of the most extensively studied exoplanets HD 189733b 19 20 21 , although the detections are affected by stellar activity and vary during different transit epochs 22 23. Theoretical H α modeling work 24 25 shows that extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and Ly α radiation are needed to produce a large number of excited hydrogen atoms, and in the case of HD 189733b, it is probably the stellar activity which provides such a strong EUV radiation considering its host star is a K-type. As an early A-type star (detailed spectral type: B9.5-A0), KELT-9 (HD 195689) has a strong EUV radiation even without significant activities 4. Thus, the observed strong H α absorp-3 tion in KELT-9b&apos;s atmosphere is probably the result of an immense EUV radiation received and an extremely high temperature achieved. Effects like stellar variability and stellar activity (including enhanced chromospheric activity due to star-planet interaction 26) could potentially affect the H α detection. Although we are not able to measure the activity level of KELT-9 since CARMENES does not cover the Ca II H&amp;K lines, early A-type stars like KELT-9 normally do not exhibit strong activities because they almost have no chromosphere or corona. The same level of H α absorption observed during two transit epochs (see Results of individual night in Methods) also suggests that the host star is probably not very active. Furthermore, the Doppler information of the H α absorption originated from the planet orbital motion makes our detection unambiguous. The observed extra absorption depth at the H α line centre is 1.15 ± 0.05% while the photo-metric transit depth in the continuum is only 0.68% 4. This implies an effective radius at the line core of ∼ 1.64 R planet. According to theoretical calculations 25 , H α absorption is mostly originated from an atomic layer of the planetary atmosphere and the excited hydrogen atoms at n=2 state have a roughly constant number density (n 2) in the atomic layer. Therefore, we inferred the observed H α absorption in KELT-9b is probably from an atomic layer extending from 1 R planet to 1.64 R planet with a temperature range from ∼ 4600 K (day-side temperature) to ∼ 10000 K. The H α absorption is optically thick for the sight-line passing the lower part of the atomic layer, and thus the line profile is dominated by the thermal broadening and the maximum line centre optical depth τ 0. The observed H α line profile in KELT-9b has a much larger line width (21.7 ± 1.1km/s, σ of the Gaussian fit) than the thermal broadening velocity (10.8 km/s, assuming an average temperature of 7000 K), which demonstrates that the H α absorption is optically thick. Using the analytic model in ref. 25 , we estimated that an excited atom number density of n 2 = 2.7 × 10 3 cm −3 (which corresponds to a maximum line centre optical depth τ 0 = 57) can produce the observed H α line width. Contributions from rotational broadening as well as possible hydrodynamic escaping broadening 27 are relatively small and therefore neglected in the above estimation. As KELT-9b is orbiting very closely to its massive host star, the planetary Roche lobe has a relatively small size. The Roche radius at the planetary terminator (where the transit absorption occurs) is smaller than the radius towards the star 28. Therefore we used the effective Roche radius as an approximation of the value at the terminator 29 , and the obtained radius is R Roche = 1.91 +0.22 −0.26 R planet. The observed effective radius at the H α line core is close to the Roche lobe, implying that the hydrogen atmosphere almost fills the Roche lobe and can further escape the planet. We estimated the mass loss rate by assuming a hydrogen particle at 1.64 R planet can escape the planet if the particle can reach the Roche lobe with a large enough kinetic energy. Using the 4 above calculated density of n 2 and assuming n 2 /n H = 10 −6 at the atomic layer boundary, we obtained a mass loss rate of ∼ 10 12 g s −1 for R Roche = 1.91 R planet. However, since the Roche radius has large errors (1 σ range: 1.65 ∼ 2.13R planet) due to the not well determined planetary mass, the mass loss rate estimated from this method has one order of magnitude uncertainty. The estimated escape rate here is in broad agreement with the value in the discovery paper 4 (10 10 − 10 13 g s −1) which is estimated using the EUV flux level. Note here we only considered thermal escaping to obtain a rough estimation, the actual escape rate calculation requires a comprehensive modeling work (e. g. ref. 30). Given the high temperature of KELT-9b (∼ 4600 K at day-side 4) and an extremely high level of ultraviolet radiation received, most of the molecular hydrogen is probably dissociated into atomic hydrogen and further been stripped away. Further transit measurements of other Balmer lines (e. g. H β) will enable a comprehensive study of the planetary temperature structure, and the combination of the Balmer line modeling and the atmosphere escape modeling will allow to constrain the mass loss rate as well as the atmosphere life time more precisely.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Observations. We observed two transits of KELT-9b with CARMENES, a fiber-fed echelle spectrograph mounted on the 3.5 meter telescope at Calar Alto. The instrument has two arms: one in the near infrared and one in the visible. We used only the data taken with the visible spectrograph which has a resolution of R = 94 600 and a wavelength coverage from 0.52 µm to 0.97 µm with 42 spectral orders. The host star is a bright early A type star (magnitude V=7.56 mag, T eff = 10,170 K). The exposure times were set to 300 or 400 seconds. The observation lasted for ∼ 6 hours for each night. Both of the two observations were performed under partially cloudy weather condition, thus some of the spectra have relatively low signal-to-noise raios and part of the observations was lost.</p><p>Data reduction. Standard data reduction of the raw spectrum was performed with the pipeline CARACAL (CARMENES Reduction And Calibration 31 ), including bias, flat, cosmic ray correction and wavelength calibration. The spectra were further reduced with a self-written IDL script with three main steps.</p><p>Step 1 Removal of telluric lines. The telluric features at the H α wavelength range are mostly H 2 O lines. The telluric removal was performed in the observer rest frame. We firstly built a theoretical H 2 O transmission model with the HITRAN database 32 based on the method described in <ref type="bibr">33</ref> . The next procedure was to calculate the H 2 O column densities for each spectrum as the value varied during the observations. The column density was calculated by fitting strong H 2 O absorption lines from an adjacent spectral order with a wavelength range of 6474Å6474˚6474Å ∼ 6497Å6497˚6497Å. The observed spectra were normalized before the fitting. The column density value was then used to calculate the theoretical H 2 O spectrum at the H α wavelength range. The telluric lines were removed by dividing each observed spectrum with the corresponding modeled H 2 O transmission spectrum.</p><p>Step 2 Removal of stellar lines. The stellar line removal was performed in the stellar rest frame. The RV correction includes three parts: (1) barycentric Earth radial velocity; (2) absolute stellar RV (−20.567 ± 0.1 km/s) 4 ; (3) stellar orbital motion RV around the star-planet mass centre. The stellar orbital RV was obtained with K star = 0.276 km/s from the literature. After these RV corrections, the stellar photospheric H α lines were well aligned in all the spectra. We then built a reference spectrum (F out v ) by combing all the out-of-transit spectra with the SNR as weight. Each of the observed spectrum was then divided by this reference spectrum to remove the stellar H α line. In this way, we obtained the residual spectrum at different phases</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R v = F v /F out v .</formula><p>Here v is wavelength expressed in velocity space (v = 0 corresponding to the stellar line centre at 6562.81 ˚</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A)</head><p>Step 3 Rebin and combine the spectra. The above data reduction steps were performed separately on the two transit datasets. We combined the spectra by binning the two transit datasets with a orbital phase step of 0.01. The spectra within each phase bin were added up with their SNRs as weights. In this way, we obtained 18 spectra from phase -0.08 to phase +0.10.There is no data for the phase bin at -0.01. These spectra are finally displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.1a</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary Fig.1</ref> shows an example of the data reduction procedures.</p><p>Stellar spectral model. We simulated the variation of stellar lines (S v ) during transit using the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and 34 . The model includes RM effect and CLV effect. The simulation includes the following steps.</p><p>(1) We firstly obtained the stellar spectrum as a function of limb angle using the Spectroscopy Made Easy tool <ref type="bibr">35</ref> . The simulation utilizes the VALD line list <ref type="bibr">36</ref> and the Kurucz ATLAS code <ref type="bibr">37</ref> . The stellar parameters used are T eff = 10170 K, [Fe/H] = -0.03, log g = 4.093. The stellar rotation was not included in this step, but will be included in the next step. We simulated the stellar spectra at 21 limb angles and linearly interpolated the spectra at other limb angles.</p><p>(2) We then calculated the synthetic spectrum during transit. We divided the stellar disk into elements with a size of 0.01 R star × 0.01 R star . The stellar spectrum during transit was then calculated by integrating the spectra of the unobscured elements. The RM effect was included by assigning each stellar element a RV due to the stellar rotation. The parameters used are: R star = 2.362 R Sun , R planet = 1.891 R Jupiter , i = 86.79 degrees, v sinI = 111.4 km/s and λ = -84.8 degrees.</p><p>(3) We obtained the normalized stellar line profile change by dividing each simulated spectrum with the out-of-transit spectrum. The simulated result is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Supplementary Fig.2</ref>. The RM effect causes a bright Doppler trace. The green line indicates the RV of the rotating stellar surface that is blocked by the planet. This RV value changes from -29 km/s to -8 km/s during transit. The CLV effect makes the line profile shallower at mid-transit while deeper when transiting the stellar limb.</p><p>The above simulated stellar line profile change is for 1 R planet . However, the actual stellar H α line change should be larger than the 1 R planet case because the planetary atmosphere absorption increases the effective radius. In order to properly account for this "effective radius increase" problem, we introduced a factor f and assumed the corresponding line profile change is f times of the simulated result for the 1 R planet case. We note here the actual effective radius is quite complicated because one needs to consider the line profile of the planetary absorption (i. e. the effective radius varies from the line centre to the line wing). The RV difference between the planetary atmosphere and the stellar elements obscured by the planet (i. e. the two dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.1b</ref>) also affects the actual effective radius. Therefore, we used a simple constant f factor as a first-order approximation to account for this problem.</p><p>MCMC analysis. We performed an MCMC analysis to fit the observed data R v <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1a)</ref> and retrieve the errors. The model includes two parts: the planetary transmission spectrum T v and the stellar line change S v . The transmission spectrum is assumed to be a Gaussian function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T v = 1 + h e − (v−v 0 ) 2 2σ (1)</formula><p>where v is velocity, σ is the Gaussian standard deviation, h is the Gaussian height and v 0 is the planetary radial velocity (the planetary orbital motion plus the wind speed). The final model is obtained by multiplying the absorption spectrum (T v ) and the simulated stellar line variation (S v )</p><p>In total, there are five free parameters in the model: Gaussian standard deviation (σ), Gaussian height (h), planetary orbital motion amplitude (K planet ), wind speed (v wind ) and the stellar model factor (f ). We only used the fully in-transit data, because the planetary absorption spectrum during ingress and egress is different from the absorption spectrum during fully in-transit. This means the analysis is based on binned spectra covering the phases from -0.045 to +0.045.</p><p>The emcee code was employed to run the MCMC simulations. We used 100 walkers and each walker has 10000 steps. The first 1000 steps were discarded as burn-in. The correlation diagrams are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Supplementary Fig.3</ref>.</p><p>Equivalent width calculation. The H α equivalent width for each absorption spectrum is calculated by the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W Hα = +75+v 0 v=−75+v 0 (1 − R v )∆λ v<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R v is the observed absorption spectrum at velocity v, ∆λ v is the wavelength difference at v, v 0 is the planetary velocity (combination of orbital motion and wind speed). Here, R v is corrected with the modeled stellar line profile change, i. e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R v = (F v /F out v )/S v .</formula><p>The integration range was chosen to be ±75 km/s considering the actual absorption profile presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.2, i</ref>. e. this range includes the majority of the line profile. The W Hα has a value in the same unit as ∆λ v . We derived the uncertainties of W Hα by summing E(R v ) × ∆λ v values in quadrature (i. e. square root of sum of squares), where E(R v ) is the uncertainty of R v . The result is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.3</ref>.</p><p>Results of individual night. The results of individual night are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Supplementary Fig.4</ref>. The spectra here are binned with 0.01 phase steps. The transmission spectra and equivalent widths are calculated after the correction of the stellar line variation and planetary orbital motion. We adopted the values of the planetary orbital motion amplitude (K planet ), the wind speed (v wind ) and the stellar model factor (f ) which are obtained from the combined two nights spectra. The H α signal can be seen clearly in both nights with a similar absorption depth, only that the Night 2 result is more noisy due the cloud passing by during the observation.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Supplementary Fig.4</ref> presents the equivalent widths of un-binned spectra. As can be seen, the observations are not consecutive due to the interruption of cloud and the spectral SNR has a large variation.</p><p>Code availability. The spectral reduction was done with a self-written IDL script. The MCMC analysis was done with the emcee tool which is public available from https://github.com/dfm/emcee.
