				<p>We report on initial results from the largest infrared AO direct imaging survey searching for wide orbit (100 AU) massive exoplanets and brown dwarfs as companions around young nearby stars using Robo-AO at the 2.1-m telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The occurrence rates of these rare substellar companions are critical to furthering our understanding of the origin of planetary-mass companions on wide orbits. The observing efficiency of Robo-AO allows us to conduct a survey an order of magnitude larger than previously possible. We commissioned a low-noise high-speed SAPHIRA near-infrared camera to conduct this survey and report on its sensitivity, performance, and data reduction process.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over the past two decades, our knowledge of planetary systems has expanded from just our Solar System to a multitude of planetary architectures. The Kepler mission has detected thousands of exoplanets in closein orbits (1 AU) as they transit their host star. Direct imaging identified a complementary population of substellar companions (2-70 M Jup ), namely planets and brown dwarfs at large projected separations (10 AU). The existence of these companions at wide separations has played a critical role in shaping theories about the formation and migration of brown dwarfs and planets, by combining mechanisms such as core accretion, disk instability, cloud fragmentation, and dynamical scattering on various timescales and orbital separations. These mechanisms predict correlations between the presence of a wide-orbit companion and certain environmental characteristics, such as the presence or absence of other companions, circumstellar disk morphologies, and the eccentricity of the companion's orbit.</p><p>The IAU currently defines the boundary between brown dwarfs and planets at 13 M Jup , but it remains an unresolved issue whether it is an artificial boundary rather than reflective of a natural boundary, linking observational properties of these objects to dominant formation mechanisms (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chabrier et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Schlaufman 2018</ref>. Companion demographic studies are necessary to look for trends and clarify the uncertain boundary between brown dwarfs and massive exoplanets. However, due to the small number of discoveries so far, most theoretical work has focused on individual systems. Large exoplanet imaging searches, each on the order of hundreds of targets, have discovered between 0 and 4 substellar companions, bringing the total detections to ∼12 objects in the planetary-mass regime (15 M Jup ) and another ∼30 in the brown dwarf regime <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). To better understand these substellar objects and determine the best parameters for distinguishing between brown dwarfs and massive exoplanets, we need to carry out statistical studies of these objects, which require larger sample sizes. Therefore, the next step is to conduct a survey large enough to greatly boost the detections of these rare objects. This will allow us to go beyond individual discoveries and into population studies to test formation and evolution models. We are conducting the Large Adaptive optics Survey for Substellar Objects (LASSO), the largest infrared direct imaging survey to date, searching for substellar companions around ∼3,500 young, low-mass stars in the solar neighborhood. We have conducted a pilot survey, observing ∼400 targets using the Robo-AO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baranec et al. 2014</ref>) robotic laser adaptive optics instrument at the Kitt Peak 2.1-m telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salama et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Jensen-Clem et al. 2017</ref>), equipped with a Selex Avalanche Photodiode for High-speed Infrared Array (SAPHIRA) detector as the infrared science camera. Robo-AO is a robotic laser guide star adaptive optics instrument. Due to the automated operations of Robo-AO, its observing efficiency is unparalleled and enables this survey to be 5× larger than previously feasible. Robo-AO has been at the 2.1-m telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona, since November 2015. In June 2018, Robo-AO was decommissioned in preparation for its next commissioning on the UH88 (2.2-m) telescope on Maunakea, by the end of the year 2018.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ROBO-AO INFRARED CAMERA</head><p>The signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio can be improved using photon-counting detectors, such as EMCCDs (Electron Multiplying Charge-Coupled Devices) at visible wavelengths, which make use of electron avalanche mechanisms to exponentially multiply the signal without increasing the readnoise. This type of photon-counting technology has recently been extended to infrared wavelengths, with the development of SAPHIRA detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Finger et al. 2014</ref>). These SAPHIRA detectors allow for almost noiseless signal amplification and ultra-low dark currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Atkinson et al. 2017)</ref>, which is especially beneficial for space telescopes where, in the absence of atmospheric interference, detector noise is the main noise source. Such photon-counting IR detectors are also invaluable for ground-based astronomical observations of photon-starved targets. Robo-AO was initially equipped with an EMCCD detector as the visible-light science camera, but in order to extend the scope of observable objects to much cooler and lower-mass objects, namely brown dwarfs and massive exoplanets, we need to move to the nearinfrared regime. To this end, we commissioned a new SAPHIRA detector for Robo-AO. This type of high-speed detector is particularly useful to minimize the degrading effect of the target's tip-tilt motion on image quality by taking multiple short-exposure images while adding negligible noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jensen-Clem et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>Adding an infrared camera allows us to expand the diversity of possible targets and perform multi-color photometry by simultaneously imaging in both the visible and infrared. Additionally, once the infrared camera is fully integrated into the Robo-AO software, it will allow us to point to targets that are otherwise too faint to find in the visible. With the simultaneous infrared and visible imaging we will be able to observe these targets in the optical by increasing their exposure time. Robo-AO does not yet employ active tip-tilt compensation, and instead takes rapid images to subsequently shift and add into a final image. We have previously demonstrated tip-tilt correction with Robo-AO, and will add this to the automated observing routines in the future. We will <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">SAPHIRA Detector</head><p>The SAPHIRA detector ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Finger et al. 2014</ref>) is a new infrared detector technology that has so far only been used for fringe tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eisenhauer et al. 2016</ref>), demonstration tests ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Atkinson et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Goebel et al. 2016</ref>, and with the Robo-AO system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baranec et al. 2015</ref>) at Palomar on a limited basis in 2014. This is the first long-term deployment of such a camera on an adaptive optics system for science applications. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the camera interior setup. The cold head is cryogenically cooled to 65 K. On top of the cold head is the inner sanctum, in which the detector is located. The inner sanctum is heated to 85 K because it is more stable to cool beyond our desired temperature and then heat back up to it. A cold blocking J-filter is placed on the opening at the top of the inner sanctum and a radiation shield surrounds the entire structure to help prevent thermal radiation from reaching the detector. The solid angle open for light to reach the detector is 0.1 steradian. The entire structure is placed inside a vacuum chamber, which is pumped down to &lt; 1 × 10 −5 torr in order to isolate the unit from ambient air and maintain its cold temperature. The Institute for Astronomy has developed PB1 ("PizzaBox") electronics to read out the detector. It can be used in different configurations for Hawaii-2RG, Hawaii-4RG, and SAPHIRA detectors. In this case, we use the single board configuration for the 320 × 256 SAPHIRA detector, which has 32 readout channels and is capable of reaching a 2 Mpixel/sec sampling rate per channel. This allows for an 800 Hz full frame readout rate.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>.1. Summary of characteristics for Robo-AO science cameras.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Automation</head><p>Given the short timeframe (∼3 months) before the system was to be removed from the Kitt Peak 2.1-m and overhauled in Hawaii, we decided against integrating control of the SAPHIRA camera with the core software of Robo-AO. Instead, we produced a custom Python script, installed on an independent account on the IR camera control computer with read-only access to the primary control computer. By avoiding direct interaction with the Robo-AO system, we minimized development time and the need for regression testing.</p><p>This script automated the IR observation process by monitoring the Robo-AO queue and AO logs. Observation settings were determined from target entries when they were selected by the queuing subsystem, with camera activation once the AO loop was closed. For convenience, this script also triggered initialization of the IR camera system on startup, produced a separate log for IR observations and comments, and pushed all data to the storage drive on shutdown. As opposed to manual control of the SAPHIRA camera, this script reduced observation time overhead by approximately 30 seconds per image (enabling an increase in number of survey observations by up to 15% in ideal conditions), and greatly reduced operator training time and errors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LASSO Target List</head><p>As a starting point for building our target list, we used the Cool Dwarf Catalog (CDC), described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Muirhead et al. (2018)</ref>. Its purpose is to identify cool dwarf targets and their properties for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which was launched in May 2018. The CDC is incorporated into the TESS Input Catalog and TESS Candidate Target List. The CDC was then cross-matched with the GALEX catalog in order to select for youth, identified by excesses in the UV. The following cuts were applied, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rodriguez et al. (2013)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N U V − W 1 (3.4 µm) ≤ 12.5 mag (1) J − W 2 (4.6 µm) ≥ 0.8 mag (2) N U V − W 1 &lt; 7 × (J − W 2) + 5.5 mag<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Next, the remaining targets were cross-matched with Gaia DR2, in order to assemble proper motion and parallax measurements. Finally, observability cuts were applied to ensure that the targets are observable with the Robo-AO system on the Kitt Peak 2.1-m telescope:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m i ≤ 15 mag (4) Dec &gt; −30 •<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Targets with m V ≤ 17 mag were selected when no i-band measurement was available. Finally, only targets with distances, calculated from Gaia DR2 parallaxes, within 100 pc were selected. The resulting list consists of 2,787 <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Properties of target list constructed from the Cool Dwarf Catalog. The stars are mostly M dwarfs and some late K-type stars. The proper motions are from Gaia DR2. Note the range of V-magnitudes extends beyond the typical 11th magnitude limit for extreme-AO systems due to Robo-AO using a laser guide star system instead of a natural guide star system.</p><p>stars. The properties of our sample is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The targets are predominantly M dwarfs with some late K-type stars. They span temperatures of ∼3000 -4000 K, and masses of ∼0.1 -0.8 M . Although our contrasts are not as deep as those of extreme-AO systems (since we have no coronagraph and are on smaller, 2-m class, telescopes), we can go beyond the typical primary star brightness limit of 11th V-magnitude because we are using a laser guide star system as opposed to a natural guide star system. The full target list also includes ∼1000 additional members of the Sco-Cen association. These stars are at distances slightly beyond 100 pc, but belong to the youngest and nearest association observable form the Northern Hemisphere. The purpose of including these stars in the LASSO survey is to compare young field stars with these younger Sco-Cen members to search for differences in occurrence rates of substellar companions. The total target list consists of ∼3500 targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">LASSO Pilot Survey</head><p>We have conducted a pilot LASSO survey while Robo-AO was installed on the 2.1-m telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona. During this time, we observed ∼400 stars, through a range of weather and observing conditions, while we were still in the process of testing the SAPHIRA camera readout and automation software. These observations were all carried out in the J -band between March and May 2018. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a mosaic of LASSO observations with companion candidates.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Observing conditions and image quality</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, during the span of our LASSO observations, the median measured seeing (in the i'-band) was 1.6" and the median J -band Strehl ratio was 24% (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salama et al. 2016</ref> for a description of the Strehl ratio calculation). The 2.1-m telescope at Kitt Peak suffers from poor dome seeing, which represent the majority of the contribution to our seeing measurements. The dome also does not have air conditioning, therefore how well the dome and mirror thermalized with the outside air prior to observing has a significant impact on the observing conditions (see Jensen-Clem et al. <ref type="bibr">2017</ref> for more details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Survey sensitivity</head><p>To assess the sensitivity of the LASSO survey, specifically with the goal of detecting faint substellar companions, we injected fake companions into each real image and traced the limiting magnitude contrast and separation at which we could still recover the companion. We injected an artificial companion by taking the star's PSF and scaling it down to a range of contrasts, then shifting over a range of projected separations. A radial average is subtracted from the image with the injected companion to suppress the central star, then this image is divided by the root mean square noise of each radial ring, thus creating a Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) map. A minimum SNR of 5 was our threshold for declaring that the injected companion was recovered. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the resulting median contrast curve as well as the 1-sigma error bars (shaded region). If we assume the most sensitive case of a primary star of 0.15 M that is 10 Myrs old, then the contrasts shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> correspond to the companion masses displayed on the right y-axis. We converted the magnitude of the companion to a mass using hot-start evolutionary models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chabrier et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Baraffe et al. 2015</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the same median contrast curve but in terms of companion temperatures and spectral classes and for the same assumed primary stars, except at 10 Myrs and 100 Myrs.  10 Myr 0.15 M primary star <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

Robo-AO enables us to conduct this large direct imaging survey of ∼3500 targets, which is 5-10 times larger than previous surveys of this type. This will be the first longterm deployment for science purposes of a SAPHIRA detector. We have conducted an initial pilot LASSO survey of ∼400 stars with Robo-AO installed on the 2.1-m telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona. The survey will continue in full once Robo-AO is installed on the UH88, 2.1-m telescope, on Maunakea.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
