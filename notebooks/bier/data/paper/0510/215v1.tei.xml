			<abstract>
				<p>A variety of terrestrial planets with different physical parameters and exotic atmospheres might plausibly exist outside our Solar System, waiting to be detected by the next generation of space-exploration missions. Some of these planets might transit their parent star. We present here the first study of atmospheric signatures of transiting Earth-size exoplanets. We focus on a limited number of significant examples, for which we discuss the detectability of some of the possible molecules present in their atmospheres, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3) or molecular oxygen (O2). To this purpose, we developed a model to simulate transmission spectra of Earth-size exoplanets from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near infrared (NIR). According to our calculations, the signatures of planetary atmospheres represent an absorption of a few parts-per-million (ppm) in the stellar flux. The atmospheres of a few Earth-like planets can be detected with a 30-40 m telescope. The detection of the extensive atmospheres of tens of small satellites of giant exoplanets and hundreds of hypothetical ocean-planets can be achieved with 20-30 m and 10-20 m instruments, respectively, provided all these planets are frequent and they are efficiently surveyed. We also found that planets around K stars are favored, mainly because these stars are more numerous and they are smaller compared to G or F stars. While not addressed in this study, limitations might come from the stellar photometric micro-variability.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Earth is the only known example of a life-hosting world, even though terrestrial exoplanets have been searched for since the discovery of the first Earth-mass exoplanets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wolszczan &amp; Frail (1992)</ref>. However, planets similar to the Earth, Venus or Mars, in size, density or orbital parameters are still beyond the reach of the present capabilities for planet detection around normal stars.</p><p>Until now, mostly giant exoplanets have been discovered. Remarkable progresses have been made recently with the discovery of planets in the mass range of 14 to 21 Earth masses (14 to 21 M ⊕ , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">McArthur et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Santos et al. 2004</ref>), and most recently a ∼7.5 M ⊕ planet orbiting GJ 876 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rivera et al. 2005</ref>). We may speculate, then, that smaller planets with sizes down to that of the Earth might be observed in a near future. Among the 161 planets 1 detected so far, eight have been discovered or re-discovered as they were transiting their parent star, producing a photometric occultation. The last transiting planet identified is a Saturn-mass planet orbiting HD 149 026, a bright V = 8.15 G0 iv star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sato et al. 2005</ref>). The first discovered transiting giant exoplanet, HD 209 458b <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Henry et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charbonneau et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mazeh et al. 2000)</ref>, is the object of intense investigations dedicated to characterizing its hot atmosphere.</p><p>Probing planetary atmospheres by stellar occultations is an effective method used for a lot of planets and their satellites in the Solar System, from Venus to Charon (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Elliot &amp; Olkin 1996)</ref>. With this technique, we can observe the thin atmospheric ring surrounding the optically thick disk of the planet: the limb. In the case of giant exoplanets, though, the star is only partially occulted (1.6% for the transiting planet HD 209 458b). The spectrum of the star light transmitted and filtered by the lower and thick giant exoplanet atmosphere consequently presents extremely weak absorption features (from 10 −3 to 10 −4 , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Seager &amp; Sasselov 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hubbard et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the difficulties, such dim signatures were detected: <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref> measured the lower atmosphere of HD 209 458b as they detected a (2.32 ± 0.57) · 10 −4 photometric diminution in the sodium doublet line of the parent star at 589.3 nm. However its upper atmosphere, which extends up to several planet radii, shows even larger signatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, 2004</ref>) observed a 15 ± 4% absorption in the Lyman α (Ly α ) emission line of HD 209 458 at 121.57 nm as well as absorptions from atomic carbon (7.5 ± 3.5%) and oxygen (13 ± 4.5%) in the upper atmosphere. In this work, we will discuss the possibility to detect and to characterize the lower atmospheres of exoplanets using signatures comparable in origin to the one detected by <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref>.</p><p>The idea is to extend the use of transmission spectroscopy to hypothetical Earth-size planets. We estimate that these exoplanets present at least two orders of magnitude less signal than gaseous giants, as the transit of the planet itself would have a dimming of ∼10 −5 (the transit depth, ∆F/F , where F is the stellar flux, can be expressed as (R P /R ⋆ ) 2 , with R P and R ⋆ standing for the radii of the planet and the star, respectively). The atmospheres of Earth-size exoplanets should span over ∼100-km height without considering potential upper atmospheres. Depending on their transparency -which would give an equivalent optically thick layer of ∼10 kmthe expected occultations caused by atmospheric absorptions should be ∼10 −7 to ∼10 −6 .</p><p>Earth-size planets are probably the most challenging objects to detect with transmission spectroscopy. The orders of magnitude given above, in fact, raise many questions: is it realistic to seek for possible features that dim, with an instrumentation that might or might not be available in a near future? What are the strongest signatures we should expect? What kind of planet could be the best candidate to look at?</p><p>We have developed a one-dimensional model of transmission at the limb to give quantitative answers to these questions. Since we use the stellar light to explore the planetary atmospheres, we chose to focus on the wavelength range where the largest number of photons is available, i.e., between 200 and 2 000 nm. The model is described in Sect. 2. The detectability of the selected atmospheres depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) achievable with a space telescope spectrograph. The constraints on idealized observations and the method we used to calculate their S/N, are described in Sect. 3. Finally, the results for the specified cases are given and discussed in Sect. 4.</p></div>

In the present work we consider a nontransient occultation for the 'in transit' phase, with a null phase configuration (configuration 2 in Brown's <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), that is, the planet is centered in the line of sight with respect to the star. This configuration both maximizes the <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Sketch of the transmission of the stellar light through the planetary limb. The planet itself, i.e. the 'solid' disk (in grey) is optically thick at all wavelengths. The quantity dl is the elemental length along the line of sight.

In the following we detail the integration of the atmospheric opacity along a stellar light path (or cord) through the limb of the planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Opacity along the line of sight</head><p>We calculate the total opacity of the model atmosphere, τ λ , along a cord, parallel to the line of sight, as the sum of the opacity of each species i present in the atmosphere, τ λ = i τ λ,i . We can calculate the opacity along the cord as a function of its impact parameter, b:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">τ λ,i (b) = 2 +∞ 0 A λ,i ρ i (h)dl,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A λ,i is the absorption coefficient for the species i at the wavelength λ, expressed in cm 2 g −1 , and ρ i (h) is the mass density in g cm −3 of the species i at an altitude h in the atmosphere. Now, re-expressing Eq. 1 as a function of the height z = h + R P , with R P being the planet radius, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ λ,i (b) = 2 bmax b A λ,i ρ i (z − R P ) zdz √ z 2 − b 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b max is the height of the higher atmospheric level we are considering. The method to estimate b max is presented in Sect. 2.2.3.</p></div>

Brown (2001) defined ℜ to be the ratio between those two quantities, and ℜ ′ (the so-called spectrum ratio) as ℜ ′ = ℜ − 1. Here, ℜ ′ is the sum of two distinct types of occultations:</p><p>-The occultation by the 'solid' surface of the planet, optically thick at all wavelengths. Projected along the line of sight, this is a disk of radius R P and the occultation depth is simply (R P /R ⋆ ) 2 . -The wavelength-dependent occultation by the thin ring of gaseous components that surrounds the planetary disk, which can be expressed as Σ λ /(πR 2 ⋆ ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Description of the atmospheric profiles</head><p>Along a single cord, stellar photons are crossing several levels of the spherically stratified atmosphere. We generate an atmospheric model using the vertical profiles from <ref type="bibr">Tinetti et al. (2005a</ref><ref type="bibr">Tinetti et al. ( , 2005b</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fishbein et al. (2003)</ref> for the Earth and from the Venus International Reference Atmosphere (VIRA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kliore et al. 1985</ref>) for Venus. These atmospheric data include the profiles of pressure, p, temperature, T , and various mixing ratios, Y . The atmospheres are initially sampled in 50 levels, ranging from the ground level to an altitude of about 80 km for the Earth and about 50 km for Venus. Both profiles stop below the homopause, so we assume hydrostatic equilibrium for the vertical pressure gradient. A useful quantity to describe atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium is the scale height, H, i.e. the height above which the pressure decreases by a factor e. The scale height explicitly depends on the temperature, as H = kN A T /(µg), where k and N A are the Boltzmann's and Avogadro's constants while µ is the mean molar mass of the atmospheric gas. Since g is the acceleration due to gravity, H also implicitly depends on the radius and the density of the planet 2 . Consequently, less dense objects are likely to have more extensive atmospheres, hence they are easier to detect <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Density and size of planets are therefore key parameters for the present work. In order to estimate their influence, we test a set of different planetary types ranging from the Titan-like giant planet's satellite (ρ P ≈ 2 g cm −3 , R P ≈ 0.5 Earth radius -0.5 R ⊕ ) to the 'super-Earth' object (ρ P ≈ 6 g cm −3 , R P ≈ 2 R ⊕ ). For the physical properties of plausible, theoretically predicted planets such as a 'super-Earth', we use the mass-radius relation model from <ref type="bibr">Dubois (2004)</ref> and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sotin et al. (2005)</ref>. Our atmospheric model allows the re-scaling of vertical profiles depending on the acceleration due to gravity of the planet and the atmospheric pressure at the reference level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Molecular composition of the atmosphere</head><p>Our simplified atmospheric profiles contain only the species that may produce interesting spectral signatures in the chosen wavelength range (0.2 to 2 µm), viz., water vapor (H 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ) and molecular oxygen (O 2 ). Molecular nitrogen (N 2 ) has also been considered, though lacking marked electronic transitions from the UV to the near IR. Nevertheless, it is a major species in Earth's atmosphere and it has a detectable signature via Rayleigh scattering at short wavelengths.</p><p>We consider three types of atmospheres: (A) N 2 /O 2 -rich, (B) CO 2 -rich and (C) N 2 /H 2 O-rich cases. The first two types can be associated with existing planetary atmospheres, respectively Earth and Venus. The last type (C) could correspond to the atmosphere of an Earth-mass volatile-rich planet such as an 'ocean-planet' described by <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. (2004)</ref>. The basis for building a 'toy model' of an H 2 O-rich atmosphere are found in <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ehrenreich et al. (2005b, see Sect. 2.2.5)</ref>.</p><p>Vertical gradients in the chemical composition and temperature of each of these atmospheres are plotted in  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the mean chemical compositions of these model atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Temperature profiles</head><p>As mentioned above, we use Earth and Venus vertical temperature profiles as prototype for N 2 /O 2 -rich and CO 2 -rich atmospheres (see Sect. 2.4). Moreover we assume an isothermal profile in the thermosphere, instead of the real one. This is an arbitrary, but conservative choice, since the temperature should on the contrary rise in the thermosphere enhancing the atmosphere's detectability (see Sect. 4.2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Upper limit of the atmosphere</head><p>We set the profiles to extend up to a critical height b max from the centre of the planet, or h max from the surface (b max = R P + h max ). This limit corresponds to the altitude above which the molecular species we considered (H 2 O, O 3 , CO 2 , O 2 ) are likely to be destroyed or modified either by photo-dissociating or ionizing radiations, such as Ly α or extreme-UV (EUV).</p><p>Therefore, the critical height corresponds to the mesopause on Earth (at ≈ 85 km). The column density of the terrestrial atmosphere above that altitude, N ≥85 km , is sufficient to absorb all Ly α flux. In fact, as the number density of the atmospheric gas, n(h), de-   Temperature is assumed to be constant above that height. The thickest horizontal line shows the position of the cloud layer.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(g mol −1 ) YN 2 (%) YH 2 O (%) YCO 2 (%) YO 2 (%) YO 3 (%) Used</formula><p>creases exponentially with height, we can simply consider N ≥85 km ∝ n 85 km · H 85 km , where n 85 km and H 85 km are the density and the scale height of the terrestrial atmosphere at 85 km, respectively. Similarly, we set the upper limit of a given atmosphere, h max , to the altitude below which the photodissociating photons are absorbed. We assume that h max is the altitude where the column density equals that of the terrestrial atmosphere at 85 km, that is n hmax · H hmax = (n 85 km ) ⊕ · (H 85 km ) ⊕ . We determine h max by scaling this equation.</p><p>Values of h max for the different models are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Similarly to neutral elements absorbing light below h max , it is likely that ionized elements are absorbing light above this limit, though we do not include this effect in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Presence of clouds</head><p>In the wavelength range of interest, the surface of Venus is almost completely hidden by clouds. Therefore, it seems reasonable to model these types of clouds to a first order <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 3</ref>. Atmospheric profiles, B1. The legend is identical to that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. The temperature profile and mixing ratios are that of Venus. The temperature is considered to be constant above 50 km. Carbon dioxide is barely visible because it is by far the major constituent so its line is superimposed with that of the total density. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Atmospheric profiles, C1. Same legend as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 3</ref>. The temperature profile follows a dry adiabat in the first 10 km of the atmosphere, until the point where e ≥ e sat . Next, it follows a steeper saturated adiabat up to 20 km high. The temperature gradient is arbitrarily set to be isothermal above this point. The cloud top (thickest line) is one scale height above the higher point where e ≥ e sat . For reasons detailed in the text (see Sect. 2.2.5), this point corresponds to the level where the temperature gradient becomes isothermal. approximation by assuming that they act as an optically thick layer at a given altitude. As a result, clouds effectively increase the apparent radius of the planet and the transiting spectrum gives information only about atmospheric components existing above the cloud layer. The top of the cloud layer is a free parameter for N 2 /O 2 -and CO 2 -rich atmospheres (set to 10 and 30 km, taken from the Earth and Venus, respectively). We treat the case of the N 2 /H 2 O-rich atmosphere separately because H 2 O is a highly condensable species.</p><p>2.2.5. Composition, vertical structure and location of the clouds in a N 2 /H 2 O-rich atmosphere</p><p>The temperature gradient of an atmosphere containing non-negligible amount of condensable species, like H 2 O, significantly departs from the case where no condensation occurs. A correct estimation of the temperature profile is crucial to determine the scale height, hence the detectability of that atmosphere. In an H 2 O-rich atmosphere, the evolution of the adiabatic temperature gradient is driven by the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor, e, to the saturating vapor pressure, e sat . This ratio should also determine the levels at which the water vapor is in excess in the air and condenses (for e/e sat &gt; 1), i.e. the levels where clouds may form.</p><p>Our initial conditions at the z = 0 level (z 0 ) are the temperature T 0 and pressure p 0 . With these quantities we can estimate e sat , which depends only on the temperature, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">e sat (T ) = p * exp µ H2O L v N A k 1 T * − 1 T (5)</formula><p>where p * and T * are the reference pressure (1.013 ·10 5 Pa) and temperature (373 K), µ H2O is the molar mass of water and L v is the latent heat of vaporization for water (2.26 · 10 10 erg g −1 ). Assuming that the planet is covered with liquid water (e.g., an ocean-planet; see <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2004</ref>) and that T 0 is 'tropical' (e.g. 340 K), the humidity at the surface is high so that the value of e 0 must be an important fraction of e sat (T 0 ). We set e 0 to half the value of e sat (T 0 ). The volume mixing ratio of water can be expressed as Y H2O = e/p, and we can calculate it at the surface of the planet. The atmosphere of an ocean-planet may also contain a significant quantity of CO 2 . We arbitrarily set this quantity constant to Y CO 2 = 0.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Léger et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ehrenreich et al. 2005b</ref>). Molecular nitrogen is the major constituent of the atmosphere of the Earth and the second more abundant species in the atmosphere of Venus, and therefore we chose to include it to complete the chemical composition of this atmosphere. The mixing ratio of N 2 was set to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Y N2 = 1 − Y CO 2 − Y H2O</formula><p>at any level. Assuming the atmosphere contains only N 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 , we can obtain the mean molar mass of the atmospheric gas (µ 0 = i Y 0 i µ i ) and that of the dry atmospheric gas</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(µ 0 d = µ 0 − Y 0 H2O µ H2O ), the mean specific heat of dry air (C 0 p = C p i Y 0 i µ i /µ 0 d ) and the scale height H 0 (all at the level z 0 ).</formula><p>For the z j+1 level, we need to evaluate the temperature gradient between z j and z j+1 . There are two cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Triplet &amp; Roche 1986)</ref>: -e j &lt; e j sat ; in this case the temperature follows a dry adiabatic gradient,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆T dry = −g C j p .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>-e j = e j sat ; in this case the gradient is saturated,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆T sat = ∆T dry 1 + r j sat 1 + L v r j sat /(R j dry T j ) 1 + r j sat C j p C p H2O + L 2 v 1+r j sat RH 2 O R j dry RH 2 O (T j ) 2 (7)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r j sat = (µ H2O e j sat )/[µ j d (p j − e j sat )]</formula><p>is the mixing ratio of saturated air, R j dry = N A k/µ j dry and R H2O = N A k/µ H2O are the specific constant of dry air at the level z j and water (respectively).</p><p>If z j+1 &lt; 20 km, we select the appropriate gradient accordingly to the value of e/e sat , and get the value of the temperature T j+1 . Above 20 km, we assume the temperature profile becomes isothermal (T j+1 = T j ).</p><p>The assumption of an isothermal atmosphere, already discussed in Sect. 2.2.2, is somewhat arbitrary but is motivated by an analogy with the atmosphere of the Earth, where the temperature gradient becomes positive from about 20 to 50 km. Taking an isothermal temperature gradient will conservatively mimic the presence of a stratosphere. However, it has important consequences since it allows H 2 O to be significantly present above the cloud top. In fact, above 20 km, the temperature stops decreasing, preventing condensation from occurring (the saturation vapor pressure depends only on temperature). Our assumption consequently fixes the height of the cloud deck to the point where the temperature profile is isothermal (actually, one scale height above that point). If we set this point higher, we would increase the amount of clouds hence reducing the detectable portion of atmosphere. In addition, the cloud formation would certainly take the corresponding latent heat of condensation out of the atmospheric gas, contributing, as a consequence, to cool the atmosphere at the level of the cloud layer.</p><p>We calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H j+1 , p j+1 = p j · exp −z j+1 /H j+1 , e j sat (from Eq. 5) and either e j+1 = e j · exp (z j − z j+1 )/H j+1 )</formula><p>, if the atmosphere is not saturated or e j+1 = e j+1 sat , if the atmosphere is saturated. We finally find all Y j+1 i , µ j+1 dry and C p j+1 dry and then iterate the process for all atmospheric levels.</p><p>The higher and the lower pressure levels where e = e sat indicate respectively the bottom and the top of the region where clouds are forming. We assume the cloud layer does not extend over one scale height above the top of the cloud forming region. However, we can still have e ≤ e sat higher in the atmosphere, and thus H 2 O can be present above the clouds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Chemical species</head><p>We used the program LBLABC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Meadows &amp; Crisp 1996</ref>), a line-by-line model that generates monochromatic gas absorption coefficients from molecular line lists, for each of the gases, except ozone, present in the atmosphere. The line lists are extracted from the HITRAN 2000 databank <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rothman et al. 2003</ref>). We calculated the absorption coefficients for O 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 in our wavelength range we (i.e., from 200 to 2 000 nm).</p><p>The absorption coefficients relative to these species depend on pressure and temperature. We verified that those variations do not impact significantly on the results obtained (see Sect. 4) and we decided to use the absorption coefficients calculated at the pressure and temperature of the cloud layer, i.e., 10 km in models A1, A2 &amp; A3, 30 km in models B1, B2 &amp; B3 and from 25 to 70 km in models C1 to C3. We then assumed these absorption coefficients to be constant along the z-axis. This is a fairly good approximation since molecules at that atmospheric level contribute more substantially to the transmitted spectrum than molecules at the bottom of the atmosphere. Absorption coefficients for H 2 O, CO 2 , O 3 and O 2 are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>The spectrum of O 3 is unavailable in HITRAN at wavelengths lower than 2.4 µm. However it has strong absorption in the Hartley (200-350 nm) and Chappuis (400-750 nm) bands. Thus we took the photo-absorption cross-sections, σ (in cm 2 ), from the GEISA/cross-sectional databank (Jacquinet- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Husson et al. 1999</ref>) and converted them into absorption coefficients, A (in cm 2 g −1 ), such as A = σN A /µ, where µ is the molar mass of the component.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>, the pressure and the temperature variations do not have a significant influence over the cross sections/absorption coefficients of O 3 . We therefore used the values given for p = 1 atm 3 and T = 300 K, and set them constant along the z-axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Rayleigh diffusion</head><p>Light is scattered toward short wavelengths by atmospheric molecules whose dimensions are comparable to λ. Rayleigh diffusion could be an important indicator of the most abundant atmospheric species. Molecular nitrogen, for instance, does not present any noticeable spectroscopic lines between 0.2 and 2 µm. With a transit observation, the presence of a gas without spectroscopic lines like nitrogen in the Earth atmosphere can be indirectly inferred from the wavelength-dependance of the spectrum ratio continuum. Since Rayleigh scattering cross section of CO 2 is high, Venus-like atmospheric signatures should also present an important Rayleigh scattering contribution.</p><p>We have therefore estimated these different contributions. The Rayleigh scattering cross section, σ R , can be 3 1 atm = 1 013 hPa.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">σ R (¯ ν) = 24π 3 ¯ ν 4 n 2 r(¯ ν) 2 − 1 r(¯ ν) 2 + 2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ¯ ν = 1/λ, n is the number density (cm −3 ) and r is the refractive index of the gas. The total Rayleigh scattering includes weighted contributions from N 2 , O 2 , CO 2 and H 2 O (i.e., σ R = i Y i σ Ri ), and so we need all the corresponding refractive indexes. These are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bates (1984)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sneep &amp; Ubachs (2004)</ref> for N 2 , O 2 and CO 2 . 4</p><p>The refractive index for H 2 O comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schiebener et al. (1990)</ref>. Tests have proved the different refractive indexes do not significantly change with temperature and pressure. We have therefore calculated the indexes for standard conditions (15 • C and 1013 hPa).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Refraction</head><p>Depending on the wavelength, the refraction may bring into the line of sight rays coming from different parts of the star. To quantify the importance of that effect, we calculate the maximum deviation, ∆θ, due to the wavelength dependence of the refraction index, using the formula given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Seager &amp; Sasselov (2000)</ref> and the refractive index at the surface (h = 0) between 0.2 and 2 µm. We obtain ∆θ ≈ 0.3 ′ . This represents about 1.5%, 1% and 0.5% of the angular diameter of the star (F-, G-and K-type star, respectively) as seen from the planet. We can therefore consider this effect negligible as long as there are no important variations of the stellar flux on scales lower than the surface corresponding to these numbers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Choice of test models</head><p>We chose 9 cases, divided into 3 categories: 1 R ⊕ -planets (models A1, B1 and C1), 0.5 R ⊕ -planets (A2, B2 and C2) and 2 R ⊕ -planets (A3, B3 and C3). The parameters for each model are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. For theses ranges of planetary radii, the depth of the occultation by the tested planets will differ by a factor of ∼16 at most during their transit. Notice that a better detection of the transit itself does not always imply a better detection for the atmosphere of the transiting planet. On the contrary, in some cases, the fainter the transit is, the more detectable the atmosphere will be! In any case, we naturally need to secure the detection of the planet itself before looking for an atmosphere.</p><p>The choice of studying planets with a variety of sizes gives us the possibility to explore a large range of planet characteristics, in mass, radius and density. The Earth density is 5.5 g cm −3 . A planet having the internal composition of the Earth and twice its radius would weigh ∼10 times more, while a planet half large would weigh ∼10 times less ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sotin et al. 2005</ref>). That gives densities of 6.1 and 4 g cm −3 , respectively. We thus have 3 cases, each of which can be coupled with a plausible atmosphere. We chose a N 2 /O 2 -rich atmosphere (similar to that of the Earth) for models A1, A2 and A3, and a Cytherean (i.e., Venus-like 5 ) CO 2 -rich atmosphere for models B1, B2 and B3.</p><p>Note that the atmospheric pressure profiles are scaled from the 1 R ⊕ cases (A1 and B1) to the 0.5 and 2 R ⊕ models. In doing so, we did not include any species that showed a peak of concentration in altitude, such as the O 3 layer in model A1. In fact, the O 3 peak does not depend only on the hydrostatic equilibrium, but also on the photochemical equilibrium at the tropopause of the Earth. For that reason O 3 is absent in models A2 and A3. <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. (2004)</ref> suggested the existence of 'oceanplanets', whose internal content in volatiles (H 2 O) might be as high as 50% in mass. Such planets would be much less dense than telluric ones. We are particularly interested in those ocean-planets since the lower the density of the planet is, the higher the atmosphere extends above the surface. These objects could have densities of 1.8, 2.8 and 4.1 g cm −3 for radii of 0.5, 1 and 2 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sotin et al. 2005</ref>), which are relatively small, but reasonable if compared with Titan's density (1.88 g cm −3 ). The huge quantity of water on the surface of an ocean-planet could produce a substantial amount of water vapor in their atmosphere, if the temperature is high enough. A non-negligible concentration of CO 2 might be present as well in those atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr">Ehrenreich et al. 2005b</ref>). Using this information on ocean-planets, we can simulate three extra cases, namely C1, C2 and C3 <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Choice of different stellar types</head><p>In this work, we consider planets orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ) of their parent star. Our atmospheric models are not in fact a good description for planets orbiting too close to their parent star. For instance, the heating of the atmosphere by an extremely close star could trigger effects like evaporation, invalidating the hydrostatic equilibrium we assumed (see, for instance, Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tian et al. 2005</ref>). The reduced semi-major axis a r of the orbit of all planets we have considered is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a r = a · (L ⋆ /L ⊙ ) −0.5 .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>We set a r = 1 astronomical unit (AU), so that the planet is in the HZ of its star.</p><p>Here we focus on Earth-size planets orbiting around different main sequence stars, such as K-, G-and Ftype stars, since the repartition of stellar photons in the spectrum is different from one spectral type to another. Planets in the HZ of K, G and F stars, with a r = 1 AU, should have a real semi-major axis of 0.5, 1 and 2 AU, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Signal-to-noise ratio for ideal observations</head><p>Prior to the atmospheres, we need to detect the planets themselves with a dedicated survey, as the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Catala et al. (2005)</ref>. The transmission spectroscopy we theoretically study here require the use of a large space telescope. Hence, we need to quantify the S/N of such observations to determine the detectability of the atmospheric signatures for a transiting Earth-size exoplanet. The S/N will depend on both instrumental and astrophysical parameters. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Instrumental requirements</head><p>The first relevant parameter relative to the instrumentation is the effective area of the telescope collecting mirror, S, which can be expressed as S = (ǫD) 2 π/4. The coefficient ǫ 2 accounts for the instrumental efficiency and ǫD is thus the 'effective diameter' of the mirror. Up to present, all exoplanetary atmospheric signatures have been detected by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This instrument, now no longer operative, was very versatile 6 and consequently not planned to have high efficiency. It had a throughput ǫ 2 ≈ 2% from 200 to 300 nm, and ǫ 2 ≈ 10% from 350 to 1 000 nm. As the majority of photons we are interested in is available in the range from 350 to 1 000 nm, we reasonably assume that a modern spectrograph has a mean ǫ 2 significantly greater than 10% from 200 to 2 000 nm. Present day most efficient spectrographs have ǫ 2 ≈ 25% in the visible, so it seems reasonable to imagine that next generation spectrographs, specifically designed to achieve high sensitivity observations, could have throughput of ǫ 2 ≈ 25%, or ǫ = 50%.</p><p>Another parameter linked to the instrument is the spectral resolution, R. In the following, R will be assumed to be about 200, i.e. 10 nm-wide spectral feature can be resolved.</p><p>Finally, it is legitimate to question the ability of the instrument detectors to discriminate the tenuous (∼ 10 −6 ) absorption features in the transmitted spectra of Earthsize planets. In a recent past, sodium was detected at a precision of 50 parts-per-million (ppm) on a line as thin as about 1 nm by <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref> using STIS. According to our results (see Sect. 4), some absorption features from Earth-size planet atmospheres show a ∼1 ppm dimming over ∼100 nm: the technological improvement required to fill the gap should not be unachievable. Besides, since we deal with relative measurements -the in-transit signal being compared to the out-of-transit one -there is no need to have detectors with a perfect absolute calibration. Only a highly stable response over periods of several hours is required. Nevertheless, instrumental precision remains a challenging issue whose proper assessment will require further, detailed studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Physical constraints on the observation</head><p>The number of photons detected as a function of wavelength depends on the spectral type of the star, while the total number of photons received in an exposure of duration t depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, V . The stellar spectra F V =0 ⋆ (λ) are from ρ Capricorni (F2 iv), HD 154 760 (G2 v) and HD 199 580 (K2 iv) and are taken from the Bruzual-Persson-Gunn-Stryker (BPGS) spectrophotometry atlas <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . The fluxes (erg cm −2 s −1 ˚ A −1 ) are given at a null apparent magnitude, so we re-scaled them The stellar type determines the radius and the mass of the star, so the transit duration (and thus the maximum time of exposure during the transit) is different depending on the star we consider. The transit duration is also a function of the semi-major axis of the planet orbit. Since we chose a constant reduced distance (a r = 1 AU) for all planetary models (see Sect. 2.5), the duration of transit depends on the stellar luminosity as well. From Zombeck (1990), we obtain the radii of F and K stars relatively to that of the Sun, respectively R F /R ⊙ ≈ 1.25 and R K /R ⊙ ≈ 0.75, the mass ratios, M F /M ⊙ ≈ 1.75 and M K /M ⊙ ≈ 0.5, and the luminosity ratios, respectively L F /L ⊙ ≈ 4 and L K /L ⊙ ≈ 0.25. Using Eq. 9, the duration of the transit is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">τ ≈ 13π 4 h · R ⋆ R ⊙ M ⋆ M ⊙ −0.5 L ⋆ L ⊙ 0.25 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where 13π/4 h is the mean transit duration of a planet at 1 AU across a G star averaged over all possible impact parameter of the transit. From Eq. 10 we obtain mean transit durations of 7.6, 10.2 and 13.6 h for K-, G-and F-type star, respectively. In the following, we set t = τ . Ideally, our observations are limited only by the stellar photon noise -the detection of sodium at a precision of ∼50 ppm in the atmosphere of HD 209 458b by <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref> was in fact limited by the stellar photon noise. However, at the low signal levels we are searching for, the intrinsic stellar noise might need to be considered as well. Stellar activity, as well as convective motions will cause variations in both intensity and color in the target stars, on a large variety of timescales. The impact of stellar micro-variability on the detectability of photometric transits has been addressed by a number of studies (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moutou et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aigrain et al., 2004</ref> -especially their <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lanza et al., 2004</ref>), all point-ing towards photometric variability levels in the range of ∼100-1 000 ppm for durations of a few days. This is to be compared to the strength and duration of the atmospheric signatures we want to look at: they are ∼1 ppm variations lasting a few hours. While indeed the different time frequency and spectral content of these signatures versus the stellar noise will hopefully allow to discriminate the two, the impact of stellar micro-variability on such faint signals is likely to be significant, and may limit the ability to detect an atmosphere in a transiting planet. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aigrain et al. (2004)</ref> suggested K stars are more adapted than G or F stars regarding to the detection of terrestrial planets versus stellar micro-variability. However, note that the observation of several transits for each planet considered will confirm the signal detected in the first transit. For instance, at a r = 1 AU around a K star, a planet has a period of ≈ 0.3 yr, allowing to schedule several transit observations within a short period of time. Finally, the usual technique to detect a spectral signature from a transit is to compare in-transit and out-of-transit observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, 2004</ref>). For all these reasons, we will assume in the following to be able to discriminate a transit signal from the stellar activity and consequently the photon-noise to be the limiting factor. Nevertheless, further and detailed analysis is certainly needed to quantify the effect of stellar micro-variability, as a function of the stellar type, but this is outside the scope of this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Spectral features of interest</head><p>Here we summarize the contributions of each atmospheric absorber to the spectrum ratio for various models. The spectral resolution of the plots presented here is 10 nm. The most prominent spectral signatures, when present, are those of O 3 and H 2 O. Carbon dioxide is hard to distinguish from H 2 O bands and/or its own Rayleigh scattering. Molecular oxygen transitions are too narrow to significantly contribute to the spectrum ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Ozone</head><p>In the spectral domain studied here, the Hartley (200-350 nm) and Chappuis (420-830 nm) bands of O 3 appear to be the best indicators of an Earth-like atmosphere. These bands are large (respectively 150 and 600 nm) and lay at the blue edge of the spectrum, where spectral features from other species are missing. There is noticeably no contamination by H 2 O, and O 2 strong transitions are narrow and could be easily separated. Ozone bands significantly emerge from Rayleigh scattering and they correspond to very strong transitions, despite the small amount of O 3 present in the model A1 atmosphere (Y O3 &lt; 10 −5 ). When present, ozone is more detectable in an atmosphere similar to model A2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Water</head><p>The signature of H 2 O is visible in a transit spectrum only if H 2 O is substantially abundant above the clouds. This is not the case for models of Earth-like atmosphere like A1, A2 and A3. On the contrary, the models of the oceanplanets (C1, C2 and C3) show a major contribution from this molecule, in the form of four large bands that dominate the red part of the spectrum (at λ &gt; ∼ 950 nm). For these three cases, H 2 O can be significantly abundant above the clouds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">Carbon dioxide</head><p>The lines of CO 2 are about as strongly emerging from the 'continuum' than the H 2 O ones, but are often overlapping with these lines. The transitions around 1 600 nm and the ones around 1 950 nm are the easiest to identify, other bands are not observable if water is present. Rayleigh scattering and photo-absorption cross sections of CO 2 are comparable at most wavelengths below 1.8 µm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>), except for a few ∼10-nm wide bands. In fact, the more CO 2 is present in the atmosphere, the more opaque the atmosphere becomes. This implies it would be impossible for an observer on the surface of Venus to see the Sun. Carbon dioxide may be more detectable farther in the infrared, hence making desirable further investigations up to 2.5 µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Molecular oxygen</head><p>Molecular oxygen does not appear in the plots: its bands at 620, 700, 760 and 1 260 nm are too thin to appear with only 10 nm resolution. Besides, its Rayleigh scattering cross section almost completely masks its absorption features (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>) so that no large bands of O 2 can be used as an indicator of its presence. However, note that the presence of O 3 indirectly indicates the presence of O 2 , as pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. (1993)</ref> and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5.">Rayleigh scattering</head><p>When Hartley and Chappuis bands of O 3 are absent (all cases but A1), the Rayleigh scattering signature is clearly visible in the blue part of the spectrum ratio. On one side it masks the presence of some transitions, like those of O 2 and some of CO 2 , but on the other side it can provide two important informations: (i) even if the spectral features cannot be distinguished because they are too thin or faint, the characteristic rising 'continuum' as λ −4 for short wavelengths is a clear indication that the planet has an atmosphere, and (ii) it indirectly indicates the presence of the most abundant species of the atmosphere, such as CO 2 and N 2 , even if N 2 shows no spectral signature in the observed domain. As a consequence, Rayleigh scattering can be considered a way to detect N 2 , provided clouds and/or aerosols do not in turn mask the Rayleigh scattering signature.</p><p>To summarize, it is possible to detect the presence of the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet thanks to the Rayleigh scattering, whatever the composition of the atmosphere is. Moreover, it is theoretically possible to discriminate between an O 2 -rich atmosphere, where O 3 is expected to be present ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Léger et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sagan et al. 1993</ref>) and a H 2 O-rich atmosphere, as the O 3 lifetime is supposed to be extremely brief in a water-rich environment. In other words, we should be able to distinguish telluric Earth-like planets with low volatile content from volatile-rich planets. On the other hand, high spectral resolution is needed to discriminate between H 2 O-rich planets and Cytherean worlds (B1, B2, B3).</p></div>

Two factors are determining the role of the star in the capabilities of detecting an exoplanet atmosphere: (i) The size R ⋆ of the star, which directly influences the S/N (see Eq. 11) and the duration of transit (Eq. 10) and (ii) the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, which influences both the duration of transit and the probability to observe the transit from Earth (see below). These factors can explain the discrepancies between the S/N values obtained for different kind of stars in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>The probability, α, that a planet transiting its parent star might be seen from the Earth is defined as α ≡ P {transit} = R ⋆ /a, with R ⋆ being the radius of the star and a the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Let us now define β to be the number of planet(s) per star, and γ to be the fraction of the sky that is considered for a transit detection survey (in other words the efficiency of surveys to find the targets). We list in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> the number of potential targets for each model. This number, N , corresponds to the number of targets detected with a 10-m telescope mirror effective size and with a S/N greater than or equal to 5. It is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">N S/N≥5, ǫD=10 m = N 0 ·α·β ·γ · S/N V =8, ǫD=10 m 5 3 , (15)</formula><p>where N 0 is about 6 000, 1 000 and 3 000 for K, G and F stars respectively, i.e. the number of stars with magnitude ≥ 8, and S/N V =8, ǫD=10 m is the expected S/N ratio computed for a given atmosphere of a planet orbiting a V = 8 star with a telescope having a mirror effective area of 10 m (this value is given in the last column of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Since no Earth-size planet has been discovered so far, we have no real estimate of β. In the following, when it is not a free parameter we consider β = 1 9 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Catala et al. (2005)</ref> propose a 30 • × 30 • survey dedicated to find planets around &lt; 11 th -magnitude stars, i.e., γ ≈ 2-3% for such a project. Let be N S/N, ǫD , the number of potential targets reaching a minimum S/N ratio for a given mirror effective size ǫD, which scales from the value calculated using Eq. 15, N S/N≥5,ǫD=10 m , in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">N S/N, ǫD = N S/N≥5, ǫD=10 m · S/N 5 −3 · ǫD 10 m 3 . (16)</formula><p>The values obtained for atmospheric detection are strongly in favor of a small, late type star. Note that this is also true for the detection of the planetary transit as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Effect of the atmospheric temperature gradient</head><p>The thick CO 2 Venus-like atmospheres (B1, B2 and B3, see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> &amp; 4) are more difficult to detect than other cases. Even if we set the top of the clouds at 10 km height, the detection remains more challenging than for model A1. That is somewhat surprising, partly because CO 2 has strong transitions, particularly in the near infrared, and partly because of the larger scale height at the surface of the planet (14.3 km for model B1, 8.8 km for model A1). As a consequence, the atmosphere in model B1 should have a larger vertical extent than in model A1. In reality, the difficulty to characterize the atmospheres of models B1, B2 and B3 is related to the temperature profiles we chose (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and 3</ref>): At 50 km of altitude, the temperature of model B1 is roughly 60 K colder than that of model A1. This model in fact benefits from the positive stratospheric temperature gradient of the Earth. Moreover, the atmosphere for model B1 (µ B1 = 43 g mol −1 ) is heavier than the one for model A1 (µ A1 = 29 g mol −1 ). Therefore, at high altitude, the scale height is larger in model A1 than in model B1 (respectively 7.6 km and 3.9 km at an altitude of 50 km).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Effect of atmospheric pressure</head><p>Note that the thickness of the atmosphere in model B1 is almost half the one in A1, despite the intense surface pressure (100 atm), which should help to increase the upper level of the atmosphere, limited by the UV photodissociation (h max ). The exponential decrease of pressure prevents, in fact, p 0 to play a key role: in order to counterbalance the effect of the negative temperature gradient, <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Actually, β = 2 in the Solar System because there are two Earth-size planets with atmospheres, namely Venus and the Earth.</p><p>the surface pressure should have been &gt; 10 6 atm to obtain absorptions similar to the case of the Earth (model A1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Effect of the planet gravity and density</head><p>The atmospheric absorption is, at a first order, proportional to H ·R P . At a given temperature and for a given atmospheric composition, the scale height H is proportional to the inverse of the gravity acceleration, g −1 , or equivalently to R 2 P /M P , where M P is the mass of the planet. As a result, the absorption is expected to be roughly inversely proportional to the bulk density of the planet, ρ P , independently of the planet size. This effect is illustrated by the following examples: models C1, C2 and C3 all benefit from very extended atmospheres, given the weak value of g in the three cases. For a planet as dense as the Earth (such that g C1 = g A1 ), the results for the N 2 /H 2 O-rich atmosphere in models C are close to the ones obtained for models A. Both models C and A, present typical spectral features. In model A1, ozone, for which the concentration peaks at the tropopause, gives a prominent signature in the blue edge of the spectral domain (the Hartley and Chappuis bands, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8, top panel)</ref>. On the contrary, the saturated atmosphere of model C1, which sustain H 2 O up to high altitudes, yields strong bands around 0.14 and 0.19 µm <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8, bottom panel)</ref>. The role played by g can be better understood by comparing model A3 or B3 (g = 24.5 m s −2 ) to model A2 or B2 (g = 3.9 m s −2 ), and model C3 (g = 14.7 m s −2 ) to model C2 (g = 2 m s −2 ). Using absorption spectroscopy, it is clear that the atmospheres of small and light planets (i.e., with low surface gravity) are easier to detect than the ones of large and dense planets (i.e., with high surface gravity).</p><p>Small and light exoplanets, however, may not be able to retain a thick atmosphere. In fact, high thermal agitation of atmospheric atoms causes particles to have a velocity in the tail of the Maxwellian distribution allowing them to escape into space (i.e., Jean's escape). It is therefore questionable if planets of the size of Titan can have a dense atmosphere at 1 AU from their star. Models A2, B2 and C2 enter that category. This problem concerns both small planets and giant exoplanet satellites.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Williams et al. (1997)</ref>, a planet having the density of Mars could retain N and O over more than 4.5 Gyr if it has a mass greater than 0.07 M ⊕ . Model planets A2 and B2 have masses of 0.1 M ⊕ and a density equivalent to that of Mars (≈4 g cm −3 ) so they would be able to retain an atmosphere (though they may not be able to have a 1 atm atmosphere, as for Mars). The ocean-planet model C2 has a mass of 0.05 M ⊕ for a density of 2.8 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> , and according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Williams et al. (1997)</ref>, its atmosphere should consequently escape. However, although at 1 AU from the star, such a planet also has a huge reservoir of volatile elements. This reservoir should help to 'refill' the escaping atmosphere.</p><p>Note that an hydrodynamically escaping atmosphere should be easier to detect than a stable one, since it can bring heavier elements into the hot upper atmosphere. This effect is illustrated by the absorptions seen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Vidal- Madjar et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, 2004</ref>) in the spectrum of HD 209 458, which originate in its transiting giant planet hydrodynamically escaping atmosphere. A model of an 'escaping ocean' is studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jura (2004)</ref>. This process would give interesting absorption signatures in the H 2 O bands from the lower atmosphere and in the signatures of the photo-dissociation products of H 2 O from the upper atmosphere (such as an absorption of Lyman α photons by the hydrogen atom). See detailed discussion in Jura (2004).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The vertical extent of the atmosphere is of extreme importance as concerns the detectability of a remote atmosphere by absorption spectroscopy. This tends to favor less dense objects, like giant exoplanet satellites (as would be an 'exo-Titan') or volatile-rich planets (as ocean-planets, theoretically possible but not observed yet). Cytherean atmospheres are the most challenging to detect. Surface parameters, such as surface pressure and temperature, are not crucial. A temperature gradient that becomes positive at few tens of kilometers height (for instance owing to photochemistry) might help the detection. Our results show that late-type stars are better for detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of planets in transit, since they are smaller, more numerous and present a better probability of being transited by a planet.</p><p>The strongest signatures of the atmosphere of a transiting Earth-size planet could be those of H 2 O (6 ppm in the case of hypothetical ocean-planets), O 3 (∼1-2 ppm) and CO 2 (1 ppm), considering our spectral study from the UV to the NIR (i.e., from 0.2 to 2 µm). The presence of an atmosphere around hundreds of hypothetical 'ocean-planets' (models C) could be detected with a 10-20 m telescope. The atmospheres of tens of giant exoplanet satellites (model A2) could be in the range of a 20-30 m instrument. A 30-40 m telescope would be required to probe Earth-like atmospheres around Earth-like planets (model A1). These numbers suppose that Earth-size planets are frequent and are efficiently detected by surveys.</p><p>Finally, planets with an extended upper atmosphere, like the ones described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jura (2004)</ref>, hosting an 'evaporating ocean', or the planets in an 'hydrodynamical blowoff state', are the natural link between the planets we have modelled here and the observed 'hot Jupiters'. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.

The spectrum ratios have been respectively shifted by the values in parenthesis so that the absorption by the 'solid disk' of the planet is 0 ppm. In the case of models with clouds, the 'solid disk' is artificially increased by the cloud layer.
