<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Report Executive Summary</head><p>Over four hundred years have passed since Galileo's first observations of the heavens fundamentally transformed humanity's understanding of the cosmos. We have learned that we live not in a static eternal universe, but in an expanding one, comprised of matter, radiation, dark matter, and dark energy, with the latter two still poorly understood. We exist not in an island universe, but instead within one of hundreds of billions of galaxies, comprised of tens of trillions of stars. We have seen that our solar system is not alone, but instead one of unknown billions of planetary systems in the Milky Way. These discoveries have emerged from a history of advances in astronomical theory, observation, and technology culminating in telescopes on the ground and in space covering every observable wavelength of light, new frontiers in gravitational wave and neutrino observations, and entire universes residing in simulations on supercomputers.</p><p>Despite all these triumphs, many basic, fundamental, and essential questions remain: Is there life elsewhere? Is our world unique? How do stars form? What are the building blocks of structure? How did our galaxy, solar system, and Earth arise and evolve? These questions demand an observatory beyond any in existence or in development to answer. They require a large aperture to capture the very faintest objects across cosmic time. They require spatial resolution high enough to separate planets from their host stars and the ability to block out the latter's blinding light. They require access to a range of wavelengths broad enough to read the atomic fingerprints of matter across all temperatures and densities. In this document, we describe such an observatory: The Large Ultraviolet / Optical / Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept. LUVOIR represents an ambitious yet feasible observatory designed to answer not only the questions astronomy presents today, but also the as of yet unknown questions of tomorrow.</p><p>LUVOIR's main features are:</p><p>• A large (15-m LUVOIR-A, 8-m LUVOIR-B), segmented aperture designed to fit in a single launch vehicle.</p><p>• Scalable, serviceable architecture design for an observatory at Earth-Sun L2.</p><p>• A total wavelength range of 100 nm-2.5 mm.</p><p>• ECLIPS: An ultra-high contrast coronagraph with an imaging camera and integral field spectrograph spanning 200-2000 nm, capable of directly observing a wide range of exoplanets and obtaining spectra of their atmospheres.</p><p>• HDI: A near-UV to near-IR imager covering 200-2500 nm, Nyquist sampled at 400 nm and diffraction limited at 500 nm, with high precision astrometry capability.</p><p>• LUMOS: A far-UV imager and far-UV + near-UV multi-resolution, multi-object spectrograph covering 100 nm-400 nm, capable of simultaneous observations of up to hundreds of sources.</p><p>• POLLUX: A UV spectropolarimeter covering 100-400 nm with high-resolution point-source spectroscopic capability. A consortium of European institutions, with leadership from the French Space Agency, is contributing this instrument concept study.</p><p>LUVOIR continues the vision of the Great Observatories as a community-driven facility with the power and capability to answer scientists' questions across the full NASA • Exploring the full diversity of exoplanets.</p><p>• Discovering and characterizing exoplanets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars across a range of ages and searching for biosignatures in their atmospheres, in a survey large enough to provide evidence for (or against) the presence of habitable planets and life.</p><p>• Remote sensing of the planets, moons, and minor bodies of the solar system. • Exploring the building blocks of galaxies both in the local universe and at their </p></div>

LUVOIR dramatically increases the sample size and diversity of exoplanets that can be studied, pushing to dozens of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.

Those capabilities also create new opportunities in remote sensing of solar system bodies. Credit: NASA / New Horizons / J. <ref type="bibr">Friedlander &amp; T. B.

With input from NASA, the aerospace industry, and commercial partners, this study has identified the technological gaps and has defined a path to realize LUVOIR. The observatory is being designed to leverage:</p><p>• Segmented mirror technologies from the ground and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) • Coronagraph development from the ground and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)</p><p>• Serviceable design heritage from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and other missions • Detector and optics technologies from multiple missions • Industry and commercial innovations in vibration isolation and launch vehicles LUVOIR's power, flexibility, and serviceability ensure that it can perform not only the "signature" science examples in this report, but also the unknown science of the future. It is an observatory to serve the astronomical community not just for the 2030s, but also for many decades to follow. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction</head><p>Humanity is defined by the drive to know about our place within the world around us. The very name homo sapiens captures what we prize in ourselves, and our never-ending quest for wisdom leads us ever further outward. The value of that quest for the betterment of our species is immeasurable. Ages-old questions and investigations earned us the revelations that the stars are Suns swirling in a vast galaxy, itself one of a myriad of islands in a boundless cosmos. Now we have crossed another threshold of discovery: there are planets around other stars. Tracing a path from the dawn of the universe to life-bearing worlds is within our grasp. The further revelations we will find on that path have long belonged to the realm of speculation-now we begin to find out if our imaginary musings are real. This monumental objective demands powerful and flexible new tools, and different ways of combining our scientific skills. We have found that the range and diversity of worlds is far greater than we imagined, yet we see planetary systems reminiscent of the solar system as well. At the moment, the vast majority of known exoplanets are "small black shadows" indirectly detected through their effect on their host stars. Our knowledge of exoplanet properties is largely limited to orbits, masses, and sizes. We have just begun to measure the atmospheric constituents of gas giant exoplanets; such studies will greatly expand in the coming years.</p><p>The next frontier is to extend these capabilities to rocky planets and find the "pale blue dots" in the solar neighborhood ( <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>.1). We can determine whether habitable, Earth-like conditions are common or rare on nearby worlds and probe them for signs of life. Concurrently, we will nurture a new discipline-comparative exoplanetology-by studying a huge range of exoplanets, thereby gaining invaluable information for placing the solar system in the broader context of planetary systems. A vital part of establishing that context is deeper understanding of the bodies in our own system.</p><p>Our drive to know goes beyond asking the question "what exists?" to "why does it exist?" and pushes us to understand the origins of all we see around us. The boundary of what we can see now stretches all the way to the dawn of the universe, but like our first steps in the study of new worlds, our vision lacks both completeness and context. We seek to understand the environments and processes that gave rise to a life-supporting cosmos, from the formation of the earliest structures and the rise of the elements essential for life as we know it, to the assembly and evolution of galaxies, to the detailed mechanisms of star and planet formation <ref type="figure">(Figure 2.</ref>2).</p><p>The boundaries of physics will be tested and stretched while exploring the birth and evolution of the cosmos.</p><p>In subsequent chapters of this report, we will delve into far greater detail on all of these scientific questions and investigations, which define the tool we need to leap forward. That is the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/ Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR), a concept for an ambitious future space telescope in the tradition of NASA's Great Observatories. LUVOIR had its genesis in the 2013 NASA Astrophysics Roadmap "Enduring Quests, Daring Visions." The current LUVOIR study builds upon telescope concepts going back decades (e.g., ATLAST, the High Definition Space Telescope) but goes far beyond them in both scientific and technical detail. LUVOIR will provide the powerful observing capabilities required to execute the revolutionary investigations we will discuss. Furthermore, LUVOIR's power, flexibility, and longevity will allow it to answer the asyet-unknown questions of the 2030s and beyond.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The worlds around us</head><p>We have long speculated about the existence of planets outside the solar system. The names of imagined worlds are familiar to us: Tatooine, Vulcan, Arrakis. Our own planetary system is largely bimodal in nature, with small rocky planets close to the Sun and massive gas giants in the cold outer reaches. Scientists naturally expected that other systems would be similar-if they existed at all. In the mid-1990s, decades of persistence and technological innovation were finally rewarded with the discovery of the first exoplanets. We have been both shocked and delighted to find that exoplanets are both common and diverse-reality far surpassed our scientific predictions. We can now look into the sky and realize that most of the stars we see harbor worlds. Soon, we will more fully reveal the character of giant planets, which will further stretch the bounds of our theories. The next steps in this quest are even more amazing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">The census of Earth-like exoplanets</head><p>Indirect planet discovery techniques, like the transit method used by NASA's Kepler Mission, have shown that small rocky planets are not rare. Kepler indicates that about 24% of sun-like stars have roughly Earth-size planets in their habitable zones ( , and references therein). These zones span the range of distances from the stars where we think rocky planets can have liquid water-an essential material for all life on Earth-on their surfaces. This revelation drives us to proceed to the next step: build the capabilities to reveal the character of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 2-4</p><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report rocky exoplanets and measure the fraction that are truly Earth-like. We need to probe rocky planet atmospheres and determine their thermal/chemical states by measuring their molecular abundances, including water vapor and other greenhouse gases. Astronomers and planetary scientists have calculated that to achieve this goal for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars, we must collect and analyze light from the planets themselves, i.e., obtain direct images and spectra (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kaltenneger &amp; Traub 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b600">, Snellen et al. 2015</ref>). But doing this for habitable planet candidates around Sun-like stars is made extremely challenging by the fact that the Earth is 10 billion times fainter than the Sun and orbits close to its host star. When viewed from an interstellar distance of 10 parsecs, the apparent separation of the Earth from the Sun is only about the width of a human hair at the distance of two football fields.</p><p>The first direct images of exoplanets have been obtained with ground-based observatories, revealing the relatively faint planets by suppressing the bright light from the central stars using coronagraph instruments <ref type="figure">(Figure 2.</ref>3). High-performance coronagraphs on future 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes (the Extremely Large Telescopes, or ELTs) may be able to study the atmospheres of rocky planets orbiting in the habitable zones of the nearest cool red dwarf stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b601">Wang et al. 2017</ref>). However, direct observations of rocky exoplanets around Sun-like stars demand the ultra-high contrast possible only with a space-based telescope coupled to a highperformance starlight suppression system (Figure 2.1).</p><p>Furthermore, measuring the frequency of Earth-like conditions requires observations of a large number of candidate exoplanets (dozens; <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.4). To find and study that many candidates, an even larger number of stars must be surveyed (hundreds). This goal of quantitatively measuring the frequency of habitable conditions on rocky worlds is a strong driver on the required space telescope size. By executing a systematic study of a large number of rocky exoplanets, we can guarantee that whatever we find will be of scientific value. In the absence of positive detections of water vapor, we would know that global-scale surface oceans are relatively rare on rocky worlds in the habitable zone. This null result would still transform our understanding of habitability as a planetary process, and further confirm the special nature of our home. On the other hand, if we find that Earth-like conditions are common on rocky worlds near our Sun, then a stunning vista of hospitable new worlds will be unveiled. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR Frequently Asked Questions</head><p>How big is LUVOIR? We are developing 2 architectures, LUVOIR-A and LUVOIR-B. LUVOIR-A has a primary mirror with a diameter of 15 meters. This size corresponds to the largest observatory that can be launched in a SLS Block 2 vehicle. LUVOIR-B has a primary mirror with a diameter of 8 meters, which is the largest observatory that can be launched in a 5-meter fairing similar to those in use today How long will LUVOIR last?</p><p>The prime mission is 5 years, which is the standard prime mission duration for large space missions, with 10 years of on-board consumables. Furthermore, LUVOIR is designed to be serviceable and upgradeable, with a lifetime goal of 25 years for non-serviceable components.</p><p>[Chapter 8]</p><p>What are LUVOIR's key science goals? This report describes a number of "signature science" programs that demand LUVOIR. Additionally, we are actively collecting community input on science with LUVOIR and have developed a number of public on-line tools to help create science programs (https://asd.gsfc. nasa.gov/luvoir/tools/).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">The search for life</head><p>The tool to achieve the exoEarth census can also probe the atmospheres of those planets for biosignature gases and find the first signs of life outside our home planet. The spectrum of the Earth contains features arising from gases of biological origin, like O 2 and methane, in addition to strong features from water vapor and greenhouse gases ( <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>.5). The Earth is the only planet we know of teeming with surface life that strongly affects the planet's atmosphere. Thus, there are good reasons to focus serious searches for life outside the solar system on exoplanets that are as much like the Earth as possible. By targeting exoplanets with sizes and orbits similar to Earth's and host stars similar to the Sun, we hope to increase our chances of finding-and recognizing-extraterrestrial life. However, it is important to understand that no one molecule (or pair of molecules) is automatically a biosignature in every context. The key is to calculate the abundances of molecules in the whole atmosphere, and then compare those abundances to the production and destruction rates predicted by physics and chemistry. To calculate the production/destruction rates, a good deal of knowledge about the atmosphere's context will be needed, including the planet's orbit and the characteristics of the host star. If the abundance of a molecule is too high, then we know the production rate is underestimated and an additional biological source is indicated. In essence, we first will try to explain the character of an atmosphere with physics and chemistry. If we fail, then we succeed at finding signs of life.</p><p>Therefore, confident life-detection has at least three fundamental requirements: 1) assess a wide range of atmospheric molecules, 2) actually measure their abundances with some precision, and 3) understand the planet's context within its system. The first requirement demands direct spectra with broad wavelength coverage from the near-UV to the near-IR. The  The LUVOIR Interim Report LUVOIR telescope and starlight suppression system can span these wavelengths of light and access the important constituents of planetary atmospheres, including water, carbon dioxide, molecular oxygen (O 2 ), ozone, and methane. The second requirement demands good quality spectra to measure abundances, which drives the required telescope and instrument sensitivity. Additional secondary signs of life, such as seasonal variations in a planet's spectral features, will increase confidence in any life-detection claim. The third requirement demands collection of a range of supporting information, including far-UV spectra of stellar activity-driven emission from the host stars. LUVOIR's great sensitivity and flexibility will enable the variety of observations needed to properly place a planet in context.</p><p>The dozens of rocky worlds LUVOIR will explore will inevitably have a range of sizes, orbits, and chemical compositions, and orbit various stars with different ages. Earth has harbored life for most of its history, but in the earlier stages, the atmosphere was very different from that of the modern Earth (e.g., low O 2 abundances). Recognizing such a planet as inhabited also demands the careful assessment of atmospheric abundances and planetary context described above. If LUVOIR confirms the habitability of rocky exoplanets, or finds signs of life, we will learn how those traits respond to different planet and star characteristics. This will turn the  habitable zone from a theoretical concept based upon a single planet to one that is empirically derived from multiple worlds, and usher in a new era of planetary science: one of comparative astrobiology. The search for life also takes place closer to home. Over the last decades, we have discovered that several moons of the outer solar system have liquid water beneath their icy surfaces. These sub-surface oceans must be heated from below, which may also provide the energy needed for life. The geysers recently observed from Enceladus and Europa <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>.6) may allow glimpses into their deep oceans. LUVOIR has an important role to play by determining the currently unknown strength and frequency of this phenomenon, through high resolution monitoring of icy moons. Such information will be a valuable partner for future spacecraft visiting these other ocean worlds to search for signs of life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">The solar system's place in the planet family</head><p>When we look at the solar system, it appears delicately balanced to produce a living world, with our largest planet-Jupiter-playing a dominant role. However, our exoplanet discoveries show that the planet formation process is robust and leads to a wide range of outcomes. How do we understand the solar system in this context? By exploring the character of many kinds of exoplanets, including types that do not exist in the solar system, like warm Jupiters, sub-Neptunes, and super-Earths ( <ref type="bibr">Figure 2.7)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">The lives of galaxies</head><p>The destinies of stars and planets are controlled by the formation and evolution of their home galaxies. These are not uniform, static assemblages. The range of galaxy masses and structures is enormous, from massive giant elliptical galaxies, to complex spirals with super-massive black holes at their centers (sometimes seen as active galactic nuclei), to tiny but massive dwarf galaxies housing only dozens of stars. Throughout their lives, galaxies interact with both their neighbors and their neighborhood. Some galaxies are born small but become the building blocks of giant spirals like our own Milky Way. Most mysteriously, we see that some galaxies are actively forming new stars, while others are undergoing a slow death as their stars age and no new ones are born. Our current understanding of this complex interplay is highly incomplete. Gas flows from the space between the galaxies (intergalactic medium), into the region around a galaxy (circumgalactic medium), then into the galaxy itself where it can become the fuel for new stars. Eventually, massive stars, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei drive material back out. Much of this cycling of matter is currently unobserved, since the gas flows are hot and tenuous. To understand the rates of star formation in galaxies, we need to measure the balance of these inward and outward flows. This demands sensitive ultraviolet spectroscopy, which can only be done from space. Galaxy mergers result in bursts of star formation as well but may also be responsible for the ultimate "death" of merged galaxies. Understanding the role this process plays in giving rise to the massive galaxies of today demands deep, high-resolution visible and near-infrared imaging of all types of galaxies ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.8) at earlier times.</p><p>Finally, stars produce essentially all the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, the materials out of which planets are built. The births and deaths of stars within galaxies enrich the universe in elements needed for life (carbon, oxygen, nitrogen) and our technology (true metals). The global enrichment of the universe is intimately tied to star formation and the cycling of matter into and out of galaxies. LUVOIR will provide</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">The far reaches of space and time</head><p>How an initially amorphous universe grew to host the diverse structures we see today is a driving question for astrophysicists. We understand that the complex interplay between normal matter and dark matter during the rapid early expansion of the universe was vital for producing a cosmos with galaxies, stars, and planets. Clusters of galaxies are strung out along dark matter webs like jewels in space <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">(Figure 2.9</ref>). But in some ways, we know very little. What is the nature of dark matter? At the moment, we roughly know what it does on the largest size scales but not what it is. Constraining the nature of dark matter requires probing scales and masses smaller than can be probed by any facility today.</p><p>Do our models of galaxy formation still work at smaller size scales? The models were built to explain the largest structures we can see today and they provide constraints on the fundamental physical parameters of the universe. Whether they can explain smaller structures is a key test that will reveal whether we have captured the physics of interactions between normal matter, dark matter, and ionizing light. LUVOIR will facilitate detailed studies of the population of ultra-faint, low mass dwarf galaxies in the furthest reaches of time and space all the way to today. These studies are enabled by visible and near-infrared imaging surveys that take advantage of LUVOIR's sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and high-precision astrometry capabilities. Its UV spectroscopic capabilities will provide a critical tool towards understanding of the emergence of structure and light from the cosmic dark ages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">The origins of stars and planets</head><p>Descending even further in size scale, stars form through the collapse of dense cores within cold clouds of interstellar gas and dust. Planets then form in rotating disks of remnant gas and dust around the newborn stars (protoplanetary disks). But the fact is we do not have comprehensive theories for either process that can explain what we see, much less predict the currently unseen. We are unable to explain the fundamental outcome of the star formation process-the initial stellar mass function (IMF), which describes how many stars of which masses are born. How the cores of interstellar clouds relate to the stars they form and how the IMF varies with time and environment are complexities that we have only begun to wrestle with. With ultraviolet/visible imaging at exquisite spatial resolution and powerful multi-object spectroscopy, LUVOIR will follow high-mass stars out to unprecedented distances, hunt for binaries down to small separations, and provide access to the lowest-mass ends of the IMF. Planet formation theories were originally built to describe the birth of the Solar System. As we learned more about protoplanetary disks by observing them in star forming regions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 2.10)</ref>, even the solar system became difficult to explain. When it comes to exoplanets, our planet formation theories did not predict and cannot explain the wide range we have already discovered. We are not able to trace the planet formation process all the way from its beginning in gas and tiny dust grains to any fully formed planet, and it is abundantly obvious that important processes are missing from our theories.</p><p>The fundamental problem is that we need better theories to explain what we see but cannot formulate those theories without information that we do not currently have. Stars and protoplanetary disks are small; currently, we can only study them in detail when they are relatively nearby. To increase the numbers we can study in different environments and thereby provide fodder for our theories, observations at higher spatial resolution are needed.</p><p>Furthermore, several key observational tests must be done in the ultraviolet. For example, massive stars are rare but play a vital role in star formation. Finding more of them requires extending our ultraviolet observing capabilities to the galaxies farther beyond the Milky Way. Ultraviolet spectroscopy is also needed to observe molecular hydrogenthe most important gas in protoplanetary disks-at the critical time when disk gas is starting to disappear and planet formation is ending. The high spatial resolution and ultraviolet capability provided by LUVOIR will be vital for advancing our theories of star and planet formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A big observatory for big goals</head><p>Each of these revolutionary science investigations demands distinct observations, but they share a common need for a large space telescope that can collect light from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. Further, that observatory must have a diverse and powerful toolkit of instruments. The Hubble Space Telescope, which has been one of the most productive scientific tools ever built, shares these characteristics. But our transformative goals demand a great leap in capability over Hubble and every other current or planned observatory. The design of LUVOIR is driven by our need for greater sensitivity, finer resolution, and higher contrast. At the same time, the design draws on a decades-long wealth of expertise and technology development garnered from several current and near-future space missions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Designing for serviceability</head><p>The LUVOIR-A science program described in this report can be achieved within a 5-year prime mission using the as-designed instruments. LUVOIR should be judged on the strength of that science, without relying on an extended mission. However, Congress has mandated that all future large space telescopes be serviceable to the extent practicable. The LUVOIR Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) has embraced this requirement, since gaining the greatest scientific return from a strategic mission with an extended development time and significant cost demands long operational lifetimes. LUVOIR's serviceability is a key part of enabling a series of "Greater Observatories" in the tradition of Hubble, Compton, Chandra, and Spitzer. Our preliminary observatory designs incorporate standardized mechanical components (e.g., valves, latches, rails) and allow replacement of many spacecraft elements (e.g., reaction wheels, gyros, batteries, solar arrays, computers). Consumables (e.g., propellant, cryogen) can be replenished and science instruments easily removed for replacement. Incorporating these features in the LUVOIR design from the outset will also result in faster and easier Integration and Test procedures on the ground before launch, advantages that will be realized regardless of whether LUVOIR is actually serviced.</p><p>We have considered the question "how will LUVOIR be serviced?" We first note that a design commitment to serviceability is not a commitment to servicing. If LUVOIR were to launch in the late 2030s, presumably the first servicing mission would be desired in the 2040s, so a decision to service would not have to be made in the near future. Whether or not LUVOIR would be serviced will depend on political and budgetary realities that are unpredictable. If history is a guide, it is doubtful that NASA's Science Mission Directorate on its own will have the</p></div>

Servicing LUVOIR will therefore have to be approached opportunistically. As an illustrative example, the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate is considering a Deep Space Gateway in cislunar space which, in principle, could be used for servicing scientific assets on-orbit. The energy required to move LUVOIR from Sun-Earth L2 to Earth-Moon L1 or L2 and back is small compared to that required for launch of the observatory. Returning the fully deployed LUVOIR to cis-lunar space for servicing by some combination of astronauts and/or robots is a technical challenge, but not an impossible task (Chapter 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Enabling LUVOIR</head><p>Revolutionary science goals require a technologically challenging observatory. The large LUVOIR apertures demanded by our sensitivity and spatial resolution goals must be segmented and deployable to fit within a launch vehicle. Fortunately, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to be launched in 2021 has paved the way in this area. Our most technically challenging observational goal is the extreme starlight suppression needed to directly observe exoplanets. There are two basic instruments to do this: coronagraphs and starshades. The latter are deemed unfeasible for telescopes as large as LUVOIR-A (details appear in Appendix E). Current coronagraphs cannot reach the contrast values needed to detect and study small exoplanets. For LUVOIR to achieve its goal of directly studying rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, coronagraph performance must be improved in several ways.</p><p>As part of addressing this challenge, NASA has embarked on several development programs for starlight suppression technology. The Segmented Coronagraph Design Study, under the leadership of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program, has demonstrated that coronagraphs can be designed for segmented, obscured apertures (a point of doubt a decade ago). The most important current effort is the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) technology demonstration program currently working to design a high-performance coronagraph coupled to a complex, obscured telescope aperture. Further, a coronagraph's performance is directly linked to stability of the wavefront of light entering it. The CGI program has made great strides in developing technologies and algorithms to stabilize the wavefront coming from the telescope (low-order wavefront sensors, deformable mirrors). The highest contrast measured to date (~10 -9 ) was demonstrated in testbeds at JPL through the CGI program (details appear in Chapter 11).</p><p>The LUVOIR coronagraph must achieve about another 1-2 orders of magnitude improvement in contrast beyond the current record. To do this, the LUVOIR observatory was designed with wavefront stability, sensing, and control in mind at all times.</p><p>Mechanical and thermal disturbances have been minimized and several layers of wavefront control implemented. As part of this mission study, we have assessed the technological maturity of each piece of the starlight suppression system; all are currently at Technology Readiness Level 3 or higher. The remaining major challenge is to show that this whole design works together as a system to provide the needed performance. In Chapter 11, we present our technology assessments and preliminary development plan.</p></div>

Here we answer a question frequently asked about the relationship between the LUVOIR and HabEx concepts. The two teams developed the text of this section together. LUVOIR and HabEx share two primary science goals: 1) studying habitability and biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets around Sun-like stars and 2) executing a broad range of general astrophysics studies. The two mission concepts are distinguished by a difference in focus. For LUVOIR, Goals 1 and 2 are on equal footing. It will be a general purpose "Great Observatory," a successor to Hubble and JWST in the 8-16 m class. HabEx will be optimized for exoplanet direct observations (Goal 1) but will also enable a range of general astrophysics. It is a more focused mission in the ~ 4 m class.</p><p>The two missions do have similar goals for exoplanet science but differ in their quantitative levels of ambition. HabEx will explore the nearest stars to "search for" signs of habitability &amp; biosignatures via direct detection of reflected light. LUVOIR will survey more stars to "constrain the frequency" of habitability and biosignatures and produce a statistically meaningful sample of temperate terrestrial planets. In sum, the two studies will provide a continuum of options for a range of futures.</p></div>

Finally, Chapter 12-"LUVOIR Cycle 1"-contains an exciting vision of what the scientific community might chose to do with LUVOIR in its first year of operations in the late 2030s. LUVOIR is an observatory not just for the science of the 2030s, a selected sample of which appears in this report, but also for decades after.

LUVOIR's exoplanet survey will be both broad and comprehensive, which will revolutionize our understanding of planetary habitability, and will provide the first estimates for the frequency of habitable conditions and life in the local Solar neighborhood <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3</ref>.1). LUVOIR's detailed study of the orbital parameters, atmospheric compositions, surface properties, and temporal variability of many rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of different stars will reveal environmental conditions for a diversity of worlds at different stages of evolution, and potentially usher in a new era of comparative astrobiology. LUVOIR will address three profound scientific questions for exoplanets:</p><p>• How common are habitable environments on worlds around other stars? • How common is life beyond the solar system? • How does life co-evolve with its exoplanetary environment?</p><p>LUVOIR's ability to measure fundamental environmental properties (e.g., atmospheric composition) for many exoplanets will help us answer the first two questions, and answering the last question will require detailed, in depth study of LUVOIR's most promising worlds to understand the interactions between the biosphere and its environment.</p><p>LUVOIR will also revolutionize the search for habitability and life closer to home, in our outer solar system. With spatial resolution comparable to flyby missions, UV capability, and its unprecedented spacebased collecting area, LUVOIR will provide sensitive global (i.e., planet-wide) imaging and spectroscopy of a diverse population of potentially habitable solar system worlds, particularly Europa and Enceladus.

LUVOIR's search for habitable worlds and life beyond the solar system will sample habitable zone planets orbiting stars of spectral type from F to M (the habitable zone is defined as that region around a star in which a rocky planet can support surface liquid water; <ref type="bibr" target="#b547">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref>). These planetary systems will be at different ages, potentially providing a window into the different stages of habitable planet evolution and possibly with dramatically different biospheres from our own planet. This rich diversity of worlds requires a mission that is versatile and capable of exploring and characterizing environments unlike the modern Earth's, that may nonetheless be habitable. To motivate and enhance the scientific footing of this search, we consider the different habitable environments known to exist throughout Earth's 4.6 billion-year history, and the significant impact that our evolving biosphere had on these environments. These different environmental conditions and dominant biospheres generated significantly different spectral features. The observable features created by life acting on its environment are called "biosignatures." By understanding the likely observable characteristics of these varied environments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kaltenegger et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rugheimer &amp; Kaltenegger 2017)</ref>, we can identify measurements needed to understand habitable exoplanet evolution. While modern Earth offers detailed, high fidelity information on a currently inhabited world, the diverse environments and biospheres of early Earth provide valuable data on "alien" globally habitable or inhabited environments.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor   </p></div>

These spectra provide context and motivation for our search strategies for a diversity of habitable worlds. The environmental conditions of the Hadean eon (before 4 billion years ago) are poorly constrained due to an extremely sparse geological record, but life on Earth may have arisen during this eon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bell et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nutman et al. 2016)</ref>. Hadean Earth may have experienced significantly higher rates of meteoric infall compared to today. Similar young exoplanets may likewise be enshrouded by thicker interplanetary dust disks produced by planetesimal destruction (exozodiacal dust).</p><p>At the onset of the Archean (4-2.5 billion years ago), the Earth likely had a flourishing anaerobic biosphere. The Sun was only about 75-80% as luminous as today, so a robust inventory of greenhouse gaseswhich likely included carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4 )-would have been required to keep Earth hospitable. There is disagreement on the level of atmospheric Archean CO 2 : estimates have ranged from approximately modern Earth-like levels to orders of magnitude more than modern Earth (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kanzaki &amp; Murakami 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Rosing et al. 2010)</ref>. Methane levels may have ranged between 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than today <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Pavlov et al. 2000)</ref>, produced by biological and geological processes. These high, biologically-mediated Archean methane levels may have occasionally triggered formation of an atmospheric organic haze (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Arney et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Zerkle et al. 2012</ref>), which could itself be considered a biosignature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Arney et al. 2018</ref>). Spectral features from CH 4 , CO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , and haze are strongly apparent in the Archean Earth spectrum <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.2)</ref>. Note high amounts of CH 4 generate spectral features that overlap with the strongest H 2 O features in the near-infrared (NIR), so disentangling these gases will likely require measurements of multiple bands and/or high signal-tonoise measurements. A dramatic difference between modern and Archean Earth is the lack of O 2 in the Archean atmosphere (and in its spectrum).</p><p>In the Proterozoic (2.5 billion years ago-541 million years ago), significant atmospheric oxygen accumulation occurred, irreversibly altering the oxidation state of the atmosphere and generating a powerful UV shield in the form of the ozone layer (O 3 can be seen in the UV part of the spectrum). It has been suggested that mid-Proterozoic oxygen levels may have been as low as 0.1% of the present atmospheric level, precluding directly detectable O 2 spectral features ( ), although O 2 might be inferred by detecting O 3 in the UV. Thus, the Proterozoic teaches us that O 2 , while present, may still be spectrally invisible. Biologically modulated season variations in O 3 may be detectable at UV wavelengths for the lower oxygen levels of the Proterozoic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Olson et al. 2018</ref>), but not for modern Earth whose higher levels of O 3 mean its UV spectral feature is saturated. Also, the presence of O 2 and oceanic sulfate may have limited mid-Proterozoic CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> to low (i.e., approximately modern) levels, diminishing methane's role as a greenhouse gas and its spectral features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Olson et al. 2016</ref>). However, other biogenic greenhouse gases that could act as biosignatures, such as N 2 O, may have been enhanced in the mid-Proterozoic due to anoxic and sulfidic waters limiting availability of metals required for the enzymatic conversion of N 2 O back to N 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Buick 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Phanerozoic or modern Earth (541 million years ago-present) has been heavily studied in the context of remote sensing and mission development studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Sagan et al. 1993</ref> Modern Earth can be used to validate and constrain models of the remote observable properties of Earth as an exoplanet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Robinson et al. , 2011</ref>, and its biosignatures and chemical disequilibria inform the search for life <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hitchcock &amp; Lovelock 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Krissansen-Totton et al. 2016a</ref>).</p><p>The co-evolution of life and its environment. Over Earth's history, life has co-evolved with its environment, and it is often impossible to separate the history of Why LUVOIR?</p><p>[Why direct imaging? / Why from space? / Why NUV-Optical-NIR? / Why so big?]</p><p>The most powerful way to characterize potentially habitable worlds is a space-based telescope with a large aperture, which can conduct direct spectroscopy of habitable planets over a broad wavelength range.</p><p>Understanding the surface and near-surface environment of a potentially habitable planet is the key to discovering whether that planet can support a liquid water ocean. Direct imaging provides a direct, and short, line of sight down through the planet's atmosphere to probe the planetary surface. Transmission spectroscopy will observe a much longer path through the planetary stratosphere and is therefore sensitive to atmospheric trace gases. However, it cannot see the planetary surface, and due to the effects of aerosols and refraction, it will have difficulty sampling the near-surface atmosphere. Transit observations are also not sensitive to planets around Sun-like stars (long orbital periods, shallow transit depths), so they do not allow us to characterize planets more similar to our own.</p><p>LUVOIR's direct imaging spectroscopy will probe deep into planetary atmospheres, potentially all the way to the surface. This will provide crucial information on near-surface physical conditions, water vapor abundance, and biosignature gases, including those that are not abundant at higher altitudes. Because LUVOIR will be observing from space, it will not have to stare through Earth's atmosphere, which contains many of the gases LUVOIR will search for. Those gases include molecular markers of habitable surface conditions (e.g., water vapor, CO 2 , CH 4 , liquid surface water) and biomarkers (e.g., O 2 , O 3 , CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , biological surface features). Absorption features of all these molecules lie in the near-UV, optical, and near-IR wavelength ranges.</p><p>Of the space-based telescopes being considered for the next decadal survey, LUVOIR has the largest collecting area and the smallest inner working angle. This will allow LUVOIR to detect and spectrally characterize a greater number of planets, and characterize a given planet in a shorter amount of observing time. The combination of tighter IWA and large collecting area will permit spectral characterization from the near-UV into the near-IR for most targets.</p><p>Observations over multiple, short time intervals will allow for time-dependent observations that can map planetary surface inhomogeneity and rotational periods. This combination of advantages means LUVOIR will provide mapping and in-depth spectroscopic characterization of a large number of rocky planets around other stars, increasing the probability that we will discover habitability and life, and improving the robustness of the interpretation of any biosignatures that we may find.</p></div>

As a result, the signs of habitability and life are occasionally the same signatures. Life has impacted its global environment in many ways. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis caused major changes to the chemical state of the planetary atmosphere and oceans, which caused the eventual rise of atmospheric oxygen ( ). This rise of oxygen created an ozone UV shield, which may have allowed life to spread from lakes and oceans (where water is an effective UV shield) onto land surfaces where it might produce detectable surface reflectance biosignatures. Earlier in Earth history, the evolution of methaneproducing microbes (methanogens) may have generated large atmospheric quantities of CH 4 , providing an important Archean greenhouse gas, in addition to possibly triggering periods of global organic haze that would have dramatically impacted the climate and spectral properties of Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Arney et al. 2016</ref>). If LUVOIR finds signs of life, it will advance our understanding of how life interacts with its host planets. Because these interactions between life and the atmosphere are complex, and can occur on diurnal, seasonal, and much longer timescales, studying them will require sampling a large number of potentially habitable exoplanets, and time-resolved high-fidelity observations over the longest possible baseline for any planets for which LUVOIR has found signs of life. LUVOIR is uniquely suited to pursue these goals. The large aperture of LUVOIR enables a survey of potentially dozens of HZ exoplanets that offers the unique and unprecedented opportunity to witness worlds with a variety of properties. This includes habitable worlds at different ages and stages of evolution, allowing us to compare nascent worlds to ones much older. LUVOIR will also allow us to compare planets around a variety of stellar spectral types, informing our understanding of how star-planet interactions shape biospheres. LUVOIR's large survey has the potential to deliver profound insights into how life emerges and survives over time, and the longer-term impact it can have on its environment. LUVOIR can search for planetary variability on diurnal and seasonal timescales, and serviceability allows for longer baseline observations (e.g., decadal timescales). This may allow LUVOIR to test hypotheses related to the response of the biosphere to time-dependent phenomena such stellar activity or insolation variations due to the planetary orbit. LUVOIR will be capable of unlocking the story of life in the cosmos, and in so doing will improve our understanding of the history of life on Earth.</p><p>We emphasize that a wide wavelength range, spanning from the near-UV (NUV) to the NIR, is needed to characterize Earth and detect signs of life during different epochs during Earth history. One of the goals of LUVOIR is to be able to detect life on Earthanalog worlds for as much of Earth history as possible. Furthermore, this is a specific example of a more generic goal, which is to detect biospheres different from Earth. This is especially important when considering the history of oxygen in our planet's atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Figure 3.3)</ref>. O 2 is regarded as the canonical biosignature of Earth, and today it can be detected at visible and NIR wavelengths. However, it was undetectable in the Archean eon, so alternative biosignatures like methane would have to be relied upon for similar anoxic exoplanets. Methane in the Archean likely produced stronger absorption bands than today and may have been detectable even at visible wavelengths ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3.2)</ref>; abundant methane is a much stronger biosignature if it can be detected together with CO 2 , which absorbs in the NIR and would indicate an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium most easily explained by biology <ref type="bibr">(Krissansen-Totton et</ref> The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

During the mid-Proterozoic, which encompasses roughly 30% of Earth's history, the NUV offers the only wavelengths (from the UV through the thermal IR) where oxygen can be detected via its photochemical byproduct O 3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schwieterman et al. 2018)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Signature science case #1: Which worlds are habitable?</head><p>Planetary habitability is the outcome of the complex interplay of processes between the planet, planetary system, and host star. Understanding which planets can be, and are, habitable, will require multiple pieces of information including the nature of the host star, a census of greenhouse gases, observed or modeled estimates of planetary surface temperature and pressure, andmost importantly-evidence of surface liquid water. LUVOIR can provide this information for multiple exoplanets. Because it is observing in reflected light, it can probe a planet's deep atmosphere and surface. LUVOIR's direct imaging observations can therefore provide better sensitivity to surface habitable conditions than is possible with upper-troposphere and stratosphereskimming transmission observations that cannot observe below even thin cloud layers.</p><p>We now know that small exoplanets with R &lt; 1.6 R Earth are most likely to indicate a rocky world (e.g., Rogers 2015) that is able to support a surface liquid water ocean. Compelling Kepler statistics indicate these small planets are common (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013)</ref>. However, a planet that exists within the HZ may not support surface liquid water due to lack of initial volatile delivery (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lissauer 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Raymond et al. 2006</ref>) or subsequent loss of atmosphere and volatiles.

In the solar system, the discovery of subsurface liquid water oceans on several icy moons has sparked a hope of finding habitable conditions in the icy moons of our cosmic backyard. LUVOIR can monitor plumes and surface features discovered on Enceladus and Europa over long temporal baselines, providing valuable information on the timing and locations of eruption activities. LUVOIR could also measure reflected sunlight in Titan's near-infrared spectral windows, which provide access to the surface and sub-haze environment. These studies will provide much needed remote sensing data on nearby worlds that can be used in tandem with spacecraft measurements to gain a holistic picture of these environments.</p></div>

Water is central to the search for life beyond Earth, and while subsurface liquid water may also provide a habitable environment (e.g., on Europa and Enceladus within the solar system), the focus on surface water for exoplanets is driven by detectability concerns. A biosphere that can readily exchange gases with the atmosphere can produce habitability markers and biosignatures that are more easily detected over interstellar distances compared to a subsurface biosphere. In addition to being a proven solvent for life for a vast diversity of metabolisms on Earth, water has many fundamental chemically favorable attributes for life <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Pohorille &amp; Pratt 2012)</ref>, and it is the most common polyatomic molecule and solvent in the universe. Earth, with its surface water ocean, is the only planet known to support life. Elsewhere in the solar system, habitable environments may also exist where liquid water flows over rock in the subsurface of Mars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ehlmann et al. 2011</ref>), and in the subsurface oceans of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Carr et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Roberts &amp; Nimmo 2008)</ref>. Clues to habitable sub-surface environments may be revealed by detailed studies of these bodies' surfaces and any outgassing, atmosphere, or plumes of ejecta.</p><p>LUVOIR's survey of exoplanets will produce the first empirical constraints on the limits of the HZ for a variety of stellar types and broaden our understanding of the processes that shape habitability. In general, Earth-like atmospheres are considered those composed of a background of N 2 , and greenhouse gases such as H 2 O and CO 2 . The failure of these principle greenhouse gases (and others, like CH 4 , N 2 O, and O 3 cf. Section 3.1) to provide a clement temperature range as a function of incident stellar radiation defines the limits of the HZ. While LUVOIR may test this classic habitable zone definition, it will also explore and test alternate modes of habitability that may be possible such as: a) worlds where dense CO 2 atmospheres may be formed by the early extreme luminosity of the host star for planets orbiting M dwarfs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meadows et al. 2018</ref>); b) planets with low water abundance (so-called Dune worlds; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Abe et al. 2011</ref>); c) planets with dense H 2 -dominated atmospheres <ref type="bibr">(Gaidos &amp; PIerrehumbert, 2013</ref> LUVOIR will observe planets in the HZs of F, G, K, and M dwarfs, potentially allowing a comparison of the evolution of habitability on planets orbiting stars with different luminosity evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baraffe et al. 1998</ref>) and activity levels. The differing extreme UV (XUV; l=10-124 nm) and UV (l &lt; 400 nm) spectra of host stars will lead to different atmospheric loss and photochemical processes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.4)</ref>, both of which affect planetary atmospheric composition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-12</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report About 90% of the LUVOIR stellar targets will be FGK stars, which may represent something more akin to the Earth-Sun system, with moderate stellar evolution. These systems represent our best chance of finding true Earth analogs to set our home world in context. FGK dwarfs, compared to M dwarfs, host HZ planets at large enough orbital separations that they can be seen outside the coronagraph inner working angle (IWA) in direct imaging for a large number of targets. The IWA measures the smallest planet-star angle at which a planet can be resolved, and it scales with l/D where D is the telescope diameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.5 shows how the IWA truncates the observable spectrum for planets orbiting a variety of stellar types. HZ planets orbiting FGK stars are less accessible to transit observations due to the long orbital periods of these worlds and small transit depths. If transits can be observed, refraction will likely inhibit observations of their lower atmospheres where water vapor is most abundant on a habitable planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b549">Misra et al. 2014a</ref>). Initial ground-based characterizations of HZ terrestrials with high-resolution spectroscopy will likely focus their observations on M dwarf targets, which offer the best planetstar contrast and best prospects for transit observations. Space-based direct imaging observatories, therefore, provide the first and best opportunity to image terrestrial planets the super-luminous pre-main sequence stellar phase , tidal locking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Heath et al. 1999</ref>), and extreme M dwarf activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Tarter et al. 2007</ref>). However, there are mechanisms that could allow for habitable conditions even in the face of these challenges: a) later migration into the habitable zone or late delivery of volatiles can mitigate the damage of the super-luminous pre-main sequence phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Morbidelli et al. 2000)</ref>; b) atmospheric circulation on tidally locked worlds can prevent atmospheric collapse on the perpetual night side and generate thick substellar cloud decks that extend the habitable zone closer to the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kopparapu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Yang et al. 2013</ref>); and c) oceans can shield marine life from the damaging radiation produced by energetic flaring ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Segura et al. 2010</ref>)-provided, of course, that the planet can retain its atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Garcia-Sage et al. 2017</ref>). LUVOIR could directly observe nontransiting exoEarth planets around the closest M dwarfs (e.g., Proxima Centauri b), and it could also observe the same transiting M dwarf planets targeted by JWST or large ground-based telescopes in a shorter complementary wavelength range for transit transmission spectroscopy. Uniquely, LUVOIR's access to the UV could test for atmospheric escape processes by detecting escaping H in transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bourrier et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ehrenreich et al. 2015</ref>). Figure 3.6 shows possible transit transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 b and e for a variety of scenarios, including habitable and non-habitable states (Lincowski et al, in prep). The "false positive O 2 " planet (green line) represents a world with abiotic photochemical O 2 (Section 3.3.2) that can be can be distinguished from truly a habitable planet by its lack of H 2 O features and through the appearance of strong (O 2 ) 2 dimer features. These are pressure-induced features that appear in atmospheres with extreme amounts of O 2 characteristic of in reflected light and characterize Earthlike worlds orbiting truly Sun-like stars.</p><p>M dwarfs. M dwarfs comprise 75% of the main sequence stars in our galaxy, so the question of whether their planets can be habitable is critical to understanding the distribution of life in our galaxy. While M dwarf habitable planets are on close-in orbits around their dim stars, LUVOIR's large aperture will provide an IWA that allows direct observations of planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs, and they will comprise about 10% of the stars LUVOIR will survey. LUVOIR can also conduct transit transmission observations of M dwarfs in a wavelength range complementary to JWST, but direct imaging of M dwarf HZ planets will be the most effective way of detecting water vapor in their deep atmospheres. For HZ terrestrial planets, measurement of deep atmosphere water vapor will likely elude transmission spectroscopy measurements of the handful of M dwarf targets that JWST will observe, as transmission probes higher stratospheric altitudes with much lower water abundances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meadows et al. 2018;</ref>). However, recent work suggests that "habitable moist greenhouse" states with wet stratospheres are possible for slowly rotating planets with thick substellar cloud decks that cool the surface environment. High altitude water can still be lost to space, but if loss occurs slowly, this may result in a novel type of habitable state with observable stratospheric water vapor in transit observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b412">Fujii et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kopparapu et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Although F, G, and K stars may harbor habitable planets with histories and characteristics more like Earth's, M dwarf planets provide a fascinating complement from a habitability standpoint as they likely undergo a significantly different evolutionary sequence compared to planets orbiting F, G and K stars. This different evolution can include possible extreme water loss during Atmospheric composition of habitable worlds. To comprehensively characterize the atmosphere of a detected planet in reflected light, the presence or absence of as many gases of interest as possible must be constrained. It is also important to measure the continuum flux level and slope set by Rayleigh and cloud/haze scattering. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table   3</ref>.1 summarizes several gases of interest, and the wavelengths at which they absorb.</p><p>In practice, observations out to only ~1.8 mm will be obtainable for most Earth-like targets, because thermal radiation from the warm telescope mirror (270 K) swamps the planet signal at longer wavelengths; LUVOIR is not a cryogenic telescope to prevent UVabsorbent contamination from condensing on the mirrors (see Appendix D). For a modern Earth-like or early-Earth-like HZ terrestrial planet, at wavelengths from 0.2-1.8 mm, trace gas absorption will be primarily from important greenhouse gases H 2 O and CH 4 . Absorption from CO 2 , NH 3 , O 3 , O 2 , CO, and O 4 also occurs in this wavelength range <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">(Table 3</ref>.1) and can be used to characterize diverse terrestrial planet atmospheres, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.6. LUVOIR could observe planets transiting M dwarfs in the UV-Visible-NIR, complementing longer wavelength observations of these same worlds with JWST and groundbased telescopes. Shown here are possible transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 b and TRAPPIST-1 e for several atmospheric scenarios, including habitable and non-habitable states. Non-habitable states include a planet with "false positive" O 2 produced by abiotic photochemical processes and a Venus-analog. Also included is an Earth analog for TRAPPIST-1 e. Credit: A.

The longer the wavelength range and the larger number of absorption bands that can be detected, the greater the fidelity with which atmospheric composition can be discerned. Detecting multiple features improves our confidence in the unique detection of a specific gas by ruling out similar, overlapping absorption features produced by different gases. For example, CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and H 2 O have several overlapping absorption features at visible and nearinfrared wavelengths, including near 1.1 and 1.4 mm, which could be confused in spectra of low to moderate resolution. LUVOIR's NIR channel can obtain spectra at R=200 to help break this degeneracy (it can also obtain spectra at R=70). However, in this example, water can be identified cleanly near 0.94 mm, and CH 4 cleanly near 1.7 mm (also near 1 mm at Archean-like abundances), allowing the degeneracy to be broken, and improving model fitting and retrieval for both gases. The smaller 8-m aperture (LUVOIR-B) will reduce the number of planets that this full wavelength range can be obtained for, but the study of the 8-m architecture, and its final design, are not completed. We will ensure that our major science questions can still be addressed with LUVOIR-B and will discuss this in detail in our Final Report. Atmospheric composition and pressure affects habitability, as the stability of surface liquid water depends on both surface temperature and pressure from the overlying atmosphere. Both will be challenging to constrain. A Rayleigh scattering slope, or the detection of dimer (i.e., a molecular complex consisting of two identical molecules linked together) or pressure-induced absorption features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b550">Misra et al. 2014b</ref>), could allow measurements of atmospheric pressure, at least to the lowest observable atmospheric layer. The lowest observable layer may not be the surface due to cloud cover, scattering aerosols, or molecular opacity. Detection of Rayleigh scattering requires observations at visible wavelengths and does not place strict requirements on spectral resolution. It will not be possible to measure temperatures directly in the absence of planetary thermal radiation (although thermal detection of exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars using ground-based observations with ELTs could provide excellent complementary information on planetary temperature; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Quanz et al. 2015</ref>). However, it may be possible to constrain temperature, and also habitability, by retrieving a water vapor profile consistent with condensation (i.e., a condensation </p></div>

Constraints on the water vapor profile could be obtained by observing water bands at different wavelengths, which sense different depths in the atmospheric column.</p><p>Water bands between 0.6 and 1 mm probe the near-surface environment, while NIR water bands at 1.15 and 1.4 μm sense the middle and upper troposphere.</p><p>Other atmospheric features. A wide spectral range permits discovery of unexpected atmospheric absorbers and provides a longer lever arm to constrain cloud particle sizes and composition through Mie scattering effects. Blue and UV wavelengths are particularly important for observing these effects. Observations of exoplanets may reveal the presence of hydrocarbon, sulfuric acid or water vapor hazes in terrestrial atmospheres, especially at UV-visible wavelengths (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Arney et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hu et al. 2013</ref>; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.2). Spectral estimates of the composition, particle size, and optical depth of the planetary aerosols could also constrain the albedo of the planet (whether it is more likely to be reflective, or dark), helping to improve the inherent size-albedo degeneracy for directly imaged, non-transiting planets. Spectral features or scattering slopes of volcanically-generated species such as CO 2 , H 2 S, SO 2 , or H 2 SO 4 aerosols, especially if these vary on monthly or yearly timescales, could indicate active volcanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hu et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kaltenegger &amp; Sasselov 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Misra et al. 2015</ref>).

Elemental sulfur (S 8 ) particles, produced by photochemical reactions involving volcanic gases such as H 2 S, can produce broad absorption features at l &lt; 0.5 mm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hu et al. 2013</ref>). H 2 S and SO 2 could be detected in the UV at wavelengths &lt; 0.3 mm. Some gases, which are highly soluble in water like SO 2 , could also serve as desiccation markers, hinting at a lack of a significant surface ocean.</p><p>Direct detection of liquid surface water. While gas phase water may be detected through its atmospheric spectral features, direct detection of surface liquid water may also be possible for a subset of the most observable planets through detection of specular reflectance from liquid water oceans (the "glint" effect). This phase-dependent phenomenon can be sought in either reflection or polarization. These observations are best made in the near-infrared where the relative lack of Rayleigh scattering enhances the detectability of the planetary surface and the glint phenomenon ( ). Ocean glint could be detected with photometric observations at continuum wavelengths (i.e., between strong atmospheric absorption bands), and especially those near 0.8-0.9, 1.0-1.05, and 1.3 mm; , at multiple planetary phases between quadrature and crescent. Near-infrared observations also minimize glint false positive signatures from polar ice ( ) which is less reflective at longer wavelengths. For an Earth-twin, clouds and hazes may make the polarization signature from surface oceans challenging to detect ( ), and the reflective glint signal may prove the best option for the direct detection of surface liquid water. For Earth, glint is most pronounced near a star-planet-observer (phase) angle of 150°, where a glinting planet would be nearly twice as bright as a non-glinting planet. The ability to measure planetary phase functions at such close planet-star separations will depend on the IWA of the high-contrast field-of-view and cannot be achieved for planetary systems with inclinations below about 60 degrees. An IWA of 2 l/D in the NIR channel allows glint detection in the 1.33 mm continuum out to </p></div>

While dozens of moons have or have had oceans, a few special cases are considered the best targets in the search for life and prebiotic conditions: Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. These moons represent end members of a different kind of habitable world from the terrestrial planet: worlds whose icy surfaces, deep oceans, and interactions of endogenic and exogenic energy sources give rise to the physical and geochemical processes that might create and maintain life. LUVOIR will conduct game-changing science for the solar system's ocean worlds, via multi-epoch imaging at high spatial resolution (~25 km resolution at 500 nm for Jupiter at opposition for LUVOIR-A, comparable to imaging with the Juno spacecraft) and sensitive spatially resolved spectroscopy at UV through NIR wavelengths. For solar system icy ocean worlds, the question is not whether these oceans exist, but rather: "how may we study them?" and "how do these potentially habitable systems operate?" Europa orbits Jupiter between Io and Ganymede in a Laplace resonance, and it has maintained geologic activity over the lifetime of the solar system as a result of early accretional heat, radiogenic activity, and for at least the past 2.5 billion years, immense tidal heating from Jupiter. Europa's surface is churned over by tectonic and resurfacing processes and displays so few craters that it can only be constrained to an age of 40-90 Myr <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.7)</ref>.

With the planned spatial resolution and collecting power of LUVOIR-A, emission from individual plumes could be resolved in FUV spectroscopic imaging observations with the LUMOS instrument ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.8). Such observations would constrain plume frequency, dynamics, and plume-magnetosphere interactions. ELT ground-based observatories will be able to perform complementary NIR studies, yet strong attenuation of the water signatures in the infrared due to telluric opacities and not having access to the UV will severely hinder the sensitivities obtained using these facilities. On Enceladus, plumes are known to erupt near the south pole from the "Tiger Stripes" region ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3.7)</ref>. The mass of the ejected material varies following a diurnal cycle ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedman et al. 2013)</ref>, responding to openings and closings of the fissures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nimmo et al. 2014</ref>).

Precisely estimating the expected exoplanet science yield necessitates modeling the execution of such a mission, which in turn requires constraints on several key astrophysical parameters as well as a high-fidelity simulator of exoplanet direct observation missions. A decade ago, such modeling was not possible. Now, the Kepler Mission has constrained the frequency of Earth-sized potentially habitable planets around Sun-like stars, the Keck Interferometer Nuller and the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer have constrained the presence of warm dust around nearby stars, and mission simulators have advanced dramatically.</p><p>Here we describe an observational procedure to find habitable exoplanet candidates, then establish whether they may in fact be habitable (i.e., have signs of water). For planets that remain promising for habitability and life, the steps for characterization continue in Section 3.4. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.10 shows a graphical summary of the key questions and the observational means of answering them.

Once LUVOIR obtains an image of a potential exoplanet system, metrics are needed to distinguish planets from background stars, galaxies, brown dwarfs, and other confusion sources <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3.11)</ref>. A combination of methods could be used to counter background confusion. Multi-epoch observations will reveal targets with the same proper motion as the parent star, an excellent metric for source confusion discrimination.</p></div>

A useful wavelength range for initial habitability assessment (i.e., the search for atmospheric water vapor) is 0.87-1.05 mm for two reasons. First, this channel is less likely to be cut off by inner working angle constraints compared to longer wavelength water features. Second, the 0.94 mm H 2 O feature is accessible, as is the 1.0 mm CH 4 feature, which could provide evidence of an atmosphere rich in CH 4 (e.g., an Archean Earth analog or a Jupiter analog). The H 2 O and CH 4 features do not overlap significantly in this wavelength range, which will remove possible degeneracies for the type of planet under observation. The H 2 O band at 1.12 mm, although stronger, overlaps closely with the 1.1 mm CH 4 feature, leading to potential misinterpretation of planets with abundant CH 4 but no water.</p></div>

Thus, LUVOIR should be able to detect at least a small number of true "Earths"-or discover that habitable conditions on planets in their stars' habitable zones are rare. Following the detection of habitable planet candidates (i.e., a positive water vapor detection), we will continue to characterize the rest of the spectrum following the strategy in Section 3.4.</p><p>While searching for and characterizing exoEarth candidates, LUVOIR will detect dozens of other planets, from hot rocky worlds to cold gaseous planets.

The latter was estimated by assuming that planets are randomly assigned to stars, such that multiplicity is governed by a Poisson distribution, and that each observation represents an independent event with probability of success given by that observation's completeness. Error bars do not include uncertainty in the median exozodi level, any uncertainties in mission performance parameters, or uncertainty in observational efficiency.</p></div>

The role of precursor/follow-up knowledge for exoplanet direct imaging. Counter-intuitively, precursor knowledge of the host stars and orbits of exoEarth candidates does not greatly increase the total number of such planets discovered and characterized, in the case where a direct observation mission is target-limited rather than time-limited. This is the situation for both LUVOIR observatory concepts, A and B. However, such precursor knowledge is of great value for increasing the observing efficiency of exoplanet direct observation missions. A full explanation of this issue will be provided in Stark et al., in preparation. Here we summarize the main conclusions about exoplanet precursor and supplemental studies for future missions like LUVOIR and HabEx.</p><p>1) Orbit determination is required to quantify the energy fluxes incident on an exoplanet from its host star. This is particularly necessary to show that an exoplanet is located in its star's HZ. If not done in advance of direct observations, then it should be done concurrently.</p><p>2) Mass measurements are highly desirable in order to understand an exoplanet's bulk properties and to constrain the effects of surface gravity on the observed atmospheric spectrum. This information could be obtained either through precursor, concurrent, or follow-up work. 3) Precursor observations that identify stars with detectable exoplanets (especially those in the HZ), and which develop orbital ephemerides sufficient to predict when the targets could be best observed, are desirable for mission planning. This information could reduce the mission resources (e.g., integration time) devoted to exoplanet searches and thus save them for other uses.</p><p>4) The number of HZs (or ice lines) accessible to a given imaging mission architecture is a 1:1 function of the inner working angle of that architecture. When the mission has sufficient observing resources to study all the exoplanets of interest outside its design IWA, it is target-limited and the effect of prior knowledge on mission yield is small. When there are more accessible targets outside the IWA than mission resources to study them, the effect of prior knowledge on mission yield may be substantial.</p><p>5) The primary targets of direct observation missions are stars with HZs outside the design IWA. Precursor knowledge showing the absence of a HZ planet may be used to de-prioritize certain target stars. However, a target's value to comparative planetology and planet formation studies should be taken into account before excluding it from observation.</p><p>The scope of the observing program(s) required to address Items 1-3 depends on whether these measurements are done prior to a mission, concurrently, or afterwards. Precursor observations would need to survey all primary targets accessible to the mission design, whereas concurrent or follow-up observations would only need to study the subset of stars with planets of interest. Exoplanet orbits may be determined in advance with ground-based radial velocity instruments or concurrently from a series of exoplanet direct imaging observations with LUVOIR/HabEx. Either ground-based radial velocity instruments or a dedicated space astrometry mission could make exoplanet mass measurements. It may also be possible to make the necessary mass measurements by equipping the direct imaging mission with the appropriate astrometric or radial velocity instrument. A dedicated astrometry mission would likely be the most expensive option to fulfill Items 1-3, while ground-based radial velocity would likely be the least expensive (with other options falling in between). However, a factor of 5-10 improvement in radial velocity measurement accuracy on Sun-like stars will be needed before this method, either from ground or space, could measure the masses of rocky exoplanets. system by characterizing the surfaces and atmospheres of a large sample of terrestrial planets in the HZ and searching for signs of life ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3.14)</ref>.

Not all features produced by life will be detectable; LUVOIR will only be able to detect the subset of biosignatures that produce absorption features in its wavelength range. In addition to detecting potential biosignatures, it is important to gather additional information so that biosignatures can be interpreted in the context of the whole planetary and stellar environment, a process that can help rule out abiotic processes called "false positives" that can mimic biosignatures. Biosignature assessment is then completed with a search for other corroborating contextual signs of habitability and life. Detection and interpretation of biosignatures and environmental features requires highcontrast, high sensitivity, moderate resolution spectroscopy, and a broad wavelength range to detect multiple spectral features from both potential biosignatures and telltale false positive indicators. A large mirror enables a wider wavelength range to be obtained for any given IWA, and the IWA (not the OWA) is what limits the wavelength range that can be observed for most habitable zone planets at distances accessible to LUVOIR. LUVOIR's survey of possibly dozens of nearby exoEarths offers the best chance in the coming decades to answer at long last whether we are alone in the universe, and to place Earth's biosphere in context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">The search for biosignatures</head><p>There are several target biosignatures to be sought, and also signs of disequilibrium chemistry that may allow us to constrain surface fluxes of gases that are unlikely to be produced by abiotic planetary processes. Absorption features from biosignatures and biosignature false positive discriminators are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 3</ref>.2. Key environmental characteristics to be sought for interpretation of biosignatures include planetary mass/size/ density, atmospheric mass and composition, the nature of the planetary surface, and stellar characteristics including spectral type, UV activity, and age. While the specific target gases identified for Earth <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 3.</ref>2) will be searched for, a more generic search for biosignatures is to determine fluxes (i.e., flow rates) of gases into the environment and constrain sources and sinks for those gases. This can be done by searching for environmental characteristics that are out-of-equilibrium, implying a constant replenishment of a gas against chemical or The LUVOIR Interim Report photochemical destruction. For instance, O 2 is out of kinetic equilibrium with CH 4 on Earth, implying significant surface fluxes for these gases that cannot readily be explained by abiotic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Etiope &amp; Sherwood Lollar 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hitchcock &amp; Lovelock 1967)</ref>. If no other (abiotic) plausible explanation can be found, the gases in question could represent unexpected biological processes and should be explored further. Below we describe specific target biosignature gases. Oxygen (O 2 ). The highest priority biosignature gas is molecular oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Meadows 2017)</ref>. O 2 is the byproduct of oxygenic photosynthesis, currently the dominant metabolism on our planet and possibly the most productive metabolism for any planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kiang et al. 2007b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kiang et al. , 2007a</ref>. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses cosmically abundant water, atmospheric CO 2 , and sunlight to create biomass and power life. Oxygen is unusual for biogenic products in having its strongest features in the visible and near-infrared. Because its high abundance results in even mixing throughout the atmospheric column, it produces strong spectral features even above a planet-wide cloud deck. Oxygen (or its photochemical byproduct ozone) may have been detectable in Earth's spectrum since the Proterozoic period (2.5 billion years ago-541 million years ago; <ref type="bibr">Segura et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kaltenegger et al. 2007)</ref>, although recent geochemical results may indicate a significant rise in O 2 as recently as 0.8 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Planavsky et al. 2014</ref>). Although the photochemical destruction of H 2 O and CO 2 may generate abiotic O 2 , along with telltale spectral signatures of these processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Meadows 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 3.3.2)</ref>, discrimination between abiotic and biological sources of O 2 can also hinge on its production rate and the nature of O 2 sinks in the environment. Consequently, constraints on atmospheric and surface composition are required to determine if the biosignature gas has the measured concentration because there is a large surface flux of the gas in an environment that has strong sinks for it, or if there is a weaker, possibly abiotic source of the O 2 in an environment with fewer sinks.</p><p>Ozone <ref type="bibr">(O 3</ref> ). Ozone is a photochemical byproduct of O 2 . Because it produces UV spectral features that are detectable at low O 2 levels that render O 2 itself spectrally invisible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2014</ref>), it can be used to infer atmospheres with low (e.g., low Proterozoic-like) oxygen concentrations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.2)</ref>. As a photochemically produced gas, its production rate also depends on the UV spectrum of the host star in addition to the amount of O 2 in the atmosphere. The very strong O 3 Hartley-Huggins band can be detected between 0.2-0.35 mm.</p><p>In atmospheres with low oxygen levels, O 3 concentrations are highly responsive to changes in O 2 levels. Over the course of a planet's orbit, changes in seasonallydependent biological O 2 production would induce changes to strength of the UV ozone spectral band as a type of temporal biosignature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Olson et al. 2018</ref>). The weaker Chappuis band extends between 0.4-0.7 mm and is prominent in the spectrum of modern Earth that has abundant O 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Krissansen- Totton et al. 2016b</ref>).</p><p>Methane (CH 4 ). Methane can be produced by biological and geological processes, with biological processes dominating on Earth. The ratio of biological to abiotic production rates on Earth is possibly close to 65:1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Etiope &amp; Sherwood-Lollar 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">IPCC 2007)</ref>. Methanogenesis is a simple anaerobic metabolism that produces CH 4 from CO 2 and H 2 , and is primordial on Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Ueno et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Woese &amp; Fox 1977)</ref>. Almost all abiotic mechanisms that produce CH 4 on an Earthlike planet involve waterrock reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Etiope &amp; Sherwood-Lollar 2013)</ref>, and so methane in an atmosphere can also indicate habitability by implying the existence of liquid water. Methane's 1.4 and 1.7 mm bands are weakly detectable at modern CH 4 concentrations, and it has other shorter wavelength bands that are possibly detectable at higher Archean-like (e.g., ~0.1% of the atmosphere; 4-2.5 billion years ago) concentrations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.2)</ref>. CH 4 also shows strong bands between 0.8-1.4 mm for a modern Earth-like planet orbiting M dwarf stars like Proxima Centauri b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meadows et al. 2018)</ref>, and possibly also for planets orbiting later K dwarfs (Arney et al. in prep.) due to the longer photochemical lifetime of methane around these types of stars. Interpretation of methane as a biosignature, even more so than oxygen, hinges on understanding its sources and sinks, which will require thorough characterization of the environment coupled to modeling. Large methane fluxes may imply biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Guzmán-Marmolejo et al. 2013</ref>). Simultaneous detection of CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and O 2 will strengthen the biosignature kinetic disequilibrium argument. For anoxic planets, simultaneous detection of abundant CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and CO 2 (i.e., CH 4 mixing ratios &gt; 10 -3 ) indicates an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, and therefore a potential biosignature <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O). Nitrous oxide is produced by life, and it may have been present in large quantities during parts of the Proterozoic eon <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Buick 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Roberson et al. 2011</ref>). Known abiotic sources are minor, and include lightning and reactions involving dissolved nitrates in hypersaline ponds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Samarkin et al. 2010</ref>). Nitrous oxide's strongest bands occur longward of the LUVOIR wavelength range; other bands exist between 1.4 and 2 mm, but these bands are weak and tend to overlap with other gases that are likely to be present (such as H 2 O and CO 2 ) and would therefore require either very high abundances, or high signal-to-noise data to recover.</p><p>Other potential biosignatures. To increase the chances of detecting life, especially given the likely diversity of terrestrial planetary environments and considering the varied dominant life forms throughout our own planet's history, other biological impacts on planetary environments should be sought in the UV-visible-NIR wavelength range. These may include atmospheric disequilibria, hazes, surface reflectivity, and temporal variations in atmospheric composition or surface albedo due to life processes.</p><p>Hazes. Hazes are photochemically produced particles. Organic haze produces a strong, broadband UV-blue absorption feature. Organic haze is generated primarily via the photolysis of CH 4 , but can only form in the presence of Earth-like CO 2 amounts LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

Additionally, in the presence of other methyl-bearing biological gases such as dimethyl sulfide (C 2 H 6 S) and methanethiol (CH 3 SH), organic haze can form at a lower CH 4 /CO 2 ratio than for atmospheres where the methyl groups are solely sourced from CH 4 , strengthening the interpretation of biological involvement. Similarly, the formation of sulfur aerosols such as S 8 (which produces a blue-UV absorption feature akin to organic haze) is impacted by the H 2 S/SO 2 ratio ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hu et al. 2013</ref>), and H 2 S is produced by biological and geological processes. Constraints on the H 2 S flux required to produce an S 8 haze in a given atmosphere may suggest the involvement of biology if high production levels are inferred. Surface reflectivity. Leaf structure produces a steep increase in reflectivity near 0.8 mm known as the "red edge" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gates et al. 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Seager et al. 2005</ref>), which produces a &lt;10% modulation in Earth's disk-integrated brightness at quadrature. Other biological pigments can also produce strong reflectivity signatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hegde et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Schwieterman et al. 2015</ref>). Reflectance edges, which are discontinuities in planetary reflectance as a function of wavelength, could occur through the visible and NIR, depending on the pigmented and/or photosynthetic organism producing the signature. Unexpected reflectance signatures that do not match abiotic compounds could therefore suggest life.</p><p>Temporal changes. On Earth, life produces seasonal changes in vegetation coverage and albedo, and periodic changes in gas abundances. CO 2 concentrations change seasonally (~10 ppm) due to changes in temperature and sunlight intensity, which modulate photosynthetic drawdown of CO 2 in the spring and summer, and its release back to the atmosphere with vegetation decomposition in autumn and winter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Keeling et al. 1976</ref>). Methane also changes seasonally by ~10-20 ppm. At low O 2 levels, seasonal O 2 variations might be discerned from variability in O 3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Olson et al. 2018</ref>). Seasonal variations like these could also be sought in exoplanet spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Meadows 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schweiterman et al. 2017</ref>), but would require very high precision, high signal-tonoise spectral data to detect changes on this Earth-like scale, as well as observations at multiple points during the planet's orbit to capture any seasonal variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">False positives for life</head><p>Any claims of evidence of life beyond Earth will be met with appropriate scrutiny from the scientific community. Attempts will be made to determine ways in which the claimed evidence for life could be produced without invoking extraterrestrial biology. The exoplanet astrobiology community has spent considerable effort simulating ways in which non-biological processes could mimic proposed exoplanet biosignatures, in particular atmospheric O 2 and O 3 . These efforts have identified multiple such "false positives" for biologically produced O 2 and O 3 , as well as the observations required to discriminate between them and the "true positives" associated with global biological O 2 production (see Meadows 2017 for a review).</p><p>All of the known abiotic O 2 and O 3 generation mechanisms rely on photolysis of water vapor or CO 2 and a dramatic shift in the redox state of the planet's atmosphere. These changes to the bulk atmospheric composition could be driven by H loss caused by photolysis of high-altitude H 2 O on planets without a water "cold trap" <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Wordsworth &amp; Pierrehumbert 2014)</ref> or by massive H loss from the planet as a result of high stellar luminosity early in the star/planet history during the pre-main sequence phase  <ref type="bibr">(CH 4</ref> ) in the atmosphere and are orbiting F-or active M-type stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Harman et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The most direct ways to rule out all of the false positives for biological O 2 production within LUVOIR's wavelength range are to 1) constrain the total abundance and atmospheric pressure of O 2 to rule out the ocean loss scenario ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Schwieterman et al. 2016</ref>) and 2) constrain the atmospheric redox state by detecting the presence of H-containing species in the atmosphere, specifically H 2 O and CH 4 . The detection of significant quantities of H 2 O would indicate an atmosphere with at least some H atoms and would make many of the abiotic O 2 accumulation scenarios unlikely. The detection of CH 4 would indicate substantial atmospheric H, a significant flux of reduced gases to the atmosphere, rapid chemical destruction of O 2 and O 3 , and therefore kinetic disequilibrium, which is thought to be one of the strongest remotely detectable biosignatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hitchcock &amp; Lovelock, 1967)</ref>.</p><p>In some circumstances, detection of CH 4 together with O 2 may be difficult. The detection of modern-day Earth's CH 4 concentrations will be challenging if it is not possible to access wavelengths longer than 1.5 mm due to IWA constraints. Other host stars, such as M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rugheimer &amp; Kaltenegger 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Segura et al. 2005</ref>) and late K dwarfs (Arney et al. in prep), may increase detectability of planetary CH 4 and O 2 simultaneously at wavelengths shorter than 1.5 mm, due to the longer photochemical lifetime of CH 4 around these stars. For situations where O 2 and CH 4 cannot be accessed simultaneously, the different mechanisms for generating O 2 and O 3 abiotically would each have to each be ruled out individually.</p><p>To rule out all known abiotic O 2 /O 3 generation processes, LUVOIR will:</p><p>1. Search for the presence of other O-bearing molecules in the atmosphere (e.g., CO 2 , SO 2 ) to estimate the potential for these gases to be photolyzed and generate O 3 abiotically <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3</ref>.15).</p><p>2. Measure the spectral properties of the star in the ultraviolet to understand the energy available to photolyze O-bearing gases and drive H escape.</p><p>3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Search for spectral features associated</head><p>with water and water clouds, to determine if the planet has a cold trap that would prevent H-loss associated with high stratospheric water vapor content. This combination of measurements will be able to identify or rule out all of the known false positive mechanisms by detecting observable features of these processes and estimating the efficiency with which they could lead to O 2 and O 3 accumulation.</p><p>The other way to strengthen a potential biosignature is to identify independent, secondary features from life. These will be particularly strong if they are associated with the same biological process as the first biosignature. For example, the O 2 and O 3 in Earth's atmosphere come from oxygenic photosynthesis. LUVOIR could also detect the seasonal drawdown and release of CO 2 , and/or surface reflectance features like the vegetation red edge and pigments, both of which are associated with organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis. No abiotic spectral mimic is known to exist for Earth's vegetation red edge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Schwieterman et al. 2017</ref>). However, this "edge feature" may exist at other wavelengths on exoplanets, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.15. A planet with detectable ozone but no life.

Such a world could be mistaken for an inhabited Proterozoic Earth-like planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.2)</ref>. However, the strong CO 2 features present in this spectrum suggest the abiotic nature of the oxygen, as a CO 2 -rich atmosphere has a high likelihood of generating oxygen through photochemistry around this type of star.

Domagal-Goldman (NASA GSFC)</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor based on the spectral properties of the stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kiang et al. 2007a</ref>), and mineral surfaces could mimic these features if they occur at other wavelengths. Cinnabar and sulfur, for example, produce steep reflectance features at 0.6 and 0.45 mm that may mimic shorter wavelength reflectance "edges" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Schwieterman et al. 2017</ref>). Any seasonal variations would also need to be distinguished from the effects of abiotic photochemistry. LUVOIR's large, in-depth survey of numerous potentially habitable exoplanets provides an additional unique pathway to increase the confidence of a detection of extraterrestrial life: the integrated confidence level that biosignatures have been detected on at least one of LUVOIR's targets will rise if the same signals are detected on multiple worlds. For example, if LUVOIR detects the simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane on one rocky world in the habitable zone, this could be explained by a transient phenomenon or by a binary planet system, with one CH 4 -rich world and one O 2 -rich world (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rein et al. 2014</ref>). Because both of these scenarios are highly unlikely, detection of multiple planets showing the simultaneous presence of O 2 and CH 4 would provide significantly stronger evidence that we are not alone in the universe than the detection of O 2 and CH 4 in a single planet.</p></div>

Characterize the star and determine planet masses. A well-characterized host star spectrum is important for understanding the characteristics of orbiting planets. In particular, the UV spectrum of the star and constraints on stellar activity will be important for understanding the potential for planetary atmospheric loss and photochemical processes.

If not available via ground-based radial velocity observations, estimates of planet masses could be obtained with astrometry using the HDI instrument on board LUVOIR.

Search for O 2 and abundant CH 4 and constrain water abundance. To constrain water abundance and search for O 2 and CH 4 , observations can be obtained over 0.675-1 mm. The presence of H 2 O will already be known from initial observations, but higher SNR follow-up will be required to constrain abundance. Key features in this spectral range include: H 2 O (0.65, 0.72, 0.82, 0.94 mm), O 2 (0.69, 0.76 mm), and CH 4 (0.79, 0.89, 1.0 mm, for high Archean-like levels).

Such features can be present in this spectral range at 0.57, 0.63, and 1.06 mm, in both our visible and NIR bandpasses. Very high CO 2 levels that might indicate abiotic photochemical O 2 generation may also be detectable through the CO 2 feature near 1.05 mm. The long wavelength side of the broad ozone Chappuis band (0.5-0.7mm) can also be seen in the visible bandpasses for planets with modern Earthlike oxygen amounts. Additional important features that could be detected in this wavelength range are H 2 O (1.12 mm), and CH 4 at high Archean-like abundances (0.6, 1.1 mm).</p><p>8. Search for blue wavelength absorbers, Rayleigh scattering, and other NIR absorbers. Next, the spectral coverage could be extended to include 0.4-0.565 mm range in the visible, and also to include the 1.1-1.32 mm range in the NIR. The short wavelengths could show signs of blue absorbers including organic haze for methane-rich atmospheres (&lt; 0.5 mm, and haze can be a biosignature), S 8 particles for planets exhibiting high levels of volcanic outgassing (0.2-0.5 mm), and the full O 3 Chappuis band. In the NIR, an indicator of high CO 2 atmospheres is its 1.21 mm band, which is critical for constraining CO 2 photolysis as a potential abiotic source of O 2 and O 3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Schwieterman et al. 2016</ref>). Additional constraints on O 2 could come from 1.27 mm band for modern O 2 levels.</p><p>9. Observe the UV and search for Earth-like CO 2 in the NIR. By extending the spectrum in the NIR to include the 1.31-1.6 mm bandpass, additional H 2 O (1.4 mm) and CH 4 (1.4 mm) features can be observed, and importantly, a CO 2 band detectable at modern Earth-like concentrations and greater is present near 1.6 mm. This CO 2 band can be used to compare to CH 4 abundances to determine whether haze or CH 4 can be interpreted as biosignatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Arney et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018</ref>).

For some atmospheres, like the Proterozoic Earth, weak O 3 may be detectable and even quantifiable in the UV because the bottom of the band is not near zero flux and could therefore be measured ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.2, middle panel). 10. Revisit: Time-dependent and multi-epoch observations. Photometry of the brightest imaged planets at timeresolved intervals of hours during a single visit can be used to search for timedependent changes in planet brightness or color which could be indicative of surface or cloud inhomogeneity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">Ford et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b409">Cowan et al. 2009</ref>). These data could either be taken as multiple photometric images (Step 2 of our characterization strategy; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 3</ref>.10), or extracted from long spectral integrations obtained for other purposes, as long as discrete time intervals in the longer integration could be retrieved at sufficient S/N. Rotational mapping and unmixing models (e.g.,  can infer the colors and geographic distribution of uniquely identifiable surfaces that contribute to the observed variability with 2-3% hourly multiband photometry spanning a single planetary rotation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b409">Cowan et al. 2009</ref>). Once a rotational period is determined, variability that deviates from this periodic signal could indicate transient phenomena such as clouds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b416">Pallé et al. 2008)</ref>. Longer time baseline observations that span a substantial portion of the orbital period will enable searches for seasonal variability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Olson et al. 2018</ref>) and the construction of more precise (two-dimensional) surface maps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b414">Kawahara and Fujii 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b413">Fujii and Kawahara 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Large aperture telescopes are essential for time-variability studies. To resolve the rotation period of the planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 3.18)</ref>, the individual integrations that comprise a time-series observation must sample at significantly shorter time intervals than the rotation period. To that end, the rotation period of Earth can be determined to within 10% for a 15-m telescope with 5% throughput.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synergies During the LUVOIR Era</head><p>In the next 5-10 years, we may be able to obtain transmission spectra of habitable zone planets orbiting M dwarfs, which are observationally favored for transmission spectroscopy due to their relatively large transit depths and frequent transits. This will constitute our first search for potential biosignatures on potentially habitable exoplanets. This search will likely continue in the LUVOIR era, and this technique may be augmented with a second generation of adaptive optics systems and ELT instrumentation. These advances also may enable ELTs to conduct direct spectroscopy measurements, albeit limited to planets in orbit around M dwarfs.</p><p>In addition to a search for signs of life, this research on M dwarf planets will provide intriguing insights into terrestrial planet evolution, as the high stellar activity and early high luminosity of their host stars create a different photochemical environment. However, this same energy source may also cause ocean loss for planets in the habitable zone (see Section 3.2.1). This presents a double-edged sword for a biosignature search, as this energy may accentuate the signals from some biosignature gases (such as CH 4 ), but also make atmospheric and ocean retention less likely.</p><p>Regardless of the result of these future observations of M dwarf habitable planets, LUVOIR will provide complementary observations on these targets. If biosignatures are detected with ELTs, LUVOIR will confirm the presence of these gases, by detecting them from space and with a complementary shorter wavelength range tied to other molecular lines. LUVOIR can observe transits of the same M dwarf planets targeted by JWST and groundbased telescopes, and it can observe the nearest M dwarf habitable zone worlds in direct imaging. And if planets around M dwarfs are found to suffer catastrophic volatile loss, LUVOIR's UV transit spectroscopy capabilities will probe the atmospheric loss process (Chapter 4).</p><p>Additionally, LUVOIR will conduct a biosignature search on a complementary set of targets, by observing terrestrial planets orbiting stars like our own Sun. Should prior searches for life prove unsuccessful, LUVOIR will expand our search for life to planets in more familiar stellar environments. And if prior searches for biosignatures prove successful, LUVOIR will expand the diversity of stellar environment for which we can find biosignatures. Either way, LUVOIR will represent a dramatic leap forward in our ability to understand how life is a function of its stellar environment.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

In both cases, LUVOIR will place the search for life inside a global context, and within an expanded understanding of planetary processes. For worlds in our solar system, LUVOIR's imaging and spectroscopic capabilities will allow global mapping of the atmospheric and mineral composition for worlds large and small. For exoplanets, LUVOIR's large aperture and wide spectral range will provide a rigorous assessment of exoplanet biosignatures as well as their global environmental contexts. This environmental context will include a search for key markers of global habitability, including signs of a hydrological cycle, and the presence of clouds and oceans. LUVOIR will conduct this search for signs of life and habitability on dozens of worlds orbiting a diversity of Sun-like (FGK) stars, representing an expansion on prior and concurrent searches for biosignatures on M-dwarf stars. Finally, LUVOIR will also complement these prior observations of potentially habitable planets around M-dwarfs with space-based observations that will expand the wavelength coverage for transit spectroscopy of these worlds.</p><p>Overall, LUVOIR will conduct observations of dozens of potentially habitable worlds around a wide variety of stars. These observations will complement many other facilities, including ground-based telescopes and orbiters/landers to solar system targets. And each of these investigations will provide scientific context for the others; what we learn from LUVOIR's observations of the solar system will influence our interpretation worlds and informs our interpretation of all types of exoplanets, thereby revealing how the processes we understand well from studies of the Earth connect with those of other planets.

By characterizing all types of planets, discovering and observing Kuiper belt objects, and observing circumstellar debris disks, the users of LUVOIR will dramatically enhance our understanding of the process of planet formation. This chapter explores some of what we can learn from the exoplanetary and planetary science LUVOIR will enable beyond the search for life. We discuss and present a few exemplary LUVOIR science cases relating to the atmospheres of non-habitable planets, planet formation, atmospheric escape, and solar system science, focusing on the value of science enabled by large sample sizes. There are of course countless additional opportunities for exoplanet science with LUVOIR. Many such additional investigations are comprehensively documented in the ExoPAG Science Analysis Group 15 report "Science Questions for Direct Imaging Missions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Apai et al. 2017)</ref>, which is an excellent reference for understanding the exciting diversity of exoplanet science beyond the search for habitable worlds. Some additional exoplanet science cases, including transit observations beyond the UV, are described in Appendix A of this document.</p><p>The "Signature Science" cases discussed in this chapter represent some of the most compelling types of observing programs on a wide range of exoplanets that scientists might do with LUVOIR. As compelling as they are, they should not be taken as a complete specification LUVOIR's future potential in these areas. We have developed concrete examples to ensure that the nominal design can do this compelling science. We fully expect that the creativity of the community, empowered by the revolutionary capabilities of the observatory, will ask questions, acquire data, and solve problems beyond those discussed here-including those that we cannot envision today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Signature science case #1: Comparative atmospheres</head><p>The most compelling exoplanetary characterization discoveries so far have arisen from comparative studies of planets. By revealing the diversity of exoplanet radii, including the stunning ubiquity of sub-Neptune sized planets, as well as unexpected trends in planetary system architectures, the Kepler mission inaugurated era of systematic comparative exoplanetology. LUVOIR will build on these results by thoroughly characterizing the atmospheres of hundreds of directly imaged and transiting exoplanets, over a much wider range of conditions than exist in the solar system, vastly improving our understanding of the fundamental atmospheric processes affecting habitable and inhospitable planets alike.</p><p>There will be plenty of opportunities for such studies. The search for exoEarth candidates will uncover hundreds of other types of planets ( ). <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>.2 illustrates the yield of detected planets of various sizes and temperatures expected to be found in the LUVOIR Architecture A habitable planet search. These additional exoplanets are ice and gas giants at a range of orbital distances from a variety of stellar primaries as well as non-habitable terrestrial and super-Earth sized planets. About 150 sub-Neptune sized planets around a variety of stellar types and at various equilibrium temperatures are expected. For some planets, follow up characterization could be done simultaneously with long exposures to obtain spectra of habitable zone terrestrial planets. In other cases, alternate coronagraph masks and additional exposure time might be needed. For all of these worlds, LUVOIR will enable a host of science programs, ranging from studies of atmospheric dynamics in gas giants to searches for evidence of volcanic gases in the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. The SAG15 report <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Apai et al. 2017</ref>) discusses such programs and many others. The most promising avenue among the wealth of science made possible by this diversity of worlds will be systematic, comparative studies of planetary atmospheres. Many of the more massive planets will have been detected by RV surveys or GAIA, thereby providing masses, while astrometry with HDI will measure or constrain the masses of smaller planets. Planets with known masses, incident fluxes, and measured atmospheric composition will provide a laboratory for testing theories for planet formation, atmospheric evolution, photochemistry, and cloud processes. In this section we briefly summarize some of the highlights of such investigations made possible by LUVOIR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Diversity of composition</head><p>LUVOIR will characterize atmospheric diversity among the planets within each system that it observes, systematically measuring atmospheric composition of gas and ice giants, sub-Neptunes, super-Earths, and small rocky planets. Atmospheric composition is of special interest as the particular species present depend on atmospheric temperature and pressure regulated by the incident stellar flux and, for giant planets, emergent planetary flux from the deep interior. The atmospheres of all solar system giants are enhanced over solar abundance, a fingerprint that is generally attributed to the details of planetary formation process <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2016</ref>). For terrestrial planets, composition is a signature of initial atmospheric formation as modulated by escape, crustal recycling, and other endogenic and exogenic processes (such as impacts and volcanos).</p><p>The visible atmospheres of the relatively cool giant planets probed by direct imaging are directly connected to their deep interiors by a continuous convection zone and the bulk composition of their atmospheres will reflect that of the planet as a whole (Fortney et al.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 4-6</p><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report 2007). This is different from the atmospheres of the hot transiting giant planets, which are disconnected from their deep interiors by a radiative zone that extends to 100 to 1000 bar or more. Thus, LUVOIR will characterize a distinct population of planets with notably different atmospheric structure and composition than most of the transiting planets expected to be observed with JWST, although note LUVOIR can also observe planetary transits in a wavelength range complementary to JWST. Understanding how atmospheric composition varies with planet mass and stellar properties is vital, since planet formation models predict a wide range of enrichments in elements compared to stellar abundances (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Oberg et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fortney et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b564">Madhusudhan et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thorngren et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Espinoza et al. 2017</ref>). Observations of transiting giant planets suggest a trend of decreasing atmospheric heavy element enrichment with increasing mass that mirrors the one seen in the solar system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 4.3)</ref>. LUVOIR users will test whether such trends hold for the cooler, more distant population of planets that more closely resemble solar system gas and ice giants. LUVOIR will also constrain the atmospheric composition of planets at the sub-Neptune/super-Earth boundary to understand if these are distinct planet types or simply a continuum of composition.</p><p>LUVOIR will obtain reflected light spectra of dozens of gas and ice giants, down to sub-Neptune/super-Earth sizes, at a variety of orbital distances around stars of varying mass and metallicity, thus balancing the population of planets expected to be characterized with JWST transit studies. Optical photometry and spectra of detected planets will readily constrain the presence or absence of atmospheres from the distinctive appearance of Rayleigh and cloud particle scattering. Atmospheric composition can be derived from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, as the wavelength ranges and spectral resolutions required for detecting gases in terrestrial atmospheres (Chapter 3) will also permit measurement of H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 4 , Na, and K in gas giants and additional species in the atmospheres of lower mass planets. Atmospheric metallicity can be determined using CH 4 , H 2 O, and NH 3 bands in optical ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.4) and near-IR spectra. For planets warm enough that atmospheric water is not condensed into clouds, such spectra will also constrain carbon-to-oxygen ratios, a key indicator of formation and migration history. For systems with potentially habitable planets, atmospheric characterization of any giant planets will also provide valuable insights into the formation history of the system.  While atmospheric chemistry among the hydrogen-helium dominated giant planets can likely be grossly predicted, the atmospheric diversity of terrestrial planets discovered by LUVOIR will doubtless exceed our imagination. By carrying versatile integral field spectrographs covering a wide wavelength range, LUVOIR is well equipped to characterize the atmospheres of all types of terrestrial planets. A few examples of the diversity of worlds LUVOIR will be able to search for and characterize include: a) Hot exoEarths / exoVenuses are predicted to be the end-state of planetary evolution for rocky worlds with high O 2 or CO 2 atmospheres and rocky planets interior to the habitable zone of the star <ref type="bibr">(Berta- Thompson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b565">Schaefer et al., 2016)</ref>. Worlds undergoing catastrophic ocean and atmospheric loss may exist in the habitable zone (  and their characteristics will vary with stellar spectral type ( <ref type="bibr">Segura et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Segura et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">Segura et al., , 2007</ref>). Optical and near-IR spectra will constrain H 2 O, O 2 , and CO 2 abundances, providing insight to this critical class of planets that define the inner edge of the habitable zone.</p><p>b) Water-rich atmospheres may also exist in the usual habitable zone, either on the path to the "exoVenus" end-state, or as a long-term stable configuration of the planet's atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Goldblatt et al., 2016</ref>).   <ref type="bibr">, 2014)</ref>; this evolution may occur on worlds with or without life ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Catling et al., 2018)</ref>. Such evolution can be driven by atmospheric loss, which when scaledup can lead to evaporated core rocky worlds that are the remnants of massive atmospheric loss from larger planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b554">Gillon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luger et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>e) Terrestrial-sized planets with dense envelopes that were not lost can exist beyond the habitable zone, and due to the greenhouse effect from their H 2 envelopes, lead to planets with stable oceans well beyond the "traditional" habitable zone <ref type="bibr">(Owen &amp; Mohanty, 2016)</ref>. Pressure-induced absorption from high-pressure H 2 atmospheres will be detectable in the optical and near-IR by ECLIPS.</p><p>Comparing the nature of all such terrestrial planets to each other and to any habitable worlds discovered by LUVOIR will place these planets in context. For example, if exoVenus-type planets turn out to be ubiquitous, the relative importance of the runaway greenhouse mechanism will be apparent. However, the diversity of such worlds (do they always sport bright sulfuric acid clouds?) will only emerge through comparative studies of multiple planets. Since we cannot readily predict likely atmospheric compositions for all of the terrestrial planets LUVOIR will discover, the most important capability for characterizing these worlds will be flexibility. As discussed more fully in Chapter 3, LUVOIR's spectral range for coronagraphic spectroscopy provides the ability to detect and measure the abundances of a large array of possible gases, including H 2 O, CH 4 , O 2 , O 3 , and CO 2 . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.5 shows simulated ECLIPS spectra, of both giant and terrestrial planets, that give a flavor of LUVOIR's powerful capabilities for atmospheric characterization.</p></div>

In the solar system giant planet stratospheres, CH 4 photochemistry generates hydrocarbons such as C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4 ; these molecules can polymerize into more complex hydrocarbon species, some of which condense into aerosols. These hydrocarbons strongly absorb UV and blue light on Jupiter and Saturn.

Measure UV spectra of host stars. understanding photochemistry in one planet's atmosphere will inform our understanding of the other planets, including potentially habitable ones. Measurements of the UV spectrum of the host star will also be critical for understanding these processes and interpreting exoplanet atmospheres. LUVOIR observations will illuminate how haze opacity varies with planetary and stellar characteristics, clarify the role hazes play in potentially habitable planets, and improve our ability to model photochemical processes in all types of planetary atmospheres The UV capability of ECLIPS will be crucial for constraining photochemical hazes as they often absorb strongly in the blue and UV. S 8 particles, expected in warm giant planet atmospheres as a consequence of sulfur photochemistry, and organic hazes, which form from methane photochemistry and cause Titan's characteristic orange color, both produce strong UV-blue absorption features. The organic hazes could be detected at low spectral resolution at wavelengths shorter than 0.5 mm for hazy Archean Earth although thinner hazes will require extending to shorter wavelengths (&lt; 0.4 mm; see blue spectrum in right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.6).</p><p>Although WFIRST may image some exoplanets, the bluest WFIRST photometric band cuts off at about 0.55 mm, too red a wavelength to usefully characterize hazes. Studies have also showed that hazes and clouds that are opaque in transit transmission observations-thus obscuring other atmospheric features-can still allow observations of deep atmospheric features in direct imaging (Charnay et al 2015; <ref type="bibr">Morley et al 2015)</ref>. Thus, a UV-coronagraph equipped LUVOIR would provide an outstanding platform for detecting and characterizing photochemical hazes in a great variety of planetary atmospheres. The understanding LUVOIR observers will gain from understanding hazes in a diversity of atmospheres will doubtless aid the interpretation of habitable planet hazes as well.</p></div>

Clouds influence the atmospheric pressure-temperature structure of a planet, the reflected, emission, and transmission spectra, as well as planetary albedo and energy balance.

Water vapor and water ice clouds in Earth can be studied in-situ and via remote sensing; models developed to explain their behavior and properties are often used as a starting point for models of extrasolar planet clouds (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001)</ref>, although the full diversity of cloud processes in all types of exoplanets has not yet been explored.</p><p>Clouds may also be used as temperature indicators and tracers of atmospheric dynamics (circulation, mixing, turbulence).

Clouds may also mask the presence of specific atmospheric absorbers even if present at large abundances below a thick cloud deck. A systematic survey of cloud properties across all types of planets will be transformative for building better models of cloud behavior under varying conditions. In particular the characterization of most habitable planets will likely ultimately rest on cloud models, so a broad, systematic survey of cloud properties in all types of planets with LUVOIR will directly impact habitable planet studies. An understanding of how global cloud properties (altitude, thickness, patchiness of various species) vary with observable planetary properties will be one of the most important legacies of LUVOIR exoplanet science.</p><p>LUVOIR users will aim to understand which particular cloud species are present in which atmospheres, the processes that control cloud particle sizes and vertical distributions, the dynamical and radiative feedbacks between clouds, atmospheric thermal structure, and global dynamics. For a few favorable planets, LUVOIR observations will shed light on how clouds respond to global planetary diurnal and seasonal cycles. Time-resolved high-precision observations (photometric and spectroscopic light curves) have been obtained with HST and groundbased telescopes for some young giant planets. Extending such studies to cooler atmospheres in reflected light will be possible for bright planets for which photometry can be obtained in an hour or so.</p><p>The capabilities of ECLIPS to obtain UV to near-IR reflected light spectra are well matched to illuminating cloud processes. Cloud particle sizes are best constrained through large wavelength coverage, permitting size identification through Mie scattering effects which vary with wavelength. Cloud vertical thickness and number density also strongly influence planetary reflection spectra in the optical. In addition, for a few wellplaced planets, the large aperture permits high cadence photometry, allowing searches for rotational modulation from clouds, tracing atmospheric dynamics and measuring rotation periods.</p></div>

Indeed, many highly irradiated rocky planets (e.g., CoRoT-7b, Kepler-10b) might be the remnant cores of evaporated Neptune-mass planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>). As a consequence, atmospheric escape also has a major impact on our understanding of planet formation (e.g., Van Eylen et al. 2017).</p><p>Upcoming missions will provide us with a large number of transiting planets covering the whole parameter space necessary to thoroughly study escape from an observational perspective. For example, the TESS mission is expected to find about 1700 planets orbiting nearby stars, some of which (~15) will be Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs. The PLATO mission will greatly exceed these numbers, particularly  The LUVOIR Interim Report by extending the search to longer-period planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Sullivan et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>). LUVOIR is the only mission capable of characterizing the extended atmospheres of a statistical sample of these worlds, essential for understanding the global properties of atmospheric escape and understanding how the physics of UV-driven atmospheric mass loss determines the long-term stability of all types of planetary atmospheres. The observational census of atmospheric escape requires the acquisition of UV transmission spectroscopy observations for about 100 transiting planets orbiting stars (later than spectral type A5V). The complete sample of planets is necessary to understand how atmospheric escape correlates with stellar and planetary system parameters. The observations should be carried out at both FUV and NUV wavelengths for the brightest/ nearest systems (for Lyman-alpha in particular it is necessary to observe systems within 60 pc due high ISM absorption). Moreover, because stellar UV emission from active stars can be highly variable from one transit to another, it is important to obtain high S/N detections within an individual transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bourrier et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>LUVOIR observing program. The target planetary systems will be well distributed on the sky and the identification of the best targets will be possible only after the results of the CHEOPS, TESS, and PLATO missions are in hand (still before the launch of LUVOIR). The observations will need to cover UV wavelengths (100-400 nm) where a large number of strong resonance lines of various elements are present. These features, plus a large number of weaker resonance lines of several metals will be the primary target of the observations. The observations will aim not only at measuring transit depths and shapes, but also at measuring the velocity profile of the absorbing material along the line of sight.</p><p>In this way, it will be possible to provide a set of strong observational constraints on models of atmospheric escape. From the few relevant HST observations of transiting planets obtained so far, it appears that the typical velocity of the escaping material is of the order of 10-20 km/s. This requires instruments with a resolving power 40,000-60,000 to resolve the velocities, readily achievable with LUMOS.</p><p>Obtaining these observations simultaneously for a range of species is particularly valuable since different species probe different regions in a planet's photo-evaporative wind. For example, while Lyman-alpha can trace material beyond the planet's Hill sphere as it interacts with the stellar wind, metal lines like CII trace the inner bound portions of a planet's upper atmosphere, where the photo-evaporative wind is launched and Lyman-alpha is heavily extincted by the ISM. Additionally, detection of these metal lines provides a way to probe atmospheric compositions, which is not subject to the effects of clouds lower in the atmosphere.</p><p>The need to reach high-enough signalto-noise ratios (S/N) for multiple species in a single transit drives the specifications on the effective area, which in turn places constraints on the telescope diameter and component efficiencies. The exposure times are then driven by the transit durations and the need to get enough out-of-transit coverage to make sure transit asymmetries can be unambiguously detected. Additionally, high time resolution (~ 1 second) is required to be able to detect and characterize flaring events of the host stars that need to be taken into account in the data analysis and interpretation. The transit durations observed will cover a wide range of transit durations depending on stellar type and the planet's irradiation, ranging from ~1 hour for planets close-in planets around very late M dwarfs like those in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Gillon As an example of an observing program to characterize the mass-loss characteristics of low-mass planet, we reconsider GJ 436b, a 4.3 Earth radius warm Neptune on a 2.6-day orbit around M2.5 dwarf with a V-band magnitude of 10.7. Although, this planet has been studied carefully in Lyman-alpha (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bourrier et al. 2016</ref>), it is not currently possible to detect other species with current facilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Loyd et al. 2017</ref>). LUVOIR, using the LUMOS instrument's G150M mode will achieve a 5-sigma detection of the velocityresolved absorption profile in the 133.5 nm C II line in just 20 minutes. This would provide carbon detections in ~10 points as the planet's Hill sphere transits, probing all the way into the inner bound portions of the upper atmosphere which are inaccessible to current observations. Moreover, while GJ 436 b is an ideal example, upcoming surveys will uncover a large sample of planets around bright nearby stars that can be characterized to a similar level, enabling us to repeat these observations for dozens of planets spanning the full range of planetary parameter space. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Sullivan et al.

The determination of bulk density allows us to distinguish rocky worlds from planets with substantial gas-envelopes or ice or water worlds. Masses and radii constrain surface gravity and are needed to interpret spectra of planetary atmospheres. Circa 2018, most planet masses are measured via the radial velocity technique, with a small number determined from transit timing variations. Neither of these methods can currently provide mass measurements for true analogs of our Earth around solar-type stars. Therefore, the capability of measuring exoplanet masses with extremely precise astrometry (~0.1 mas) is a key attribute of the High Definition Imager (HDI). Such astrometric measurements will yield reliable orbits and masses for planets with M ≥ 1M Earth orbiting ≥ 1 AU from G2V stars within 10 parsecs (the mass measurement limit is smaller for lower mass stars). Additionally, LUVOIR's immense light-gathering power, short integration times, large instantaneous field of regard, and rapid repointing will enable deep imaging of each exoplanet target star many times, ensuring both an accurate orbital solution as well as a high chance of planet discovery. The combination of direct imaging using ECLIPS and precision astrometry with HDI will robustly disentangle multi-planet systems ( <ref type="bibr">Guyon et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Since a planet's brightness in reflected light is a function of the planet radius, albedo, and orbital phase, determining the radius is difficult. Repeat imaging in multiple filters at different orbital phases is key to untangling these degeneracies. As an example, for a planet with a substantial atmosphere observed at crescent phases, the forward lobe of Rayleigh scattering tends to dominate over atmospheric and surface absorption at blue wavelengths, reducing the albedo uncertainty. Exploratory retrieval studies show that at phase angles greater than ~100, degrees measurement of planet brightness in the blue offers improved constraints on planet radii compared to more gibbous phases ( <ref type="bibr">Nayak et al. 2016</ref>). Further retrieval studies of simulated directly imaged planets observed in reflected light will identify the optimum strategy for constraining radii, and hence bulk density and composition, of both terrestrial and giant planets.</p></div>

For example, giant planets can affect volatile delivery to the inner solar system, leading to potential differences in composition between terrestrial planets in systems with and without giant planets. Atmospheric composition of giant planets also provides clues to their formation and evolution. Gas giant planets formed by the core accretion mechanism are expected to have atmospheric heavy element abundances in excess of those of their parent stars. Available data on hot transiting planets already point to a trend of atmospheric heavy element enrichment with mass ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.3). LUVOIR will extend such comparisons to cooler, more solar system-like giant planets, and uncover systematic deviations from the trend that might indicate other formation mechanisms (like gravitational collapse) for subsets of planets. Furthermore, differences in atmospheric bulk composition (recorded as C/O ratios) for planets at similar orbital distances may indicate migration has moved some of them from their birthplaces to the locations we see today. Planet migration can also establish planets in orbital resonances and alter their eccentricities. Thus, measurement of orbits, masses, and atmospheric composition for all the planets in any system together permit a much richer understanding than any of these measures alone. Integral field spectroscopy at R=70 will be able to measure precise volatile inventories for a hundreds of gas and ice giant planets, enabling comparisons of C/O ratios over a wide range of orbital separations and identifying relationships between composition, mass, and orbit.</p></div>

Erosion of these planetesimals produces interplanetary dust, which can actually be the most easily observed feature of a planetary system, due to the large total surface area of the dust grains. Dust in the warm inner region of the solar system is called zodiacal dust, which largely comes from comets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Nesvorný et al. 2010</ref>).

Gravitational interactions between a planet and planetesimals can trap some of the latter into dynamical resonances, which can then be revealed through clumps in the interplanetary dust. Such trapping can serve as a record of the planet's migration history (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Malhotra 1993</ref>). Furthermore, if we assume a planetesimal belt is roughly coplanar with the planetary system, we obtain an immediate estimate of the inclination of the system and can constrain a planet's orbit with fewer observations. High resolution, high contrast imaging of exoplanets will simultaneously reveal interplanetary dust, providing dynamical and contextual information without additional observational demands.</p></div>

Measuring planetesimal compositions offers the opportunity to infer the bulk composition of planetary material that formed around various types of stars. Compositional differences between relatively unprocessed gas in younger protoplanetary disks vs. gas produced from planetesimals in older debris disks set expectations for giant planet atmospheres accreted purely from relatively unprocessed primordial gas vs. those contaminated by planetesimal impacts. These measurements also inform the possible make-up of subNeptune atmospheres accreted during the protoplanetary phase vs. those outgassed from a planet's interior. But even in the solar system, to probe the interior composition of planetesimals, one needs to break them open, as was done by NASA's Deep Impact mission to comet Tempel 1. Fortunately, this breaking open is exactly what is happening to planetesimals in debris disks. The goal is to determine the bulk composition of planetesimals around a variety of young stars by measuring elemental abundances of material in debris disks. Determining the composition of dust in debris disks is and will remain difficult, because the grains are relatively large and their spectral features are broad, weak, and ambiguous.

The advent of sensitive radio spectroscopy with ALMA has provided the opportunity to survey a limited number of gas species in many debris disks (specifically, CO and neutral carbon). But such observations cannot provide a full compositional inventory of gas in debris disks, as emission lines of other important species (water, atomic oxygen, and metals) are not accessible.</p><p>To access a wide range of atomic species in debris disks, astronomers have instead employed sensitive UV / optical absorption spectroscopy, using the host stars as the background light sources. An example appears in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.12, which also shows time-variable gas coming from stargrazing extrasolar planetesimals. Far-UV spectroscopy is vital for these studies, as the strong absorption lines of many atomic and molecular gases are only available in that bandpass. This is the technique that was used to inventory the gas in the Beta Pic and 49 Cet disks, both around intermediate mass A-type stars ( <ref type="bibr">Roberge et al. 2006</ref>). In both cases, the gas elemental composition appears extremely and unexpectedly carbon-rich. The reasons for this are not fully understood at this time.

Furthermore, access to absorption lines from more than one energy level and ionization state is important for determining the gas excitation temperature and the ionization balance of the gas.

With projected lifetimes of order 10 5 -10 6 years, the typical active comet is therefore a short-lived remnant of a much larger population of evolving objects in the region beyond Jupiter.</p><p>The major factor limiting the study of icy planetesimals is detection efficiency for small bodies. These objects are only visible due to reflected sunlight that experiences inverse square dilution in both the outbound and reflected directions, resulting in a R -4 brightness function with heliocentric distance. This effect is magnified in the gas coma, because the rate of sublimation from a nucleus decreases rapidly with temperature, resulting in a lower scattering column density with increasing heliocentric distance. This combination of factors results in a severe observational bias against smaller and less active bodies that is reflected in the clear difference in the observed size distributions of TNOs and SPCs, where even the largest SPC nuclei (e.g., 109P/Swift-Tuttle) are smaller than every known TNO, and the paucity of gas production measurements from comets beyond 2.5 AU.</p><p>HST is currently the deepest telescope for detection of small bodies by virtue of the much lower sky-background and its use of diffraction limited imaging. WFC3 broadband (F350LP filter) imaging can currently identify (SNR~5) a 15 km diameter object in a circular orbit at 40 AU in ~600 s (the crossing-time for a 0.08" resel). The LUVOIR HDI will extend the HST advantage as a detection tool, even when compared with the next generation of 30-m class ground based telescopes. Over the same bandpass, LUVOIR-HDI would achieve SNR~5 detection of 3.5 km diameter objects over a ~70 s resel-crossing time, a 4-fold reduction in limiting diameter in 1/8th the time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 4.14)</ref>. In addition to point source detection, the HDI and LUMOS instruments would provide a 100x increase in sensitivity to the surface ice composition and low surface brightness UV emission from the gas comae of TNOs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">(Figure 4.15)</ref>. LUVOIR is essential for the following types of studies.</p><p>Population statistics. The deepest wide-field surveys available are currently unable to detect objects &lt;10 km in diameter beyond the orbit of Saturn, yet dynamical models identifying the KEB as the source of SPCs and Centaurs require that such bodies must be extremely common. LUVOIR-HDI is capable of extending the detection threshold down to 1-10 km sizes typical of SPCs. A campaign targeting size distributions in the classical KEB between 40-50 AU would identify any objects in this region ≥ 3 km in diameter at a rate, including time-sequenced returns to establish motion, of 1 sq-deg per day of integration. In addition to small KEBs, these observations would obtain trailed images of Centaurs between 6-30 AU to depths of 0.5-2 km and detect Sedna-sized Dwarf planets at distances up to 1000 AU (Sedna's aphelion).</p><p>Moons and rings. The cold classical Kuiper Belt's binary population is thought to be a primordial remnant produced during the epoch of planetesimal formation. With negligible binding, binary pairs of 100 km objects have shown separations &gt;10 5 that sharply constrain subsequent perturbations. Binary occurrence increases rapidly with decreasing separation to the limit of HST's angular resolution. LUVOIR will be able to characterize the occurrence rate of Kuiper Belt binary systems down to the Roche limit for objects with diameters as small as 120 km <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">(Figure 4.15)</ref>, approximately the size at which the Kuiper Belt size distribution breaks from a steep to shallow slope. Two of the largest Centaurs, Charliko and Chiron, are thought to support ring systems. Their origin <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.15.

LUVOIR will permit a unique characterization of the deepest regions (40-50 AU) of our solar system (objects with m&lt;33), also permitting unprecedented studies of their atmospheres (m&lt;20), surface composition / variability (m&lt;22) and their origin and evolution via studies of their rings and binary configuration (m&lt;24).

Surface composition. NASA's New Horizons mission has revealed the complex cryogenic world Pluto <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 4.16)</ref>, which, like Neptune's moon Triton, has a spatially heterogeneous surface composition shaped by a variety of poorly understood processes including both geologic activity and atmospheric transport of CO, N 2 , and CH 4 ices. More remote (e.g., Eris) and smaller (e.g., Sedna, Makemake) TNOs have spectra dominated by CH 4 absorption. Surface and seasonal variations, including sublimation/ condensation of atmospheres, on all of these worlds are poorly constrained and can be directly addressed by LUVOIR spectroscopic study in the 0.5-2.5 mm range. In contrast to the hydrostatically organized dwarf planets, smaller TNOs are spectrally featureless or present surfaces with small amounts of nonvolatile water ice. This likely represents their primitive, more homogeneous structure. LUVOIR's high sensitivity, spectroscopic capabilities and spatial resolution will permit a deep characterization of the surface composition on smaller bodies.</p><p>Volatility. Comets are the primary means through which we obtain volatile composition information from icy planetesimals. However, the sample is skewed by the strong temperature dependence of CO, CO 2 , and H 2 O sublimation, the R -4 reduction in scattered surface brightness, and a historical emphasis on wide-field observations of photochemical fragments (e.g., CN instead of HCN or HNC). These factors combine bias study toward the global properties of the most active nuclei at small heliocentric distances. This emphasis lacks perspective on factors including compositional heterogeneity, seasonal patterns in surface temperature, the characteristics of low-activity objects  <ref type="bibr">(Prialnik and Bar Nun, 1990)</ref>. Particularly for distances beyond the orbit of Jupiter, the composition of a comet coma has been partially sampled for only a few objects, and, in several cases, is detectable only from an associated dust coma. The broad spectral coverage of LUVOIR will combine observations of atomic species (O, C, S, H, and D) in the UV with the classical visible band fragment molecules (OH, CN, C 2 , etc.) and their near-IR parents between 1-2.5 microns. Moreover, it will have the sensitivity to detect, or place far more stringent limits on gas production from low activity, volatile rich bodies including some Trojan asteroids and the Main Belt Comets and to monitor the characteristics of ice sublimation for nuclei in the CO dominated region of comet orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Summary</head><p>Before the Kepler mission flew we knew of only a few hundred exoplanets, most discovered by the radial velocity method and thus lacking information on planetary radii. Kepler added thousands of confirmed and candidate planets to the list of known exoplanets, but perhaps the greatest contribution to exoplanet science was the discovery of exceptional diversity among planets. Super-earth and sub-Neptune sized planets, not represented by any solar system objects, turned out to be exceptionally abundant. This diversity of planet types broadened our vision and led to a revolution in efforts to understand planet formation and evolution. LUVOIR will enable an equivalent new era of comparative exoplanet science. Instead of comparisons of planet sizes and masses, LUVOIR will empower its users to conduct comparative studies of planetary atmospheres, including their composition, chemistry, clouds, dynamics, photochemistry, and escape processes for hundreds of planets. By improving our understanding of fundamental planetary processes on all types of planets our ability to interpret observations of and deeply understand habitable planets will only be magnified. Likewise,  by providing a new view into the process and outcomes of planet formation LUVOIR has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve. Equipped with a flexible, powerful observatory designed to characterize exoplanets of all stripes, the next generation of exoplanet astronomers will achieve a comprehensive view into the nature of the diversity of planets-particularly including their atmospheres-and planetary systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">How do galaxies evolve?</head><p>This question is one of the oldest in astrophysics, dating from the very first realization a century ago that galaxies are "island Universes" unto themselves. The quest to answer it has motivated some of astronomy's brightest minds to build its most ambitious telescopes. Over decades of discovery spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, astronomers have painted a rich picture of how galaxies grow. They begin as small seed fluctuations in the largescale structure to assemble "hierarchically" into self-bound dark matter halos. These potential wells draw baryons together, and this gas becomes galaxies and the stars, and in some places, life emerges. We know that supermassive black holes lurk in the hearts of nearly every galaxy, and for brief periods might govern their evolution. Yet our understanding of the physics behind these emergent patterns lags behind our ability to characterize them. We can model the tree-like hierarchical assembly of dark matter, but how baryons populate the branches of this tree is mapped out only for the largest pieces at late times, and we do not know what sets the minimum scale for galaxy formation. We do not know why some galaxies are dominated by their bulges while others have none: is it an effect of the hierarchy, gas accretion, or activity from their supermassive black holes? We do not know how galaxies sustain their star formation for much longer than their present gas supply allows. We do not know why the most massive galaxies cease forming stars at any significant level (called "quenching"), and stay that way. These questions, and many more, comprise the leading edge of galaxy formation studies today <ref type="bibr">(Somerville &amp; Davé 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madau &amp; Dickinson 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Building on today's state-of-the-art, and anticipating developments in the next decade, this chapter will pose questions that we expect will remain unsolved even in the 2030s, because they require observations at wavelengths, sensitivity, and spatial resolution that are well beyond those of other foreseeable facilities. We will focus on two broad domains of galaxy evolution as the "Signature Science" that motivates LUVOIR's UV coverage, high-resolution imaging, and multiplexing capabilities, and in turn its aperture, wavelength range, and instrumentation. To understand "The Cycles of Matter," astronomers using LUVOIR will be able to deploy multi-object spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, with up to 50-fold sensitivity gains compared to Hubble and the multiplexing ability to observe more than a hundred objects at once. To map "The Multiscale Assembly of Galaxies," astronomers using LUVOIR will employ extremely stable 10 mas imaging with an unprecedented combination of depth and wavelength coverage.</p><p>The Cycles of Matter: How do galaxies acquire the gas they use to form stars? How do they sustain star formation over billions of years when they appear to contain much less gas than this requires? How does feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) expel gas and metals, and to what extent is this feedback recycled into later star formation? What happens to a galaxy's gas when it quenches? Is it used up, ejected, or hidden?</p><p>Much of galaxy formation is still hidden from view because it involves gas at temperatures that are too high and densities that are too diffuse to observe directly, or physical scales that are too small to resolve. All these scales, from &lt; 100 pc to more than 1 Mpc, are relevant when we consider how gas flows drive galaxy evolution. With its uniquely powerful UV capability at high</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report  spatial resolution, LUVOIR will directly observe these gas flows to trace the raw materials of galaxies, the ejected products of star formation, and the recycling between them over the latter half of cosmic time.</p><p>The Multiscale Assembly of Galaxies: We know empirically that galaxy formation is a multiscale process spanning at least seven orders of magnitude in mass and three in size that unfolds over the 13 billion year sweep of cosmic time. The brightest galaxies we know about are 10 billion times brighter than the faintest, and the densest are 1 million times more crowded than the most diffuse. In between these extremes, galaxies follow orderly scaling relations between mass, size, star formation, and metal content. This remarkable regularity spanning a vast range of diversity challenges our current theories and even our imaginations to understand how Nature does it. Part of the story is that even the largest galaxies of today began as smaller seeds at the dawn of time, and gradually built up into massive giants by acquiring gas and merging with other galaxies. Along this "merger tree" path, galaxies grow by accreting gas and merging with their neighbors large and small. By reaching depths of 33-34th magnitude, LUVOIR will detect the early building blocks of galaxies like the Milky Way, and fill out the merger tree that leads to galaxies at the present time. It will also "see inside galaxies" to unprecedented limits, resolving their internal building blocks at &lt; 100 pc scales to unravel the processes inside galaxies that drive their evolution. All these themes motivate and exploit LUVOIR's unique spatial resolution and broad wavelength coverage.</p><p>The "Signature Science" cases here represent some of the most compelling types of observations astronomers might do with LUVOIR at the limits of its performance. But, compelling as they are, they should not be taken as a complete specification of the LUVOIR program. We have developed concrete examples to ensure that the nominal design can do this compelling science, and so that the astronomical community has detailed examples they can adapt to their own interests. We expect that the creativity of the community, harnessing the revolutionary capabilities of the observatory, will ask questions, acquire data, and solve problems that we cannot envision today. That is as it should be, as a flagship should always reach far beyond current capabilities and break the current limits of our imagination. With this in mind, let us ask vital science questions that we believe will remain unsolved until LUVOIR, and consider how they drive the requirements for its aperture, resolution, and wavelength coverage. We hope these cases will stimulate the reader to imagine their own science cases and to begin applying these tools to design their own future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Signature science case #1: The cycles of matter</head><p>Much of the still-unknown story of how galaxies evolve comes down to how they acquire, use, and recycle their gas. Inflows and outflows of gas likely shape the evolution of star formation within a galaxy. Inflows ultimately arise from the intergalactic medium (IGM) to provide fuel for continued star formation over the lifetime of a galaxy. Outflows from the interstellar medium, driven by stellar radiation and explosions or by AGN, or some combination of them, keep galaxies from forming too many stars in their central regions. The balance of these flows set the rate at which galaxies accumulate heavy elements.</p><p>All these flows meet in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), an extremely diffuse gaseous medium spanning roughly 30 times the radius and 10,000 times the volume of LUVOIR's science aims must be considered in light of progress that is expected between now and its launch. What will the field of galaxy formation look like after the advances of the 2020s, when we will have operational JWST, ALMA, and one or more extremely large telescopes on the ground? Of course, we cannot know what surprises Nature will supply, but experience teaches that new facilities break new ground and are forced by competitive peer review to address the most demanding problems of their time.</p><p>First, we can expect that essentially the entire sky will have been surveyed at seeinglimited resolution in the optical bands, e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), PanSTARRS, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). LSST's accumulated co-add will reach ~28th magnitude in the optical over 10 years, with 0.8-1" resolution. These maps will be joined by the massive fiber-based spectroscopic surveys that started with SDSS and the 2dF survey and will expand deeper and wider with the Subaru PFS survey and its contemporaries. All-sky imaging provides accurate photometry, and spectroscopy provides additional physical diagnostics of stellar population age and metallicity, and galactic dust content. These vast datasets support rich multivariate analyses with statistical precision and excel at determining galaxy population statistics and galaxy/galaxy correlations in large-scale structure and halo substructure. After these surveys, there might be very little about the large-scale distribution of galaxies that remains to be learned. These massive spectroscopic surveys also detect millions of strong gas absorbers, such Mg II and Ca II lines, which probe dense interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM gas. However, as we will show, they cannot access the key UV physical diagnostics over most of cosmic time.</p><p>The other major theme of the 2020s will be high-resolution imaging in the IR, sub-millimeter, and radio. JWST and WFIRST will be the prime space observatories, bringing 50-100 mas resolution to imaging and multi-object spectroscopy. WFIRST will provide Hubble-quality imaging to a large sky area, and JWST will detect galaxies to AB ~ 32. JWST is optimized to reach "the first galaxies," seeing the first seeds of modern galaxies at z &gt; 15. It will also be revolutionary in its mid-IR capability, able to observe the rise of dust, ice, and molecules in galaxies over most of cosmic time. Long-wavelength facilities such as ALMA and SKA will bring their powers to bear on the neutral and molecular gas content of galaxies at high resolution. Finally, 20-30 m telescopes on the ground will, if successful with adaptive optics, bring &lt; 50 mas imaging and spectroscopy at IR wavelengths, in a comparable resolution and depth space as JWST.</p><p>What observational parameter space remains after all this? Space observatories are the platform of choice for high-resolution optical imaging, UV imaging and spectroscopy, highly repeatable precision photometry, ultrastable astrometry, and high-performance optical coronagraphy. LUVOIR's "Signature Science" motivates and uses these capabilities, while acknowledging the areas where ground-based telescopes or space facilities at other wavelengths do their best. And in the end, it is the complementarity and collaboration between these domains that drives the science forward.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report  now understand that the CGM has a total mass comparable to the stellar masses of galaxies and is richly structured in density, temperature, and chemical enrichment. No picture of galaxy formation and evolution is complete without understanding this major galactic component.</p><p>To organize our discussion, we will proceed into galaxies and back out again, starting from the IGM and how it moves into the CGM as galactic fuel. From there we will consider the flows within the CGM and how gas from inside it and outside it are processed and recycled. Finally we will consider the disk/halo interface, where accretion becomes the ISM and the ISM becomes feedback. At each stage we will see how astronomers using LUVOIR could make definitive measurements of processes that have been hidden from view. First, we must stop to investigate why observing these processes makes LUVOIR's UV sensitivity so essential to its design.</p></div>

It is possible that life would not exist were it not for the protective ozone layer that keeps these harmful photons out. We can have life on Earth, or UV astronomy from Figure 5.1. Galaxies are much more than they appear to be in starlight. Normal galaxies are surrounded by a massive reservoir of diffuse gas that acts as their fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center: the circumgalactic medium. It is fed by accretion out of the cosmic web and by outflows from the galaxy. Recent evidence indicates that the CGM is a major factor in galaxy evolution. Unraveling the CGM and all its associated flows is major driving force for LUVOIR and its instruments. Adapted from Tumlinson, <ref type="bibr">Peeples, &amp; Werk (2017)</ref>.</p></div>

In this state of affairs, we must place our telescopes in space if we are to make a full characterization of the gas in halos and the IGM over the last 10 Gyr of cosmic time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.2 shows that the ability to cover UV wavelengths is essential to explore the full range of temperature and density where we can find the CGM and IGM baryons-most of the normal matter in the universe. In the panel at lower left, the greyscale intensity map shows the distribution of gas in the halo of a simulated L* galaxy from the EAGLE project ( <ref type="bibr">Oppenheimer et al. 2016</ref>). This gas is all in the CGM of the simulated galaxy, yet it exists in multiple "phases" from 1 million K and densities near the cosmic mean (~10 -5 -10 -6 cm -3 ) to denser gas close to the galaxy's disk at 10 4 K and log n H &gt; -1. In these conditions, the hydrogen and metals in the gas will exist in high states of ionization: 1% or less of the H may be neutral, while common metals like C, N, O, S, Mg, and Fe may be ionized multiple time to the stages indicated on the figure (e.g., O VI or O+5). In these conditions, the quantum mechanical rules of energy transfer dictate that the gas will emit and absorb energy primarily at UV wavelengths. Detailed calculations indicate that 60-80% of photons emitted and absorbed by diffuse CGM gas are UV photons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Bertone et al. 2013</ref>). These lines appear in the upper right <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.2. Diffuse gas surrounding galaxies requires UV capability for most of cosmic time. The greyscale image below shows that most CGM gas lies at T &gt; 10 5 K, where atomic physics places its absorption and emission in the rest-UV. The colored squares mark diagnostic ions used to study this gas, placed at the temperature/density combination where they are strongest.</p></div>

We conclude that the UV species that best trace the temperature and density regime of diffuse galactic gas flows lie in the UV over the last 10 Gyr of cosmic time. This inescapable piece of physics means that, if we are interested in resolving questions about how galaxies acquire, process, eject, and recycle their gas, over the last 10 Gyr of cosmic time, we need access to UV wavelengths that are observable only from space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Gas flows in absorption: More sources, deeper limits, earlier times</head><p>The IGM and the CGM-the lowest density matter in the cosmos-are intrinsically difficult to study. Astronomers have spent decades trying to grasp the nature and impact of this material, with modest success. Absorptionline spectroscopy has been the primary tool of choice, because it excels at detecting diffuse gas down to the very lowest densities (even lower than the cosmic mean density), especially if those regions occupy large regions of space. Absorption lines can be detected in gas spanning a huge range of temperature and densities, providing a lever arm on physical diagnostics for almost all relevant phases of the gas. The availability of background sources sets a critical limit on the use of absorption lines as probes of diffuse gas. The most throughput-optimized UV spectrograph at the moment is Hubble's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), which can perform high S/N spectroscopy of sources only down to about 18th magnitude (AB mag in the FUV). There are only about 1000 such objects on the entire sky ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5.</ref>3), making UV spectroscopy of intervening gas a game of choosing sources carefully to yield the desired population of foreground galaxies. Using this technique, Hubble users have explored modest samples of mainstream L* galaxies (N = 42; <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Tumlinson et al. 2013</ref>), dwarf galaxies (N = 40; <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Bordoloi et al. 2014</ref>), radio-selected star forming disks (N = 45; <ref type="bibr">Borthakur et al. 2015</ref>), galaxies in dense environments ( <ref type="bibr">Burchett et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. 2016</ref>) and galaxies hosting AGN (N = 13; <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Berg et al. 2018)</ref>. As a result of the paucity of sources, the quasar absorption lines (QSOALS) method can make only crude For S/N = 20 spectroscopy, Hubble/COS is limited to the objects in the red wedge, which barely reaches past z ~ 0.7. With its 3 mag deeper grasp, LUVOIR/LUMOS users will have many more QSOs to choose from, with enough in the z = 1-2 interval to finally build precise maps of how gas feeds galaxies at that epoch. Right: LUVOIR+LUMOS S/N for a flat-spectrum FUV = 19 source in one hour of integration for each of the G120, G150, G180 and G300M gratings (R = 30-40,000). The LUVOIR limits were derived from the LUMOS ETC available at luvoir.stsci.edu .</p></div>

The upshot is a set of essentially one-dimensional maps, with only a few forays beyond, and, with Hubble, limited mainly to galaxies at z &lt; 0.5. The LUVOIR Ultraviolet MultiObject Spectrograph (LUMOS) is designed for point-source spectroscopy 30-50 times more sensitive than Hubble/COS, at about double its highest resolution (R ~ 40,000). LUMOS users will be able to choose from any of the quasars counted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.3, including thousands of choice objects at z &gt; 1. This is a critical time in the history of the universe: star formation rates begin declining from their z ~ 2 peak, AGN have passed their epoch of maximum activity and are turning off, the "red sequence" of passive galaxies is beginning to emerge, and the first large concentrations that we call galaxy clusters are about to mature. To understand the almost totally unknown role of IGM and CGM gas at this epoch, we must be able to observe tens or even hundreds of QSO/ galaxy pairs. The areal density for such pairs is non-linear with magnitude (and so with aperture), given the QSO and galaxy UV luminosity functions. With a 15-m aperture, roughly 1% of all L* galaxies at z ~ 0.2 will have close-separation QSOs for which high-S/N, high-resolution spectroscopy is feasible in an hour. For higher-redshift galaxies at z ~ 0.7, the number is lower by a factor of 10, but that still gives access to a respectable 1/1000 of all L*-type galaxies. With such large samples, LUMOS users will be able to address a wide range of critical open questions about the flows of matter.</p><p>Where are the missing baryons? Normal galaxies possess only a few percent of their expected budget of baryonic matter <ref type="bibr">(Fukugita, Hogan, &amp; Peebles 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">McGaugh 2005)</ref>. A large mass fraction exists in the CGM, but this measurement has so far been performed only near L* galaxies and only at z &lt; 0. <ref type="bibr">2 (Werk et al. 2014</ref>). The wavelengths accessible to LUMOS provide coverage to an extensive range of rest-frame extreme-UV ions that redshifts into the FUV for z &gt; 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Tripp 2013)</ref>. This includes nearly every ionization state of the most abundant heavy element, oxygen (O I though O VI). Performing a baryon census in which most of the gas is traced by a single element will eliminate some of the most serious systematic errors in ionization models that plague these measurements. The remaining oxygen ions-O VII and O VIII-reside in very low density, high temperature gas, generally accessed today through a small number of X-ray sightline in which megaseconds of Chandra or XMM time have been invested (the lines lie at ~20 Å in the rest-frame). Fortunately, other ions visible in the UV at z ~ 1 probe that same regime. One example Synergies with other ground/space facilities: 30-m+ ground-based optical/IR telescopes obtain data on associated galaxies. ALMA and radio telescopes can constrain their ISM gas and metal content.</p></div>

Every sightline at z ~ 1 thus offers an opportunity to observe baryons across the full spectrum of their phase space, from neutral, colder gas (e.g., O I, H I), through to warm, ionized gas (e.g., O VI), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.2. This Signature Science forms a synergy with ground-based telescopes, which are needed to measure the redshifts, masses, star formation rates, and metallicities of the associated galaxies. As Hubble and Keck have cooperated to advance this field in the 2020s, so can LUVOIR and the next generation of extremely large telescopes on the ground. Follow the metals to map feedback. Heavy elements are "Nature's tracer particles"-the equivalent of a message in a bottle that tells us where the products of star formation have been carried over time. These messages spread far and wide, clearly showing that some galaxies have transported their metals over vast distances-even megaparsecs-away from their birthplace. If we can piece together all the messages in all the bottles from all the island universes, we should come to understand how galactic feedback actually works.</p><p>Hubble's UV capability has extensively probed the extent of metals around galaxies, culminating in the finding that only 20% of all metals produced are still retained in the galaxies that made them ( <ref type="bibr">Peeples et al. 2014</ref>). The rest are elsewhere, many in the CGM. It is striking how wide a range of metallicity is seen in normal galaxy halo gas at z &lt; 1, with ~50% of the gas having metallicities around 5% Solar, while the other half is roughly Solar ( <ref type="bibr">Lehner et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wotta et al. 2016</ref>). The lowest-metallicity CGM gas may be associated with infalling material, either from the IGM or accreting from a hot corona, while the higher metallicity gas could be ongoing enriched feedback. Extensive work with numerical simulations indicates that the physical extent of metals around galaxies, and their relative mixtures in the phases of the gas, can provide critical tests of poorly understood feedback models. Understanding the origins of this gas, whether it will collapse onto the galaxy or will be subsumed back into the corona, is critical to understanding how and from where galaxies replenish their fuel supply for </p></div>

LUVOIR will allow us to measure the prevalence of low-metallicity gas about galaxies of different masses, star-formation rates, and environments using UV absorption spectroscopy. This is currently not feasible now, because of the relative low density on the sky of UV-bright sources accessible to Hubble's spectrographs. Moreover, LUVOIR will be able to do this over the critical z = 0.5-1.5 epoch of galaxy formation. Performing a census of metals over this redshift range can exploit the simultaneous coverage of almost every UV ion of oxygen, sidestepping any systematic problems with using C, Si, O, and N variously, as is done at z &lt; 0.2.

The baryon census and feedback studies described above require access to redshifted Lyman alpha (HI 1215), so a program targeting metal absorption obtains unprecedented Lyman alpha forest "for free." A LUVOIR program observing 100 quasar sight lines at S/N &gt; 30 would perform three major measurements: (1) constrain the matter power spectrum P(k) to better than 5% accuracy on scales of 0.1 to 100 Mpc at z ~ 1, bringing precision cosmology to a new epoch in time; (2) measure the H I column density distribution function f(N HI ), which at the low H I end measures the IGM, but at the intermediate and high HI end directly maps onto the CGM and ISM of galaxies; <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> measure the equation of state of the IGM, T=T 0 (ρ/ρ avg )γ -1 , to accuracies approaching 10%. The thermal history of the universe bears the fingerprints of major heating events such as reionization of Hydrogen and Helium and the influence of the Hubble expansion, but also can be used to trace the influence of other hydrodynamic processes more closely linked to galaxy formation and evolution. A comprehensive LUMOS QSOALS campaign: All of these studies of CGM missing baryons, metals, and the IGM can be carried out with a single, comprehensive QSO survey. For definiteness, and for scaling to other architectures, we scope this to use the 100 brightest QSOs identified in the SDSS DR7 QSO catalog, using matched GALEX FUV fluxes. We set the S/N goals such that 1 hour in each of the LUMOS High resolution gratings will yield the blue curve in the upper right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.3 for an FUV = 19 mag QSO. For brighter objects, we scale the exposures by FUV magnitude to maintain the same S/N. This survey of 100 QSOs will require just under 200 hours of integration time (and, perhaps ~300 hours with overheads). Spectroscopy for 100 background quasars at z~1 represents a fundamentally game changing prospect for the study of the formation and evolution of the baryons in, around, and in-between galaxies and the larger cosmological context galaxies live in. No mission current or planned other than LUVOIR could complete such a program in a treasury scale program allocation of time. Any claim of understanding the history of baryons in the universe demands a study of this epoch of transformation in cosmic time, and LUVOIR rises to the challenge.</p></div>

To improve this situation, we must attempt to "take a picture" of a galaxy's gas flows in two dimensions, using emission from the gas itself that reveals its density, temperature, metallicity, and kinematics. With its millions of ~0.1" apertures, customizable to nearly any source, LUMOS will be able to probe physical processes-shocks, accretion, ejecta, and recycling-at scales that even simulations today can barely reach. This capability will enable LUVOIR's users to investigate smallscale structures within the CGM, especially in those vital regions where outflows meet inflows and gas is being recycled.

These instruments can access some of the important UV diagnostic lines, most readily Lyα, but only at high redshift. They are also limited still to relatively low spatial resolution, which translates to physical scales of &gt; 10 kpc. They are limited in sensitivity by bright and time-variable sky backgrounds that will make detection of the much weaker lines of key metals exceedingly difficult in individual halos. LUMOS will bring at least three unique abilities-UV coverage, high spatial resolution, and extreme sensitivity-to bear on this important problem, in ways that ground-based telescopes cannot. With this instrument, astronomers will be able to map the density, temperature, and mass flow rates of the CGM, directly, using the UV radiation emitted by CGM gas as it cycles in and out of galaxies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.6 shows how the LUMOS microshutters map to small-scale (&lt; 1 kpc) clouds that carry gas and metals away from the prototypical starburst galaxy, M82.

The false color zoom shows small clumps that trace the interaction of the galaxy's outflow with the CGM. Did these clumps cool and form where they are? Or is this material directly ejected? If so, what does it imply about the mass ejection rate, and the mass rate of recycling? This is galactic feedback in action, but only at UV wavelengths can we prove the relevant energy scales to answer these questions.

This diffuse gas will be challenging to detect even for LUVOIR, but appropriate integration times could be fitted in as parallels to the weeklong exoplanet visits, for example. In deep LUMOS exposures, the structure of the CGM can be detected in multiple lines, allowing us to count up the heavy element content of this gas, to watch the flows as they are ejected and recycled, and to witness their fate when galaxies quench their star formation, all as a function of galaxy type and evolutionary state. LUVOIR could map galaxies in fields where deep imaging identifies filaments in the largescale structure, and where ground-based ELTs have made deep redshift surveys to pinpoint the galactic structures and sources of metals to be seen in the CGM. Because this radiation is far weaker than local foreground radiation (SB ~ 100-1000 photons cm -2 s -1 sr -1 ) ground-based telescopes seeking it at redshifts where it appears in the visible (z &gt; 2) must perform extremely demanding sky foreground subtraction to reveal the faint underlying signal. These foregrounds are considerably lower from space (by factors of 10-100), shortening required exposure times by an equivalent factor. Using this technique and binning up 0.5-1" regions of the microshutter array (a few kpc at z &lt; 2),  LUMOS users can examine the large scale distribution of the filaments and extended disks they feed, from the peak of cosmic star formation down to the present. When put together, the three essential ingredients of UV coverage, spatial resolution, and extreme sensitivity will enable mapping of gas flows through the CGM in its rich detail. LUVOIR accesses the key lines at z &lt; 2, a 10 Gyr era encompassing the peak of cosmic star formation, the rise of the brightest quasars, the widespread quenching of massive galaxies, and the emergence of galaxies as we know them today. Only an optimized UV mission such as LUVOIR has the sensitivity and resolution to apply these powerful diagnostics to this cosmic era when so much happens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Gas flows and quenching</head><p>Galaxy quenching is a prime target for LUVOIR's unique power. How galaxies quench, and remain so, is a major open question. The number density of passive galaxies has increased 10-fold over the 10 billion year interval since z ~ 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Brammer et al. 2011</ref>). Galaxies undergoing quenching are the ideal laboratories to study the feedback that all galaxies experience: the galactic superwinds driven by supernovae and stellar radiation, the hot plasma ejected by black holes lurking in galactic centers, and the violent mergers that transform galaxy shapes while triggering the consumption or ejection of pre-existing gas. LUVOIR will have the collecting area to support deep, wide-field UV multi-object spectrograph searches for CGM gas at the line emission fluxes that are expected, and with the spatial resolution to observe the transformation of star forming disks to passive spheroids at 50-100 pc spatial resolution and closely examine the influence of AGN on this process. For galaxies identified as quenching, emission maps of the surrounding CGM will determine the fate of the gas that galaxies must consume or eject and powerfully elucidate the physical mechanisms that trigger and then maintain quenching. Only a diffraction-limited space telescope with an aperture of at least 10-12 meters can achieve such spatial resolution in the optical and observe the rest-frame UV light necessary to witness the co-evolution of stars and gas in galaxies undergoing this transition. As most of the development of the present-day red sequence occurred since z ~ 2, and the key diagnostics are rest-frame UV lines, this critical problem is a unique and compelling driver for LUVOIR's aperture, UV coverage, and capabilities for multi-object spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.5">Mapping inflow and outflow with down-the-barrel spectroscopy</head><p>We can now consider the final steps in our view of galactic gas flows with LUVOIR: how CGM gas turns into ISM, and how ISM gas returns to the CGM. What drives the flows that transport mass from the CGM into galaxies, and then back? The inflows are driven primarily by gravity and cooling acting on and within gas that enters the halo in filaments, strips off satellites, or becomes thermally unstable while orbiting in the halo. Gas cooling and gravity are straightforward to implement in models and simulations, even if the emergent behavior they create is hard to simulate. "Feedback"-the general term for mass, momentum, and energy from stars and AGN that influence the course of galactic evolution-is far more complex, because the underlying physical mechanisms span a huge range of density, temperature, energy, and physical scales.

Understanding how feedback operates physically to influence galaxies as they grow is an active and abiding challenge in the astrophysics of galaxies. Theoretical models of how flows develop and propagate for various sources and physical mechanisms, including winds and radiation pressure from main-sequence OB stars, the collective effects of correlated supernovae, and jets and winds from AGN. At their best these models make specific predictions for the mass and energy transport, velocity and acceleration profiles, and time evolution of these flows as a function of the source properties (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Murray et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, Thompson et al. 2011</ref>). These trends are often then implemented as "subgrid" prescriptions in large-scale numerical simulations that attempt to recover realistic galaxy populations and internal properties. These prescriptions are labeled "sub-grid" because they occur at sub-kiloparsec scales that cosmological simulations still cannot resolve.</p><p>Observers can test these physical models of feedback, but with a major limitation. Some bulk properties of galactic outflows can be revealed by spectroscopy that uses the driving sources themselveswhether AGN or star-forming regions-as background sources, in a so called "downthe-barrel" spectrum. Inflow is detected as redshifted absorption and/or emission, while outflow is blueshifted. Often the observed profiles include absorption and emission from separate portions of the gas, which must be teased apart to reveal the details of the flow. The major limitation of current "down-the-barrel" measurements is that they typically cover most or all of a galaxy's disk, so the observed profiles average over a large number of individual sources, erasing the source-by-source variations in energy and mass that trace the key physical variables. Nevertheless, this technique has successfully demonstrated a correlation between gas velocity, star formation rates, and star formation surface density <ref type="bibr">(Martin 2005</ref>) and star formation surface density ( <ref type="bibr">Kornei et al. 2012</ref>), with galaxies with higher star formation rates exhibiting higher outflow velocities. These signatures get stronger as the sightline approaches the galaxy's semi-minor axis, suggesting that the flows are biconical in shape and emerge up out of the disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Bordoloi et al. 2014</ref>), as also seen in hydrodynamical simulations. Downthe-barrel measurements of small "greenpea galaxies" have examined the escape of ionizing radiation from their star-forming regions using UV/optical line ratios ( <ref type="bibr">Henry et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>To resolve the physics at scales closer to the actual sources, astronomers using Hubble's COS instrument are making pioneering measurements of 16 individual clusters in the face-on nearby galaxy M83 (D = 4.6 Mpc). This program (Program 14681, PI Aloisi) is observing 16 UV-bright clusters across the face of M83, to map out the gas flows emerging from them individually. This program requires 40 orbits to execute, so doing 10 times as many clusters or a few galaxies would be a large or very large allocation of Hubble time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.8 shows the potential of the LUMOS multi-object mode to transcend these limitations and fully resolve these outflows. In particular, LUMOS could probe the launch-points for winds across the face of a spiral galaxy by observing its individual OB associations, providing a measure of the energy injection needs for launching winds.

Not only will LUMOS enable the dissection of flows at small scales, but the multiplexing of the microshutter arrays provides a huge efficiency gain that will enable maps of resolved flows for a wide range of galaxies in the nearby Universe. It is critical to understand the wind-expulsion history of galaxies as a function of mass, as the winds are likely critical for shaping the stellar mass-halo and mass-metallicity relationships of galaxies, which depend strongly on galaxy mass. This is best accomplished by high-S/N, high-resolution spectroscopy with broad UV wavelength coverage. The wavelength coverage, notably to wavelengths as short as l~1000 Å, is critical. If we are to understand galaxy transformation and the role that winds may play in it, the ability to observe these flows at the relevant small scales is needed. 8. LUMOS will perform intensive multi-object spectroscopy of star-forming regions, ISM gas, and galactic outflows in nearby galaxies. Here we show the footprint of the LUMOS multi-object mode overlaid on the nearby galaxy M83 at 4.6 Mpc. At this distance, the LUMOS microshutters subtend 2-3 parsecs.

Over this time, some grow by forming stars and merging with their neighbors to become big galaxies with prominent bulges and massive disks hosting violently active black holes. Those that grow too big too fast can "quench," ceasing to form stars and then evolving passively as their stars age. Other galaxies remain small, perhaps eventually merging into larger ones. Nature makes galaxies of these kinds and every type in between, and no theory of origins will be complete without a full understanding of how this happened. Why will galaxy formation remain Signature Science in the era of LUVOIR, even after JWST and the ELTs? In short, none of these highly capable facilities will be able to achieve LUVOIR's unique combination of depth, resolution, and mapping efficiency. Depth allows us to see the smallest building blocks of galaxies. With enough resolution we can look inside galaxies at small physical scales, breaking down their formation at a level of detail that isolates the key physical processes. Finally, any observational insights must be backed by statistically significant samples collected with a high mapping efficiency or speed.

LUVOIR will expand the faint frontier to the smallest relevant scales over nearly the whole of cosmic time.</p><p>In the modern universe, galaxies occupy an enormous range of mass from giant ellipticals at M* &gt; 10 12 M  to ultra faints at M* &lt; 10 4 M  . In the prevailing hierarchical paradigm, all galaxies of any substantial size grow from the steady accumulation of gas and by the successive mergers of many smaller galactic components in what is known as a merger tree. Every giant galaxy has many dwarfs in its past; our own Milky Way has evidently accumulated many such dwarfs over its history. Within the next few hundred million years, it will acquire the two Magellanic Clouds in a minor merger with the even more dramatic major merger with Andromeda to follow. Telling the full story of galaxy formation starts with being able to work backwards through this tree of galactic origins to see the roots, and this requires pushing back the faint frontier. The brightest galaxies at any redshift will tend to be the seeds of the brightest galaxies at any later time. The galaxies we see at the dawn of time with Hubble, and soon with JWST, are not the earliest seeds of galaxies like our Milky Way. While we can probably reach Milky Way-like progenitors as far back as z = 6 with JWST <ref type="bibr">(Okrochkov &amp; Tumlinson 2010)</ref>, what we see will be the main trunk of the tree, not the hundreds of other branches that existed at that time. But what is the minimum threshold for galaxy formation that LUVOIR should try to reach?</p><p>The faint frontier expanded in an unexpected direction with the discovery of ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. These galaxies are gravitationally bound but possess only ~10 5 M  of stars, or even less, with characteristic radii of only 100-300 parsecs. They were first detected as slight over-densities in the all-sky star map produced the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( <ref type="bibr">Willman et al. 2005</ref>). The UFDs are now believed to be the ancient "fossils" of tiny galaxies that formed 80-90% of their stars before or during the epoch of reionization <ref type="bibr">(Ricotti &amp; Gnedin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Brown et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weisz et al. 2014</ref>), like those first galaxies that preceded our own Milky Way. If so, then the ultimate faint frontier lies where we can detect the UFD scale over the full sweep of cosmic time.</p><p>We demonstrate the power LUVOIR will bring to such a study by deriving the plausible mass limits reached as a function of redshift in a single very deep exposure. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.10 shows the stellar mass range that defines the dwarf populations of galaxies, with the UDFs at the minimum threshold (as we currently know it). The figure also shows the limits achievable by telescope of varying size, including Hubble, JWST, and the two LUVOIR architectures. The High Definition Imager will enable LUVOIR users to reach the extreme low mass end (M* &lt; 10 5.5 M  ) of the stellar mass limit at many redshifts in a deep survey (AB ~ 33-34) and wider surveys of 10 6 -10 7 M  systems in much shorter exposures.</p><p>Only LUVOIR will be able to detect galaxies at the scale of the Ultra-Faints when they are still forming stars. This capability will reveal the entire grand sweep of galaxy formation to the earliest times, permitting full reconstruction of mass functions and merger trees. LUVOIR will also be able to trace the relationships between massive galaxies and their faintest satellites, which respond to details of the gas and star formation physics in complex ways that are still poorly understood. LUVOIR can, for instance, probe the relationship between L* galaxies and their faintest satellites, looking for evidence of when and now dwarf galaxies can be quenched by their larger, quenched neighbors ("conformal quenching") for  </p></div>

Using Hubble, astronomers have surveyed large samples of galaxies during the rise and fall of cosmic star formation <ref type="bibr">(Madau &amp; Dickinson 2014</ref>). These studies have mapped out the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate ( <ref type="bibr">Whitaker et al. 2012</ref>), and traced the rise of quenched galaxies on the red sequence almost back to its beginnings ( <ref type="bibr">Kriek et al. 2009</ref>). Perhaps the greatest surprise from this work is how small galaxies appear to be at early times. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure  5</ref>.12 shows that the red sequence is already identifiable at z ~ 2-3, but with most of its quenched galaxies occupying only a few kpc in size. Indeed, star forming galaxies at these redshifts average several times larger than passive galaxies at the same mass. How do these galaxies quench, and do they actually get smaller as they do? Hubble itself has struggled to address what happens inside galaxies at these early times because its diffraction limit corresponds to physical scales of 300-400 pc at z = 2-3. Hubble images place only a few pixels across these small yet massive galaxies at high redshift. This is sufficient to marginally resolve galaxy disks, but not the smaller-scale processes at work within them. It is also sufficient to detect ~1 kpc star-forming clumps <ref type="bibr">(Elmegreen et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">(Elmegreen et al. , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Forster Schreiber et al. 2011</ref>), but large clumps may be blended collections of smaller star-forming regions ( <ref type="bibr">Tamburello et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rigby et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Bordoloi et al. 2016</ref>), even if the clumps are like the largest and brightest in our immediate neighborhood, 30 Doradus in the LMC (diameter d ~200 pc) and the Carina Nebula (d ~ 140 pc).</p><p>We know that galaxies have structure on 100 pc scales because of evidence from the few cases where natural gravitational telescopes are provided by foreground galaxy clusters <ref type="bibr">(Figure 5.13)</ref>. In these rare cases, Hubble probes individual starforming regions in ways that illustrate the power of LUVOIR. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.13 shows an example, where Hubble reveals two dozen star-forming clumps in a lensed galaxy, with radii of 30-50 pc. These clumps have the sizes and luminosities of the brightest starforming regions in the nearby universe, and none would be resolvable to Hubble without lensing. The lensing reconstruction of this lensed galaxy provides a rare view of what distant star-forming galaxies actually look like. Convolving this truth image with the scaled empirical Hubble PSF shows which features LUVOIR can recover, as a function of aperture. LUVOIR's users will be able to recover almost all the star-forming clumps in the F390W filter. This simulation shows that for LUVOIR, any distant galaxy can be imaged with the sharpness that Hubble can now achieve for the most favorable gravitationally lensed systems, which cover only a tiny fraction of the sky. LUVOIR would therefore be able to survey star formation down to 100 pc scales for thousands of galaxies, which is terra incognita. Galaxy death, or quenching and compactification: The mystery of how galaxies "die"-or cease to form stars at any significant level-is one of the most abiding</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5-24</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report in astrophysics. Edwin Hubble's original tuning fork (1926) captured the basic truth that some galaxies are disky, blue, and star-forming, while others are spherical, redder, and quiescent. Numerous complex and overlapping mechanisms from stellar feedback to AGN and mergers have been proposed to turn star-forming galaxies into quenched ones, but there is still no definitive physical understanding of this basic phenomenon.</p><p>The presence of fully quenched galaxies at high redshifts z &gt; 2 is surprising enough, but even more so are the extremely compact sizes of many of these galaxies. Ultracompact galaxies pack a Milky Way's worth of stars, 10 11 M  or more, into a kiloparsec or less. These galaxies are only marginally resolved by Hubble, with &gt; 50% of their total light falling onto just one or a few pixels. Yet these galaxies are possibly the earliest progenitors of today's massive ellipticals, and if so they are a key part of the galaxy formation puzzle.</p><p>To unravel the origins of these mysterious galaxies, we must be able to resolve their internal structures, to measure stellar content and ages of their stellar populations, to look for internal gradients in age, to follow internal dynamics, and to trace all these quantities over time as this population arises. This is Signature Science for LUVOIR owing to its exquisite spatial resolution, 100 pc or better at all redshifts, which will allow us to map the internal structures and permit age dating of stellar populations at small scales. LUVOIR's broad UV/optical coverage and collecting area are also essential to this problem: restframe UV and optical colors are much more sensitive indicators of population age than are the optical/IR colors available with JWST. LUVOIR will surpass JWST on both counts, both in terms of physical resolution and the diagnostics that can be measured at that resolution. The same is true of ground-based telescopes, over small fields, which will exceed LUVOIR's raw spatial resolution with extreme NIR extreme AO, but will struggle to reach the same depths and cannot apply rest frame UV star formation diagnostics. Figure 5.15. At z ~ 2, massive galaxies of surprisingly small size are already "red and dead." These "ultracompact" red galaxies are likely the progenitors of today's massive ellipticals. They may have formed in a monolithic collapse, by compaction of star-forming progenitors, or gas rich major mergers are possibilities. Why did they stop forming stars so early, and why have they not resumed in the 10+ billion years since? At z ~ 2, these galaxies are very poorly resolved by Hubble, and JWST will do little better. LUVOIR will resolve these galaxies' internal structures to measure age gradients and dynamics that reflect their origins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Dissecting galaxies one star at a time</head><p>Our ability to determine when galaxies assemble their stellar populations, and how that process depends on environment is a fundamental component to any robust theory of galaxy formation. By definition, the dwarf galaxies we see today are not the same as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that were disrupted during assembly. Our only insight into those disrupted building blocks comes from sifting through the resolved field populations of the surviving giant galaxies to reconstruct the star-formation history, chemical evolution, and kinematics of their various structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Brown et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Resolved stellar populations are cosmic clocks and assay meters that can assess the age and metallicity of their galaxies using well-defined relationships obeyed by stellar luminosity and color. Their most direct and accurate age diagnostic comes from resolving both the dwarf and giant stars, including the main sequence turnoff. As demonstrated by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program (PHAT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Dalcanton et al. 2012</ref>), fitting stellar evolution models to CMDs can reveal not only when star formation occurred in Andromeda, but how episodic it is, and how it varies across the disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b463">Williams et al. 2014</ref>). This work highlights both the need for the survey depth required to obtain a CMD accurate enough to differentiate between models and the ability to map across as much of a galaxy as possible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5-26</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report</p><p>Unfortunately, the main sequence turnoff is too faint to detect with any existing telescope for galaxies beyond the Local Group, and beyond this the increasingly severe effects of crowding become an even more fundamental limit. Both effects greatly hinder our ability to infer much about the details of galactic assembly because the galaxies in the Local Group are not representative of the galaxy population at large. LUVOIR will transform our ability to determine stellar histories by leveraging both light gathering power and spatial resolution, extending our reach beyond the Local Group, and thus significantly increasing the diversity of galaxies we can study.</p><p>We consider two types of surveys by way of example. First, we consider the distances that can be reached for characterization of diffuse (i.e., non-crowded) stellar populations in nearby galaxies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.16 shows a cartoon of the local Universe with galaxies in their actual positions and marked by type. In this view, 24 Mpc across, a 15-m LUVOIR can reach the main-sequence turnoff at SNR = 5 in 100 hours (V and I). For diffuse populations, this capability can be used to probe faint dwarfs or age-date the outer regions of massive galaxies. At closer distances, these observations can be collected over time to build up the timeline of proper motion and work out galaxy motions in 3D (see Chapter 6).</p><p>For a second type of survey, we consider regions where crowding comes into play. LUVOIR's spatial resolution will enable usable photometry at much higher stellar densities than smaller telescopes. The PHAT program has empirically determined that usably accurate photometry can be obtained in UVOIR images up to a surface density of ~15 stars per square arcsecond with Hubble. Scaling this limit up by 1/D 2 , we find that a 15-meter LUVOIR could detect the main sequence turnoff out to 5 Mpc, working with up to 400 stars per square arcsecond before crowding becomes prohibitive ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">Figure 5</ref>.17).</p><p>LUVOIR will work in concert with 30m-class ground-based telescopes expanding our reach to other well-populated galaxy groups, with LUVOIR obtaining photometry of G dwarfs stars down to V~34 mag, and the ground obtaining kinematics of much brighter giants out to the Coma Sculptor Cloud. The dwarf stars in the Coma Sculptor Cloud are effectively inaccessible to the ground, requiring gigaseconds of integration even for an isolated star.</p><p>This capability for studies of resolved and semi-resolved stellar populations has a wide range of applications from mapping the history of star formation in galaxies to assessing the impact or reionization at the smallest scales. The LUVOIR HDI ETC and the CMD tool, linked here, provide prospective users with the opportunity to derive the requirements for their own applications.</p></div>

On cosmological scales, the total mass-energy density is almost precisely equal to the critical value. Most of the mass-energy density is in the dark energy component and one quarter of the total is a cold dark matter (CDM) component. There is a complex interplay between the cosmic expansion history, dark matter, radiation, and baryons, which yield many of the observable elements in the universe. Yet we are still working towards ascertaining the true nature of dark energy and dark matter. Furthermore, our models for galaxy formation and evolution from the birth of the first stars through the era of reionization, and on to the present, remain rudimentary.</p><p>Using ground-and space-based observatories through the early 2030s, we will make significant inroads in our understanding of the cosmic "dark sector" and the properties of galaxy building blocks in the early universe. This drives many of the science objectives of JWST, Euclid, LSST, WFIRST, and the planned 20-m to 40-m ground-based telescopes. Yet these telescopes will not reach beyond a specific frontier that we already recognize as critical for a comprehensive understanding of structure formation in the universe. This frontier exists at the scales of the lowest mass galaxies (with total masses ≤ 10 6 M  that we know are there, from the first sparks of galaxy formation at z&gt;10 to the least luminous dwarf galaxies in the present day. These galaxies map to physical scales as small as 10 kpc and with stellar concentrations as small as 100 parsecs. At these size and mass scales, we enter regimes where competing scenarios for the evolution of the dark matter density field, and its associated baryonic structures, make distinguishable predictions that can be robustly tested with observations that reach fainter than AB = 33 mag.</p><p>To explore this ultra-faint regime, we require LUVOIR, which (for the 15-m architecture) will be capable of resolving &lt; 100 parsec scales at all redshifts while reaching a 5-s point source limiting AB magnitude of 33 (0.23 nJy) in just 10 hours and ~35 mag (0.04 nJy) in ~10 days. Three novel observational regimes that require LUVOIR are described in this chapter:</p><p>1) The dark matter power spectrum on scales below 100 kpc: Between the universe's horizon scale and galactic scales, the structure we measure is consistent with dark matter being entirely non-relativistic and non-interacting. This does not uniquely identify a specific fundamental particle for dark matter, however. Indeed, several candidate particle classes are allowed by existing observations. This has motivated work on dark matter particle candidates that, on astronomical scales, have ensemble behaviors consistent with being "warm" (mildly relativistic) and/or "self-interacting."</p><p>The microphysics of the interactive or radiative properties of dark matter influences the nature of structure on various scales and epochs in time. Specifically, the imprint of dark matter physics manifests at scales below 100 kpc (corresponding to the scale of self-gravitating halos of a few million solar masses) in the statistics and shapes of these structures as functions of size and mass over cosmic time.</p><p>2) The limits of galaxy assembly in the pico-Jansky regime: Associating galaxies with the underlying dark matter structure requires modeling the interplay of cooling mechanisms, the epoch of reionization, and feedback effects from star formation and AGN. The most massive dark matter halos have long baryonic cooling times, with stars</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

Very low mass halos are not able to retain a steady pool of star-forming baryons due to ionizing radiation that is keeping the universe transparent to this light. The source of the ionizing photons likely comes from a great abundance of starforming, low mass galaxies. The bulk of the physical processes that dominate the early formation and evolution of cosmic structure all take place on scales below 10 kpc. This corresponds to minuscule volumes within massive galaxies, or in dwarf galaxies,</p><p>The State of the Field in the 2030s</p><p>By the year 2035, HST, Euclid, WFIRST, and JWST will have completed their missions and LSST will have achieved its 10-year survey depth. At least two 20-40 meter class ground-based optical-NIR observatories will be operational. SKA should be online and creating deep maps of the neutral hydrogen distribution out to high redshifts. LUVOIR will be following on the success of these facilities by bringing unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the ultraviolet and optical regime.</p><p>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST): Deep NIRCam surveys with JWST will exist down to AB = 31.5 mag (for 0.1" diameter source with 500 ksec exposure time). This will allow JWST users to discover many new ultra-faint sources but will still not be deep enough for many of the luminosity regimes we need to reach to fully map the assembly of structure from small-scale components at 6 &lt; z &lt; 10.</p><p>LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST: These sky survey telescopes will detect many new faint dwarf galaxies in the local universe but will not have the resolution to characterize their morphological structure in detail nor measure their proper motions. However, these targets can be studied with LUVOIR.</p><p>Extremely Large Telescopes on the Ground: These facilities will have similar angular resolution as LUVOIR in the NIR but will have difficulty detecting sources fainter than AB ~ 31 mag due to the brightness of the night sky. The spectroscopic capabilities of such 20-40 meter telescopes will be a superb complement to the imaging power of LUVOIR.</p><p>Square Kilometer Array: The SKA will perform wide-area deep imaging of the neutral hydrogen gas at cosmological distances (z &lt; 10) and will provide the knowledge of where to target deep imaging with LUVOIR to study the role of reionization suppression of star formation.</p><p>LUVOIR: In the context of studying the building blocks of galaxies, LUVOIR will reach stellar mass limits typical of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies at all redshifts. LUVOIR observers will detect sources with fluxes fainter than AB = 33 mag, where reionization suppression of star formation is predicted to be important. LUVOIR will also extend dwarf galaxy detection out to 25 Mpc in the local universe, and allow observers to detect directly the sources of ionizing radiation in the cosmos and characterize the energy distribution of that ionizing radiation. Its high precision astrometric stability and calibration, will allow the measurement of transverse velocities of stars within Local Group galaxies to directly measure mass density profiles and to map the gravitational fields around nearby galaxies by measuring satellite orbits within their central halos. This information will provide additional constraints on the kinematics and the nature of dark matter.</p></div>

Such observations will be transformational as they will reveal star and galaxy populations not yet seen with current or planned telescopes.</p><p>3) The history of ionizing light from observations shortwards of rest-frame 900 Å: To complete our understanding of the emergence of structure, we must characterize the influence that ionizing radiation has on early galaxies. Directly observing ionizing photons at the epoch of reionization is effectively impossible due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium to the ionizing photons of that epoch. LUVOIR will leverage its FUV and UV sensitivity and resolution to directly detect weak Lyman continuum radiation escaping from z&lt;1 galaxies in a spatially resolved manner for multiple objects per pointing, revealing the environmental factors that favor the escape of radiation, providing crucial data on how light escaped galaxies during the epoch of reionization at z ≥ 7.</p><p>With LUVOIR, the community acquires a unique and unmatched combination of sensitivity and volume to observe, across most of cosmic time and in many different intergalactic environments, what the universe actually does on spatial scales where the confluence of the matter power spectrum, dark matter physics, and baryonic processes all interplay. LUVOIR will accomplish this by extending our census of dwarf galaxies to much fainter limits in the current epoch and extend that census, at brighter limits, across the last 13 billion years. This will allow LUVOIR users to establish the direct connection between the current-epoch matter power spectrum with its early progenitors. With such information, we can directly distinguish between competing dark matter models that show significant differentiation on scales below 100 kpc. LUVOIR investigators will also directly observe the impact of reionization on early star formation by measuring the galaxy luminosity function well below limits achievable with current or planned telescopes. Finally, LUVOIR will enable a direct characterization of that ionizing radiation by acquiring the spectra of UV light escaping from galaxies at wavelengths below rest-frame 900 Å, something only a large-aperture UV-sensitive telescope can accomplish.</p><p>The Signature Science Cases discussed in this chapter represent some of the most compelling types of observing programs on the building blocks of structure that scientists might do with LUVOIR at the limits of its performance. As compelling as they are, they should not be taken as a complete specification LUVOIR's future potential in these areas. We have developed concrete examples to ensure that the nominal design can do this compelling science. We fully expect that the creativity of the community, empowered by the revolutionary capabilities of the observatory, will ask questions, acquire data, and solve problems beyond those discussed here-including those that we cannot envision today.</p></div>

There is evidence that the ensemble of dwarf galaxies is primarily responsible for the reionization of the universe and for maintaining its transparency to ultraviolet radiation. The space density and internal structure of these galaxies are closely connected to the fundamental properties of the dark matter particle, the level and duration of reionization, and the granular limits of the galaxy formation process. To date, limits on the thermal signature of dark matter have been placed by studies of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through Lymanalpha forest statistics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Viel et al. 2013</ref>), strong gravitational lensing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Li et al. 2016)</ref>, and dwarf-galaxy-scale statistics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Kim et al. 2017</ref>).

Dark matter particles may be significantly colder (more massive) yet be interacting (either self-interacting or with a dark matter-baryon interaction mechanism), or have more nuanced properties that fall outside of the currently popular prescriptions for dark matter candidates (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Buckley &amp; Peter 2018)</ref>. Each type of dark matter property manifests itself on astronomical scales through a gravitational signature, in the statistical description of dark matter structure. Our measure of this signature is through the matter power spectrum today, as well as at earlier cosmic times. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.1 illustrates the matter power spectrum behavior for several dark matter cases compared to CDM. At wave numbers above k ≈ 10h/Mpc, corresponding to scales well below that of the Milky Way Galaxy, the distinctions between these power spectra are significant. The k ≈ 10 h/Mpc scale corresponds to total mass scales in the 10 9 to 10 10 M  range. These correspond to classical dwarf galaxies, which have stellar masses of less than 10 5 to 10 6 M  and are fainter than M V = -10 mag. As we approach smaller scales,</p></div>

Halos of total mass of 10 7 M  have stellar masses as low as just tens of solar masses. In the current epoch, such systems have visual absolute magnitudes between -2 and 0. This defines the capability level LUVOIR targets. By the early 2020s, the Dark Energy Survey and LSST will have completed the census of dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way Galaxy. In the spirit that each massive galaxy's satellite galaxies provide just one "draw" of the underlying physics that gives rise to this population, we must expand on that sample by surveying the satellite dwarf population associated with massive galaxies similar to our own Milky Way. By the late 2020s, JWST and ELTs will have the sensitivity to extend the dwarf satellite galaxy search out to several Mpc. Dwarf galaxies are identified through detection of their constituent stars, as long as the membership of those stars can be confidently determined, through colors or spectroscopy over an extended field of view. LUVOIR will extend this sensitivity, using horizontal branch stars, to far beyond the Virgo Cluster's 16.5 Mpc distance. This has multiple advantages. First, a sample of massive and Milky Way-analog galaxies provides multiple "draws" similar to our well-studied Galaxy. Second, this much larger volume gives us access to an enormous dynamic range of environments, so that dwarf galaxies can be studied in both volatile and quiescent states.</p><p>LUVOIR's sensitivity, angular resolution, and Nyquist sampling will deliver transformative measurements on the smallest galactic scales. We highlight the potential breakthroughs in this field by presenting two dramatically different (but connected) periods in the history of the universe: the extended local volume in the current epoch (out to a luminosity distance of ~30 Mpc, or z = 0.008), and the early universe, 13 Gyr in the past (at z~7), about half-way through the reionization transition era from a visually opaque to a transparent universe.</p></div>

Galaxies out to 40 Mpc from us, with masses comparable to the Milky Way, are being systematically surveyed for dwarf galaxies as faint as M V = -12.3 mag (comparable to the Leo-I Galactic dwarf; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Geha et al 2017)</ref>. These surveys are identifying dwarf galaxies that are current-epoch analogs to the early galaxies responsible for re-ionizing the universe (e.g., Boylan-Kolchin et al 2015). The potential connections are complex, however. Many of the faintest local dwarf galaxies detected are chemically enriched relative to their early-universe counterparts. The stars in these low-mass neighbors of our Galaxy are created, in part, through inefficient molecular cooling while, at the same time, experience additional quenching effects from an intense ionizing radiation field. Exploring the connections between local dwarf galaxies and corresponding properties in the early universe suggests that even JWST will not be able to detect the full complement of dwarf galaxies at early times by several magnitudes of sensitivity (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.6 and <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.8).</p><p>To make a major breakthrough in understanding the connection between dwarf galaxies and the mass-scales of their dark matter halos will require the detection and characterization of significant samples of faint and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in a range of environments over a wide span of cosmic time.

The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.2 for sample sizes of 4 and 16 Milky Way-like satellite systems. The error bars shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.2 have been magnified by a factor of 7 to make them visible in this plot. These calculations begin by adopting an empirical relation between dark matter halo masses and their stellar mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(Bullock &amp; Boylan-Kolchin 2017</ref>) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6.</ref>3), although how reliable this is in the regime of the true ultra-faint galaxies is the focus of ongoing work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Kim et al. 2017)</ref>. At the low-mass end of the galaxy distribution, the effects of star formation suppression due to an intergalactic ionizing background flux can be significant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Barber et al (2014)</ref> develop a semi-analytic description of this effect</p></div>

In a rigorous treatment of the physics of galaxy formation, many other evolutionary effects can affect the survival and apparent properties of individual dwarf galaxies. However, as we are considering the possibility of acquiring broadly complete samples of dwarf galaxies around massive systems, including those that extend towards the parent halos' virial radii, we begin by including only this dominant suppression signature of reionization. Finally, a relation between the adjusted differential mass function and the corresponding power spectrum within specified scale-ranges is needed. While aspects of this connection have long been explored (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Eisenstein &amp; Hu 1999</ref>), the method derived by <ref type="bibr">Schneider (2015)</ref> is particularly practical and that is what we have used for this calculation. A LUVOIR program to obtain the needed constraints on the small-scale matter power spectrum would begin with two contiguous chevrons of HDI observations for each target. Each strip extends from the central galaxy out to about half the virial radius (~100 kpc); one strip is along the analog's major axis, and the other is along its minor axis. In addition, we would observe a number of random positions within the central 100 kpc to ensure we achieve a 50% filling fraction of the survey region (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.4 for a survey layout centered on NGC 3810). This survey approach samples one quarter of the total virial-radius volume.</p><p>The dwarf galaxies discovered from these observations are then used to estimate the census of the compete population within the entire virial volume of each central galaxy targeted in the survey. The advantage of LUVOIR for this study is that the combination of its sensitivity and survey efficiency is unachievable by any current or planned platform, on the ground or in  space, by orders of magnitude. With these representative surveys of luminous dwarfs in each system, we then use the abundancematching framework to transform this to a mass function. The mass function is then compared with that predicted for the CDM-derived matter power spectrum (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schneider 2015)</ref>. By targeting multiple systems that are as similar to the Milky Way as possible, and assuming that each one is an effective "draw" on the properties of the underlying physics that results in the populations we observe, we can estimate both the power spectrum's amplitude and its measurement uncertainty (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.2) on several spatial scales corresponding to those in the derived mass functions. A LUVOIR survey to characterize the dwarf galaxy mass function around Milky Way analogs will provide the degree of accuracy we need to distinguish between different dark matter scenarios at &gt;4s significance as <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.2 demonstrates. The targeted galaxies will be in hand as several Milky-Way scale galaxies have already been identified out to 40 Mpc (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Danieli et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Geha et al 2017)</ref>. Indeed, dwarfs within the nearer systems have been identified to M V =-9 mag, and to M V =-12 mag in the more distant systems. A LUVOIR deep imaging survey around Milky Way analog systems within 15 Mpc will reach down to be to the horizontal branch (M V =0 mag) in dwarf galaxies detected in these systems, reaching the limits of dwarf galaxy formation. The LUMOS instrument could be operated in parallel during this type of survey to simultaneously map the absorption features from the circumgalactic medium of the central galaxy. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.5 demonstrates the potential of a Nyquist-sampled imager to detect and characterize different stellar populations on space telescopes of various aperture sizes. The individual horizontal branch or red giant branch stars (depending on distance) will be detectable within each candidate dwarf galaxy. Many of the dwarf galaxy systems identified with LUVOIR will be superb targets for ELTs, given the precise positions and properties to aim for. The least luminous candidates in many target Milky Way analogs will be fainter than AB = 31 mag and would likely require additional LUVOIR observations.</p><p>The internal structural profiles of dwarf galaxies in the local universe will also be feasible as these systems will be extremely well resolved with LUVOIR. For example, the FWHM of the PSF of the 15-m LUVOIR HDI instrument in the r-band (650 nm) is 9 milliarcseconds. An individual dwarf galaxy analogous to the Virgo-I dwarf with a halflight radius size of ~20 parsecs would, at the Virgo Cluster's distance, subtend ~0.50 <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.5.

The distances shown here are for a S/N = 5 optical detection with a fiducial 10-hour integration in the V-band. In such an observation, observers using the 15.1m LUVOIR could detect RGB stars out to 16 Mpc and horizontal branch stars out to 40 Mpc. With a 100-hour integration, the 15.1-m LUVOIR will have the ability to detect individual RGB stars out to 29 Mpc.</p></div>

The faintend slope of the galaxy luminosity function becomes quite steep by z~7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Bouwens et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Finkelstein et al. 2015</ref>), which implies that if galaxies exist at luminosities below the current detection limits, then these ultra-faint dwarf galaxies should be the dominate sources for reionizing the universe. Gravitationally magnified Hubble Frontier Field data do show high-redshift galaxies, which are at least 100 times fainter in luminosity than previously observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(Livermore, Finkelstein and Lotz 2017)</ref>. However, the steep faint-end slope cannot continue to indefinitely faint galaxies-there must be a turnover or cutoff. As such, the behavior of the luminosity function at the faint end should reveal the degree to which faint galaxies powered cosmic reionization. As in the local universe, the dark matter power spectrum defines the scaffolding upon which high-redshift dwarf galaxies are built. Star formation within dwarf galaxies then plays multiple roles, not the least of which is as a source of ionizing photons. While there are not yet enough identified z ≥ 7 sources of ionizing photons to account for the universe's far UV transparency at z &lt; 6 (e.g., Schenker 2015), the balance would tip in favor of high-z galaxies if there are large numbers of them that are fainter than what we presently can detect. After reionization, the UV background should suppress star-formation and gas accretion onto halos at log (M/M  ) &lt; 9 (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Iliev et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Mesinger &amp; Dijkstra 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Alvarez et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">, Jaacks et al. 2013</ref>).

Existing Hubble observations of the Frontier Fields clusters have found no evidence for such a turnover down to M UV ≈ -14 mag, which corresponds to log (M/M  ) ≈ 9.5. A direct test requires pushing fainter, down to at least M = -13 mag. The apparent luminosity of such faint sources at z ~ 7 corresponds to tens of picoJanskys. LUVOIR will be capable of detecting extended sources at such low flux levels with a survey of several hundred hours per pointing, which would directly test the hypothesis that the UV background suppresses star formation and produces a significant turnover in the low-mass galaxy luminosity function. Finkelstein (priv. comm.) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Jaacks et al. (2013)</ref> have placed important constraints on the shape of the faint-end of the z=7 luminosity function. Using the modified form of the Schechter luminosity function with a turnover as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Jaacks et al. (2013)</ref>, the rest-frame UV luminosity function may exhibit a turnover that is detectable at, and fainter than, an absolute UV magnitude around M = -13.5 mag. Abundancematching with current best estimates of the UV luminosity function implies that this corresponds to halo masses log (M h /M  ) ≈ 9 at z = 7, consistent with theoretical expectations for the suppression mass. Observationally, this deviation would start to be seen in NIR passbands at AB ≈ 33 mag. LUVOIR-enabled deep imaging surveys that reach the turnover in galaxy LF that is predicted to occur due to UV background feedback suppression, will directly test this hypothesis. However, there are two additional observational constraints that must be accommodated. The first is that while the luminosity function must turn over, it cannot go to zero, at least not until well below the regime of dwarf galaxy progenitors. The second is the emissivity of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM), which has been estimated using absorption features in z &gt; 6 quasar spectra (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bolton et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Becker &amp; Bolton 2013</ref>). These two constraints set limits on the number of ionizing photons emanating from galaxies at a particular epoch. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.6 shows the predicted number of galaxies per square arcminute per magnitude detected in scenarios with and without a turnover in the differential UV luminosity function. Such a survey would deliver 40% more galaxies (down to -13.5 mag) if no turnover is present. Users of the 15-meter LUVOIR could detect this difference in the number of observed galaxies in a single HDI pointing at a 3-s confidence level in about 340 hours of total exposure time, which includes enough time to observe each field in 3 passbands and is within the time allocation range of a large or multi-cycle treasury program. We have assumed that these ultra-faint z = 7 galaxies are resolved (~0.1 arcsec) with radii in the range of 200-300 parsecs (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Ono et al. 2013</ref>). The 9-m LUVOIR would require about 950 hours per pointing to achieve a similar detection.</p><p>Ideally, LUVOIR users would want to probe to these depths across both ionized and neutral regions (which in the 2030s, we should know of from SKA 21cm mapping, and WFIRST Lyman-α grism mapping; and/ or potential NASA Probe mission Lyman-α intensity mapping). Current theories predict that we should see this turnover in ionized regions, but not in neutral regions. Models of reionization are extremely sensitive to this, as the galaxies near this limit dominate the ionizing emissivity. They dominate the UV luminosity density due to their numbers, but they are also more likely to have larger ionizing escape fractions than their more massive counterparts. A survey consisting of such multiple pointings may only be feasible with the LUVOIR-A design.</p></div>

To demonstrate this, we employ the <ref type="bibr">Gonzalez et al.

In contrast, dark matter halos with highly relativistic particles (i.e., warm dark matter) have smaller central phase-space densities, so that density profiles saturate to form systems with flat central density profiles (constant central cores). Owing to their small masses, dSphs have the highest average phase space densities of any galaxy type, which implies that for a given dark matter model, phase-space limited cores will occupy a larger fraction of the virial radii. Hence, the mean density profile of dSph galaxies is a fundamental constraint on the nature of dark matter. Current observations are unable to measure the density profile slopes within dSph galaxies because of a strong degeneracy between the inner slope of the dark matter density profile and the velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits. Radial velocities alone cannot break this degeneracy even if the present samples of radial velocities are increased to several thousand stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">(Strigari et al. 2007</ref>).

For all the simplicity of this description, significant challenges remain for a quantitative formulation of star formation. The relation between cores and stars is still matter of debate, as is the origin of the distribution of stellar birth masses (the stellar initial mass function, or IMF), the influence of the surrounding environment, and the effects of early dynamical evolution. The reasons for these debates are the significant observational challenges faced by measurements of the relevant quantities (cores and stars at different stages of formation and early evolution), and the fact that we do not have yet a predictive theory covering all stages of star formation. Extant models are able to describe individual observational results, but not link them. For instance, massive stars are notoriously difficult to form in simulations, and observations have not been able to determine how (fragmentation, coalescence) and where they form. Mass segregation has not been tested as a function of environment, nor is known whether it is a dynamical or primordial effect ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Kryukova et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Kirk et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Pang et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Elmegreen et al. 2014</ref>). Star clusters eject stars via N-body relaxation; the frequency of these runaways, which is around 4% in the Milky Way, has neither been established in other galaxies, nor studied as a function of a galaxy's properties and environment. We are also still struggling to establish whether age spreads exist in young clusters, although some evidence for this exists for the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with a spread of a few Myr. The two problems feed into each other: without a theory, we cannot unequivocally interpret the observations of resolved or unresolved stars; and without unambiguous measurements, we cannot formulate a theory. In order to break this circular ambiguity, we need to perform unambiguous measurements of the early stages of star formation and the stellar IMF in a vast range of environments and parent galaxy properties, to guide models and finally achieve one of the key goals of modern astrophysics: a theory of "how stars form."</p><p>Accomplishing the characterization and quantification of star formation and the stellar IMF will require the synergistic combination of observations from a broad wavelength range, UV to millimeter. This combination is partially offered by current (Hubble, ALMA, VLT, etc.), upcoming (JWST), and planned (30m-class ground-based telescopes) facilities.

Yet these stars can heavily influence their surrounding environment; for instance, they can provide between 25% and 50% of the ionizing photon flux from the host cluster.

This will test theories of low-mass star formation, and constrain variations of the low-end of the stellar initial mass function in low-density environments. ALMA will have characterized the populations of gas cores in several nearby galaxies, and will have shed light on the relation between the core mass function and the stellar initial mass function around the low mass turnover. Improved models will help interpret the complex chemistry of the pre-stellar cores. In parallel, adaptive optics-assisted 30-m class telescopes will have assembled large samples of binary stars at a range of masses out to the Magellanic Clouds, using both radial velocity (RV) and proper motion techniques. Combinations of these facilities will have increased the number of candidate galaxy hosts of very massive stars, i.e., stars with masses &gt; 150 M  , by at least tenfold, up from the current census of a handful.</p><p>By 2030 NASA's TESS mission will have identified a thousand planets smaller than Neptune with orbital periods less than 40 days around nearby stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Ricker et al. 2014</ref>); we can expect that many will have been further characterized using ground-based (e.g., ELTs) and space-based facilities (e.g., JWST). NASA's WFIRST and ESA's PLATO are expected to launch around 2024 and will extend exoplanet detections out to and beyond the habitable zone, with the latter mission focusing on bright solar-type stars. Groundbased RV monitoring will have extended the statistics of planets larger than Super-Earths out to a few AU (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pepe et al. 2010</ref>). Thus, by 2030 the exoplanet population of nearby stars within a few AU will be fairly well characterized. In relation to planet-forming disks, ALMA will have delivered hundreds of continuum disk images at a resolution of ~5-10 AU in nearby star-forming regions, thus fully characterizing the mid-plane dust emission in the giant planet-forming region. Many of these disks will also have AO-assisted ground-based and/or WFIRST scattered light imagery at similar spatial resolution, probing the population of small grains and the overall disk structure. JWST will have surveyed hundreds of these young stars at a resolution of &gt; 20 AU, and probed material ejected in jets/outflows as well as warm (~500 K) disk gas inside the snowline via medium-resolution (Dv~100 km/s) spectroscopy.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor  </p></div>

Individual cluster stars can only be resolved to the distance of the LMC with Hubble ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">Crowther et al. 2016</ref>). Reaching beyond the Magellanic Clouds, to resolve into individual stars the young populations in the starforming galaxies of the Local Group out to ~1 Mpc (e.g., NGC 6822, IC 1613, NGC 3109, Gr 8, the unusual nearby bright starburst IC 10) will offer a significant increase in the potential number of individually detected VMSs.</p><p>In addition to a census of VMSs within individual clusters, a census of the frequency of VMSs in different environments is required to gauge their overall impact on the evolution of galaxies, and to constrain models for their formation and evolution. Ideally, one would sample a wide range of very young star clusters in as wide a range of galaxies as possible, including luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Presence of VMSs can be inferred using unique UV spectral signatures: P Cygni NV (1240 Å) and CIV (1550 Å) profiles, broad He II (1640 Å) emission, blueshifted OV (1371 Å) wind absorption, and an absence of SiIV (1400 Å) P Cygni profiles. In the optical, a VMS would be easily confused with WR emission from a lower mass O-star. Thus, UV spectroscopy is a key requirement for obtaining a census of VMSs and other massive stars in the nearby Universe, together with quantitative measurements of their properties.</p><p>UV multiplexing (multi-object spectrograph or integral field spectrograph) to obtain spectra of resolved massive stars in clusters out to 0.7-1 Mpc, and spectra of unresolved young, massive star clusters out to 150 Mpc (Arp 220, the prototype ULIRG, is at 77 Mpc distance) is a minimum requirement, and will secure about 200 LIRGs and ~20 ULIRGs. Large detector formats increase efficiency by covering entire star clusters/star-forming regions and/or entire star cluster populations in a single pointing. A large telescope aperture, ~15-m, will ensure both enough sensitivity (~2 hours exposure to reach S/N = 10 at 160 nm on a compact cluster with m AB (FUV) = 23 mag; this is a 1 Myr old, 10 6 M  cluster at a distance of 80 Mpc and embedded in 20 mags of extinction, as expected in Arp 220) and angular resolution for resolving individual stars within clusters out to 0.7-1 Mpc (0.01" resolution in the UV corresponds to a separation of 0.03 pc at 0.7 Mpc distance).

Hydro-dynamical simulations show that massive stars require dense and massive accretion disks to form, as these are needed to overcome the radiation pressure barrier. The disks tend to be unstable and break into complex systems. The resulting properties of the multiple systems (number of companions, distribution of separations [i.e., short vs. long orbital periods], distributions of mass ratios, and their dependence on the stellar mass) are model-dependent. Furthermore, the dynamics of binaries drive the evolution of star clusters while, simultaneously, the combination of cluster dynamics and internal stellar processes determine the internal evolution of each binary <ref type="bibr">(Portegies Zwart et al. 2010</ref>), but, again, there is enormous dependency on uncertain parameters.</p><p>Short-period (spectroscopic) binaries will remain the domain of ground-based telescopes, especially the upcoming integral field spectrographs on adaptive</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

Upcoming AO-assisted red/ near-IR cameras (e.g., ELT/MICADO) may achieve the required level of stability over large FoVs, and deliver proper motions as accurate as 10 mas/yr over 4 years. However, the physical properties of the stars need to be characterized in order to constrain models. This demands measuring the resolved massive stars' winds and photospheric parameters (including bolometric luminosities and masses), which can be accomplished only with spectroscopy of individual stars in the 100-200 nm range ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">Wofford et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Binaries at different stages of evolution within a star cluster have mean separations that change between a few tens and a few thousand AUs <ref type="bibr">(Portegies Zwart et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Resolving binaries with UV spectroscopy at all stages of evolution requires resolving mean separations across a wide range from tens to hundreds of AU; probing a range of environments requires reaching at least the distance of the Magellanic Clouds.

A 30 AU separation is found for a system of two equal-mass late-type B stars (~3 M  each) with a 25-year orbital period. The tens-AU regime is interesting for the investigation of the progenitors of peculiar objects and GRBs, as models suggest massive stars may be interacting in the post-MS phase.

Analysis of spectroscopic features of the integrated light from elliptical galaxies indicates that the slope of the low-end of the IMF becomes steeper, i.e., more bottom heavy, for increasing velocity dispersion (e.g., van <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">Dokkum &amp; Conroy 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Conroy &amp; van Dokkum 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b299">Spiniello et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b300">Spiniello et al. , 2015</ref>), in agreement with results from analyses of the mass-to-light ratio in the same systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Cappellari et al. 2012</ref>). However, measurements of lensed early type galaxies and of IR spectral features have challenged the robustness of IMFsensitive spectral features and of mass-tolight ratio determinations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">Smith et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b297">Smith et al. , 2015</ref>.</p><p>Direct IMF determinations, i.e., counting stars in resolved stellar populations, yield a cleaner result, although current facilities cannot reach far enough to probe a rich range of galaxy properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Geha et al.

Near-future facilities (JWST and WFIRST) will make in-roads for direct star counting in nearby galaxies, mostly in the satellites of the Milky Way. JWST will resolve individual stars down to 0.3 M  for all Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies out to ~0.5 Mpc, and down to the hydrogen burning limit for the nearest dwarfs, thus enabling testing of models of low mass star formation and probing variations of the low-end of the IMF. The IR capabilities on JWST will provide a factor of ~2 improvement in efficiency over HST for detection of low-mass stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">(Geha 2014)</ref>, and repeat observations to separate populations (foreground from external ones) via proper motions will further increase the efficacy of the approach.</p><p>Conversely, the central regions in elliptical galaxies will remain unresolved even with the most powerful telescope we can conceive; so  indirect (integrated population) methods will remain the only option. The central regions of ellipticals appear to be special places in many respects: they host supermassive BHs; show high velocity dispersion/deep potential wells and high [α/Fe] abundance patterns; and are the centers of the first collapsing structures, with very high inferred star formation rates when the bulk of the stars formed, etc. Several physical models for the IMF seem to suggest that these would be prime sites for IMF variation. Among these galaxies are archetypes like M87, M60, and M49 (all Virgo ellipticals), but also the nearby field ellipticals Centaurus A and NGC 3377.</p><p>One of the most promising avenues for constraining the low-end IMF is the exploitation of the surface brightness fluctuation technique at the spectroscopic level, called "fluctuation spectroscopy" (e.g., van <ref type="bibr">Dokkum &amp; Conroy 2014</ref>). The basic idea is the following: for nearby elliptical galaxies the number of giants per pixel is small and so their numbers will fluctuate (via Poisson statistics) from pixel to pixel. One can therefore identify pixels containing relatively few giants. By focusing on "low fluctuation" pixels one can obtain a relatively unobstructed view of main sequence stars, which are easier to model in integrated light than the entire population. The breakpoint is when the mean number of stars per resolution element is &lt; 10 5 , which is where the pixels are dominated by MS stars, and there are very few, if any at all, giants. These resolution elements need to be observed with multi-object spectroscopy between 400 nm and 1000 nm (an extension to the LUMOS bandpass currently under consideration), in order to separate M dwarfs from F and G dwarfs, and infer variations at the low-mass end of the IMF.</p><p>Currently, HST delivers a mean number of stars per resolution element (~0.2") of ~10 7 in the central regions of Virgo ellipticals, implying that an improvement of about a factor 100 in diffraction-limited region area is required. This demands ~0.01" angular resolution spectroscopy over arcminutesized fields. Lack of blue coverage (JWST) or large FoV (e.g., HARMONI on ELT) makes these future facilities inadequate for achieving this goal. For future AO-assisted integral field spectrographs, the main challenge will be to control the stability of the PSF and plate scale over a large FoV at blue wavelengths.

Understanding how and in what environment planets assemble contributes to this science objective in two critical ways: i) by determining which nearby planetary systems are most likely to host lifebearing planets and ii) by constraining planet properties that are not directly observable (e.g., bulk composition), which are important in interpreting the spectra of potential Earthlike planets. Recent high-resolution images of circumstellar disks around young <ref type="bibr">(1-10 Myr)</ref> stars revealed complex structures (e.g., ALMA Partnership 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Wagner et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Andrews et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perez et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">Pohl et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Hendler et al. 2018</ref>), some of which point to advanced planet formation. A few candidate giant planets have been recently detected around Myr-old stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">Sallum et al. 2015</ref>). Short timescales to assemble asteroid-size objects and giant planets are well in line with the evolution and dispersal of gas and dust in the solar nebula <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(Pascucci &amp; Tachibana 2010</ref>). Thus, 1-10 Myr-old circumstellar disks provide an opportunity to study planet formation in action.</p><p>Constraints on planet formation also come from the properties of Gyr-old exoplanets and planetary systems (Chapter 4). Indeed, scaling relations in disks and exoplanets with the mass of the central star strongly suggest that sharp edges and gaps in young disks remain imprinted in the exoplanet population (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Alexander &amp; Pascucci 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b280">Mulders et al. 2015</ref>). In addition, the composition of early planetary atmospheres should inform the formation history of planetary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Cridland et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>At the distances of typical star-forming regions (e.g., Taurus-Auriga or Chamaeleon I), 1 AU corresponds to an angular scale of ~10 mas and gas probing ~1 AU radii will have FWHMs of ~30 km/s. Therefore, the high angular and spectral resolution of LUVOIR is a unique tool for mapping the inner disks where terrestrial planet formation occurs <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>.5). Such highresolution observations will directly link birth environments to the final architecture of the exoplanetary systems. LUVOIR observations of young stars will detect and characterize protoplanets (Section 7.2.1), trace the composition, evolution, and dispersal of planet-forming material (Section 7.2.2), and map protoplanetary material dispersed via disk winds (Section 7.2.3). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Detect and characterize protoplanets</head><p>As protoplanets are likely accreting gas through a circumplanetary disk, multiwavelength observations are necessary to separate disk emission from that produced in an accretion shock and thereby constrain the properties of forming planets. Accreting giant planets will glow in U-and B-band as well as UV and Balmer emission lines (e.g., Hα at 656.3 nm; <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.6), while the disk will start to dominate at ~1000 nm (e.g., Zhu 2015). 30m-class ground-based telescopes with extreme AO systems will be diffraction limited at near-infrared and visible wavelengths over small field of view (~few square arcseconds) and will mostly probe re-processed emission from one circumplanetary disk at a time.</p><p>Jovian mass planets at 5-50 AU separations will carve deep gaps in their natal disks that can be readily resolved in LUVOIR coronagraphic scattered light images in the visible. UV/visible imaging in HDI filters sensitive to these accretion diagnostics will enable the direct detection of protoplanets within these gaps. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.6 shows an example of a simulated face-on disk + actively accreting protoplanet, at the distance of the Taurus star-forming region, in units of the signal-to-noise per resolution element of HDI's narrow-band Hα filter. Conservative estimates of the accretion luminosity indicate that such intermediate distance Jovian/ Saturnian mass planets should be detectable in all nearby star-forming regions. Since these accreting planets can be detected without coronagraphy in narrow-band Hα imagery, nearby star-forming regions can be surveyed with HDI's 3' × 2' field-of view, enabling a statistical study of protoplanets in both mass and semi-major axis. Furthermore, the accreting protoplanet survey will identify the brightest targets for follow-up spectroscopy in the FUV and NUV with LUMOS-enabling us to characterize the circumplanetary accretion environment in detail, a capability unique to LUVOIR.</p><p>Neptune-mass planets may be too faint to be directly detected but can dynamically carve detectable narrow (~1-10 AU) gaps in circumstellar disks. High-resolution scattered light images probe the population of small (sub-micron) grains that are coupled to the gas and, as such, can trace dynamical perturbations induced by planets. The narrow gap at ~80 AU in the nearby disk of TW Hya imaged with HST is a candidate for a sub-Jovian carved gap ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Debes et al. 2013</ref>). JWST will detect similar gaps at large radial distances (&gt; 30 AU), but LUVOIR's observational capability is unique for the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">Zhou et al. 2014</ref>). In a 9000 s exposure with the HDI narrow-band Hα filter, the protoplanet is detected at S/N~20, the outer disk is detected at S/N between 1-2 per resolution element (easily binned to increase contrast), and the inner disk is detected at S/N between 2-12.

While star-light suppression techniques (e.g., coronagraph, angular differential imaging) will be necessary for all instruments to detect exoplanets at ~1 AU, only LUVOIR can extend these studies into the UV, fully probe the accretion component, and help determine the properties of forming planets at Solar System scales. By comparing where exoplanets form in disks and their properties at birth with the location and properties of exoplanets around Gyr-old stars, we will be able to assess which processes shape planetary architectures and constrain the luminosity evolution of giant planets. In addition, we can test if the pile-up of single RV giants at ~1 AU results from initial conditions in the disk (e.g., the location of the snowline; Ida &amp; Lin 2008) or rather disk dispersal processes (e.g., migration at the gap created by photoevaporation; Alexander &amp; Pascucci 2012).

UV fluorescent H 2 spectra are sensitive to gas surface densities lower than 10 -6 g cm -2 , making them an extremely useful probe of remnant gas at r &lt; 10 AU. In cases where mid-IR CO spectra or traditional accretion diagnostics (e.g., Hα equivalent widths) suggest that the inner gas disk has dissipated, far-UV H 2 observations can offer unambiguous evidence for the presence of a remnant molecular disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Ingleby et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">France et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Arulanantham et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>LUVOIR's multi-object, high-resolution capability (R &gt; 30,000, 4.8 square arcminutes per LUMOS field) enables emission-line surveys and absorption-line studies of high-inclination (i &gt; 60°) disks. Absorption line spectroscopy through high-inclination disks, currently limited to a small number of bright stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Roberge et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b294">Roberge et al. , 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">France et al. 2014</ref>), are especially important because the large wavelength coverage of LUVOIR provides access to important molecular species in the UV and NIR, such as H 2 , CO, OH, H 2 O, CO 2 , and CH 4 .

For star-forming regions beyond Taurus-Auriga, the efficiency of these surveys goes up dramatically with the introduction of multi-object spectroscopy, greatly reducing the total observing time and increasing the survey efficiency in a census of star-forming regions at distances less than 1 kpc. Combining these surveys with the detailed characterization of debris disks discussed in Chapter 4 enables us to trace the physical and chemical evolution of</p><note type="other">The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor LUVOIR The LUVOIR Interim Report 7-13</note><p>the bulk of the disk mass, constraining the composition of the gas that can be accreted onto the core of giant planets as well as that of the planetesimals that could constitute the bulk of the icy planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.3">Map protoplanetary material dispersed via disk winds</head><p>Recent theoretical work suggests that disk evolution and dispersal are driven by a combination of thermal and MHD disk winds (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Alexander et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Gorti et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Ercolano &amp; Pascucci 2017)</ref>. Disk winds can affect all stages of planet formation: from planetesimal formation, by reducing the disk gas-to-dust mass ratio (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Carrera et al. 2017)</ref>; to the mass of giant planets, by starving gas accretion onto late-forming planet cores (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">Shu et al. 1993)</ref>; to planetary orbits, by dispersing gas from preferential radial distances and halting planet migration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Alexander &amp; Pascucci 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Ercolano &amp; Rosotti 2015)</ref>. However, computational challenges and poorly constrained input parameters make it difficult to predict how basic disk properties evolve and to ascertain the role of different winds in dispersing protoplanetary material. On the observational side, high-resolution (R &gt; 30,000) optical and infrared spectroscopy yields growing evidence of slow (&lt;40 km/s) disk winds around Myr-old stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">Pascucci &amp; Sterzik 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Sacco et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b281">Natta et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b291">Simon et al. 2016</ref>). Modeling of the line profiles and line flux ratios suggest that emission arises at disk radii between 0.1 and 10 AU. On similar spatial scales, jets (ejected material moving at ~100 km/s) are also expected to be accelerated and collimated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">Ray et al. 2007</ref>). Many of the brightest jet diagnostics are accessible to high-resolution imaging spectroscopy at UV and optical wavelengths (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">Frank et al. 2014</ref> for a recent review).</p><p>The high spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of LUVOIR are therefore needed to understand the origin of disk winds, the relative roles and interplay of MHD and photoevaporative winds, as well as to clarify the physical mechanism by which jets are launched and collimated. In addition to high-resolution spectroscopy, LUVOIR slitless spectroscopy (i.e., open microshutter array) and narrow-band images in UV and optical forbidden lines will map for the first time the launching region of jets and disk winds, and reveal their interaction. POLLUX spectropolarimetry will complement the science case discussed above by uniquely constraining the strength and topology of stellar magnetic fields during pre-main sequence evolution, with important implications for stellar and disk formation and evolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">Gómez de Castro et al. 2016</ref>).</p></div>

Both of these final point designs will be presented in the Final Report; for this Interim Report we focus primarily on LUVOIR-A and its design evolution.</p><p>LUVOIR's two design concepts demonstrate a scalable mission architecture with a range of science yield, cost, and technical risks that can be adapted to an uncertain future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Design overview</head><p>An initial concept for LUVOIR-A, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.1, builds upon the legacies of HST, JWST, and WFIRST. Similar to HST, LUVOIR covers a bandpass spanning the UV to the near-IR, has a suite of imagers and spectrographs, and is designed to take advantage of potential future servicing capabilities that are currently being developed by NASA and other agencies. Like JWST, LUVOIR has a segmented primary mirror that deploys from a stowed configuration, along with the secondary mirror support structure, the sunshield, and a number of other subsystems. Finally, like WFIRST, LUVOIR has a high-contrast coronagraph instrument, capable of directly imaging and spectroscopically characterizing exoplanets. In this sense, LUVOIR builds upon the technical legacy of the great space observatories that will have preceded it. LUVOIR-A is divided into three primary segments: The Flight Segment consisting of the observatory itself, the Ground Segment consisting of ground stations and mission and science operations centers, and the Launch Vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1">Flight Segment</head><p>The Flight Segment, or observatory, is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.2 and is divided into the payload and the spacecraft. The payload consists of the optical telescope element, the backplane support frame, the Vibration Isolation and Precision Pointing System (VIPPS), the gimbal system, and four serviceable instrument modules. The spacecraft consists of the payload interface tower, the sunshield, and the spacecraft bus. The payload is articulated with respect to the spacecraft using a two-axis gimbal system. Repointing the observatory involves rolling the entire observatory about the sun-earth axis through 360°, while simultaneously pitching the payload with the gimbal from 0° to 90° (0° corresponds to the telescope boresight normal to the sunshield, while 90° corresponds to the telescope boresight parallel to the sunshield). With these two degrees of freedom, the payload can point anywhere in the anti-sun hemisphere. An additional second axis on the gimbal allows just the payload to roll about the telescope boresight from 0° to 90°. The boresight roll allows targets to be aligned to instrumentspecific apertures, and also enables pointspread function roll subtraction. Details on the specific elements of the payload are provided in Chapter 9.</p><p>The payload and spacecraft are physically separated from each other via the Vibration Isolation and Precision Pointing System (VIPPS), a non-contact interface that is controlled in six degrees-of-freedom by voicecoil actuators. The VIPPS is located between the gimbal and the backplane support frame and is discussed in more detail in Section 8.2.2.1.</p><p>The spacecraft, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.3, must provide basic services to the payload: power, communications, attitude control, command and data handling, propulsion, and structural support during launch. The spacecraft also thermally isolates the payload from solar heat loads via the sunshield. Each of these subsystems are designed to not only meet the minimum 5-year mission needs, but also anticipate future evolution of the LUVOIR observatory through serviceability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.1">Spacecraft structure</head><p>The spacecraft bus is octagonal in shape. A central bay holds the propellant tanks, which are refuelable. The central bay is surrounded by the primary spacecraft structure that supports the mass of the payload and transfers loads to the launch vehicle during launch and ascent. Additional spacecraft subsystems are supported by the secondary spacecraft structure around the perimeter of the primary structure and are accessible for serviceability.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.2">Sunshield</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><note type="other">The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 8-6</note><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report from solar thermal loads and provides a cold environment in which the payload can be thermally stabilized with active heaters, and in which system radiators have sufficient cold-sink temperatures. Nominally, the sunshield remains in a fixed attitude normal to the Sun-observatory axis, maintaining a constant thermal load on the sunward side of the sunshield as the payload slews to different targets on the leeward side of the sunshield. The payload always sees a constant thermal environment, regardless of its pointing attitude. Two science observations necessitate exceptions to this nominal attitude and require the entire observatory to pitch toward the sun (while still keeping the payload in shadow). Exoplanet revisit observations must be scheduled at critical time intervals to maximize observational completeness and may require access to sunward portions of the sky. Also, observations of specific solar system bodies, such as Venus and comets, require pointing the observatory up to 45° from the Sun-Earth axis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8.4</ref> shows several different pointing scenarios for the observatory.</p><p>Although the sunshield appears similar in concept and design to that of JWST, it differs in two important aspects. First, it is larger. While JWST's sunshield is tennis-court sized, the LUVOIR-A sunshield is closer in size to a football field, spanning nearly 80-m tip-to-tip. And whereas JWST's sunshield is an extremely complex system of 5 thin layers that need to be precision deployed to tight tolerances on the angle and separation between the layers, LUVOIR's sunshield is simpler. A minimum of two sheets of single-layer insulation are needed to meet the thermal performance requirements, although three layers will likely be needed for redundancy against micrometeroid strikes. The spacing and angle between these layers is not critical, so long as they do not touch.</p><p>The manner in which the sunshield is deployed also differs between LUVOIR and JWST. JWST uses two rigid pallets to hold the sunshield system. These pallets are stowed up around the telescope and instruments, cocooning the payload during launch and ascent. After launch, the pallets fold down, and port and starboard deployable booms pull the sunshield layers out from the pallet, before spreaders and tensioners fineposition the five sunshield layers. In contrast, LUVOIR will package the entire sunshield at the base of the spacecraft. Four deployable booms will pull the folded sunshield out in each of four directions: fore, aft, port, and starboard. Details of the deployment are still being worked by the Study Team, but we anticipate several advantages over JWST, as well as several new challenges. Advantages include a smaller relative mass and volume for the stowed sunshield system, the use of high TRL deployment mechanisms, such as AstroMasts®, and overall lower risk to the deployment due to fewer mechanisms. New challenges include venting of the stowed sunshield during ascent, and the fact that the payload will be exposed once the fairing is jettisoned. We expect to have more detail regarding the sunshield deployment advantages and risks available in the final study report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.3">Attitude control system (ACS)</head><p>The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized and inertially fixed, with the spacecraft axial vector parallel to the sun-spacecraft axis. The ACS is responsible for counteracting external disturbances (primarily solar pressure torques), as well as changing the yaw axis of the observatory and reacting against gimbal pitch changes during payload retargeting maneuvers. The ACS is also responsible for pitching the entire observatory sunward for specific observations (see Section 8.2.1.1.2).</p><p>The ACS sensor suite serves two functions: star trackers, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and coarse sun sensors determine the attitude and inertial position of the spacecraft relative to the sun, while proximity sensors on the VIPPS determine the relative attitude between the spacecraft and the payload. ACS actuators, consisting of four control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) and sixteen 5-lb. thrusters respond to the sensor suite to maintain the absolute attitude and inertial position of the spacecraft. The four CMGs are arranged to provide full three-axis stabilization with redundancy. The thrusters are arranged in two sets: the first is used during momentum dump maneuvers, the second is used for stationkeeping and orbit maintenance.  The C&amp;DH system consists of a solidstate recorder, a board-level computer for command and control, and dedicated controller boards for spacecraft deployment and gimbal mechanisms. To ensure the payload never sees direct sunlight, a separate ACS safe-hold processor takes over in the event of a C&amp;DH system failure to maintain a safe attitude. Each instrument contains enough internal storage for two day's-worth of data. Therefore, the solid-state recorder on the spacecraft only needs to act as a buffer for each downlink and is sized to hold only a single downlink's worth of data (~10 Tb, including margin). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.5">Communications</head><p>The communications system uses Ka-band for data downlink and S-band for telemetry and housekeeping. A 1.8-m high gain antenna is used to connect with ground stations. Commands and telemetry during launch and ascent will use S-band omni antennas. A link budget is provided in 8.2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Electrical power systems</head><p>Approximately 105 m 2 of solar panels provide more than 31 kW of power needed by the LUVOIR observatory, allocated by system in  and is located at the base of the spacecraft, below the sunshield. A 24 amp-hour battery is included for providing power during launch and ascent. The power system provides 28-v to spacecraft subsystems, and 120-v directly to the payload. A 120-v payload bus was chosen primarily to minimize the power harness across the VIPPS interface. The higher voltage allows for fewer, thinner conductors, and therefore more flexible cables, to bridge the non-contact interface. LUVOIR adopts a Class-A mission risk posture throughout the observatory (both the spacecraft and the payload). All electrical system boards are side-A / side-B or boxlevel redundant, all mechanisms have dual- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.7">Propulsion</head><p>A single 100-lb. thruster is used for the first mid-course correction maneuver, which occurs ~12 hours after launch and corrects the trajectory for variability in the launch vehicle performance. A set of four 5-lb. longduration thrusters are used for subsequent mid-course correction maneuvers, as well as for the orbit insertion burn to enter the SEL2 halo orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.1.8">Flight dynamics</head><p>LUVOIR will orbit the second Sun-Earth Lagrange (SEL2) point in a quasi-halo orbit that does not exceed 25° from the Sun-Earth axis at its maximum, or 5° from the SunEarth axis at its minimum. A notional delta-v budget is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_52">Table 8</ref>.3. Station-  keeping and momentum dumps will occur nominally once every three weeks and will be scheduled to coincide to minimize science observation down-time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.2">Ground System</head><p>The LUVOIR Ground Segment will be based on the models of other large observatories such as HST and JWST. Primary and backup mission operations centers will be responsible for overall control of the observatory, orbit determination, telemetry, and mission planning. Similarly, a science operations center will be responsible for planning the observation schedule, supporting a guestobserver program, processing science data, and distributing and archiving the data for the user base. Two Ka/S-band ground stations are also baselined to provide two downlink passes per day; a third station would provide additional margin against missed passes due to weather or other conditions but is not fundamentally necessary to meet mission requirements. The ground stations consist of 18-m dishes in White Sands, NM, and in South Africa. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.6 shows a schematic of a notional ground system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8-12</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.4">Concept of operations</head><p>LUVOIR's concept of operations will be similar to other large observatories of its class. There are three general observation scenarios, related to the three key elements of LUVOIR's science campaign: general astrophysics observations, local solar system observations, and high-contrast exoplanet observations. Each scenario may impose different operational constraints on the observatory. Regardless of the scenario, each observation will begin with a slew to the new target field-of-view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.4.1">Slew and target acquisition</head><p>Following a science observation, wavefront maintenance routine, or stationkeeping/ momentum dump maneuver, LUVOIR will be ready to begin a new science observation. The observatory will slew to a new target based on previously uploaded coordinates. Slews will incorporate pitchangle changes using the gimbal system, and yaw adjustments using the spacecraft ACS. For special sunward observations, the spacecraft ACS may also need to pitch the entire observatory. During a slew, the VIPPS will be actively isolating the payload from the spacecraft, reducing the dynamic inputs to the payload and thus reducing the amount of settling time that will be required once the final attitude is achieved. Star trackers will be used to coarsely align the observatory to the target field, after which fine guiding will be done by the HDI instrument. Acquisition of suitable guide stars known to be in the field-of-view will be performed autonomously using the control system processor. Once fine guidance has begun, the observation can proceed, depending on the type of observation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.4.2">General astrophysics observations</head><p>General astrophysics observations using HDI, LUMOS, or POLLUX may begin shortly after a slew is complete, once system dynamics and thermal drift have settled to a level commensurate with their required wavefront stability (on the order of nanometers). While waiting for this settling to occur, internal instrument calibrations may be performed, if necessary, as well as instrument "set-up": selecting appropriate filters and channels, or in the case of LUMOS, aligning the microshutter array to the target field.</p><p>During general astrophysics observations, parallel observation with other instruments is supported. It is possible to have HDI, LUMOS, and POLLUX collecting data simultaneously under the condition that secondary instrument operations do not impact those of the primary instrument. For example, if a specific LUMOS observation is being executed, HDI may collect science data on whatever field it happens to be pointed at, but HDI would not be able to request pointing dithers to fill in focal plane gaps during this time. Similarly, if HDI were operating as prime, LUMOS would not be able to request roll maneuvers to align targets to the microshutter array.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.4.3">Solar system observations</head><p>Most solar system observations will likely require engaging LUVOIR's target tracking capability (up to 60 mas/s). Following a slew to target, the target would first be acquired by HDI using in-field guide stars. A trajectory would be computed, and tracking would begin. For cases in which it is desired to observe the object with LUMOS, ECLIPS, or POLLUX, an additional offset would be computed to place the object in their respective fields-of-view. Depending on</p><note type="other">The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor LUVOIR The LUVOIR Interim Report 8-13</note><p>the speed and duration of the observation, tracking may be accomplished by the fast steering mirror, VIPPS, gimbal system, spacecraft ACS, or any combination thereof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.4.4">Exoplanet observations</head><p>High-contrast exoplanet observations will be the most demanding of LUVOIR's capabilities. Following a slew, it is likely that a longer settling period will be required for the active control systems to help stabilize the wavefront error before acquisition of highcontrast images can begin. Once engaged, the "dark-hole" acquisition algorithm will use images from the coronagraph focal planes to generate updates to the deformable mirrors, gradually increasing the contrast in the focal plane to the desired level (~10 -10 for most observations). Once the contrast is achieved, science observations will begin by taking long integrations to reveal targets of interest. During this time, onboard metrology systems and low-order and out-of-band wavefront sensors will work to maintain the wavefront error and high-contrast image. This entire process is executed autonomously by the onboard control system processor.</p><p>It is during the dark-hole acquisition process and science integrations that picometer-level wavefront error stability is required. If the wavefront error is drifting faster than the dark-hole wavefront control algorithm can keep up, the system will never achieve 10 -10 contrast. Similarly, once the contrast is achieved, if the system drifts faster than the low-order or out-of-band wavefront sensors can keep up, then the contrast will degrade and long science integrations will not be possible. LUVOIR incorporates several techniques to achieve the necessary stability, discussed in more detail in the next section.</p><p>Parallel observations are also possible during exoplanet science observations, again assuming the secondary instrument operations do not impact the high-contrast performance. Given the picometer-level stability requirement, this may preclude even the actuation of filter wheels within the other instruments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Design drivers</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.1">High-contrast imaging</head><p>While LUVOIR is intended to be a multipurpose, multi-user observatory, the desire to perform high contrast (10 -10 ) direct imaging of habitable exoEarths around solartype stars with a coronagraph drives almost every aspect of the architecture. In addition to the need for coronagraph instruments capable of 10 -10 contrast, it has been shown that achieving and maintaining such contrast requires wavefront stability of the end-toend optical system on the order of tens of picometers RMS over the spatial frequencies corresponding to the dark-hole region in the focal plane <ref type="bibr">(Lyon &amp; Clampin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b591">Shaklan et al. 2011</ref>). This stability is needed over time periods corresponding to the wavefront control bandwidth-on the order of tens of minutes for systems using light from the target star to generate the wavefront estimates. The approach to achieving highcontrast imaging on LUVOIR is three-fold:</p><p>High-contrast through ultra-stable systems: This approach attempts to design a system that is as stable as possible. Thermal stability is achieved using materials with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion at the nominal operating temperature of 270 K: Corning ULE® glass for the mirror segment substrates and composite material for most of the structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">Park et al. 2017</ref>). These materials are coupled with milli-Kelvin-level thermal sensing and control of the mirrors, structures, and interfaces. Material property characterization is critical to understanding the behavior of structures and interfaces and modeling their performance at</p><note type="other">LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 8-14</note><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report the picometer level. The choice of materials and the material properties work together to create a system that is both thermally stable and controllable at the observatory operating temperature.</p><p>Ground-based metrology systems that can verify model predictions are currently being developed and have demonstrated the measurement of displacements of ~20 pm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">Saif et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>Dynamic stability is achieved with stiff mirrors and structures, passive isolation at the disturbance sources, and the noncontact VIPPS that actively isolates the payload from the spacecraft ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">Dewell et al. 2017</ref>). The VIPPS "floats" the telescope and controls the payload attitude relative to the interface plane via six non-contact voicecoil actuators. The VIPPS effectively isolates any dynamic disturbances from the spacecraft attitude control system from transmitting to the payload and exciting resonances that contribute to wavefront instability. The VIPPS also provides fine pointing control of the payload during science observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">Dewell et al. 2017</ref>). While the VIPPS provides ideal mechanical isolation, power and data signals must still be transmitted between the payload and spacecraft. Using a 120-v bus for the electrical power system allows for fewer, smaller-gauge conductors to be used, minimizing the number of cables and cable stiffness that must bridge the non-contact gap. Similarly, by performing as much of the data-processing on the payload side as possible, the cabling requirements for data transfer between the payload and spacecraft are minimized. Work is being done to both determine the stiffness of cables that will be bridging the non-contact interface, as well as modeling those stiffness effects as part of the system-level integrated modeling effort. High-contrast through wavefront control: This approach reduces the time period over which the system must be stable by increasing the temporal bandwidth of the wavefront control system.  Payload line-of-site pointing is sensed at the HDI focal plane via fast centroiding on selected guide stars. Pointing is then controlled by three actuators with different bandwidths: the fast steering mirror controls the highest bandwidth errors, the VIPPS controls lower bandwidth errors, and the spacecraft ACS controls the lowest. In addition to low-order wavefront error terms, the low-order wavefront sensor inside of the coronagraph also senses line-of-site pointing errors specific to the coronagraph channels and uses the deformable mirrors to correct slow drifts in both pointing and wavefront during exoplanet observations. A segment edge sensor and laser metrology system maintains phasing and alignment of the primary and secondary mirrors.</p></div>

Slow, low-order pointing and wavefront drifts are sensed internal to the coronagraph with a low-order wavefront sensor (LOWFS), similar to the one to be used on WFIRST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Shi et al. 2017</ref>) and corrected at the coronagraph deformable mirrors. The LOWFS system, however, is fundamentally limited in which wavefront terms are sensed, and how fast they can be sensed. At the same time, fast dynamic motions of the primary mirror segments will be measured using edge sensors and corrected with piezo-electric (PZT) actuators <ref type="bibr">(Feinberg et al. 2016)</ref>. A laser metrology system is also being evaluated for sensing and controlling secondary mirror position errors ( <ref type="bibr">Nissen et al. 2017</ref>). Closed-loop control will be achieved with both feedback and feedforward systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Shi et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>High-contrast through wavefront tolerance: This approach attempts to relax the fundamental stability requirement from tens of picometers to hundreds of picometers, or even nanometers, through new coronagraph architectures that are designed to be less sensitive to the wavefront error modes that are most prominently excited in the LUVOIR architecture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b571">Jewell et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b393">Ruane et al. 2016;</ref>). Additionally, spatial filtering techniques are being explored that may enable additional orders-of-magnitude in contrast, further relaxing the stability requirement. While many of these approaches show promise, they are still very early in development and it is unclear how much the stability requirement may be relaxed.</p><p>The technologies and design principles described above represent an array of tools that will be applied to the LUVOIR concept to achieve the required stability for highcontrast imaging of exoEarths. The current state-of-the-art of these technologies, and their paths to development are described in more detail in Chapter 11.</p><p>It is also important to note that picometerlevel wavefront stability is only necessary during high-contrast exoplanet observations. It is not intended that LUVOIR will maintain picometer stability 100% of the time while on-orbit. During slews, stationkeeping maneuvers, and momentum dumps, the wavefront of the system will surely drift due to mechanical disturbances and changes in thermal loads, even with active control systems like the VIPPS, edge sensors, and thermal control always operating. However, most general astrophysics observations do not require the system to achieve its targeted wavefront stability before observations can begin. A more detailed concept of operations is provided in Section 8.2.1.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.2">Thermal management</head><p>The thermal architecture of the observatory plays a critical role in enabling the broad wavelength range of LUVOIR's science goals. The nominal 270 K operating temperature represents a balance between operating at a cold enough temperature to achieve low thermal backgrounds in the NIR science bands, while operating warm enough to help mitigate contamination concerns in the UV science bands. Evidence from JWST thermal testing shows that below 260 K, molecular species rapidly begin to deposit on surfaces, which would degrade UV throughput (see Appendix D). Thus, 270 K optimally maximizes NIR science while not significantly impacting UV science.</p><p>Separate from science considerations, 270 K was also chosen for a number of engineering reasons. At warmer temperatures, damping of dynamic disturbances is increased. Also, the selection of materials that have both near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion and that are also well characterized is larger near room temperature. Finally,</p><note type="other">The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor LUVOIR The LUVOIR Interim Report 8-17</note><p>tinues to be developed through investments elsewhere in NASA and by other government agencies, then LUVOIR could leverage these resources to extend its mission beyond the initial 5-year requirement. Thus, the reliability, lifetime, and consumables have been designed to meet a 5-year minimum lifetime for all mission elements, a 10-year goal lifetime for all serviceable or replaceable mission elements, and a 25-year goal lifetime for all non-serviceable/replaceable elements. An additional advantage to designing for serviceability can be realized much earlier in the mission lifetime: the modular nature of LUVOIR's systems can facilitate testing and re-testing at multiple stages during integration.</p><p>The serviceable elements on the observatory include the four instrument modules themselves. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.9 shows a concept for how the instrument modules could be removed from the BSF and replaced. Key spacecraft subsystems are also designed to be replaceable, including the control moment gyroscopes, the avionics, and the solar array. The main elements of the observatory that have not been designed to be serviced include the optical telescope element and backplane support frame, the VIPPS and gimbal system, and the sunshield.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.4">Launch Vehicle</head><p>As the capabilities of the SLS Block 2 and its user base are still evolving, so is the certainty of which of several fairing options will be developed: an 8.4-m × 19.1-m "short" fairing, an 8.4-m × 27.4-m "long" fairing, and a 10.0-m × 27.4-m fairing. The LUVOIR team opted to be conservative in the fairing diameter but chose the 8.4-m "long" fairing as the "short" version does not provide enough height under the ogive to fit a &gt; 7-m aperture. The lift capacity for the Block 2 configuration with the 8.4-m "long" fairing is 44.3 metric tons (NASA 2017). The deployable LUVOIR a warmer temperature was chosen to help reduce the complexity of fabrication, integration, and test campaigns. By fabricating components at a temperature near where they are to be operated, modeling errors can be reduced, as well as the complexity, number, and duration of thermal cycle tests.</p><p>While most of the payload maintains an operating temperature of 270 K, several optical benches and detectors operate at colder temperatures of 170 K and 100 K, achieved through passive cooling. The thermal management system must work to simultaneously hold the optical telescope at 270 K with 1-mK stability while enabling the passive cooling. A large sunshield, similar to JWST's, provides a stable, cold-biased environment for the payload. Heaters are then used to precisely control the temperature throughout the payload.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.3">Serviceability</head><p>Drawing on the legacy of HST, LUVOIR is being designed from the outset to be serviceable and upgradeable to enable a multi-decade science mission that is responsive to a changing scientific landscape. We note however, that while the Study Team is designing LUVOIR to be serviceable, we are not designing the infrastructure to actually execute the servicing. Nor is it required to service LUVOIR for its users to achieve all of the science presented in this report within the first five years of the mission.</p><p>Other programs within NASA are currently developing autonomous and tele-robotic servicing capabilities. <ref type="bibr">2</ref>  </p><note type="other">LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 8-18</note><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report architecture is designed to maximize the science capability that can be fit within these volume and mass constraints.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.5">Integration and test</head><p>The integration and testing (I&amp;T) of LUVOIR requires careful thought and planning to minimize both the programmatic and technical challenges a mission of this magnitude will present. We understand that a long and drawn out integration and test campaign will directly impact the total cost and schedule of the mission development. A lesson learned from the JWST program is that costs are generally driven by the expense of having a "marching army" to staff the project, including managers, scientists, engineers and technicians among others. Once the final I&amp;T of the observatory is underway, more work is serialized rather than in parallel. When there is a problem in this phase of integration, a large contingent of the marching army may have to stand down while the problem is resolved.   This is distinctly different from earlier phases of a project where lower levels of assembly can be integrated and tested in parallel. A problem in one parallel path is rarely a reason to stand-down the majority of project staff in all paths. Thus, problems are generally less costly in terms of the marching army the earlier they occur. This is justification alone to do as much early prototyping and testing as possible. The less "new" information that is learned during Observatory I&amp;T, the better. At the time of preparing this interim report, the Study Team has only begun to think about the I&amp;T flow for LUVOIR at the most basic levels: trying to determine which levels of assembly may be tested in parallel versus which must be done serially; which requirements must be verified by test versus which must be verified by analysis; and the logistics of transporting, assembling, and testing systems as large as LUVOIR. We will report here our initial thoughts on what will drive the LUVOIR I&amp;T campaign, however a more detailed discussion will be presented in the final report, once a more complete picture of the LUVOIR architecture is available.</p><p>There are three primary challenges to the I&amp;T of LUVOIR:</p><p>• the sheer size of the observatory, • the verification of picometer-level stability, and • the control of contamination impacting the far-UV science.</p><p>Overcoming these challenges will require a combination of leveraging processes and techniques that have been developed for missions such as HST and JWST and developing new methods and facilities specific to the LUVOIR architecture. We address each challenge separately below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8-20</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report system. This presents a logistical challenge: how does one verify that the fully integrated system meets all performance requirements and is capable of surviving the extreme environments encountered during launch? Traditionally, NASA has adhered to a golden rule of "test as you fly, fly as you test," subjecting fully integrated flight systems to a series of environmental, performance, and functional tests to ensure their viability onorbit. However, missions such as LUVOIR are so large and complex that it is impossible to exactly replicate the flight conditions in a test environment for the entire observatory. This necessitates the "test as you fly" paradigm to evolve into a process combining lowerlevel testing with using high-fidelity, validated models to verify the expected performance of the observatory. Projects such as JWST have had to obtain waivers for the "test as you fly" requirement: e.g., while the optical telescope and instruments (a.k.a. "OTIS") underwent cryogenic optical performance testing, the test itself was not a full-aperture end-to-end optical test that verified image quality. Instead, the test confirmed the ability of the system actuators to respond to commands based on analysis of image data collected at the instrument focal planes. Most importantly, this test was the culmination of many subsystem tests and model validation efforts building on top of each other -all used to create a system-level model that is capable of accurately predicting on-orbit performance.</p><p>Similarly, once OTIS is integrated to the spacecraft and sunshield, the full observatory will not be tested at cryogenic temperatures in a thermal vacuum chamber. JWST will only see a portion of the tests that most space systems would normally see at this level, including mechanical testing followed by functional tests to verify assembly workmanship. Instead, the individual subsystems underwent rigorous performance testing at lower levels of assembly. Validated models, tracking of requirements, and verification of workmanship will be relied upon to ensure the fully integrated observatory will perform as expected on-orbit.</p><p>LUVOIR will require a similar I&amp;T methodology for performance verification, though it is likely that the division between verification by test and verification by analysis will need to happen at even lower-levels of assembly. For example, even though LUVOIR-A's 15-m diameter primary mirror would physically fit inside of the Johnson Space Center Chamber-A (where the JWST OTIS was tested, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.11), it would not fit through the chamber door fully deployed. Once deployed, there would be very little room left for optical, mechanical, and thermal ground support equipment, all critical to executing a performance test. The Plum Brook test chamber at NASA's Glenn Research Center (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.11) is larger and would accommodate LUVOIR with some room for ground support equipment, but its remote location raises another challenge: transporting the observatory prior to launch. The stowed JWST OTIS barely fits in a C-5 Galaxy aircraft-the largest cargo transport operated by the United States-and the fully integrated observatory must be barged to its final launch site in South America. Given that JWST has already stretched the available transport, integration, and testing infrastructure to the limit, LUVOIR will need to develop new options, including but not limited to:</p><p>• New integration and test facilities colocated with the final launch site. These facilities would allow components and subsystems that are assembled at remote locations to be transported by traditional means before being integrated and tested at the final launch site.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report 8-21</p><p>• New transport vehicles, such as the Stratolaunch aircraft, 4 or a modified 747 that carries cargo outside its hull similar to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, or easy access to waterways may be necessary to move the largest components, including the fully integrated observatory.</p><p>• A modular design of LUVOIR would enable the disassembly and reassembly of large portions of the system. Individual modules can undergo environmental and performance testing before being reassembled. Designing for serviceability is already a step in this direction, as at least the instruments and spacecraft subsystems are developed to be easily and repeatably inserted and removed.</p><p>This leads to the issue of qualifying the hardware for the launch environment. While it seems plausible, perhaps even advanta-geous, to argue that performance verification can be broken into smaller pieces, it is hard to make that same argument when it comes to verifying assembly workmanship in preparation for launch. Without subjecting the observatory to mechanical launch environments, it is hard to believe that a launch vehicle vendor will accept the risk of a catastrophic failure. At this point in time, the design of LUVOIR is not mature enough to know whether existing vibration and acoustic testing facilities will be able to accommodate it. Two of the largest vibration tables in the world are located at NASA Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook Station <ref type="bibr">5</ref>  </p><note type="other">LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor 8-22</note><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report with as much mass and inertia as LUVOIR. It appears that both large acoustics chambers at Plum Brook Station and ESTEC would fit an observatory of LUVOIR's size with some ground support equipment to protect the stowed observatory. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Regardless of the approach taken, the LUVOIR I&amp;T program will require careful attention to logistics to ensure a smooth flow. And while much of the hardware and ground support equipment that was developed for JWST won't be directly useable by LUVOIR, the concepts and methodologies developed for JWST I&amp;T will be. Key among them is the concept of using validated models at every level of assembly to verify requirements, especially those pertaining to ultra-stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.5.2">Verifying picometer-level stability</head><p>Many of the challenging requirements for LUVOIR create similarly challenging requirements for the test facilities and ground support equipment, which may very well need to be more stable or sensitive than the flight hardware under test in order to verify system performance. LUVOIR's ultra-stability requirements will demand micro-gravity-level vibration isolation and sub-milliKelvin-level thermal stability for at least some testing. While these levels of sensitivity are being demonstrated in lab facilities today over small scales ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">Saif et al. 2017</ref>), these levels are beyond the state-of-the-art for larger class facilities and may well be beyond what is physically possible for ground-based facilities. Verification by analysis may be the only way to demonstrate that LUVOIR is capable of achieving picometer level wavefront stability on-orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2.5.3">Controlling contamination for far-UV performance</head><p>The LUVOIR Study team recognizes that conducting science in the far-UV means that the hardware will be very sensitive to molecular contamination. At this time, our general plan is to use standard processes used on previous UV and X-ray instruments and systems. These include, but are not limited to, material controls, component bake-outs both on ground and on-orbit, and certifications. The 270 K operating temperature was selected in part for contamination control reasons. It is slightly above the temperatures at which quartz crystal microbalance monitors have measured molecular buildup during JWST testing, and it is above the temperature at which known molecules of concern would stick to critical surfaces. Mirror heaters are also being sized to allow for occasional baking out of contaminants on-orbit, similar to the annealing done on flight detectors on HST. These bake-outs would be done infrequently, perhaps once a year, to minimize the impact on science operations. Finally, LUVOIR will use techniques developed for JWST to deal with particulates that are on the mirror substrate. For example, JWST has cleaned the entire primary mirror using a brush technique with excellent results on large particulates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.3">Design alternatives</head><p>While the architecture presented in Section 8.2.1 represents one possible approach to a feasible 15-m-class LUVOIR mission, there exists a number of design alternatives that provide different approaches to achieving the ambitious science goals identified by the STDT. At the time of this writing, the Study Office has completed some of the trade studies identified below to develop the current LUVOIR-A architecture and is in the process of considering the others in an attempt to improve overall system performance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.3.1">Coronagraph vs. starshade</head><p>There are two fundamental approaches to achieving the necessary starlight suppression for exoplanet science: a coronagraph, and a starshade (sometimes called an external occulter). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>A coronagraph works by rejecting onaxis starlight that has entered the telescope while allowing off-axis planet light to be imaged onto a focal plane. The starlight rejection is usually achieved through some combination of occultation, diffraction control, and destructive interference. Since a coronagraph is located inside the observatory payload, it allows for very nimble observations; as quickly as the telescope is able to slew from one target to the next, a new exoplanet system can be observed. The two primary drawbacks to a coronagraph instrument are the extraordinary wavefront stability required by the optical system to achieve 10 -10 contrast, and limited throughput and bandpass that result from the complex optical systems that implement the starlight suppression. Coronagraphs are efficient at finding target exoplanets, but less efficient at characterizing them.</p><p>Conversely, starshades work by rejecting the on-axis starlight before it ever enters the telescope, removing the need for extreme diffraction and wavefront control from the observatory. Instead, the challenges of a starshade include the need to precisely deploy an extremely large (&gt;70-m diameter) structure and fly that structure in formation with the observatory at separation distances of tens to hundreds of thousands of kilometers. Starshades enable highthroughput, broadband observations of target stars making them effective at spectroscopic characterization of exoplanets. But the need to reposition the starshade over large distances for every telescope pointing vector means that starshades are inefficient at observing many systems and finding new targets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.12 shows some of the technology challenges and demonstration efforts that are ongoing for starshades.</p><p>LUVOIR's science case requires the ability to survey hundreds of potential planetary systems in order to guarantee enough exoEarths to statistically constrain the frequency of habitability. A coronagraph provides the necessary agility to perform such a survey. Ideally, once a target of interest is discovered, a starshade could be moved into place to enable efficient spectral characterization of the target. However, LUVOIR's large aperture would require starshades in excess of 70 meters at very large separations, well beyond the starshade technologies that are currently being developed. For now, LUVOIR has decided to rely on a coronagraph instrument, equipped with a spectrograph, to perform the exoplanet discovery and characterization. However, the observatory is being designed to be starshade-compatible and a follow-on starshade rendezvous with LUVOIR may be a viable option; see Appendix E for more details.</p></div>

However, an unobscured aperture would not leverage the approach used on the JWST for deploying the secondary and would require developing and demonstrating new packaging concepts for the observatory. Such repackaging is feasible given the large fairing volume provided by the SLS Block 2 vehicle, but likely constrains</p></div>

It is possible the gains in coronagraph throughput exceed the reduction in aperture size in terms of exoplanet science yield, however the smaller aperture also negatively impacts collecting area and resolution for the general astrophysics program. An off-axis optical design also requires the secondary mirror to be nearly twice as far from the primary mirror than a comparable on-axis design in order to maintain the same anglesof-incidence across the pupil, a requirement driven by the need to mitigate polarization aberrations that can significantly reduce coronagraph performance. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The specific geometry of the on-axis segmented pupil is related to this trade as well. The current LUVOIR-A baseline represents an extension of the JWST segment geometry with four additional rings of slightly smaller segments (1.15-m flat-to-flat vs. 1.32-m flatto-flat). The first optical design for LUVOIR required the central ring of segments to be removed to accommodate both a larger secondary mirror obscuration as well as the optical path between the secondary, tertiary, and fine-steering mirrors. The resulting large obscuration negatively impacts coronagraph performance. At the time of writing this report, the team has studied a number of new aperture geometries and optical designs to mitigate this effect. Although many of the figures in this interim report show the original aperture design with a large central obscuration, the team has since chosen a new aperture geometry and optical design that is more conducive to coronagraph performance. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 8</ref>.13 shows the old LUVOIR-A aperture compared to the new aperture.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.3.4">Disturbance isolation vs. disturbance reduction</head><p>The current LUVOIR baseline design uses several layers of both passive and active isolation to prevent disturbances from reaching the opto-mechanical payload. Passive isolators are used at the disturbance source (control moment gyroscopes, mechanisms, etc.) and a non-contact active isolation system separates the payload from the spacecraft. Initial analysis by the LUVOIR engineering team shows that this architecture contributes to a dynamically ultra-stable system capable of achieving high-contrast observations. An alternative to isolating disturbance sources from the optical system is to remove those disturbances altogether. A primary </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8-26</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report source of dynamic disturbance comes from spinning mass used as part of the attitude control system, such as reaction wheel assemblies or control moment gyroscopes. Microthrusters are a relatively newer technology that may be used in place of these mechanisms to control and maintain the attitude of the system while introducing very little or no disturbance to the system ( <ref type="bibr">Chapman et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>For the current LUVOIR design, the articulated nature of the payload necessitates the use of control moment gyroscopes; the force required to react against the gimbal mechanism as it slews the payload to a new pointing far exceeds the capabilities of microthrusters. However, a hybrid approach may be possible in which control moment gyroscopes or reaction wheels are used during slews of the payload and then stopped. Microthrusters would then take over and maintain the observatory attitude during an observation. It is unclear whether this approach is more efficient than the current architecture using a non-contact isolation system, but it does provide an alternative technology approach should the non-contact system's development be delayed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.3.5">Approaches for on-orbit metrology and wavefront control</head><p>As this and subsequent chapters describe, many tools are being applied to the challenge of achieving picometer-level stability on a system as large and complex as LUVOIR. Stable structures and materials, active and passive dynamic isolation, thermal sensing and control, wavefront sensing and control, and on-board metrology all contribute to the goal of ultra-stability. Within each technology there are several options for specific implementations. For example, metrology systems may consist of segment edge sensors, a laser truss, or a combination of both. Edge sensors themselves could be capacitive, inductive, or optical. Systemslevel modeling is being performed to determine the highest-performance, highest-TRL configuration that is capable of achieving the metrology requirements.</p><p>The specific implementation of wavefront sensing and control is another area of study. Image-based techniques such as phase retrieval are high TRL after development for JWST but may not be sufficient for active control during coronagraph operations. Loworder and out-of-band wavefront sensing techniques are under development by WFIRST for maintaining wavefront stability as part of coronagraph instrument designs. All of these techniques suffer from the need to collect enough stellar photons to estimate the wavefront error, a process that can take many minutes to tens of minutes for the types of stars that LUVOIR will observe.</p><p>Chapter 11 goes into more detail on the specific technologies that enable the LUVOIR-A architecture as described here and in Chapter 9. There are many tools in the toolbox, of varying capability and technology readiness. At the time of writing this interim report, the Study Team is still evaluating the optimal combination of wavefront sensing, metrology, isolation, and control that will provide picometer-level stability to enable high-contrast imaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Looking ahead</head><p>The LUVOIR study team has begun a second design iteration on the LUVOIR-A architecture, with the primary goal of further improving the exoplanet science yield. The effort focuses mostly on optimizing the segmented aperture geometry to be more compatible with coronagraph mask designs, specifically reducing the central obscuration size and maximizing the inscribing diameter of the aperture. In parallel with this effort, coronagraph design teams are continuing to develop new masks and instrument architectures that continue to push the state-of-the-art on segmented-aperture coronagraphy to further improve the performance of LUVOIR. The study team is also developing a structural-thermal-optical integrated model of the design that can be used to evaluate the thermal and dynamic stability of the system. This is critically important to demonstrating that the design and the incorporated technologies are capable of achieving the picometer-level wavefront stability required for the high-contrast imaging. The integrated models will also be used to inform technology development efforts and focus resources on the most promising technologies.</p><p>While completing an update to the LUVOIR-A architecture, the study team plans to develop a concept for LUVOIR-B: an 8-m observatory that is capable of being launched in a conventional 5-m diameter fairing. We expect that not all elements of the observatory will scale accordingly and that some level of redesign will be needed on LUVOIR-B. For example, while the size and mass will scale proportionally, the power consumed by the instruments most likely will not, requiring updates to the thermal management system. The LUVOIR-B design also gives the team an opportunity to explore other options for some of the trades outlined in Section 8.2.3, including an off-axis unobscured primary mirror option.</p><p>In Chapter 9, we describe in detail the payload of the LUVOIR-A design, including the optical telescope element, the backplane support frame, and the three USled instrument designs: ECLIPS, LUMOS, and HDI. Element-specific design drivers and design alternatives are also provided. Chapter 10 provides additional detail on the CNES-contributed POLLUX instrument design, and Chapter 11 provides greater detail on the technologies that enable or enhance the LUVOIR science mission, and what additional development is still needed. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.3.1">Optical design</head><p>The LUVOIR-A OTE is designed as a threemirror anastigmat system, with a fourth fast steering mirror located at the real exit pupil of the OTE. The advantages of this system include a wide field-of-view that can be accessed by a number of instruments,  The LUVOIR Interim Report with spherical, coma, and astigmatism aberrations corrected. The inclusion of the fast steering mirror also allows for ultrafine pointing stability to be achieved by all of the instruments and relaxes some of the requirements on the Vibration Isolation and Precision Pointing System (VIPPS) to point the massive science payload. The biggest disadvantage of a threemirror anastigmat system is the two additional reflections that are needed (tertiary mirror, fast steering mirror) before light enters any instrument. This throughput reduction is compensated by both the collecting area of the telescope and the high reflectivity of the coating at UV wavelengths. The two extra reflections also present two additional surfaces that can be contaminated and further degrade the throughput in the UV science bands. That being said, eliminating the aberration correction offered by the tertiary mirror, and the pointing control of the fast steering mirror before light is directed to each of the instruments may result in significantly more complex instruments, each potentially requiring their own corrective optics and fast steering mirror system. The Study Team has weighed the throughput gains achieved by changing the OTE design against the resulting complexity of the individual science instrument designs and has decided to maintain the three-mirror anastigmat design of the OTE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.3 shows a ray trace of the current OTE system, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.4 shows a wavefront error map over the telescope's field-of-view, with each instrument's field-ofview superimposed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.5 shows an example wavefront error allocation for the OTE+ECLIPS instrument system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report 9-5 still achieves diffraction-limited performance with margin at the system-level. All four mirrors are coated with a protected, "enhanced" Al+LiF coating to enable observations at wavelengths as short as 100 nm. A thin overcoat of MgF 2 or AlF 3 reduces the hygroscopic sensitivity of the LiF layer ( ). For this particular optical design, a sizeable central hole in the primary mirror was needed to pass the ray bundle through to the aft-optics system. The minimum achievable   The LUVOIR Interim Report clearance hole was 2.7 m in diameter; the secondary mirror obscuration is entirely contained within this diameter. To optimally pack the mirror segments around this hole and minimize unused collecting area, while also maintaining the outer diameter of the primary mirror in the 15-meter range, a segment size of 1.15 m flat-to-flat was selected and arranged in five concentric rings, for a total of 120 segments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure  9</ref>.6 shows an early design for the LUVOIR-A aperture, with annotated diameters.</p><p>As with the number of reflections in the OTE, the central obscuration does little to degrade the general astrophysics science because the obscuration is balanced by the sheer size of the primary mirror. However, we have found that the obscuration substantially degrades the performance of the coronagraph instrument, specifically with respect to the "core throughput," or the percentage of planet photons that are focused into the central core of the planet point-spread function. Evidence indicates that the ratio of the circumscribing diameter of the obscuration to the inscribing diameter of the primary mirror should be on the order of 10-15% to maximize the performance of the on-axis telescope / coronagraph system. Additionally, most coronagraph masks, when optimized, will circularize the outer diameter of the aperture, discarding any portion of the aperture outside of the red-dashed circle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.6. Variations on the aperture shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.6 that address these issues have been explored and the telescope design has been adjusted. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.7 shows the new LUVOIR-A aperture geometry, compared to the old one.

In order to fit in the fairing, a JWST-like wing-fold deployment has been adapted to a dual-wing-fold on each side of the primary mirror as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure  9</ref>.9. This allows JWST-like deployment mechanisms, hinges, and latches to be used on LUVOIR. The dual-wing-fold geometry also allows the primary mirror to better conform to the circular diameter of the fairing, allowing more volume in the center of the fairing for the instrument stack. Similarly, the JWST single-hinge secondary mirror support structure (SMSS) deployment was adapted for LUVOIR, with two additional hinge points on the top beam of the SMSS, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.10. Finally, the aft-optics system was made to be deployable using a nestingtelescope structure to accommodate launchvehicle envelope constraints.   The design of the primary mirror segment assembly architecture also leverages the JWST design, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.11. A single, stiff mirror segment is mounted on a hexapod for 6 degree-of-freedom rigid body positioning of the segment. A whiffle structure and delta frame interfaces the mirror segment substrate to the hexapod actuators and to the primary mirror backplane support structure.</p><p>The LUVOIR segment assembly architecture departs from that of JWST in the materials, optimized for the stability requirements and the operating temperature. Instead of beryllium segments, LUVOIR has baselined Corning's Ultra-Low Expansion (ULE ® ) glass for the mirror substrate, although other low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) materials such as Zerodur may also be used. Additionally, LUVOIR's delta frame and whiffle will be zero-CTE composite material.</p><p>JWST required radius-of-curvature actuators on each segment because the mirrors could not hold their shape in a 1-g environment during integration and test, and therefore needed built-in correctability. For LUVOIR, further detailed analysis is required, but it is believed that the stiffness of the ULE LUVOIR's optical telescope element uses many design features that were developed for the James Webb Space Telescope such as segmented mirrors, deployable sections of the primary mirror, mirror actuation, and a deployable secondary mirror.  </p></div>

Studies currently being conducted with mirror vendors will help to demonstrate if these assumptions are accurate. For now, LUVOIR is not baselining the use of a radius-of-curvature actuator.</p><p>Another critical new component to the segment assembly architecture is the edge sensor and piezoelectric transducer (PZT) actuator control system. Each mirror segment is fitted with one edge sensor per edge (i.e., two edge sensors total per shared edge) for a total of 622 edge sensors across the LUVOIR aperture. While the current design baselines capacitive-based edge sensors, optical or inductive sensors could also be used if sufficiently mature and capable. Each sensor measures local gap, shear, and dihedral angle between the segment edges. Incorporating these three measurements from all 622 sensors allows for a global solution to be found for the six degree-of-freedom position of each segment. The positions of each segment are then fed back to the hexapod fine-stage PZT actuators to control the segment position with picometer resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">Saif et al. 2017)</ref>. A discussion regarding both edge sensor and PZT technology development can be found in Chapter 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.3.3">Thermal design</head><p>High-contrast imaging necessitates that the mirrors of the OTE be extremely stable. In order to eliminate the effects of thermal expansion and contraction, an ultra-stable thermal environment must be created. As mentioned in Chapter 8, the nominal operating temperature of LUVOIR has been set to 270 K. In another departure from JWST, the individual segment, secondary, and tertiary mirror assemblies incorporate an active thermal control system. A heater plate immediately behind the glass substrate radiatively heats the mirrors to 270 K±1 mK. The primary mirror backplane and secondary mirror support structures are also actively heated at key control points in order to maintain the global thermal stability of the OTE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">Park et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The nominal 270 K temperature has several advantages over JWST. First, by fabricating components at a temperature near where they are to be operated, modeling error can be reduced, as well as the complexity, number, and duration of thermal cycle tests. Second, performance testing of LUVOIR will be completed at a much warmer temperature than JWST which should ease the qualification campaign since it won't involve cryogenic tests.</p></div>

However, the modular interface concept on JWST was discarded for three primary reasons:</p><p>1. JWST was not designed to be serviceable, 2. The ISIM element integration and test plan-at the time-had only one installation of the flight instruments planned which didn't justify the level of effort for this highly complex interface, and 3. The initial architecture for the ISIM element was very asymmetric which didn't lend itself to easy access for modularity and adding it was non-trivial.</p><p>That being said, there is nothing inherent in a composite structure design that would prevent a modular interface from being implemented as long as it was designed to be modular from the start.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.2.3">ECLIPS design implementation</head><p>There is currently no flight heritage for a coronagraph such as the one proposed for LUVOIR. There are several ground-based systems that use coronagraphs, however their overall requirements are far less stringent than those imposed on ECLIPS, and their contrast ratios are several orders of magnitude less. The WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) is the most similar coronagraph to ECLIPS but it is still under development. We expect that CGI development will help to advance the state-of-the-art in terms of how to successfully implement a coronagraph instrument on a space telescope, despite WFIRST and LUVOIR being very different observatories. The experience gained from integrating, testing, and operating a high-contrast coronagraph on-orbit will be invaluable. Some of the most critical pieces of information that will be learned by ECLIPS will build on advances from the development of WFIRST's Coronagraph Instrument (CGI).</p><p>WFIRST's CGI will mature high-contrast technologies and provide an endto-end system-level demonstration of advanced starlight suppression in the presence of actual observatory disturbances as well as background sources such as exozodiacal light.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

Ground data processing has advanced significantly in the past 10 years but operates on large-signal data sources. The WFIRST CGI speckle field will be low signal and relatively uncorrelated. Performing transit spectroscopy with HST is an analogous example: this was a new field of data analysis, and the experience from working with Hubble data is now feeding directly into JWST. Similarly, working with real high-contrast data from WFIRST will inform the design of LUVOIR and ECLIPS. In order to accommodate the variety of high reflectivity coatings and detector technologies that span ECLIPS's wavelength range, the instrument is split into three channels that cover the following bandpasses: UV (200 to 525 nm), optical (515 nm to 1030 nm), and NIR (1.0 mm to 2.0 mm). These bands are achieved using a series of dichroics at the entrance of the instrument. The small overlap in wavelength coverage between each channel is used to calibrate detector gains between bands. Each channel is equipped with:</p><p>• Two deformable mirrors (DMs) for wavefront control, • A suite of coronagraph apodizing, occulting, and Lyot stop masks • A Zernike wavefront sensor to be used as a low-order or out-of-band wavefront sensor (LOWFS, or OBWFS), • A spectral filter wheel to select the instantaneous science bandpass for the channel, and • Separate science imagers and spectrographs.</p><p>While the three channels can operate in parallel, each channel can only observe in one  The LUVOIR Interim Report bandpass at a time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.19 shows a side view of the three spectral channels in their layered configuration. Technology development for segmented-aperture coronagraphs is ongoing, and there are many promising candidates including shaped/apodized pupil Lyot coronagraphs, vector vortex coronagraphs, phase-induced amplitude apodization coronagraphs, and nulling coronagraphs. The landscape of coronagraph design may look very different at the time that an observatory such as LUVOIR is actually built, and the Study Team recommends that these candidates be re-evaluated then to maximize the possible science yield. At the time of this writing, however, the Study Team has chosen to design the ECLIPS instrument around the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) and vector vortex coronagraph architectures. Models suggest the APLC architecture currently delivers very good performance with LUVOIR-A's segmented, obscured aperture, and the masks and implementation directly leverage the significant investments in the WFIRST coronagraph instrument technology development effort (Eldorado <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">Riggs et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b328">Mazoyer et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b330">N'Diaye et al. 2014;</ref>). Vector vortex coronagraphs provide advantages for distant unresolved stars. More details about each coronagraphs' strengths and weakness are available in Chapter 11.</p><p>As the name suggests, APLCs work by placing an apodizing mask in the pupil plane to correct for the segment and obscuration geometry of the telescope. The design of these masks is a complex optimization problem. Once the geometry of the focal plane mask and Lyot stop are set, a linear optimization is used to generate binary apodizing masks. Because it is difficult to design apodizing masks that cover the entire possible habitable zone with sufficient throughput, ECLIPS is designed with a suite of focal plane masks with varying inner and outer working angles. The masks will be chosen as a function of the distance to each observed host star.</p><p>To make the design robust to stellar angular size and pointing errors, the focal plane masks are designed that the inner edge of the dark hole is set to be smaller than the outer edge of the focal plane mask (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2015</ref>). And to make the design robust to pupil misalignments, an input pupil with larger segment gaps and secondary struts than the actual telescope design is assumed. This baseline approach is conservative as it allows for large pupil shear between the plane of the apodizer and the primary mirror. Based on calculations using preliminary geometries similar to the LUVOIR-A primary mirror geometry, we predict that relaxing this constraint once the system stability is better understood will increase the throughput by about a factor of two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.2.3.1">Optical design</head><p>In the current design of the ECLIPS instruments, three mirrors are used to pick off the light from the OTE focal plane, collimate it, and re-image the telescope pupil onto the first DM in each channel. Once the light is collimated by these pre-optics, it is separated into each channel via a series of dichroic beamsplitters. The mirrors in each channel are coated according to their bandpass to provide the best reflectivity: the pre-optics and UV channel mirrors are coated in aluminum, the visible channel mirrors are coated in silver, and the NIR channel mirrors are coated in gold. To minimize polarization aberration effects within the instrument, all 90° fold mirrors are used in crossed-pairs, such that one mirror compensates the polarization effects of the other.</p></div>

A pair of relay mirrors re-image the pupil from the first DM onto the apodizing mask. A second pair of relay mirrors re-images the pupil again onto the Lyot stop, and the coronagraph focal plane mask is located at the intermediate focus. After passing through the Lyot stop, the optical bandpass is further reduced to 10-20% by spectral filters for science observations, or 2% for wavefront sensing.</p><p>Depending on the channel, after passing through the spectral filters, the light can be sent to one of several back-end instruments.

In LOWFS mode, the focal plane mask doubles as a Zernike wavefront sensing mask. The core of the point-spread function that is rejected by the focal plane mask is reflected into the LOWFS camera. A divot in the center of the focal plane mask provides the phase reference for the Zernike wavefront sensor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">Shi et al. 2015</ref>). In OBWFS mode, the system operates much the same way, except instead of reflecting only the central core of the point-spread function, the mask reflects the entire point-spread function. Note, that using the OBWFS in a channel precludes science observations in that same channel. Thus, it is intended that at any given time, one of the three channels operates as an OBWFS for the entire instrument while science observations are being performed in the other two channels.</p></div>

In photon-counting mode, these devices produce &lt;1 e -read noise, and 1×10 -4 e -/pixel/second dark current ( ).</p><p>The baseline technology for the NIR channel is the Teledyne HAWAII 4RG (H4RG) HgCdTe detector. Current devices have a format of 4k × 4k with 10 mm pixels and are three-side buttable for building larger arrays. H4RGs are the baseline detector for the WFIRST wide-field instrument and are an evolution of H2RG detectors used on the JWST NIRCam instrument. Current devices have a median read noise of ~5 e -/pix, and a median dark current: 2 x 10 -3 e -/pix/sec. It is believed that the read noise can be further reduced to 1-2 e -/pix with additional optimization of the readout circuit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.2.3.6">Deformable mirrors</head><p>Our choice of DM technology is based on the need for high-density devices to achieve large outer-working angles. For instance, achieving high contrast for the outer region of the habitable zone around the most nearby stars requires an outer-working angle of ~48 l/D. Providing wavefront control over a dark hole of that size requires ~96 actuators across the pupil. Imaging of outer giant planets drives the actuator count higher, to 128 actuators across the pupil to achieve a ~64 l/D outer working angle. In order to keep the optical design compact, we baselined a 128 ×128 actuator micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) DM device. A secondary technical driver is the fact that such compact DMs can achieve small Fresnel numbers, and thus are more amenable to DM-based correction of amplitude errors. While this technology will not be matured by WFIRST at the component level, there are avenues to do so using smaller satellites ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">Cahoy et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.3.1">LUMOS overview and science goals</head><p>A ubiquitous theme that has emerged in the science definition phase has been the study of gas in the cosmos, its relationship to (and evolution with) star and galaxy formation, and how this gas is transferred from one site to another. Understanding the flow of matter and energy from the intergalactic medium to the circumgalactic media, and ultimately into galaxies where it can serve as a reservoir for future generations of star and planet formation, is essentially a challenge in characterizing the ionic, atomic, and molecular gas at each phase in this cycle.</p><p>LUVOIR will be capable of characterizing the composition and temperature of this material in unprecedented scope and detail; on scales as large as the cosmic web and as small as the atmospheres of planets around other stars. The common denominator for this science case is that the strongest emission and absorption lines in the gases to be studied-therefore the highest information content for understanding the physical conditions in these objects-reside at ultraviolet wavelengths, roughly 100-400 nm. The LUVOIR Ultra-Violet Multi-Object Spectrograph (LUMOS) instrument is designed to make revolutionary observational contributions to all of the disciplines that call for high-resolution spectroscopy, multiobject spectroscopy, and imaging in the ultraviolet bandpass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.3.2">LUMOS design drivers</head><p>Like the other systems on LUVOIR, the LUMOS instrument design is constrained by launch vehicle mass-to-orbit capability and fairing volume. But the most significant design driver for LUMOS is throughput at far-UV wavelengths. Although recent developments in mirror coating prescription and processes have improved performance at short wavelengths, the reflectivity in the far-UV is still only a fraction of what it is for most metallic coatings in the visible and NIR. Thus, the optical design must be carefully optimized to reduce the number of surfaces in the system, and contamination must be minimized to ensure as many photons as possible make it through the system to the detector.</p></div>

LUMOS can be thought of as an analog to the successful HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument, with two orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency, multiobject capability, and a wide-field multiband imaging channel ( ).</p><p>Coupling the relatively high instrumental throughput with a factor of ~40× gain in collecting area over HST ([15 m / 2.4m] 2 = 40), LUMOS can reach to limiting fluxes of order 100-1000 times fainter than currently possible with the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and STIS instruments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.21 shows predicted effective area curves for the multi-object spectrograph  </p></div>

The LUMOS far-UV imaging aperture is physically offset from the MOS microshutter array aperture, and light from the OTE enters this channel through an unobstructed open aperture. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">Figure 9</ref>.24 shows the light path through the imaging channel. Two aberration-correcting optics direct the light through two identical reflective filter wheel assemblies that serve to define the imaging bandpass in this mode. A neutral-density filter wheel is also inserted between the two filter wheels to accommodate far-UV bright object protection, target acquisition for the MOS channel, and safe imaging of the target field through the microshutter array for shutter selection. The images are recorded on a single 200 mm × 200 mm microchannel plate detector. <ref type="table" target="#tab_66">Table 9</ref>.3 summarizes the bandpass and angular resolution achieved by the FUV imaging channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3.3.3.1.3">Cross-over mode</head><p>LUMOS performs bright object protection by pre-imaging the target field through the microshutter array. LUMOS contains a 'cross-over mode' that uses the grating selection mirror to direct light to the first filter wheel assembly in the imaging channel, through a neutral density filter wheel, and to the far-UV imaging detector. In this way, target brightness is quantified prior to spectral imaging acquisition with the MOS (imaging target acquisitions can also be made through the neutral density filter for bright-object-protection in the far-UV imaging mode). Imaging the spectroscopic target field through the microshutter array has a second benefit: it enables autonomous microshutter selection and fine-guidance adjustments to acquire the target through the selected shutter/slit. Operationally, target acquisition is achieved as following:</p><p>1. The payload slews to the target field using the VIPPS, gimbal system, and/ or spacecraft attitude control system, as needed.</p><p>2. The target field is imaged through the microshutter array (with all shutters open) in cross-over mode with the darkest neutral density filter in place for bright object protection.</p><p>3. As needed, the neutral density filter is reduced until adequate signal is achieved.</p><p>4. User-supplied celestial coordinates for the target objects are referenced to local detector coordinates, and the instrument autonomously identifies those targets in the imaged field.  </p></div>

HDI's precision astrometry mode enables a range of exciting science not feasible on existing telescopes including astrometric detection of exoplanets and measuring proper motions of extragalactic sources in the Local Group and beyond. To achieve the astrometric accuracy required for these applications (better than ±1micro-arcsecond), we need to calibrate the position of every pixel in the UVIS detector array. Such a metrology calibration system is needed if one wishes to measure galaxy proper motions out at the 10-15 Mpc distance scale or to detect the stellar wobble induced by Earth-mass exoplanets orbiting their host main sequence stars. An all-fiber metrology system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Crouzier et al. 2016</ref>) is included in HDI to allow for the calibration of the UVIS focal plane pixel geometry to a precision of 10 -4 pixels. We will investigate the astrometry error budget more thoroughly in future. A second special mode of HDI is to function as LUVOIR's primary fine-guidance sensor. Both the UVIS and NIR focal plane have the capability of defining small regionsof-interest around bright foreground stars. These regions-of-interest can be read-out at high speeds (up to 500 Hz) to provide a pointing signal to the fast steering mirror and VIPPS. This can be done without interrupting regular science operations.</p><p>Finally, the HDI focal plane will serve a function similar to that of the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on JWST and provide defocused image data for phase retrieval and wavefront sensing ). This dataset will be used during commissioning of the observatory to align and phase the primary mirror segments after deployment, as well as during routine maintenance of the wavefront as needed. Six elements in the UVIS filter wheel are dedicated to supporting this mode of operation: 4 weak lenses for generating defocused point-spread function (PSF) data, and 2 dispersed Hartmann sensors (DHS) for performing coarse phasing of the primary mirror segments.</p></div>

However, to understand the formation and evolution of stars and their accompanying planets it is necessary to also explore their circumstellar environments. POLLUX will provide a powerful, high-resolution, full-Stokes (IQUV) spectropolarimetric capability across the ultraviolet domain (97-390 nm) to uniquely trace these structures. When combined with the immense light-gathering power of LUVOIR, it will deliver unprecedented views of the disks, winds, chromospheres and magnetospheres around a broad range of stars, as highlighted below (also see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure  10</ref>.1).</p><p>Magnetic fields play a significant role in stellar evolution, while also being a key factor in both planet and star formation. We need POLLUX spectropolarimetry to identify and characterize the B-fields across all stellar masses, to address central questions such as:</p><p>• How do B-fields develop in the pre-mainsequence (PMS) phase? POLLUX will characterize the strong B-fields arising at the sheared interface between star and disk in the PMS phase (via MgII, FeII, and CII UV lines from the interface region), and will trace the flows via polarization measurements of the nearby continuum.</p><p>• How does the stellar dynamo build-up and evolve? As stellar rotation decouples from the young planetary disk, the B-field is predicted to get stronger and more complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(Emeriau-Viard &amp; Brun 2017)</ref>. POLLUX will investigate propagation of magnetic energy through the stellar atmosphere into the uppermost coronal layers and stellar wind.</p><p>• How do stellar dynamos form and evolve in cool stars? What is their impact on planet formation and evolution? POLLUX will reveal the magnetically mediated interaction between young cool stars and their planetary disks during dynamo formation and stabilization when planets and planetary atmospheres form.</p><p>• A small but significant fraction of massive stars have strong B-fields (~10%; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">Fossati et al. 2015</ref>).

POLLUX will uniquely detect subGauss B-fields in massive stars, providing a much-needed understanding of weak fields, field-decay mechanisms, and their impact on stellar evolution. • POLLUX will enable studies of stellar B-fields beyond the Milky Way for the first time. These will open-up observations in the metal-poor Magellanic Clouds (MCs), probing the evolutionary processes linked to B-fields at metallicities equivalent to those at the peak of star-formation in the Universe.</p><p>POLLUX will also enable breakthroughs in other areas of contemporary stellar astrophysics, including:</p><p>• Jet formation: The mechanism driving the powerful jets from the interaction between disks around PMS stars and their magnetospheres is poorly constrained; POLLUX will transform our understanding of this dramatic part of star formation.</p><p>• Winds &amp; outflows: A large uncertainty in evolutionary models of massive stars is the link between rotation and mass lost via their winds, which limits our understanding of the progenitors of γ-ray bursts, pair-instability SNe, and gravitational-wave sources. POLLUX observations in the Galaxy and MCs will map the density contrasts with stellar latitude required to calibrate these models.</p><p>• Novae &amp; SNe: Both classical novae and SNe remnants provide excellent opportunities to learn about the production and lifecycle of dust. POLLUX spectropolarimetry is required to identify sites in the ejecta where dust condenses-allowing us to also infer the effects of kicks imparted by core-collapse SNe-and the shapes/sizes of the grains involved.</p><p>• White dwarfs (WDs): A minority of WDs are strongly (&gt;1MG) magnetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">(Ferrario et al. 2015</ref>), but little is known of the incidence of weaker fields. POLLUX UV spectropolarimetry will explore this regime for the first time to investigate the ubiquity of B-fields in WDs, as well as the processes generating their fields (e.g., amplification of fossil fields and/or binary mergers?) A 100-hour POLLUX observing program would be transformational in our understanding of B-fields in stellar evolution. For instance, we could include UV monitoring of two low-mass sources (PMS T Tauri, evolved T Tauri) to directly characterize their B-fields and magnetic-energy transport, combined with observations of a first sample of tens of Galactic massive stars to assess the presence/strength of weak B-fields</p></div>

This information is crucial for getting insight into a planet's climate. It would also strongly complement transit observations. POLLUX can significantly detect polarization signatures for close-in gas giants (and brown dwarfs) orbiting stars out to distances of 70 pc, which currently comprises over a dozen targets, two of them transiting. Star-planet interactions (SPI) could generate detectable signatures in exoplanetary systems. Searching for SPI has developed into a very active field (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shkolnik et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b351">Kashyap et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b355">Miller et al. 2015</ref>). Evidence of SPI has been observed in UV stellar emission lines (e.g., NV; ). POLLUX will be capable of studying the intensity of UV stellar emission lines forming in a wide range of temperatures as a function of planetary orbital phase, uniquely combining this information with measurements of the magnetic field derived from the Stokes V profiles of these lines. This will allow for the first time identification of the stellar regions mostly affected by SPI and hence to understand their origin.

With POLLUX mounted on a 15-m LUVOIR telescope and a binning size of 50 Å, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) necessary to detect such a signal can be obtained in less than 3 hours of exposure time for systems as distant as 70 pc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 10.3)</ref>. Measuring and modeling the variation of the polarization signal as a function of the planet's orbital phase requires at least eight measurements spread across the orbit. A POLLUX 100-hour observing program would allow the detection and characterization of the UV polarimetric signature for over a dozen targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.3">The various phases of the ISM and extragalactic IGM</head><p>Matter in the interstellar space is distributed in diverse, but well-defined phases that consist of (1) the hot, ionized (T~10 6-7 K) ISM that emits soft X-rays, (2) the warm neutral or ionized medium (6000 &lt; T &lt; 10 4 K), and (3) the cold (T~10-200 K) neutral medium and molecular star-forming clouds. Boundaries between the different phases play a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas and by consequence in Galactic evolution. However, it is not yet clear how these different phases trade matter and entropy. We need to address the multi-phase aspect of the ISM and the influence of different factors such as magnetic field, thermal/pressure (non-) equilibrium, metallicity, shocks, etc.</p><p>Gaining fundamental insights into the processes that influence the different phases requires the wealth of interstellar absorption features appearing in the UV spectra of hot stars, and requires observing them at R ≥ 120,000 to measure individual clouds and disentangle the contributions from the different phases. POLLUX will, for the first time, give access to all phases at the required high spectral resolution. It will enable simultaneous study of tracers of hotgas (OVI, CIV), warm gas (OI, NI, and many singly-ionized species), as well as cold-HI gas like CI, and of the molecular phases through H 2 and CO lines. POLLUX will resolve the velocity profiles of the different H 2 rotational levels, yielding temperature and turbulence, and information on the formation of H 2 and its role as a coolant, e.g., in turbulence dissipation.</p><p>ISM studies also need to be generalized to external galaxies. POLLUX will enable tomography of chemical abundances in several hundred nearby galaxies using neutral gas absorption lines toward individual stars across the entire (stellar) body of galaxies or toward background quasars. Abundance variations across and between galaxies of different types and metallicities will document the dispersal/mixing spatial/time scales of newly produced elements and their nucleosynthetic origin, the role of infalling and outflowing gas in the metallicity buildup, and the dust production/composition through depletion patterns. Furthermore, cooling rates, physical conditions, and the molecular gas content can be determined spatially in the HI reservoir (with implications for the regulation of star formation and for galaxy evolution at large) and in neutral shells of HII regions (with implications for the starformation process itself). A huge step forward in the knowledge of the Galactic magnetic field in terms of sensitivity, sky coverage and statistics has been made from recent dust polarization measurements. However, they tell us nothing about the distance of the magnetic field and its distribution in the different components or phases. The POLLUX spectropolarimeter will provide this information through its ability to detect linear polarization in UV absorption lines through Ground State Alignment (GSA, <ref type="bibr">Yan &amp; Lazarian 2012)</ref>. It will open up access to the magnetic field 3-D, by measuring its orientation in different clouds, on limited distances along sight lines and on small scales ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 10.4)</ref>. In a 100-hour program, observing several hundreds of hot stars with a S/N of 500 to measure linear polarization in optically thin absorption lines at a level of a few % will help understand the interplay of magnetic field and the different ISM phases. By discerning magnetic fields in gas with different dynamical properties, POLLUX will allow the first study of interstellar magnetic turbulence <ref type="bibr">(Zhang &amp; Yan 2017</ref>).</p></div>

Some key signatures of accretion disks can be revealed only in polarized light, and with higher contrast at ultraviolet wavelengths. Specifically, high-resolution UV polarimetry will provide geometric, chemical and thermodynamic measurements of accretion disks in unprecedented detail. By probing the ubiquitous magnetic fields expected to align small, non-spherical dust grains on scales from the accretion disk out to the extended dust torus, POLLUX will be able to reveal the mechanisms structuring the multiscale AGN medium. The key information encoded into the polarized light will allow The mean magnetic field (3 μG) is oriented along the x-axis. This figure shows that the direction of polarization correctly indicates the magnetic field direction and that the expected polarization is mostly above 5%, within POLLUX capabilities.</p></div>

Measurements of magnetic field strengths will also provide constraints on the structure of magneto-hydrodynamic winds in nearby, broad absorption-lines systems accessible to the instrument. On larger scales, UV polarimetric studies of young star-forming regions will provide unprecedented insight into the enigmatic relation between onset of star formation and triggering of nuclear activity. Once activated, an AGN is expected to feed vast amounts of energy back into the interstellar medium of its host galaxy through radiation and shocks. This feedback can decrease or increase the star formation activity of the host; our understanding of the physical conditions in this interaction will be greatly improved with UV polarization observations from POLLUX.</p><p>In addition to the extended environment of AGNs, POLLUX will provide insight into the nature and lifetime of particles in relativistic jets, which are other key factors to fully understand AGN feedback on star formation in galaxies. By focusing on bright, low-redshift galaxies, it will be possible to obtain, for the first time, high-resolution spectra providing striking details on the structure and physics of AGNs. Complemented by the optical and infrared instruments on board LUVOIR, POLLUX will constitute a groundbreaking means of assessing the important role played by AGNs on galaxy evolution <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 10</ref>.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.5">Testing fundamental physics and cosmology using absorption lines towards quasars</head><p>Physics and cosmology as we know them today have been remarkably successful in reproducing most of the available observations with only a small number of parameters. However, it also requires that 96% of mass-energy content of the Universe is in mysterious forms (dark energy and dark matter) that have never been seen in the laboratory. This shows that our canonical theories of gravitation and particle physics may be incomplete, if not incorrect. Improving the sensitivity of current observational constraints is therefore of utmost importance, irrespective of whether it is consistent with the current standard physics-in which case it will reject other scenarios-or whether it will instead favor new physics. Absorption-line systems produced by intervening gas in the spectra of background sources provide original sensitive probes of fundamental physics and cosmology. The high UV spectral resolution of POLLUX on LUVOIR will open a unique window on such probes, in particular (1) the measurement of the primordial abundance of deuterium, (2) the stability of fundamental constants over time and space and (3) the redshift evolution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature. The D/H ratio can be estimated from the DI and HI Lyman series lines. Any change in the proton-to-electron mass ratio (m=m p /m e ) translates into a relative wavelength change of the H 2 Lyman and Werner lines. Finally, the CMB radiation excites the CO molecules so that the relative population in different rotational levels (measured through the electronic bands in the UV) is an excellent thermometer for the CMB temperature.</p><p>We remark that, while these are independent probes, they are intimately related by the underlying physics. For example, models involving varying scalarphoton couplings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">Avgoustidis et al. 2014</ref>) also affect the temperature-redshift relation so that constraining this relation is complementary to a search for varying fundamental constants. The Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations of the D/H ratio are also dependent on the fundamental constants and can be altered if new physics is at play (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">Olive et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The baseline specifications of LUVOIR/ POLLUX are S/N~100 per resolution element in 1h for Fl=10 -14 erg s -1 cm -2 Å -1 . This means that for known quasars with low-z H 2 absorbers as observed by HST/ COS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b356">Muzahid et al. 2015</ref>), we can reach a precision of a Δμ/μ ~ a few 10 -7 in 20-30h <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 10.6)</ref>. This is about an order of magnitude better than the current best limits (around 5x10 -6 with UVES on the Very Large Telescope), in less observing time. Similarly, the achieved precision on T CMB scales directly with the S/N ratio (0.1 K at S/N~100 and R~100,000 when current limits are DT~1K). The same is again true with the D/H ratio, although a very high resolution is less critical  The LUVOIR Interim Report since the corresponding lines are typically thermally broadened by at least 10 km s -1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.6">Solar system: Surfaces, dust scattering, and auroral emissions</head><p>UV observations uniquely probe the surfaces of telluric bodies of the solar system. They diagnose their volcanic and plume activity, their interaction with the solar wind, and their composition relevant to the space weather and exobiology/habitability fields. Very few UV polarimetric observations were obtained with WUPPE (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">Fox et al. 1997</ref>), revealing in particular the Io surface as spatially covered by 25% SO 2 frost with polarization variations associated to different volcanic regions. POLLUX will primarily characterize volcanism and/or plume activity of icy moons from polarized solar continuum reflected light and spectral UV albedo. Its high sensitivity is necessary to track any organic and ice composition of the crust of comets and Kuiper Belt objects from their UV spectra. The giant planets' UV aurorae are mainly radiated from H and H 2 atmospheric species, collisionally excited by accelerated charged particles precipitating along the auroral magnetic field lines. Aurorae thus directly probe complex interactions between the ionosphere, the magnetosphere, the moons, and the solar wind. Precipitation of auroral particles is additionally a major source of atmospheric heating, whose knowledge is needed to assess the energy budget, the dynamics, and the chemical balance of the atmosphere. The narrow FOV of POLLUX The albedo of a region of 100 km 2 can be derived with an accuracy of 0.1% with a spectral resolution of 1 nm and a 5-min exposure near 320 nm. The linear polarization of Io's surface varies between 1 and -10% between 220 and 320 nm; near 320 nm, the linear polarized signal observed by POLLUX for a binning size of 1 nm in 5 minutes should have a S/N~10, which is better than WUPPE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 10.7, right panels)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4">Design overview &amp; implementation</head><p>The baseline configuration of POLLUX that we will now present allows fulfillment of all the The LUVOIR Interim Report requirements for the instrument performance. Most of the technologies required for a complete implementation are at TRLs compatible with a Phase 0 study. We did not find fundamental restrictions or physical limitations preventing its implementation. We will discuss what research and development is needed to allow us to realize the baseline configuration by the time of LUVOIR implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.1">Baseline optical architecture and specifications</head><p>In the baseline configuration of POLLUX, we adopted the telescope parameters provided by the LUVOIR study. POLLUX is a spectropolarimeter working in three channels. For practical reasons we refer to these as NUV (19-390 nm), MUV (118.5-195 nm), FUV (97-124.5 nm). Each is equipped with its own dedicated polarimeter followed by a high-resolution spectrograph. The spectra are recorded on d-doped EMCCD detectors. MUV+NUV channels are recorded simultaneously, while the FUV is recorded separately. POLLUX can be operated in pure spectroscopy mode or in spectropolarimetric mode. POLLUX can be fed by the light coming from the telescope or from sources in the calibration unit. We anticipate that POLLUX can operate with a 270 K housing, in line with the requirement of LUVOIR. We now describe the major assumptions that we adopted to design the optical architecture of this configuration. They are illustrated on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 10</ref>.8:</p><p>• The instrument entrance is a pinhole, rather than a slit, for simpler aberration correction.</p><p>• The working spectral range is 300 nm. It is split into three channels: far ultraviolet (FUV), medium ultraviolet (MUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV). This allows POLLUX to The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report 10-13</p><p>achieve high spectral resolving power with feasible values of the detector length, the camera optics field of view, and the overall size of the instrument. It also allows to use dedicated optical elements, coatings, detectors, and polarimeter for each band, to obtain gains in efficiency.</p><p>• The FUV and MUV boundaries are set relative to the Lyman-α line. The lower limit for the MUV band is set at Lyman-α minus roughly 3 nm, that is 118.5 nm, while the upper one for the FUV is Lyman-α + roughly 3 nm, i.e., 124.5 nm.</p><p>• The shortest wavelength for the FUV strongly depends on the main telescope throughput and may be reconsidered in the future.</p><p>• The MUV and NUV channel are separated by means of a dichroic splitter. Such splitters can have a high efficiency (e.g., a mean reflectance of 61% over 140-170 nm, most of the MUV band, and a mean transmittance of 83% over 180-275 nm, most of the NUV band; see http:// www.galex.caltech.edu/researcher/ techdoc-ch1.html). A dichroic splitter allows the instrument to work in two bands simultaneously and use the full aperture, thus achieving high resolving power with relatively small collimator focal length. In the present design, we set the MUV/NUV boundary at 195 nm, to have a maximum of one full octave in each channel (here the NUV).</p><p>• Currently there are no dichroic splitters operating in the FUV below the Ly-α line and there is no evidence that such an element will become possible in the future. We have decided to use a flip mirror to feed the FUV channel. The flip mirror is located immediately before the dichroic splitter.</p><p>• The splitters are placed as close to the focal point as possible in order to decrease their size and the size of the polarimeters. Currently the flip mirror is located 20 mm away from the focus and the distance from focus to dichroic is 35 mm.</p><p>• In each channel, the beam is collimated by an ordinary off-axis parabolic (OAP) mirror. The off-axis shift and the corresponding ray deviation angle are chosen in such a way that the distance between the entrance pinhole and the echelle grating is large enough to place the polarimeter and corresponding mechanical parts. The MUV and NUV mirrors have identical geometry, though they may have different coatings and have slightly different operation mode due to the difference in each polarimeter's design.</p><p>• Echelle grating works in a quasi-Littrow mounting. The exact values of the groove frequency and the blaze angle are computed to obtain the target dispersion and subsequently the spectral resolving power.</p><p>• The cross-disperser in each channel operates also as a camera mirror, so it is a concave reflection grating. This approach allows minimization of the number of optical components and increases the throughput. In order to correct the aberrations, the crossdisperser's surface is a freeform and has a complex pattern of grooves formed by holographic recording. • Adopted coatings on the optical elements of POLLUX are those used for the telescope, except for the polarimeters. In the future, they will be optimized for each element of each channel (see Section 10.5).</p><p>• Polarimeters are located immediately after the splitters in each channel to avoid instrumental polarization by the spectrograph elements. The polarimeters are retractable in the MUV and NUV to allow the pure spectroscopic mode. In . The polarimeters should have minimal size in order to decrease their influence on the image quality. Firstly, transparent plates introduce some aberrations. Secondly, due to polarization ray splitting, the collimator may operate in an unusual mode and have considerable aberrations. Thirdly, the shorter the optical path inside the polarimeter, the smaller the difference between the spectropolarimetric and the pure spectral observation modes.</p><p>It is necessary to switch beams in POLLUX in order to feed the detectors with light coming from the telescope, or from sources in the calibration unit. Furthermore, in order to compensate the optical path difference and maintain the same beam position and the angle of incidence at the echelle when switching from the spectropolarimetric mode to the spectroscopic mode (done by removing the polarimeters from the optical train), it is necessary to change the collimator mirror (see #6 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">Figure 10.8)</ref>. Due to the focal length change, the collimated beam and therefore the theoretical resolution limit also change. On the other hand, the pinhole projection size also changes, so the resolution values found while accounting for the aberrations should be re-scaled.</p><p>The optical design is optimized for the conditions described above. In order to account for possible misalignments due to switching from the pure spectroscopic mode to the spectropolarimetric one, the target spectral resolving power was set to 130,000 (i.e., 110% of the requirement).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.2">Polarimeters</head><p>Below 120 nm, MgF 2 is opaque. Above this wavelength, both the birefringence and transparency of MgF 2 recover quickly. In order to optimize the throughput in particular below 150 nm, we explored modulation based on reflection rather than transmission for the FUV and MUV modulators. • The FUV polarimeter has a three-mirror modulator with SiC mirrors and high incidence Brewster angle (close to 80 degrees) to record polarization. Only the reflected P beam can be recovered with this technique, hence we cannot use twobeam polarimetry to reduce systematics.</p><p>• The MUV polarimeter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 10</ref>.10) has a three-mirror modulator coated with Al+LiF. The three mirrors rotate as a whole around the optical axis of the instrument. The first and third mirrors work at an incidence angle close to 47 degrees and the second mirror at the complementary of twice this angle. The choice of three mirrors ensures that the output beam is in the same axis as the entrance beam. A Wollaston prism made of MgF 2 is the current baseline solution for the analyzer, but other options will be studied.</p><p>• The NUV polarimeter is completely adapted from the ARAGO design ( <ref type="bibr">Pertenais et al. 2016)</ref>, that is a birefringent modulator made of three pairs of MgF 2 plates, and a Wollaston prism of MgF 2 for the analyzer.

The major points of this layout can be summarized as:</p><p>• The central support structure of POLLUX consists of a central chassis, which provides mechanical interfaces for the MUV, FUV, NUV arms, calibration unit, polarimetry and beam switching mechanisms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.4">Detectors</head><p>The detectors of POLLUX are based on the technology of surface processing of thinned, back-side illuminated EMCCDs (e.g., "d-doping"). These have now become competitive with micro-channel plates (MCPs) in the FUV to NUV range. They combine the linearity of CCDs with photoncounting ability, which is a key capability enabling detection of faint UV signals. Furthermore, these detectors now deliver high quantum efficiency (e.g., in-band QE &gt; 60%, see http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/6/927), thus offering the possibility to reach very high signal-to-noise ratios. Recent developments show that visibleblindness can be achieved with proper treatment (e.g., anti-reflection coatings). Detectors with 13 mm pixels will be used for POLLUX. They may be passively cooled to ~ 120K (to reduce dark current level etc.). In the FUV channel, the detector active area is 203 mm x 19 mm, while for MUV and NUV, the active areas are 131 mm x 19 mm and 131 mm x 24 mm, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.5">Operation modes</head><p>POLLUX is designed to work in two science modes, a pure spectroscopic mode and spectropolarimetric mode.</p><p>• In pure spectroscopy mode, one measurement produces either one spectrum in the FUV, or two spectra, one in the MUV and one in the NUV. It is expected that in a majority of cases, two measurements (one in the FUV and one in the MUV+NUV) will be obtained for a target.</p><p>• In spectropolarimetric mode, one fullStokes polarimetric measurement requires four spectra in the FUV, or ten spectra in the MUV+NUV channels (six spectra in the NUV and four spectra in the MUV.

A wheel, bearing the calibration lamps, is placed facing a mirror assembly that is used to redirect the light from the lamps to POLLUX while reproducing the f-number of the LUVOIR telescope. This way, we avoid any systematic effect resulting from different illumination patterns between the scientific and calibration beams within the instrument. Such wheel mechanisms are usually used as filter wheels inside optical instruments and therefore they have a long flight heritage.</p><p>The main calibration purposes for POLLUX internal calibration sources are wavelength calibration and flat fielding. The optical stimulus for the wavelength calibration is a Pt/Ne Hollow Cathode Lamp (HCL), covering the entire wavelength range of the MUV+NUV channel. The flat-field (FF) source is used to calibrate the pixel-to-pixel response variations and to monitor the blaze function and/or the evolution of the relative spectral response function (which will be tied to celestial calibrators at sparser time intervals). The optical stimulus for the FF is a deuterium arc lamp. Given that the FF will not be acquired with every observation, the impact on the overall mission efficiency is marginal. A power supply box will be placed next to the CU and will include a high voltage supply, which is required for the HCL.</p><p>The error matrix of polarization will be calibrated on the ground. Any possible evolution or aging will be monitored in flight by regular observations of a set of celestial calibrators, used as reproducibility sources.</p><p>We have currently not identified calibration sources covering the full FUV channel. Consequently, in this channel, the ground-based and onboard calibrations will be completed with observations of celestial standards, essentially white dwarfs.</p><p>Standard calibration images will be collected once per day for each detector through a fixed sequence: 10 flat-field images, 5 bias images, and 1 dark image. In addition, wavelength calibration should be obtained. In pure spectroscopy mode: 2 wavelength calibration images will be downloaded at each new pointing of the telescope, one once the telescope is pointed and before the science acquisition start, and the other after the science acquisition is finished and the telescope moves away. In spectropolarimetric mode: 1 wavelength calibration image would be obtained not only before and after the acquisition but also between each spectropolarimetric measurement.</p></div>

In the current design, the MUV and NUV echelle gratings have almost identical sizes and blazing angles. The groove frequencies differ approximately by a factor of two. Both the groove frequencies and the angles are non-standard. For the FUV echelle grating, the groove frequency and blazing angle are even more unusual. We have no evidence that such a grating has been ever produced before for the UV domain. For the three channels however, feasibility is in the range of today's technological limits (communication from Dr. Randall McEntaffer, Penn State University).</p><p>Open issues include the accuracy of the groove profiles and the coatings optimization for each of the channels. Another high technological risk is the clear aperture of the gratings. Today's process tools are limited to 200 mm diameter wafers (~140 x 140 mm clear aperture), so at least one of the dimensions on each of these gratings is a challenge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">McEntaffer et al. 2013</ref>). These points will be addressed in the framework of a R&amp;D plan between Penn State and University of Colorado, and the POLLUX consortium.</p><p>Coatings. A CNES R&amp;D program to obtain and select coatings with excellent UV and FUV efficiency, particularly in the 90 nm to 390 nm range, started in October 2017. The goal is to reach above 90% for as much as possible of this spectral range, high-uniformity coatings (&lt; 1%), over a large spectral range with low polarization (&lt; 1%) for high-contrast imaging, and pre-launch stability of ultra-thin coatings.</p><p>Materials with the best properties are MgF 2 , LiF, and AlF 3 . Single and double layers of these materials have been investigated, e.g., Al/LiF, Al/AlF 3 , Al/LiF/MgF 2 , Al/LiF/AlF 3 , and combinations with different process conditions. At the short wavelength edge, presently a top coating with AlF <ref type="bibr">3</ref> gives the best reflectance results, as has been published most recently by Del Hoya and Quijada (NASA GSFC). A reflectance of more than 30% above 100 nm and more than 90% from 120 nm to 130 nm has been reported (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 10</ref>.16).</p><p>Members of our consortium have investigated in the past protective coatings of MgF 2 , LiF, and AlF 3 for mirrors at 120 nm and studied also their environmental stability and durability. To optimize these coatings at the short wavelength cutoff it is necessary to investigate further the dependence on coating thickness and substrate temperature during the deposition process. We propose to investigate protected aluminum coatings in collaboration between MPS (Göttingen, Germany) and OptiXfab (Jena, Germany).</p><p>Experimental studies with mirror samples will start in 2018.</p><p>Dichroic. The dichroic filter used for beam separation of the MUV and the NUV is based on the GALEX heritage. It provides a mean reflectance of 61% over the 140-170 nm band and a mean transmittance of 83% over the 180-275 nm band. The reflectance was extrapolated down to 118.5 nm, the transmittance up to 390 nm, for the computation of the efficiency calculations presented in Section 10.4.6. A study by REOSC performed for ARAGO has demonstrated feasibility down to 119nm. Our development plan is to tailor a dichroic beam splitter to the MUV and NUV, and further increase the efficiency in both channels of POLLUX. This will be done in partnership with the REOSC Company. </p></div>

This chapter provides an updated evaluation of these technologies, capturing progress made since that initial report. LUVOIR's extraordinary capabilities will be driven, first and foremost, by its large aperture. As described earlier, LUVOIR will be launched with several elements stowed or in a folded configuration. These will deploy on orbit, and be locked into a solid, stable structure. Image-based wavefront sensing and control techniques will phase its optical elements to achieve diffraction-limited optical performance. The technologies for this process are derived directly from JWST and will be proven in space by that mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b391">Redding et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b366">Feinberg et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">Acton et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Extension of JWST wavefront sensing and control technologies to the shorter LUVOIR wavelengths is a matter of engineering, with the exception of coronagraph control and ultra-stability aspects discussed later in this chapter. LUVOIR will be larger than JWST, but its individual structures and mechanisms scale directly from space qualified JWST structures and mechanisms. Indeed, they may be easier to fabricate and test, since LUVOIR will not be cryogenic, and represent engineering evolution of existing designs that do not require new invention.</p><p>The technologies discussed in this chapter are critical to the science objectives of the LUVOIR mission. Some are currently immature, without demonstration by previous flight missions. In NASA parlance, they have a low Technology Readiness Level (TRL), from TRL 2 to TRL 4 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_81">Table 11</ref>.1 for definition of TRLs). All will need to be matured, through analysis and simulation, then by hardware breadboards and testbeds, then by building engineering models and prototypes for system or subsystem level testing in representative environments, to establish TRL 6 by the mission Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Recommendations for how and when they can be matured are noted throughout the chapter.</p><p>There is overlap within the major technology areas: between different coronagraph design families, with differing performance and sensitivity to disturbances; and between the various active optics and instrument technologies. There is a wide range of maturity as well. This provides LUVOIR scientists and engineers with options-and an architectural challenge. What combination of approaches at the system level best balances cost, risk, and complexity, while providing the required performance to achieve the stated science cases? The answer to this   question will be a moving target, changing as progress is made in the various technologies. The initial approach is to prefer less complex solutions, while anticipating needs that may arise as understanding of the most challenging requirements improves. The path to TRL 6 is based on performance testing at the component, subsystem, and system levels that will guide design choices, and ground the overall LUVOIR architecture in demonstrated performance. Computer modeling and analysis is an essential part of this process, and model verification at each step of technology demonstration is required to validate the tools that predict system performance. These tools will quantify the key architectural trades and provide an essential guide for LUVOIR development at every project phase, as they have for other observatories in the past.</p><p>We begin the discussion by reviewing coronagraph technologies, as they are the source of requirements for other technologies-such as the need for ultrastable optics and high-performance detectors. Ultra-stability is the second topic of discussion-this includes mirror fabrication and coatings, as well as active optics technologies. Then, instrument technologies, especially detectors for all of the LUVOIR instruments, as well as devices such as microshutter arrays for spectrographs, are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2">Coronagraph technology: High contrast imaging with an obscured aperture</head><p>LUVOIR's groundbreaking exoplanet observations will be accomplished by high contrast direct imaging, using a coronagraph to block the light from a star, in order to detect and characterize the much fainter light reflected from planets orbiting the star. The optical layout of a canonical coronagraph is sketched in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.1. It is an optical instrument that focuses light captured by the telescope onto an occulting mask. The mask blocks the star light at the very center of the field but passes light from objects even a very small angle off-center-like planets orbiting that star. After the mask, the beam is re-collimated and passed through a pupil stop, to remove starlight diffracted by the occulting mask. Finally, the beam is re-focused to form a starlight-suppressed image of the exoplanet system. This image can be LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor  The LUVOIR Interim Report produced either directly on a detector for broadband imaging, or on a lenslet array at the entrance of an integral field spectrograph for wavelength-resolved imaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.1">Coronagraph architectures</head><p>Coronagraph designs from the late 2000's were optimized for circular (or elliptical) apertures that do not have any obscurations in the pupil. This will not be the case for LUVOIR's on-axis telescope, with its secondary mirror and support struts, plus gaps between mirror segments introducing discontinuities in the optical beam. The diffraction caused by these features results in a broadened, azimuthally structured pointspread function. To achieve high suppression of the central starlight, these effects must be countered by other elements in the coronagraph, such as:</p><p>• an apodizing mask to filter the obscuring pupil features • a focal plane occulting mask with a complex transmission characteristic</p><p>• deformable mirrors (DMs): small mirrors that can be precisely shaped to remap the telescope pupil geometry.</p><p>The coronagraph research community is actively exploring how to optimally combine these design elements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">Mazoyer et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The key design objectives for a coronagraph are the deep suppression of the on-axis starlight, and the preservation of the planet light immediately adjacent to the center of the field, in the "dark hole" detection region. Starlight suppression is quantified in terms of contrast: the ratio of the intensity of the faintest detectable planet to that of the central star. The inner dimension of the dark hole is the inner working angle (IWA): the angle which quantifies how close a planet can be to the star and still be detected. IWA is commonly expressed in aperturenormalized terms, as a multiple of l/D: the ratio of the wavelength of light divided by the aperture diameter, which is about the diffraction-limited half-width of an ideal Two deformable mirrors (DMs) are used to establish high contrast. Out-of-band and low-order wavefront sensors (OBWFS, LOWFS) stabilize wavefront and intensity variations to preserve contrast.

Other key design metrics are bandpass-typically 10 to 20% of the center wavelength-and throughput, the percentage of the planet light captured by the telescope that makes it through to the core of the point-spread function imaged on the detector. Together, these metrics determine how quickly an observation can reach a high level of integrated signal, and how efficient spectroscopic characterization observations will be. Early work on advanced space coronagraph concepts emphasized achieving high contrast on telescopes with idealized unobscured apertures. Using a Lyot design with a band-limited occulter mask together with two DMs, the NASA Terrestrial Planet Finder project demonstrated contrast of 5 x 10 -10 with 10% bandpass at an IWA of 4 l/D. This established that the performance needed to image an Earth analog is feasible. It also kicked off a flurry of new coronagraph designs and tests. The best demonstrated contrasts at an IWA of 3.1 l/D 1 on an unobscured aperture currently stand at:</p><p>• 1.2 × 10 -10 at a bandpass of 2% • 6 × 10 -10 at a bandpass of 10% • 1.3 × 10 -9 at a bandpass of 20%</p><p>The addition of the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) to the WFIRST mission offered a major opportunity to the exoplanet imaging community-the application of state-of-the-art technology on a 2.4-meter diameter space telescope-and also new challenges. The WFIRST telescope has a large central obscuration (30% of diameter) and six secondary support struts. Together, these pose an exceptionally difficult coronagraph design problem. Furthermore, WFIRST will operate in a high-vibration environment that will dynamically tilt and deform the CGI wavefront during observations. In response to these challenges, coronagraph development has made rapid progress over the past 4 years, leading to the conception and laboratory demonstration of new design solutions for obscured apertures, and the application of Low-Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS). LOWFS uses light rejected by the coronagraph mask to actively stabilize the wavefront during coronagraph observations. LOWFS and related active stabilization methods are discussed in Section 11.3.</p><p>WFIRST CGI recently demonstrated a contrast &lt;1 × 10 -8 at an IWA of 3 l/D with a bandpass of 10% using 2 different coronagraph designs and LOWFS control. The demonstration was performed on a testbed that includes a WFIRST-like shadowed pupil and deliberately-induced dynamic disturbances that trace to those expected on orbit. As documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Shi et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b394">Seo et al. (2017)</ref>, the hybridLyot coronagraph design achieved 5 × 10 -9 contrast averaged over 3-9 l/D with a 10% bandwidth in the dynamic environment. Another major testbed milestone was reached in 2017 when the CGI team integrated a shaped-pupil Lyot coronagraph with an integral field spectrograph and demonstrated the first 1 × 10 -8 contrast over a broad (18%) spectroscopically-dispersed bandpass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">Cady et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Groff et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The progress made by the WFIRST project in developing obscured aperture coronagraphs has been driven by rigorous lab testing. A similar ground testing campaign, using a high-quality LUVOIR-traceable testbed, will be needed to demonstrate and debug LUVOIR coronagraphs. One such facility, the JPL Decadal Survey Testbed, will be used to demonstrate coronagraph performance at levels that trace to LUVOIR and HabEx science goals <ref type="bibr">(Crill &amp; Siegler</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor  The LUVOIR Interim Report 2017). This testbed will also provide the data for model validation activities, to ensure that the models used to engineer the coronagraphs and testbeds capture the key effects governing coronagraph performance. In parallel, the Space Telescope Science Institute is now commissioning the High Contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, aimed at system level demonstration at modest performance levels (non-vacuum), but realizing the nested loop wavefront control architecture that is necessary for LUVOIR. Caltech is also developing the High Contrast Spectroscopy Testbed, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11.</ref>2, that will demonstrate high-contrast, high-spectral resolution instrument concepts. LUVOIR coronagraph instruments will need 10 to 100 times the starlight suppression performance of the WFIRST CGI, requiring continuing development of key coronagraph elements beyond the WFIRST technology freeze. Some of these further developments are already underway, including the Segmented Coronagraph Design Analysis (SCDA) study, which sponsors independent coronagraph design work at Universities and NASA Centers, exploring alternate design pathways, and comparing performance in the context of telescopes like LUVOIR . SCDA has already yielded several coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve high contrast (10 -10 ), with bandpass up to 15%, IWA of 3-4 l/D, and with core throughput as high as 20% 2 -all with segmented apertures traceable to LUVOIR. The performance of these coronagraphs can be degraded by numerous effects such as leaked light from spatially-resolved stars, mask fabrication and alignment errors, DM calibration errors, and dynamic wavefront error disturbances. The SCDA design teams are pursuing solutions that are robust to these effects. For LUVOIR-A, the preferred coronagraph designs include the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2015;</ref>). The APLC uses a mask technology that is similar to the shaped pupil coronagraph on WFIRST CGI. It has the virtue of being relatively tolerant to resolved stellar diameter (maintaining most of the 10 -10 dark zone at star diameters up to 0.1-0.2 l/D) but has a relatively large IWA (&gt; 3 l/D) and a throughput penalty originating in the transmission loss of the apodizer mask. The second preferred design is the vector vortex coronagraph (VVC), which can reach the same contrast as the APLC but with smaller inner working angle (~2 l/D) and over a wide bandpass, limited only by the wavefront control system performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b393">Ruane et al. 2016</ref>). For centrally obscured telescope apertures, however, the VVC has significantly more sensitivity to stellar diameter than the APLC.</p><p>The best overall solution for LUVOIR might be to include multiple coronagraph </p></div>

Like the WFIRST CGI, the mask would be selected according to the demands of each observation. Thus, LUVOIR could use its VVC for smaller, more distant stars, or longer wavelength nearinfrared observations in general, whereas the APLC would be used for nearby stars large enough to be spatially resolved by the telescope. The phase-induced amplitude apodization-complex mask coronagraph (PIAA-CMC) is a third Lyot coronagraph design variant that has been developed for high performance on segmented apertures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Guyon et al. 2010</ref>). The prospects for this new design family are promising, particularly in terms of inner working angle and throughput. The LUVOIR Study Team anticipates new PIAA-CMC designs tailored to LUVOIR to evaluate within the next year alongside the APLC and apodized VVC.</p><p>Yet another coronagraph design family that is a candidate for LUVOIR are nulling coronagraphs, such as the visible nulling coronagraph (VNC) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">Lyon et al. 2008</ref>). Instead of an apodizing and focal-plane mask architecture, the VNC concept relies on pupil shearing interferometry to destructively interfere on-axis starlight. The VNC offers excellent inner working angle (2 l/D) and relatively high throughput (no apodizing mask), but at the cost of greater optical complexity. The VNC remains under active development both in terms of design concept and laboratory demonstration <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">(Hicks 2016)</ref>.</p><p>These advances have moved the coronagraph state of the art forward, as summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_81">Table 11</ref>.2.

APLC and VVC designs tailored to LUVOIR have been successfully demonstrated at the proof-of-concept level using computer models, establishing TRL 3-laboratory demonstrations are needed to advance to TRL 4, 5, and 6. Finally, we note rapid progress in photonic devices, driven by the communications industry. Design and analysis of idealized coronagraphs using devices such as photonic lanterns and universal linear optical processors indicate real potential for new methods to help solve some of the hardest problems in obscured-aperture coronagraphy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.2">Deformable mirrors</head><p>Deformable mirrors (DMs) are small mirrors with reflective face sheets whose optical figure can be changed over a small range using actuators. When used in coronagraphs, one DM is typically placed at a pupil image, where it strongly affects the phase of the electric field, providing direct correction of the largest source of wavefront error, namely the primary mirror. In this configuration a highcontrast dark hole can only be obtained in one half of the field of view. Adding a second DM at a plane away from the pupil image allows correction not only of the phase, but of the beam amplitude, which varies across the beam. The combination of two DMs also enables grating-like diffraction to null "speckles"-concentrations of light that occur in the dark-hole detection region. This results in a dark hole that is now symmetric with respect to the optical axis and in theory has wider bandpass. In general, the optical shape of the DMs is determined by</p><p>• obtaining an estimate of the complex electrical field at the science camera (in order to avoid non-common-path errors), • using a precise diffractive model of the DM response through the coronagraph in order to find the DM settings that will best cancel the aberrated complex field, and • iterating this process in order to obtain a solution that is robust to noise in the</p></div>

The estimation is in general done using spatial or temporal modulation of the images at the science camera</p><p>The DMs in a coronagraph also set the outer size limit of the dark hole. The outer working angle (OWA) is theoretically defined by the spatial Nyquist frequency of the coronagraph DMs, as the reciprocal of twice the actuator spacing. LUVOIR will require high actuator density, from 64 × 64 to 128 × 128 actuators, to provide dark-hole diameters between 32 and 64 l/D (440-880 mas at a wavelength of 1.0 mm for LUVOIR-A). Note that the IWA and OWA both scale with wavelength. Coupled with the narrow observing bands required for high contrast, this means that multiple observations at different wavelengths are needed to map out the full detection region.</p><p>Once a dark hole is achieved, the DMs must maintain contrast by correcting slow drifts in the rest of the optical system, using picometer-level actuator commands. The measurements that allow this to happen are provided by concurrent wavefront sensing, and/or metrology, discussed in Section 11.3. The CGI testbed has shown that a DM feed-forward control can also be useful, to provide fast response based on mechanical measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Shi et al. 2017</ref>). The CGI testbed has also shown that DM actuation error and actuator creep, though small, can limit coronagraph performance. Ultimately, high spatial resolution and/or repeated rounds of the contrast acquisition algorithm may be required to counter actuator errors not measurable by other means.</p><p>State of the Art:</p><p>(1) Electrostrictive PMN-based (leadmagnesium-niobate) DMs have been used to demonstrate 6 × 10 -10 contrast at 10% bandwidth with unobscured pupils, and 1 × 10 -8 contrast with the obscured WFIRST CGI pupil. These are being baselined for the WFIRST CGI instrument (TRL 5).</p><p>(2) Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) DMs have been used in a laboratory setting to achieve 5 × 10 -9 contrast in the visible nulling coronagraph (TRL 4). Continuous facesheet MEMS DMs are also routinely used on groundbased observatory systems to achieve moderate contrasts (10 -5 -10 -6 ) (TRL 4).</p><p>Path to TRL 5: Continue to mature DM technology by flight qualifying the devices and electronics. Improve actuator counts to 64 × 64 or larger. Increasing the actuator count of electrostrictive DMs is accomplished by mosaicking actuator blocks behind a common facesheet. MEMS DMs actuator counts can be increased with photolithography, but scaling electrical interconnects is a challenge. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.4 shows a wiring diagram for an 8,000-actuator device currently under development. Other goals include miniaturization of drive electronics and demonstrating feed-forward control precision and repeatability consistent with LUVOIR wavefront sensing and control requirements. Environmental tests of MEMS DMs will demonstrate robustness to launch vibrations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3">Active optics: An architecture for ultra-stability</head><p>The hardest technical challenge facing LUVOIR is the need to preserve 10 -10 contrast during coronagraph observations. High contrast is established at the beginning of each observation using "speckle nulling" controls, such as the electric field conjugation algorithm, which drives the coronagraph's two DMs to suppress residual starlight in the dark hole, compensating phase and amplitude irregularities in the telescope and coronagraph optics. The DMs must make and hold wavefront adjustments as small as a few picometers RMS. Once contrast is established it must be stably maintained for long periods of time, potentially many days, while the coronagraph accumulates photons from the planets, often at a rate of a few photons a minute.</p><p>Analysis shows that the required stability is a function of the spatial frequency of the disturbances, so that a low spatial frequency wavefront error drift can be as large as 100 pm RMS without excessive contrast degradation, while segment-to-segment phasing drift must be held below about 40 pm RMS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">Nemati et al. 2017</ref>). All of this is required on a spacecraft with vibration disturbances from spinning attitude control reaction wheels, with thermal deformations from an environment with slow temperature changes and using devices such as DMs and materials such as invar, carbon composites and adhesives that, at the picometer level, are prone to creep <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">(Sokolowski et al. 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Against this challenge LUVOIR has several powerful tools. The first is a design that creates a stable thermal environment, even as the telescope is repointed from star to star. This is accomplished with a large flat sunshield, and a gimbal between the sunshield and the telescope, as described in Chapter 8. Second is the use of thermally stable materials, coupled with milli-Kelvinlevel thermal controls, especially for the primary mirror segments. These minimize thermally driven deformations in LUVOIR mirrors and structures. Third is the use of passive isolation between the spacecraft attitude control system to attenuate highfrequency vibrations before they disturb the telescope.</p><p>However, these tools alone will not achieve ultra-stability. For that, LUVOIR will also require active measurement and control of the optics and wavefront during and between observations, to preserve the wavefront established during speckle nulling control in the face of thermal and other drift effects. To keep vibrations from limiting contrast, LUVOIR will also need active disturbance isolation between the payload and the spacecraft as a whole. These capabilities will be provided by active optics technologies described in this section:</p><p>• wavefront sensing and control running in parallel with coronagraph observations; • active, high bandwidth metrology of the optical configuration; and • active, high-attenuation vibration isolation at the spacecraft/telescope interface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.1">Finding the minimum-cost, maximum-performance solution</head><p>LUVOIR has many tools that can be combined in multiple ways to provide the ultra-stability needed for coronagraphy. Which combination will provide the needed performance at the lowest risk, cost, and complexity requires resolving trade-offs that will define the architecture for LUVOIR's active optics system. Final resolution of these design trades requires advancing the TRL of the individual technologies, at the component and subsystem levels, ultimately to achieve TRL 6 for the combined active optics observatory architecture at the mission PDR. This will be done by analyzing, building and testing components and subsystems: first testing components; then testing integrated subscale systems; finally testing at the engineering or prototype level in system-level, subsystem-level assemblies, or testbeds. For the LUVOIR-A point design study, the design team has made choices that emphasize simplicity. More complexity will be added only as needed to meet performance or reduce cost. This testing is done to verify component and subsystem performance-and in the process, to validate and verify computer models of each component and subsystem. These models can then be combined, intermixing structures, thermal, optics, dynamics, and controls discipline modeling tools in an integrated computing environment: so-called STOP modeling (StructuralThermal-Optical Performance). Ultimately, with component models grounded in testing, system-level STOP models can accurately predict system-level performance, quantifying the performance aspects of trades between different design options. Even now, at the very earliest stages, integrated modeling is proving essential in identifying architectural approaches, and setting performance allocations for the various components and subsystems, including contrast, image quality, and wavefront error budgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b392">(Redding 2016)</ref>.</p><p>STOP modeling is not a new technology or approach, but LUVOIR will present new challenges, especially the need to accurately predict performance in the picometer wavefront regime, where no material is entirely stable. This is a step beyond current practice. Sources of creep will include DM actuator nonlinearities, desorption of moisture from composite materials, natural creep of materials such as Invar, and epoxy strain relief. These creep effects have the potential to cause changes that degrade contrast, if not measured and controlled at the appropriate time intervals-and the LUVOIR STOP models will need to capture these effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.2">Wavefront sensing and control concurrent with coronagraph observations: LOWFS, OBWFS, and artificial guide stars</head><p>One way to stabilize the coronagraph contrast is by continuously measuring and correcting changes in the optical wavefront, using concurrent wavefront sensing and control (WFSC). This approach has the advantage that it can directly measure all of the changes that occur in the beam train, whether in the telescope or in the coronagraph. It has several challenges, however, such as the long integration times needed to make individual wavefront measurements when observing the dimmest target stars.</p><p>The WFIRST CGI testbed is already demonstrating the effectiveness of low order wavefront sensing and control (LOWFS) in measuring and controlling low-order wavefront disturbances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b397">Shi et al. 2016)</ref>. Figure 11.5, the core of the starlight image is reflected off the backside of the occulting spot of the focal plane mask, which includes a small dimple at the center to create a spherical reference wavefront. This forms a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b399">Wallace et al. 2011</ref>). The interference fringes that result provide a high-precision measure of the wavefront errors present in the beam. The spatial frequency of the measured wavefront is limited, since the occulting spot, which is only the width of the image core, functions as a low-pass spatial filter. LOWFS is not able to resolve higher spatial frequency effects, such as segment-to-segment phase errors, or deformations within segments. Results on the WFIRST CGI testbed have demonstrated LOWFS line-of-sight sensitivity to 0.01 mas, consistent with a feedback closed-control bandwidth of ~10 Hz and feedforward control up to 100 Hz, and sensitivity to low order spatial modes (focus, astigmatism, coma, trefoil) down to ~10 pm at 0.05 Hz under the testbed source. These results are limited by testbed stability and photon noise. Low-light (V=2 mag for dark-hole creation and V=5 mag for LOWFS) experiments are on-going and the recent initial test results are very promising.</p><p>Another approach for LUVOIR is to sample the full beam from the star, so that all of the wavefront spatial frequencies that can be controlled are measured. This is done using a dichroic beam splitter to split the light, sending one band to the coronagraph and another to an Out-of-Band Wavefront Sensor (OBWFS): UV light for wavefront sensing, while observing in the visible, for instance. The OBWFS sensor uses the LOWFS architecture, including a ZWFS, but without the spatial filtering effect of the reflection from the occulting spot. It measures low, mid, and high spatial frequency wavefront errors, though the accuracy and speed with which each term can be measured depends on the magnitude of the guide star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.6 shows the spectral type and visual magnitude of the expected population of LUVOIR-A exoEarth target stars-note that the average is V~6 mag, and all targets are brighter than V~11 mag. Monte-Carlo simulation analysis shows that OBWFS is potentially capable of resolving segment-scale disturbances to the 1 pm level in 96 seconds with a V=5 mag guide star <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 11.</ref>3). This assumes LUVOIR's idealized 15-m aperture with no throughput losses. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11-14</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report</p><p>The LOWFS approach is attractive because it has a minimum of non-common path optical error since nearly all of the wavefront error (and wavefront error drift) measured in the LOWFS sensor is common to both the coronagraph and the sensor. The target low order wavefront will be near zero, consistent with the use of the classical linearized ZWFS control algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b399">Wallace et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>For OBWFS, the target wavefront will be larger, in the tens of nanometers. Some of this is due to the non-common path, as the dichroic and other optics will be unique to the sensor, and as the wavefront sensor and coronagraph are operating in different wavelengths. Plus, the speckle-nulling control will use the DMs to generate gratinglike features in the mid and high spatial frequency wavefront, features that help reject the effects of the shadowed aperture, and that compensate residual mid-and highspatial frequency errors of the telescopethese features must be maintained. OBWFS will need to accurately measure picometer differential wavefront changes in the presence of tens of nanometers of fixed control wavefront error. This will tend to push operation of the ZWFS out of the linear regime, requiring use of higher dynamicrange, higher-performance nonlinear sensing algorithms. Nonlinear wavefront sensing algorithms that appear to meet OBWFS performance requirements are now being investigated.</p><p>The great advantage of OBWFS and LOWFS is that they can continuously measure the complete LUVOIR telescope and coronagraph wavefront: they directly observe all the effects that degrade contrast, while the coronagraph is observing. The greatest challenge they face is operating fast enough to keep up with these disturbances. A target star magnitude ≤ 5 allows segment control loop closure times of 96 seconds or less, and DM control loop closure times of 11 minutes or less <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 11.</ref>3). For fainter stars, sensing times increase, eventually making it difficult to keep up with expected thermal and material creep effects. Fortunately, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.6 indicates, 90% of the LUVOIR-A stars are brighter than V=10. For dim science stars, a combination of LOWFS to measure line of sight and low order aberrations using rejected science light, and OBWFS tracking high order aberrations at a much longer exposure length may be more photon efficient.</p><p>One way to get around the dim guide star challenge is to provide an artificial guide <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.6.

Metrology does not require a guide star to sense and control the largest sources of instability, such as dephasing of the primary mirror segments or despace of the secondary mirror. As such it is complementary to OBWFS and LOWFS, providing much higher bandwidth, maintaining alignments during maneuvers, and ensuring telescope performance during general astrophysical observations, when the coronagraph is not operating.</p><p>Two metrology methods are especially well suited for LUVOIR.

While segment edge sensors are part of the LUVOIR-A baseline, the specific implementation of the edge sensor is still under study. Capacitive edge sensors have long been used on ground-based segmented telescopes, notably the Keck Telescopes on Mauna Kea, where they provide 1 nm noise and 3.2 nm/week drift in relative segment edge piston measurements. The Keck edge sensors use interleaved sensing elements to ensure high sensitivity and stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b382">(Minor et al. 1990</ref>). Edge sensors planned for the upcoming Thirty Meter Telescope use face-on sensing plates, plus gap measurements-a non-interleaved approach better adapted for deployed-aperture space telescopes ( <ref type="bibr">Shelton et al. 2008</ref>). Capacitive gap measurement devices have demonstrated 15 pm precision for applications on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, although for much smaller gaps than are planned between LUVOIR segments.</p><p>Challenges for capacitive edge sensors include the need for close and stable gaps between the segments, including the possible need to interleave sensor structures, and high voltage for high sensitivity. Other edge sensor designs, using inductive ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b400">Wasmeier et al. 2014</ref>) or optical measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Burt et al. 2012</ref>), are also reasonable candidates.</p><p>The second metrology method is laser truss metrology, using a network of laser distance gauges to measure the rigid body state of the segments relative to the secondary mirror, and measuring the secondary mirror <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.7. Ground-based segmented telescopes commonly use non-contacting capacitive edge sensors, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope devices shown here. Configured with two sensors per adjacent segment edge, they are capable of measuring primary mirror segment-tosegment alignments. The hybrid edge sensor/laser truss metrology architecture sketched on the right uses laser metrology on the 12 segments shown tilted, and segment edge sensors on all segments. It offers better performance than either system alone, provided both have picometer precision in the most sensitive axes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.8. Laser metrology truss. With 6 laser distance gauges between each segment and corner cubes attached to the secondary mirror, each segment can be independently aligned to the secondary. Another 6 gauges from the backend instrument bench to the secondary mirror ties the primary and secondary mirror to the instrument optics. These measurements are fed back to the segment and secondary mirror rigid body position actuators to keep the entire observatory in close alignment.  relative to the instrument optics behind the primary mirror (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.8). Laser metrology can measure alignment of all of the major optical elements relative to a common reference, such as a master optical bench, or reference point on the backplane support frame. Then the rigid body actuators on the segments and secondary mirror can effectively "rigidize" the entire telescope in inertial space. Laser metrology draws its heritage ultimately from the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) project, which demonstrated picometer precision on large ground-based testbeds, with large and heavy beam launchers and corner cubes. Subsequent development achieved much smaller and more compact laser metrology devices for attachment to lightweight mirror segments, targeting performance at the sub-nanometer level. The LISA Pathfinder mission has further refined laser metrology technology, flying laser gauges and electronics that achieve picometer accuracy. Combining elements of the SIM and LISA approaches could provide the picometer-precision alignment measurements that LUVOIR will need to preserve coronagraph high contrast performance during extended observations, and do it in a compact, unobtrusive package that will not interfere with image quality. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.9 shows two example beam launcher devices from laser metrology systems.</p><p>Analysis shows that a hybrid metrology approach, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.7, using segment edge sensors on every segment, and using a laser metrology truss on a few selected segments, can outperform either system on its own, provided that both systems have picometer-level sensitivity. This approach provides the end-to-end system measurement capabilities of a laser metrology truss, while the less complex segment edge sensor devices may be better positioned to measure lateral movements of the segments relative to each other. The optimal blend of measurements will depend on the ultimate precision of practical hardware for both systems and is a focus for upcoming technology studies.</p><p>Path to TRL 4: For edge sensors, develop one or more approaches (capacitive, inductive, optical) capable of picometer sensitivity, and demonstrate sensitivity in the lab.

The LUVOIR baseline design uses a non-contact <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.10. Non-contacting vibration isolation "floats" the telescope across a narrow gap from the spacecraft. The payload controls the telescope line-of-sight by pushing against the spacecraft inertia using a set of six non-contact voicecoil actuators, while the spacecraft controls its inertial attitude such that interface stroke and gap are maintained. Requirements for spacecraft attitude control are no more stringent than those for conventional spacecraft, and do not derive from payload pointing requirements. Payload line-of-sight isolation from spacecraft disturbances is broadband, even down to low frequency, and is not affected by interface measurement noise.

This method has been flight proven by LISA Pathfinder, which used colloidal thrusters to achieve thrust of 30 micro-Newtons or less, with resolution down to 0.1 micro-Newtons.

Adoption of this approach needs to be considered at the system level to fully assess its advantages.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.6">Active control of the telescope wavefront</head><p>The telescope wavefront control actuation has a large trade space. Primary mirror segment and secondary mirror rigid body control is required to phase the segments and align the telescope following launch and maintain alignment during the life of the mission. Loworder segment figure actuation may be used to compensate for mirror fabrication errors, such as radius-of-curvature mismatch between segments, or residual gravity release effects. Higher-order segment figure actuation offers resilience to other possible wavefront errors, such as segment edge defects, and could even be used as part of the coronagraph speckle-nulling control. Wavefront control may also be applied at the telescope exit pupil using a deformable mirror external to the coronagraph. An active secondary mirror with high-order figure actuation, could also be used, though such corrections may not be effective over the entire telescope field of view due to pupil registration, distortion, and magnification limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">(McComas &amp; Friedman 2002</ref> primary mirror segment rigid body motion and control of the segment motion) requires precision rigid body actuators, perhaps like those used on JWST, but with an additional ultra-fine actuation stage. Control at the telescope is expected to be bandlimited in the spatial and temporal domains. In the spatial domain, the band is limited by the actuation spatial resolution, set by the segment geometry for rigid body control, and by actuator density if segment figure actuators or a deformable mirror is used. In the temporal domain the bands are constrained by the integrating action of observations and the chopping action of angular-or field-difference observing strategies. The exact temporal bandwidth is dependent on the science observation and architecture, but the control bandwidth is likely below 1 Hz, with passive stability needed at frequencies above the control bandwidth. The most stringent control capability within the 1 Hz bandwidth is expected to be segment piston at ~10 pm RMS of wavefront, followed by segment tilt at 25 pm RMS wavefront ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">Nemati et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>This level of actuation for LUVOIR is TRL 3. An example is Mad City Labs, Inc. 4 closed-loop piezo actuators, which show 5 picometer step resolution and have been independently demonstrated to achieve &lt;10 pm RMS on a 0.5 Hz sinusoid-good enough for LUVOIR. This actuator design was developed for a past flight application, but more development is needed for LUVOIR, including lightweighting and integration with a large-stroke actuator (such as the ones flown on JWST). The most important aspect of the Mad City Labs actuator is the demonstration of the small step resolution which provides confidence the LUVOIR requirements can be met. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.11 shows an actuator concept that uses PZT devices in concert with a flexure design to achieve picometerlevel step sizes while also isolating the PZT devices from launch loads.</p><p>Path to TRL 4: Develop flight prototype rigid body actuators, using one or more methods (PZT, mechanical, or a hybrid), and test in the lab.</p><p>Path to TRL 5: Demonstration of picometer-level actuation of a subscale segment with a prototype rigid body actuator in six-degrees of freedom.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.7">Primary mirror segments</head><p>LUVOIR primary mirror segments and their supporting subsystems can draw on heritage from multiple sources, with some key options that will need to be traded to assure best performance and affordable cost, complexity, and risk. Here we note that the JWST mirror segments are made from beryllium, a material chosen for its high stability at cryogenic temperatures. Beryllium is not the best candidate for LUVOIR because at the operational temperature of 270 K, beryllium has a very high CTE. Beryllium mirrors are also time consuming and expensive to fabricate; it took about 8 years to complete a fully integrated JWST segment assembly. Many space telescopes have used mirrors made of Ultra Low Expansion (ULE) glass, a material that is thermally very stable, and that can be figured and polished to UV requirements. ULE is commonly "lightweighted," fabricated with a honeycomb core between two thin facesheets, to provide needed high stiffness at a low mass. One facesheet is polished and coated, to provide the optically reflective surface (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  11</ref>.12).</p><p>The LUVOIR-A design assumes the use of lightweighted ULE for each of its 120 primary mirror segments, building on technology first demonstrated by the Advanced Mirror Segment Demonstrator project, which built and tested prototype JWST mirror segments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b379">Matthews et al. 2003</ref>). Each segment will be mounted via bonded invar pads that are then mounted to support flexures. The struts connect the mirror to six rigid body actuators, arranged as three separate bipods. All segments are then connected to a common backplane structure, a highly stable, stiff, composite structure that forms the backbone of the primary mirror assembly. This approach allows each segment to be independently positioned in six degreesof-freedom, so they can be aligned and phased even if the backplane structure deforms. Another important part of each mirror segment will be an active thermal control system, with one or more heaters and temperature sensors acting to maintain the temperature of each segment at 270 K. Analysis indicates that thermal stability of 1 mK will provide ~1 pm mirror figure stability during operations ( ).</p><p>One consideration for LUVOIR is whether or not its segments should be equipped with surface figure actuators. To achieve diffraction-limited performance at 500 nm requires a surface figure error of ~10 nm RMS over the fully-phased 120-segment primary mirror surface. Mirrors are limited in Surface figure actuators enable onorbit correction of these errors, insuring against contingencies, and relaxing difficult fabrication requirements. Surface figure actuators introduce weight and complexity, however. Lightweighted, surface-figure actuated ULE mirror segment systems have already been built and tested.</p><p>Another, highly actuated approach to primary mirror segments has been developed, using a Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrate technology equipped with many surface figure actuators. These "Actuated Hybrid Mirrors," shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>.13 repeatedly demonstrated 15 nm surface figure, after correction of fabrication and gravity sag errors of 1800 nm-a correction factor of &gt;100×. Actuated Hybrid Mirrors use a replication-based fabrication process, with a nanolaminate foil face sheet bonded to the SiC substrate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">Hickey et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Better performance is expected if the SiC substrate is clad with pure silicon instead of the nanolaminate, and then superpolished to meet as-built figure of &lt;100 nm RMS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b401">Wellman et al. 2012</ref>). Assuming the same correction factor as the nanolaminate version, operational surface figures of &lt;10 nm would be achievable.</p><p>The advantage of highly actuated mirrors is the high level of figure control, enough to meet the required surface figure error performance at a wide range of temperatures, in 1-g as well as 0-g, even with relaxed polishing requirements. The high actuator density would even allow the use of the primary mirror as a third DM for shaping coronagraph wavefronts. A disadvantage is the relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion of SiC at LUVOIR's 270 K operating temperature. Analysis suggests that the high thermal controllability of SiC can be thermally stable at the needed level, though with 10× tighter temperature controls (~100 µK) than for the ULE. The passive stability of SiC improves as the operating temperature drops, approaching a coefficient of thermal expansion of 0 at around 100 K. Thus, SiC mirrors are well suited for cold or cryogenic applications. A final consideration is the simple fact that active SiC mirrors do not have the long heri- </p></div>

In Hubble Space Telescope parlance, any one of these cases represents a Large or Treasury program.</p><p>Here, we imagine how aspects of each signature science case can combine as part of a robust multi-scale, guest observerdriven portfolio to impact an enormous range of science in LUVOIR's first year of observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.1">Doing the impossible</head><p>LUVOIR's combination of aperture, resolution, and sensitivity allow it to perform science that is otherwise impossible. For "impossible," consider two different operating definitions. First, impossible can be taken as its traditional meaning: science that fundamentally requires an observatory of LUVOIR's size and capability. The second definition speaks to science that can be done by observatories of lesser capability but will not likely be done due to the observations requiring prohibitively large amounts of time. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 12</ref>.1 shows the allocation of observing time on HST as a function of program size in orbits. As a general rule, small observations are executed frequently, Treasury-scale observations very rarely. For fully commissioned guest observer facilities, this trend is usually invariant with aperture. However, by virtue of its immense capability through a combination of aperture and instrumentation, one of LUVOIR's assets is its ability to move to the left programs that sit on the right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 12</ref>.1 for smaller observatories. For example, the iconic Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) which required over 11 days of observing with HST could be performed in approximately 1 hour with LUVOIR-A. Essentially, otherwise prohibitively large programs become routine, freeing up time for programs fitting our first definition of impossible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">A transformational first year of science</head><p>We do not know how a future time allocation committee will prioritize science programs, but we expect a healthy balance across exoplanet science, general astrophysics, and solar system science. We also note that in many cases parallel observations can be executed, facilitating exciting combinations of large program science. For example, a 25 hour-long ECLIPS spectroscopic observation of an exoEarth candidate can simultaneously return 5-band HDI imaging at a depth 2-3 magnitudes deeper than the HUDF. When we consider the power of parallel observations, and the multiple science cases addressed by deep field observations (let alone archival data uses), any description of a set of long LUVOIR observations for a single science case is likely to significantly underestimate the total return for that time investment. We illustrate LUVOIR's immense potential science return with a list of observing programs that require total exposure times of ~100 hours or fewer to execute, assuming the LUVOIR-A Architecture. These programs are drawn from the signature science cases described in this report. They do not, however, span the whole range of programs that the community may choose to execute as a guest observer-driven facility, nor are they intended to express any prioritization of science topics. They simply represent an example menu of large-scale program options that could be done in LUVOIR's first year, while leaving greater than three quarters of the time free for as-yet-to-bedetermined programs at any scale, assuming a very conservative observatory efficiency of 50%. As neither the telescope+instrument sensitivities are finalized at this stage nor the exact targets known in many cases, these example projects are approximate, preliminary, and purely illustrative. It is important to emphasize that in nearly every case below, a parallel observation can be executed, usually with either HDI or LUMOS.</p><p>• The exoEarth search begins: ECLIPS makes ~ 25 visits to a variety of FGK stars (plus Proxima Centauri) within 7 parsecs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.1.1">Introduction</head><p>At its closest approach, Venus is the nearest planet to Earth, yet much still remains unknown about Earth's twisted sister. Many important Venus science questions can be addressed with sys-Earth telescopic observations. A sufficiently small solar elongation viewing angle for LUVOIR (≤ 45°) enables such observations of Venus. This, together with a darkening neutral density filter, opens the door to exciting and much needed data on the Venusian atmosphere. Three interesting case studies that could be investigated with LUVOIR are described briefly below as examples of the types of Venus science LUVOIR can make possible.</p><p>1. Observations from the JAXA Akatsuki orbiter have revealed an unusual stationary bow-shaped wave at the Venus cloud tops (65 km) observable at multiple wavelengths from the UV at 283 nm (corresponding to a SO 2 absorption band) to the longwave infrared at <ref type="bibr">8-12 mm (Fukuhara et al. 2017</ref>). Normal wind speeds at these high altitudes whip across the planet at roughly 100 m/s, but this UV-bright, bow-shaped feature remains stationary relative to the surface far below. The center of the bow-shaped feature ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13.1)</ref> is located above the western slope of equatorial highland region Aphrodite Terra, and is interpreted to be a stationary atmospheric gravity wave associated with lower atmosphere wind flows over the terrain. However, the propagation of such waves to the cloud tops is difficult to reconcile with current understanding of convection in the Venus atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr">Seiff et al. 1985</ref>). Thus, the dynamics of the Venus atmosphere may be more complex than previously thought.</p><p>Monitoring the temporal evolution of features such as this could provide new insights into the physics of Venus atmosphere circulation.</p><p>2. Long temporal baseline (1970s-2012) monitoring of Venus across multiple Venus missions at l = 215 and 283 nm has revealed quasi-periodic variations in high altitude (70 km) SO 2 abundance ( <ref type="bibr">Marcq et al. 2012</ref>) with reported variations from ~400 ppbv to less than 100 ppbv. This variability may be related to poorly understood oscillations in atmospheric circulation, and/ or volcanic injections of SO 2 into the upper atmosphere. The amount of SO 2 currently in the atmosphere has been estimated to be in excess of equilibrated conditions by a factor of 100, implying a source (i.e., volcanism) within the past 20 million years <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">(Bullock &amp; Grinspoon 2001</ref>). Monitoring of SO 2 variations may therefore shed light on multiple processes related to atmospheric dynamics and/or volcanic processes. Such a monitoring campaign demands a UVenabled space-based platform that can observe Venus over years or decades. 3. Besides SO 2 , several other trace gases can be observed in the Venus spectrum, providing insights into chemical, dynamical, and photochemical processes that occur on Venus. For example, significant and surprising variability has been observed in the abundances and distributions of trace gases in the Venusian sub-cloud atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">Arney et al. 2014</ref>). These variations hint at poorly understood chemical and physical mechanisms operating in the lower atmosphere. They also suggest the presence of H 2 SO 4 virga events (rain that evaporates before reaching the surface). Between 1-2.5 mm, one can observe upwelling thermal radiation from the subcloud (0-45 km) atmosphere on the Venus nightside.

To underscore this point, the brightest source the online LUMOS ETC includes has an AB magnitude of 15, and the brightest source included for HDI is magnitude 20. Venus is an extremely bright target for LUVOIR. However, LUVOIR is also considering observations of Jupiter, which has m v = -2.7, so Venus is comparable The LUVOIR Interim Report to other bright solar system targets under consideration.</p><p>The angular diameter of Venus is ~30" when the planet is close to maximum elongation.</p><p>The LUVOIR-A LUMOS spectrometer currently has a wavelength range 100-400 nm, and it may be extended to 1000 nm. LUMOS has several available resolutions (R = 500, 16000, 63200, 100000), enabling moderate and very high-resolution spectroscopy. For comparison, previous observations probing isotopes in the Venus atmosphere have used R = 10 5 ( <ref type="bibr">Krasnopolsky et al. 2010)</ref>, while measurement of gas species in the nightside thermal windows can be accomplished with R = 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">(Arney et al. 2014</ref>), so the range of resolutions used by LUVOIR are useful for a variety of studies.

It has two channels: UVIS covering 200-950 nm and NIR covering 800-2500 nm. Nyquist sampled pixels at 400 nm (2.73 mas/pixel) and at 1200 nm (8.20 mas/pixel) mean that 10000 pixels will span Venus at 400 nm (~ 1.2 km/pixel) and 3600 pixels at 1200 nm (3.3 km/pixel).

The large aperture considered for LUVOIR (~12-15m) will also allow both shorter cadence time-series (~1 hour) -providing higher surface resolution to the inferred maps-and access to solar-analog systems out to a greater distance, which increases the yield for such investigations.</p></div>

Our program will leverage these long integrations to "mine" for rotationally induced exoplanet time variability using individual ~1 hour exposures from a longer composite spectrum. If these observations include data within the 0.7-0.8 mm LUVOIR bandpass (which contains the 0.76 mm O 2 A band), we can bin the spectrum into a single photometric point and construct a lightcurve of a terrestrial exoplanet over the total spectrum exposure time. Our simulations suggest that this dataset can be used to infer the rotation rate of Earth to within ~5% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b412">Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2017</ref>). Binning the time-dependent spectra into two or more photometric points is an effective means of constructing simultaneous multi-wavelength lightcurves, which could potentially infer the crude longitudinal distribution and color of oceans on an Earth analog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b412">Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2017</ref>). Other wavelengths can be used either instead of or in concert with the 0.7-0.8 mm LUVOIR bandpass, such as the 0.4-0.45 mm bandpass, where Rayleigh scattering masks surface features and enhances sensitivity to heterogeneous cloud coverage. However, the 0.7-0.8 mm bandpass is still preferred for the initial assessment because of its sensitivity to both atmospheric oxygen and the planetary surface.</p><p>This science program would allow a long spectral exposure, to yield two unique studies along both the spectral and temporal dimensions. Co-adding in time will give a long integration spectrum at the native instrument spectral resolution that can be used to study the atmospheric composition of the targeted exoplanet. Co-adding in wavelength will give a long baseline lightcurve with little to no spectral resolution that can be used to study the targeted exoplanet's rotation rate and surface map. Since the time-resolution of a lightcurve depends on the individual exposure times that comprise the timeseries data, low noise or noiseless detectors that can support shorter exposure times will greatly improve the feasibility and scientific return of this program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.6.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>LUVOIR provides two essential opportunities: First, the UV capabilities of LUMOS allow for the technique to be applied for HI Lyman alpha anywhere from 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.2, essentially the last 11 billion years of cosmic history. At lower redshifts, the extent on the sky of the background galaxy increases, facilitating finer and finer spatial sampling. Second, LUVOIR's immense aperture allows for the technique to be applied to the more general population of galaxies. As a result, instead of relying on very rare gravitational lens scenarios, galaxies at FUV magnitudes of 20 (for LUMOS high resolution modes) or 23 (for low resolution modes still capable of detecting HI and metal absorption) are reachable in ~1 hr integration time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.8.1">Introduction</head><p>In the search for exoEarth candidates with LUVOIR, we will undoubtedly detect a multitude of brighter planets. According to , for an 8-m size telescope, the number of exoEarth candidates detected is ~ 20 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> in ), although this is strongly dependent on the value of h Earth . At the same time, the number of stars that must be observed to detect these exo-Earth candidates numbers in the hundreds. If we assume that on average, every star has a planet of some size <ref type="bibr">(Cassan et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Suzuki et al. 2016)</ref>, then there are hundreds of exoplanets of all sizes that can be observed. Not considering the ~20 exoEarth candidates, the bulk of the exoplanets will fall into "non-Earth" classifications, without any distinguishing features between them. This provides a motivation to devise a scheme for classifying exoplanets based on planetary size and corresponding comparative atmospheric characteristics of exoplanets. With some exceptions of Venus-type exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr">Kane et al. 2012</ref>), there has not been an overarching way to classify planets beyond the habitable zone (HZ). Classifying different size planets based on the transition/ condensation of different species at different stellar fluxes (i.e., orbital distances) provides a physical motivation for estimating exoplanet mission yields, separate from exoEarth candidate yields ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13.11)</ref>.</p></div>

A 15-m telescope will bring the ability to not only observe planets, but to test the occurrence of different features within each of the planet types.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.9.1">Introduction</head><p>The detection of exomoons has proven elusive, and is becoming an increasingly prominent goal of exoplanet studies. LUVOIR can open the possibility of the detection of exomoons in the habitable zones of main sequence stars via spectroastrometry: the astrometric shift versus wavelength that occurs between wavelengths with flux dominated by the exoplanet vs. wavelengths dominated by the exomoon. The several requirements to reach this goal are: 1) a large telescope aperture; 2) astrometric calibration and stability; 3) ability to measure the centroid of the planet's light simultaneously over a broad range of wave- lengths; 4) ability to revisit the planet many times; and 4) extension to near-IR wavelengths. In addition to enabling the detection of exomoons, this technique may allow for the characterization of the planet via the orbit of the exomoon. The Moon has likely played a critical role in the evolution of planet Earth, from influencing the geological and chemical composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b471">(Smith 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b460">Canup 2012)</ref>, to modifying the mass and angular momentum of the Earth/ Moon system <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">(Canup &amp; Asphaug 2001)</ref>, to possibly stabilizing the obliquity of the Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b467">Laskar et al. 1993</ref>). Lunar tides may have played an outsized role in influencing the evolution of life on Earth (Balbus 2014). Speculation that habitable exomoons could orbit giant planets makes an intriguing alternate niche for life <ref type="bibr" target="#b473">(Williams et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b464">Kaltenegger 2010)</ref>. Caveats exist for each of these scenarios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b468">Lissauer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b463">Heller et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b466">Lammer et al. 2014</ref>), so a search for exomoons is necessary to ascertain the importance of moons on planetary physics and biology.</p><p>There are a range of proposed techniques for detection of exomoons, from transiting planet observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b459">(Cabrera &amp; Schneider 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b465">Kipping 2009)</ref>, to phase function measurements in direct imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b469">Moskovitz et al. (2009)</ref>; Robinson (2011). Each of these techniques drawbacks: transiting exomoons may be swamped by stellar variability, while phase variations may be mimicked by variations in planetary atmospheres.</p><p>We recently proposed a new approach for the detection of exomoons that could result in an instantaneous detection of an exomoon, The LUVOIR Interim Report and would allow for measurements of the exoplanet-moon system: spectroastrometry ( <ref type="bibr">Agol et al. 2015</ref>). This technique relies on the observation that a moon can outshine a planet at wavelengths where the planet is non-reflective, i.e., in strong molecular absorption bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b472">(Williams &amp; Knacke 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b469">Moskovitz et al. 2009</ref>). The Earth is outshined by the Moon at ≈2.7 mm, and the Earth would outshine a companion Jovian planet in several methane bands between 0.9-2.7 mm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 13.13)</ref>. The technique is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.14, which schematically shows how the centroid of the PSF may vary between wavelengths dominated by the planet versus wavelengths dominated by the moon. The detection technique proceeds by simultaneous measurement of the centroid as a function of wavelength. The wavelengths at which the planet is dim would have a stronger contribution from the moon, and thus cause a shift of the centroid towards the position of the moon. Thus, even if the moon and planet are not resolved, the moon may still be detected via the spectroastrometric signal.</p><p>The astrometric signal, which is proportional to the angular separation of the planet and moon, scales as r/d, where r is the separation of the moon and planet on the sky, and d is the distance to the system. The This relation assumes that the Poissonnoise limit applies, and thus also requires: 1) high-contrast to avoid additional contribution to the noise from scattered light; 2) precise control of the PSF, the astrometric pointing, and the relative astrometric precision between wavelengths. Ideally this approach will be made more efficient with simultaneous astrometric measurements at a range of wavelengths, which might be accomplished with an IFU or an MKID device. One advantage of this technique is that only the relative position needs to be measured as a function of wavelength, not the absolute position. Another advantage is that the signal will vary with time as the moon orbits the planet, which makes it reproducible and difficult to confound with other systematic errors or sources of noise. This makes this technique more powerful than other proposed techniques for detecting exomoons, which may require observations at specific times or geometries (such as transit of the moon in front of the star, or transit of the moon in front of the planet), or may not have repeatability such as microlensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b462">(Han &amp; Han 2002)</ref>. Spectroastrometry may also allow for the measurement of the mass of the planet+moon with Kepler's law, as well as a disentangling of the moon/planet spectrum ( <ref type="bibr">Agol et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.9.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>Spectroastrometry of habitable-zone (HZ) Earths will not be feasible from groundbased telescopes as these may only probe the HZ of late M dwarf stars, for which the planets are close enough that they cannot harbor stable exomoons. A space telescope is required to achieve high contrast (10 −11 -10 −10 ) to enable the detection of an exomoon, to avoid interference of the atmosphere with spectral features that show the sharpest variation in the spectroastrometric signal, to allow for repeated visits and long exposures, and to achieve stability of the PSF.</p><p>A large telescope will be necessary due to the strong scaling of the astrometric signal-to-noise with telescope aperture (∝ D 2 ), which will allow the search for this signal for a larger number of stars. The larger aperture allows for a sharper PSF and a larger number of photons, both of which improve the astrometric precision and allow for resolving out surface brightness due to (exo)zodi and speckles.</p><p>Relative astrometric precision between bands of ≈0.1 mas should be sufficient for the expected ≈1 mas shift for the two cases examined here. For the Earth-Moon at Alpha Centauri example, near-infrared coverage to &gt;1.5 mm will be required, while coverage to 2.7 mm would be preferred to obtain a strong Moon/Earth flux ratio. For the Earth-Jupiter case, coverage to 1 mm should allow for detection, while 2 mm will give a stronger Earth/ Jupiter flux ratio. A broad range of wavelengths will need to be imaged simultaneously, which an IFU or MKID detector may allow for. The inner working angle and field of view may accommodate searches closer or further from stars, while for the two examples we explored we just examined the HZ, which is well covered by current LUVOIR specifications. A detailed technical and science case for spectroastrometry will require more realistic simulations, which are in progress</p></div>

The pattern of illumination of the rings will impart a centroid offset relative to the centroid of Saturn. The Moon-Earth analog centroid offset is ≈0.4 mas at 1.4 mm, 0.9 mas at 1.9 mm, and 2 mas at 2.7 mm. Thus, near-infrared capability is required to apply this technique to an Earth-Moon analog system. Relative astrometric stability between wavebands at better than 80 mas would be required to make a detection exceeding 5−s. The planet-star contrast at these wavelengths is ≈10 −11 , and so is going to be affected significantly by speckles if a contrast of 10 −10 is achieved. Thus, pushing towards a contrast of 10 −11 may be necessary for detection of a Moon-like exomoon.</p><p>The Earth-Jupiter analog (with Jupiter moved into 1 AU) has a centroid offset of 1.3 mas at 0.86 mm. A 12-meter telescope with R=80 could detect this offset at S/N=13 with a 24-hour exposure, assuming the Poissonnoise limit. The planet/star contrast at this wavelength is ≈10 −9 , and so will not be as affected by speckles for a telescope design that approaches 10 −10 contrast.</p><p>Our investigation has the drawback that we neglected exozodiacal light and speckles, as well as other sources of instrumental noise, so further work to create realistic simulations is needed to estimate the impact of these on the spectroastrometric signal (Jansen et al. in prep.).</p></div>

From the structures and line emission of these nebulae, we will learn about the final stages in stellar lives, nucleosynthetic element dispersal in the surrounding gas, and dust formation in dense remnant winds. The high resolution of LUVOIR will allow us to distinguish between individual stars as well. According to the calculation of integration time versus point source absolute magnitude on page 49 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Dalcanton et al. (2015)</ref>, in 1 hour we can see a solar type star at a distance of 2.8 Mpc using the F555W filter at an apparent AB magnitude of 32. Within 2.8 Mpc there are 9 large galaxies, i.e., with absolute magnitude less than -16, and about 60 small galaxies. At the stellar surface density in the solar neighborhood, which is about 60 solar masses per pc 2 , there are 150 stars per pc 2 larger than 0.01 solar masses and 10 stars pc -2 larger than 1 solar mass (using the Kroupa 2001 initial stellar mass function). The mean projected separations between these stars are 6 mas and 24 mas at 2.8 Mpc. The second number is larger than the angular resolution of LUVOIR, so we will be able to separate solar mass stars in galaxy disks within 2.8 Mpc, i.e., for dozens of galaxies of various types and for the highly diverse conditions in these galaxies. By counting these stars and the more massive stars, which are separated by even larger distances, we can determine the field star mass function and approximate star formation history in all regions with fairly low extinction. Variations in this field star mass function for a given history would suggest comparable variations in the stellar initial mass function.

The implications are enormous for studies of black hole accretion, nuclear disk storms, small-scale flaring activity, nuclear spirals and torques.</p><p>Proper motions with sub-pixel accuracy Proper motions with HST could reach 0.02 pixel accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b474">(Anderson &amp; King 2000</ref>) with simultaneous fitting of the average stellar point spread function and the stellar positions. 0.02 pixel for LUVOIR equals 10 -9 radians or 0.21 mas. This means that with a 5-year baseline, the proper motion that can be measured, in km/s, equals 0.2 times the distance in kpc. With this we can observe a wide variety of interesting and important motions for the first time: the random motions of dust features in local star forming regions at the sonic speed, 0.1 km/s, the expansion of supernova remnants, planetary nebulae and "pillars of creation" at 1 km/s, the internal motions of Milky Way globular clusters to within 2 km/s, the rotation of the LMC and SMC to within 10 km/s, and the rotation of M31 within 140 km/s. For example, proper motions have already been measured in the LMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b479">Kallivayalil et al. 2013</ref>) although with less precision. This is a completely new capability to study the dynamics of nearby dust and emission line structures, and of stars and stellar systems, especially in regions where the Gaia satellite will not be able to distinguish individual stars.</p></div>

This is equivalent to ground-based resolution (1 arcsec) for all galaxies within 20 Mpc, which is essentially the Hubble Atlas of Galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">(Sandage 1984)</ref>. Deep images at high redshift will cover the same co-moving volume as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with the same or better resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Dalcanton et al. 2015</ref>). As a result, we will be able to see for the first time at high redshift the substructure of star formation clumps in young galaxies, we will resolve young bars and bulges, see multiple nuclei from recent mergers, map spiral arms, and discover dwarf galaxy companions. The radial profiles will be resolved too, allowing some understanding of the origin of the exponential radial structure in disks. Decades of research on local galaxies observed from the ground will suddenly have a counterpart in the epoch of galaxy formation.</p><p>Multi-object spectroscopy LUVOIR will observe spectral line emission from low-lying states of atoms, which are primarily in the UV and unobservable from the ground. Such observations were a primary driver of going into space in the first place as mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">Spitzer (1946)</ref> in his "Report</p></div>

Most atoms are in these ground states and both absorption and emission lines are in the UV or FUV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Dalcanton et al. (2015)</ref> have a diagram of the observable wavelengths for many important lines as a function of lookback time in the Universe. Most lowlevel ion transitions cannot be observed from the ground after a lookback time of some 10 Gyr, which means these lines are invisible for most of the Universe unless they are observed from space.</p><p>With FUV emission lines, we can see interstellar and active galactic nuclei emission from 10 6 K gas at redshifts greater than 0.3 and compare it to the observable x-ray gas at the same temperature. We can observe circumgalactic (CGM) emission in Lyman alpha, OVI, and CIV faster than on the ground by factors of 10 to 100 because of the lower levels of background light in space ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Dalcanton et al. 2015</ref>). An example of a Lyman alpha blob in space is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b476">Cai et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>LUVOIR will also observe absorption lines from ground states in the FUV. We expect 100 times as many background galaxies in a deep field at redshifts less than 1 to 2 for observations of foreground CGM absorption, and 100 times as many QSOs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">Dalcanton et al. 2015</ref>). This will allow us to map the CGM around galaxies, trace element formation, outflows and inflows and see galaxies building up and quenching by outflows for the first time.</p><p>Extensive observations of the CGM in both emission and absorption will revolutionize our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, just as most of the other new capabilities mentioned here will be revolutionary in their own fields. Not only will we see more and smaller galaxies at high redshift, but we will also start to fill in the space between the galaxies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.16 shows the impact of this change on another plot with a historical perspective. This is the sky-covering fraction of known astronomical objects as a function of year. For all time before the invention of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.16. The fraction of the sky covered with known astronomical objects is plotted versus the year in history. As telescopes reach fainter object and deeper fields, more and more objects become known. LUVOIR will add to this progression by mapping the circumgalactic gas. telescopes, humans could only see some 5000 stars at 1 arcmin resolution. The fraction of the sky covered by these light sources was very small, letting us think that most of the Universe was empty space. When the telescope was invented, the sky covering fraction got even smaller because, although many more stars could be seen, each was 60 times smaller at 1 arcsecond resolution, so more blank space could be seen as well. However, with larger telescopes to collect fainter light (in William Herschel's era), and with photographic images that allowed collection of this faint light over long periods of time (thousands of times longer than the eye could integrate), the sky started to be seen as covered with faint galaxies and nebulae, filling in the blank space and increasing the covering fraction by a factor of 100. HST increased it by another factor of 100 by finding faint galaxies at high redshift between all the nearby galaxies and stars, covering deep fields at nearly the 10% level. LUVOIR will make the next jump with its ability to see gas between the galaxies, and its possible first-time resolution of unknown objects that have appeared up to now to be only a smooth background. LUVOIR will literally fill the sky with discoveries! My thanks to Aki Roberge, Daniela Calzetti, and Bradley Peterson for their invitation to speak on this topic at the AAS Winter Meeting 2018.

Energetic particle deposition into the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet during a large M dwarf flare can lead to significant atmospheric O 3 depletions (&gt; 90% for large flares; <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Segura et al. 2010</ref>). This alters the atmospheric chemistry and increases the penetration depth of UV photons that could potentially sterilize (or catalyze) surface life. Given that particle fluxes are not (typically) directly measured for stars other than the Sun, UV observations offer the best estimates of these important particle environments. The high sensitivity and temporal resolution of the LUVOIR-LUMOS spectrograph will enable a thorough characterization of the UV host star spectrum for every potentially inhabited star observed by LUVOIR. At present, there are no other UV-capable facilities projected to be available to the astronomical community in the 2030s, making LUVOIR's contribution essential for this important host star characterization. Furthermore, the high sensitivity enabled by the large aperture and high efficiency of LUMOS (  mean that regular monitoring of these systems will be possible during exoplanet characterization campaigns with minimum impact to the primary exoplanet observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.11.3">The science program</head><p>This study requires the acquisition of a UV spectrum for each LUVOIR target with a habitable zone planet showing atmospheric spectral signatures. The UV spectrum is then essential to accurately model and interpret those features. This is particularly true for M and K dwarf host stars, where stellar atmosphere models still require a comprehensive panchromatic data set to optimize the temperature-pressure profile of the star's chromosphere, transition region, and corona (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fontenla et al. 2016</ref>). In practice, a comprehensive study of lowmass stars is required to understand the full parameter-space of age, mass, and metallicity of the system. This requires a sample of ~400 stars, including the LUVOIR Earth-like planet candidates, and a range of stellar ages that will likely require going beyond LUVOIR's direct imaging survey volume. As most of these objects are well distributed on the sky, this will be primarily an object-by-object survey of F-M stars. We will require spectral coverage across the major UV and optical diagnostics for chromospheric (~10 4 K), transition region ( Time-resolution of 1 second is required because the characteristic time scale for strong stellar/solar flares is ~1-5 minutes, and 1 second allows us to resolve flare lightcurves -important for inferring properties of CMEs and to understand the duration of energy deposition into the orbiting planet's atmosphere. This requires a photon-counting detector.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.12.1">Introduction</head><p>White dwarfs (WDs) are the remnants of all stars with initial masses less than 8 M  , and they provide important laboratories for the study of stellar evolutionary processes and the behavior of matter at extremes of temperature and density. As some of the oldest objects in the Galaxy they are useful cosmological clocks, placing strong limits on the ages of globular clusters and disk populations. They are implicated in the production of Type Ia supernovae, on which the cosmological distance scales and the existence of dark energy are predicated, even though the precise mechanism(s) remain unresolved.</p><p>In the strong gravitational fields associated with white dwarfs, it is predicted that their atmospheres should be pure H or He (depending on the prior evolution), devoid of heavier elements, which sink out of the surface layers. However, many studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b500">Barstow et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b501">Barstow et al. , 2003</ref> have demonstrated that white dwarf atmospheres containing metals are ubiquitous ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure  13.19)</ref>. While the presence of this material was initially attributed to the effect of radiative levitation, this mechanism was unable to explain the detailed abundances or the presence of metals in cool white dwarfs, where the radiative effects are negligible. It is now evident that many white dwarfs are accreting material from extrasolar planetary debris (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b507">Jura et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b508">Jura et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b506">Gänsicke et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b502">Barstow et al. 2014</ref>). Consequently, the study of white dwarf atmospheres provides a unique opportunity to determine the composition of these bodies.</p><p>It has been shown in theories of quantum gravity that fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant (α) and the electron/proton mass ratio (m) can vary in the presence of a strong gravitational field. Such variations are expected to manifest as small shifts in the wavelengths of atomic and molecular transitions. With UV spectra containing the absorption lines of many such transitions, white dwarfs have been used to study the potential effects of these variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b503">(Berengut et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bagdonaite et al. 2014</ref>) but the work is limited to a few of the very brightest white dwarfs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.12.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>White dwarfs have been studied in the UV for around 40 years, initially by IUE and then HST. While this work has yielded many important and exciting scientific results, it has generally been limited to a small and heavily biased sample. White dwarfs are Earth-sized, and hence intrinsically faint, and even with the improved throughput of COS, high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy can only be obtained for either very nearby (&lt;20 pc) or young (&lt;100 Myr) and therefore hot white dwarfs, severely limiting our understanding of the underlying physics, and the wider diagnostic power of these stellar remnants. LUVOIR will provide a unique opportunity to address these shortcomings. The larger aperture will enable observations of fainter objects, increasing the accessible sample, but also yield reduced data collection times, making the collection of suitable stellar samples more efficient. In addition, the dramatic improvement in the diffraction limited resolution enabled by the larger aperture, coupled with coronagraphic capability for the most extreme luminosity ratios, will open up the possibility of resolving binary systems with smaller separations and/ or at greater distances.</p></div>

In turn, the masses, radii, and photospheric compositions affect these rates. Studies of WDs in binary systems potentially represent a direct test of the evolutionary models and the massradius relation, since the WD mass can be independently determined from the orbital and physical elements of the system. In practice, however, few such systems have been available to be studied in sufficient detail to make these comparisons. An important science goal is to build up statistically significant samples of binary systems where orbits can be determined and follow-up spectroscopy carried out. Priorities in exoplanet research are rapidly moving from finding planets to characterizing their physical properties. Of key importance is their chemical composition, which feeds back into our understanding of planet formation. Mass and radius measurements of transiting planets yield bulk densities, from which interior structures and compositions can be deduced ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b511">Valencia et al. 2010</ref>). However, those results are model-dependent and subject to degeneracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b510">(Rogers &amp; Seager 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b505">Dorn et al. 2015</ref>). Transmission spectroscopy can provide insight into the atmospheric compositions ( <ref type="bibr">Sing et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b504">Deming et al. 2013</ref>), though cloud decks detected on a number of super earths systematically limit the use of this method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b509">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). For the foreseeable future, far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of white dwarfs accreting planetary debris remains the only way to directly and accurately measure the bulk abundances of exoplanetary bodies. Significant progress will be made through the acquisition of a large sample of high-resolution UV spectra to provide these measurements.</p><p>Observing potential variations in the fine structure constant in white dwarf spectra is very challenging, requiring extremely high S/N and deep understanding of systematic wavelength calibration effects. Statistically, there is also benefit in observing a significant sample of objects to compare results between them. Any observed effect should be reproduced in stars of similar gravity. Furthermore, extending the sample to the extreme range of white dwarf gravities allows exploration of the dependence of α &amp; m on gravity, or at least places important limits, which can constrain the possible range of theories.</p><p>A large UVOIR telescope in the 10 to 16-m aperture range will enable high S/N observations of several thousand white dwarfs, increasing potential sample sizes for the above programs by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. The length of typical exposures (approx. 0.1 hour) will likely be small compared to observational overheads. Therefore, attention will need to be paid to minimizing target acquisition and readout times and optimizing the pattern of slews between targets to achieve a high observing efficiency so that projects requiring large numbers of short exposure are not too costly.</p></div>

Nevertheless, their exact placement could be revisited. Longer wavelength regions include important absorptions due to silicates (~2000 nm) and clays (~2200-2300 nm). In addition, the ability to use a neutral density filter could be useful-several targets of interest have been unobservable by earlier space observatories because they are too bright. Objects of potential interest range can be as bright as V~7.5. The faint limit for discovered and cataloged objects is currently at V~21-22, but may be pushed fainter with new surveys.</p><p>• Spatial Resolution: A spatial resolution of 0.01" would allow ~10 km resolution in the middle of the asteroid belt and ~15 km resolution at its far edge.

Tracking rates of objects of interest will range from near-sidereal to &gt; 100 arcsec per hour. Two key capabilities of HST have been crucial in uncovering the variety of this phenomenon in old GCs: 1) from space, it is possible to achieve exquisite photometric accuracy that is very hard to reach from the ground, especially in crowded environments; 2) space-based observations provide access to important spectral features in the UV (CH, CN, and NH molecular bands) that are sensitive to the light-element abundance variations that trace the multiple populations.</p><p>The Magellanic Clouds provide the closest examples of young star clusters with masses approaching those of ancient GCs. HST imaging has revealed a surprising complexity of the CMDs in these clusters, too, with extended main sequence turnoffs, parallel young main sequences, and other puzzling features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b515">Milone et al. 2016)</ref>. It is unclear, however, to what extent these phenomena are related to the multiple populations observed in old GCs.</p><p>The stellar populations in ancient GCs tend to become increasingly complex with increasing mass, and the same may well be the case for their younger counterparts. However, small number statistics are a crucial limitation in young clusters, especially for post-main sequence stars, as even a 10 5 M  cluster only contains 20-30 post-MS stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b514">Larsen et al. 2011</ref>). Young clusters with masses well above 10 5 M  , also known as Super Star Clusters (SSCs), are rare and tend to be located beyond the Local Group. The LUVOIR Interim Report HST has played a crucial role in finding these objects, but the next step-characterising their stellar contents-will require a much larger space-based telescope. Nevertheless, it is already evident that the CMDs of some young SSCs are not well reproduced by standard models for stellar evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b514">Larsen et al. 2011)</ref>. A number of effects, including stellar rotation, binary evolution, age spreads, and chemical abundance anomalies may all play a role. Current work is already pushing HST to the limit of its capabilities, and it is clear that there is still a lot to learn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.14.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>Imaging with a 10-m class LUVOIR will make it possible to obtain exquisite photometry for individual stars in SSCs well beyond the Local Group. In evolved stars, the wavelength range 250-450 nm provides access to strong molecular features that are sensitive to light element abundances (CN, CH, NH). For hot stars, observations at longer wavelengths (e.g., ground-based AO-assisted imaging) lack the T eff sensitivity necessary to properly characterize (sub-)populations within the SSCs.</p><p>The difference between the current stateof-the art and LUVOIR is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure  13</ref>.23, which shows simulated images of an actual cluster in the galaxy NGC1313, at a distance of 4 Mpc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b514">Larsen et al. 2011</ref>). HST can only resolve the supergiants and the brightest main sequence stars in this 50 Myr old cluster and provide a crude CMD, while LUVOIR can provide accurate photometry reaching far down the main sequence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure  13</ref>.24). Blue/UV photometry with LUVOIR  would establish whether variations in lightelement abundances (C, N) are present in this and other young clusters, and would also put tight constraints on any age spreads. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.25, the same cluster as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure  13</ref>.23 has been simulated for an age of 1 Gyr. Even the brightest stars are now completely beyond reach of HST, while LUVOIR will be able to reach well below the main sequence turn-off in a few hours of exposure time per bandpass. The difference between a 6.5-m and 15-m aperture is also evident. If past experience is any guide, LUVOIR CMDs of such clusters will likely reveal surprising new features not yet imagined.</p></div>

This is largely because an arbitrarily long timescale of 1 Gyr, corresponding to the minimum thought for life to arise, is also as long as the entire main-sequence lifetime of an early F-star. However, life on Earth had already appeared by ~3.8 Gyr ago, if not sooner. Indeed, life may have evolved even earlier had our planet not been beset by ongoing impacts during the late heavy bombardment. Evidence from zircons also suggests habitable conditions on Earth by 4.3 Gyr ago, only ~300 Myr after formation of the planet. Thus, in order to explore the range of conditions under which life can arise, we should include A-stars in the search for habitable planets.</p><p>A-star systems for which exoplanets have already been directly imaged include: Fomalhaut (7.7 parcsecs), Beta Pictoris (19.4 pc), HR 8799 (39 pc), HD 95086 (90 pc), and HD 15082 (118 pc). Direct imaging is currently the best way to discover exoplanets around A-stars, as indirect methods like radial velocity and transits have proven ineffective. The known A-stars planets are massive (e.g., Jovian or larger) and located far beyond their host stars' respective HZs. Previous A-stars surveys have not found smaller terrestrial planets, since the required ultra-high contrast is not yet available. Should terrestrial planets exist within the HZs of these stars, however, we may be able to detect them using the ECLIPS coronograph to block out extraneous starlight. </p></div>

The inner working angle (IWA) of ECLIPS is 3.5 l/D = 48 milliarcsec at 1 micron. So HZ inner edge is exterior to the IWA for A4V stars out to 76 parsecs, at wavelengths shorter than 1 micron.

Almost all massive galaxies in the local universe harbor a central SMBH, as evidenced by stellar and gaseous kinematic measurements. In the more distant universe, we know the presence of numerous quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose energetic radiation is believed to originate from mass accretion onto a SMBH. As such, SMBHs are recognized as a major constituent of the baryonic universe. Furthermore, they may well control the fate of the host galaxies, as implied from the correlation between SMBH mass and galaxy bulge mass, and powerful gas outflows observed in quasar host galaxies, among other observational facts. On the other hand, the origin of SMBHs is not yet known. The discoveries of SMBHs exceeding a billion solar masses (M sun ) at z &gt; 6, where the universe is less than a billion years old, have provoked controversy on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.27.

Observations of "first quasars," representing the earliest stage of SMBH assembly from one or more types of the above seeds, are undoubtedly a key to disentangling the origin of SMBHs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.27).</p></div>

We will select z &gt; 10 sources with the dropout technique; any source at z &gt; 10 will be completely dark at l &lt; 1.3 mm due to IGM absorption, which gives rise to a strong spectral break identifiable with near-IR multi-band photometry. Candidate first quasars will be searched for with broadband colors and inferred luminosity. Unfortunately, the emergent spectrum from a first quasar has been poorly studied so far. It may have an extremely red optical/IR color, if surrounding hydrogen gas heavily obscures the SMBH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b520">Pacucci et al. 2015</ref>). On the other hand, if there are escape paths of photons from the vicinity of the SMBH, then they would make first quasars appear much bluer. Alternatively, most luminous dropout sources at the relevant cosmic epoch may simply be first quasars if a coeval (proto-) galaxy cannot produce a similar amount of radiation energy; this is indeed the case at the current observational frontier of z = 6-7, where virtually all sources with high luminosity (restframe UV absolute magnitude M 1450 &lt; -24 mag; <ref type="bibr" target="#b519">Matsuoka et al. 2016</ref>) are quasars.

Black hole X-ray binaries have a stellar mass black hole (a few to ~20 M  ) around which an accretion disk exists that is fed from a mass losing secondary star ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  13.29)</ref>. In many systems, high-speed jets of material are expelled in a situation very similar to that in AGN, and this earns these systems the name of microquasars. Microquasars provide an opportunity to study the poorly understood jet acceleration mechanism and the mysterious process that harnesses the energy and angular momentum of accretion disk material to drive the jets. In AGN the region in which these processes are taking place is hidden by dust and gas but in microquasars they are directly visible. However, the timescales involved demand special capabilities from astronomical instruments.</p><p>In microquasars there are multiple processes occurring simultaneously: shocks at the base of the jets, flares from the accretion disk, reprocessing of X-rays to lower energies, synchrotron and cyclotron processes involving optically thick and optically thin emitting materials.

To disentangle the observed signals from each of the processes it is necessary to examine both the temporal and spectral characteristics together using time resolved spectroscopy that includes the UV and has the largest coverage to longer wavelengths.</p></div>

The ultraviolet end of the spectrum is particularly interesting. Wavelengths below 400 nm have been largely unexplored.

(2014b)</ref> emphasize dimer detection at 1.06 μm at a resolution (l/Dl) of 100. Temperatures will be difficult to constrain in the absence of a detection of planetary thermal radiation. However, it may be possible to constrain temperature, and also habitability, by detecting a water vapor profile consistent with condensation (i.e., a condensation curve). Detection of clouds and weather (e.g., from variability) would also indicate condensation, but not necessarily at/near the surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 13</ref>.35 shows pressure at the τ=1 level for a clear sky Earth atmosphere, and this roughly indicates the pressure levels sensed by a spectrum. Comparison of high-(l/Dl=1,000) and moderate-(l/Dl=100) resolution spectra shows that, for water vapor, not much vertical resolution is gained by pushing beyond a spectral resolution of roughly 100. Notably, while the 0.94 mm water band probes the near-surface environment, pushing to the 1.4 mm and 1.9 mm water bands is necessary for probing Earth's middle and upper troposphere. Thus, these bands may be essential to constraining water vapor profiles for potentially habitable exoplanets.</p><p>Direct detection of surface liquid water may prove a challenging endeavor, but would be complimentary to any atmospheric spectral retrieval analysis (like that outlined above). The near-infrared is best suited to polarization or glint detection, owing to the lack of Rayleigh scattering here ( ), and detection could be accomplished with photometric observations at continuum wavelengths (i.e., between strong atmospheric absorption bands). Performing observations in the near-infrared would also minimize glint false positive signatures from polar ices ( ), whose reflectivity is diminished at these wavelengths. For an Earth-twin, clouds and hazes would likely obscure any polarization signature from surface oceans ( ). Thus, glint is the best option for the direct detection of surface liquid water, and, at least for Earth, is most pronounced near a star-planet-observer (phase) angle of 150°, where a glinting planet would be nearly twice as bright as a non-glinting planet. The ability to measure planetary phase functions to such close planet-star separations will depend on the inner-working angle (IWA) of the high-contrast field-of-view, and cannot be achieved for planetary systems with inclinations below about 60 degrees. For an Earth-Sun twin system at 10 parsecs, the required IWA would be 1.8 l/D (at the 1.33 mm continuum and for a 10-meter diameter aperture). As another example, taking an Earth-like planet near the inner edge of the habitable zone for a mid-K dwarf, the requirement shrinks to 0.9 l/D at 10 parsecs. Thus, an IWA of 2 l/D could allow glint detection out to almost 10 pc for habitable planets around G dwarfs, and almost 5 pc for K dwarfs. These distances decrease to 6 pc and 3 pc, respectively, for a 3 l/D IWA.</p><p>We briefly note that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be capable of probing the near-surface environment of habitable zone planets orbiting stellar types earlier than M ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b549">Misra et al. 2014a</ref>).</p><p>Depending on systematics, JWST may be able to characterize potentially habitable worlds around nearby M dwarf stars, but these worlds possess their own unique challenges to habitability (e.g., .

In summary, R=70 (or greater) spectra of Earth-like planets would be suitable for constraining water vapor abundance profiles. Future work is necessary to determine the minimum signal-to-noise ratios required for such an analysis. Broadband detection of glint in the phase function of a habitable zone exoplanet is possible in the near-infrared with a 2 l/D IWA and becomes restricted for a 3 l/D IWA.

Thus, inferring atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from near-infrared spectra of Earth-like planets would be essential to running predictive/forward climate models for these worlds (thereby helping to inform our understanding of the potential habitability of these planets). The strongest CO 2 features in Earth's near-infrared, reflected-light spectrum are a pair of double features at 1.59 mm and 2.03 mm. Both would require a spectral resolution of l/Dl=100 to place a single spectral resolution element across the bands, and double this resolution could enable better detections. The features at the shorter wavelength are shallower, requiring a SNR of order 40 to distinguish. The longer wavelength features are deeper, requiring an SNR only of order 10, but may be more difficult to detect due to the overall decrease in stellar brightness at these longer wavelengths.

The irradiation on these planets is so intense, with dayside temperatures reaching over 2500 K, that they are expected to have dayside surfaces that are partially or completely molten ( <ref type="bibr">Kite et al. 2017)</ref>. Although completely uninhabitable, these planets have the potential to teach us a great deal about geophysical processes under extreme conditions. Indeed, models predict that these planets should partially vaporize their rocky mantles and outgas significant but highly refractory atmospheres dominated by silicates and heavy metals, potentially allowing us to directly probe their bulk mantle compositions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b560">Miguel et al. 2011</ref>). Moreover, models also predict that alkali metals in this outgassed material may be escaping at significant rates, producing highly extended metallic exospheres possibly reaching all the way to the Roche lobe ( <ref type="bibr">Kite et al. 2017</ref>). However, these exospheres would be highly time-variable, driving the need to obtain higher S/N over a single transit. Indeed, recently there was a claimed detection of significant thermal variability in the dayside emission from the USP 55 Cancri e (Demory et al. 2016) along with the possible detection of highly extended exospheric Na and Ca+ absorption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b566">Ridden-Harper et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Given their short periods and extremely high temperatures, JWST is extremely well suited for characterizing the overall thermal emission from these planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b562">Samuel et al. 2014</ref>) and to detect emission from SiO at 4 and 10 microns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b563">Ito et al. 2015</ref>). However, due to its wavelength coverage JWST will be limited in its ability characterize the atmospheric compositions of USP planets with transmission or emission spectroscopy since many of the primary lines for the relevant metal species aside from SiO are found in the optical and near UV between 300 and 800 nm (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, TiO, VO), and therefore are inaccessible with JWST. At the same time, the intrinsic rarity of these USP planets means that even after the NASA's TESS mission concludes, most of the known USPs will be around relatively faint FGK stars (V-mag &gt;11), making them difficult to characterize with HST due to its smaller aperture.</p></div>

In particular, features like sodium D at 590 nm, calcium H &amp; K at 390 nm, potassium at 770nm, and the TiO from 600 to 800 nm, should all be detectable in either transmission or emission spectroscopy along with a wide range of iron and magnesium lines between 300 and 600 nm. For example, modeling the emission spectra of several known USPs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b563">Ito et al.

Additionally, if these planets do intend possess extended exospheres then these should be detectable in transmission at S/N in single transit, which is important given the expected variability in both the planetary atmospheric escape rates and the stellar spectrum. The possible detection of exospheric Na &amp; Ca+ on 55 Cancri e by <ref type="bibr" target="#b566">Ridden-Harper et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.24.1">Introduction</head><p>Here, we propose a statistical search for habitability and life. Such a search would provide tests for our understanding of the toplevel factors controlling planetary habitability and raise the overall confidence that we are not alone. This search would be conducted by searching for signs of habitability and of life on multiple planets, both in and beyond the habitable zone. The statistical search for habitability would turn the concept of the habitable zone into a testable hypothesis. According to the habitable zone hypothesis, there is a region around the star for which feedback processes in the climate system work to stabilize surface temperatures to allow for sustained, global reservoirs of liquid surface water. Beyond this zone, the climate would stabilize in waterpoor regimes, with vastly different surface temperatures. Because of all the feedbacks in the climate system, multiple aspects of a planet's spectral signatures should also change beyond the habitable zone: CO 2 concentrations (and their features) should increase on either side of the habitable zone (due to lack of a CO 2 weathering feedback); water-soluble gases and aerosols should increase in concentration; and water vapor and water cloud features themselves should disappear. For a more thorough discussion of this concept, and how it can begin with near-term observations, see Bean, <ref type="bibr" target="#b568">Abbot, &amp; Kempton (2017)</ref>.</p><p>A statistical search for life should raise the overall confidence in our detection of life beyond Earth compared to what is achievable by the search for life on a single exoplanet ( <ref type="bibr">Walker et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, consider an exoplanet for which LUVOIR detects the presence of water (H 2 O), molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ), but not methane <ref type="bibr">(CH 4</ref> ). This is a plausible scenario, given the long integration times required to detect CH 4 in LUVOIR's wavelength range. The combination of these measurements, as well as constraints on UV fluxes from observations of the host star, would produce a scenario for which the most likely explanation is life on that planet. However, the lack of CH 4 on that planet may be enough to prevent a conclusion as bold as "We are not alone." As an alternative, consider a scenario where LUVOIR detects this same set of features multiple times on worlds in different planetary systems. This would suggest that either our understanding of photochemical processes is woefully incomplete and under-predicting some O 2 -producing mechanism, or that life is present on at least some subset of these worlds.</p><p>This example would also apply to other biosignatures. An organic haze in the presence of a CO 2 -rich atmosphere has been recently proposed as a biosignature . While consideration to false positives has been given, a hazebiosignature has not undergone the same amount of thorough scrutiny as O 2 /O 3 . Thus, one might place a lower amount of confidence in this biosignature than the detection of O 2 /O 3 . To quantify this example, if we are to assume that ~50% of CO 2 -rich, haze-bearing habitable zone worlds have life, the detection of multiple such planets would increase the likelihood that at least one of these planets has a biosphere (whereas a search focused on a single target would not be able to draw such a strong conclusion). This search does not necessarily need to focus on the same signature being present on multiple worlds. It would also apply to any combination of potential biosignature across multiple planets, and thereby allow the mission to conduct both a broad survey for easy-todetect biosignatures on multiple planets and a detailed assessment of the biosignatures on LUVOIR's best targets. The approach could therefore by optimized so that detailed assessments (such as the measurement of longitudinal-dependent colors/spectra) are only conducted on relatively close targets, for which such assessments are capable of being conducted with reasonable investments of telescope time.</p><p>A statistical search will also be useful in the case of no (or very poor) signs of life being detected by LUVOIR. Instead of just a full null result, the process of quantifying the likelihood of life on each planet, with a statistical combination of those likelihoods, will yield an overall confidence level that sets an upper-bound on the frequency of life. Such a conclusion is not really possible unless we conduct a statistical survey of multiple worlds rather than a deep dive on a single planet. Further, the more planets we assess, the stronger our conclusions will be. Detecting no biosignatures on 55 habitablezone planets would give a 2-s upper limit on the frequency of life of 6%. Thus, our uncertainty on "eta life " would decrease by an order of magnitude, from a range of 0-1.0 to a range of 0-0.06.</p><p>Again, it is useful to consider an example: if LUVOIR finds multiple Earth-sized worlds in the habitable zone of other stars and determines that many of them have "antibiosignatures" (such as high atmospheric concentrations of H 2 and either CO or CO 2 ), the confidence level that life is rare might be high.</p><p>There are two requirements to such an approach to the search for life:</p><p>1) The science community must be able to ascribe a quantitative estimate a given data set resulted from a biosphere on any particular planet; and 2) We must be able to collect spectroscopic data on many worlds.</p><p>The former requirement demands development in the research tools utilized by the astrobiology and exoplanet communities. Options for quantifying our assessment that a given planet has a biosphere are discussed and reviewed by <ref type="bibr">Walker et al. (2018, in press)</ref>, and leverage similar efforts to quantify signs of life in our own Solar System. The latter requirement inevitably leads to a LUVOIRsized telescope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.24.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>A statistical approach to habitability and the habitable zone does not require LUVOIR, as it could begin with ground-and space-based surveys for H 2 O and CO 2 features via transit spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b568">Bean et al., 2017)</ref>. LUVOIR would extend this statistical approach to new targets, with new observational techniques. Specifically, LUVOIR would expand the search to planets around Sun-like (F, G, K) stars. It would also provide new information on clouds and aerosols on planets around Sun-like and M-type stars, via a wavelength range that is complementary to currentlyplanned transit spectroscopy observatories.</p><p>While other missions might attempt to search for signs of life, and perhaps detect them on one world, a statistical approach requires that this search be conducted on a large number of worlds. This, in turn, demands a large-aperture telescope, to drive up the yield of planets that the mission can discover and characterize. LUVOIR will be able to detect over 50 such planets. This is a large enough sample size to conduct a statistical</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor A-78</p><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report search for signs of life on exoplanets. If detectable biospheres exist on at least 10% of potentially habitable worlds, LUVOIR will find at least one such biosphere. But if life is relatively common, LUVOIR has the potential to find signs of life on many worlds. If it is rare, we will be able to set upper bounds on the frequency of life.   Then, the search would turn towards easyto-detect, but low-confidence biosignatures, such as O 3 and atmospheric organic haze, both of which can be detected in the UV channel of ECLIPS. This initial biosignature search would include some planets nearbut not in-the habitable zone. This would provide a basis for comparison of presumed "dead" planets, which could lead to more robust conclusions about the detection of life and help inform the science community if something about our understanding of photochemical and geological processes is dramatically incomplete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.24.3">The science program</head><p>For planets with O 3 or an organic haze, LUVOIR would proceed to the detection of O 2 (for O 3 -bearing worlds) and CO 2 (for hazebearing worlds). However, it would only do so if the detection of this second feature was permissible in a reasonable integration time.</p><p>(The definition of "reasonable" would be up to a future time allocation committee, but history suggests  100 hours.) If O 2 or CO 2 is detected, LUVOIR would then proceed to further spectral measurements to rule out false positives, search for secondary biosignature gases (such as CH 4 ) or attempt to characterize the surface. Again, this would be limited on a target-by-target bases based on required integration time. A full decision tree for such a search is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure  13</ref>.39.</p><p>The totality of these observations, at varying degrees of detail depending on the target, would maximize LUVOIR's ability to test our ideas of planetary habitability and search for life across the set of exoplanets it characterizes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.1">Methodology</head><p>To estimate the yield of directly imaged planets, we assume that LUVOIR must conduct a blind survey to search for and characterize potentially Earth-like exoplanets. While the efficiency of the LUVOIR exoplanet survey and the quality of its data products would benefit from a precursor survey identifying potentially Earth-like planets, we conservatively assume such a survey does not exist at the time of launch. Thus, the yield of such a blind survey is a probabilistic quantity, which depends on LUVOIR's coronagraphic capabilities, the occurrence rate of planets of various types, their detectability, and the unknown distribution of planets around individual nearby stars. To calculate expected exoplanet yields, we used the Altruistic Yield Optimization (AYO) yield code of , which employs the completeness techniques introduced by <ref type="bibr">Brown (2005)</ref>. Briefly, for each star in our master target list, we randomly distribute a large number of synthetic planets of a given type, forming a "cloud" of synthetic planets around each star, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure  14</ref>.1. Planet types are defined by a range of radii, albedo, and orbital elements. We calculate the flux from each synthetic planet in reflected light given its properties, orbit, and phase, and then determine the exposure time required to detect it at SNR=7. Based on these detection times and the exposure time of a given observation, we can calculate the fraction of the synthetic planets that are detectable, i.e., the completeness, as a function of exposure time. The completeness simply expresses the probability of detecting that planet type, if such a planet exists. The average yield of an observation is the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 14.</ref>1. The completeness of an observation is the fraction of detectable planets to total planets and is a function of the exposure time. The yield of an observation is the product of completeness and the probability that such a planet actually exists (the occurrence rate).</p></div>

We repeat this process for every observation until the total program lifetime is exceeded, arriving at an average total mission yield. In reality, yields may vary from this average due to the random distribution of planets around individual stars; we incorporate this source of uncertainty in our yield calculations by accounting for the Poisson probability distribution of planets for each star.</p><p>We employ the techniques of  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b586">Stark et al. (2016)</ref>, which optimize the observation plan to maximize the yield of potentially Earth-like planets. For a coronagraph-based search, this involves optimizing the targets selected for observation, the exposure time of each observation, the delay time between each observation of a given star, the number of observations of each star, and the planet phase for spectral characterization ). We do not explicitly schedule the observations. We expect the ability to schedule the observations will have a negligible impact on the exoplanet yield given LUVOIR's extremely large field of regard and rapid retargeting capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2">Inputs and assumptions</head><p>Yield estimates require simulating the execution of a mission at a high level. They are therefore dependent on a large number of assumptions about the target stars, the planetary systems they host, and the capabilities of the mission. Given the inherent uncertainties in many of these assumptions, consistency between yield analyses is of primary importance. We adopt inputs and assumptions that are consistent with the choices made by the Exoplanets Standard Definitions and Analysis Team and those made by the HabEx STDT. We now review and justify our fiducial assumptions about the parameters that affect the yield.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2.1.1">Planet types &amp; occurrence rates</head><p>We followed the planet categorization scheme of , which consists of a 3 by 5 grid of planets binned by temperature (hot, warm, and cold) and planet radius ("rocky," "super-Earths," "subNeptunes," "Neptunes," and "Jupiters"), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 14</ref>.2. Each planet was assigned a single albedo defined by its radius (listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 14.</ref>2), a Lambertian phase function, and all planets were assumed to be on circular orbits. We assume that the semi-major axis boundaries that define the temperature bins of each planet type scale with the bolometric stellar insolation, such that they scale with the square root of the bolometric stellar luminosity.</p><p>For exoEarth candidates we adopted the green outlined region in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 14</ref>.2. By this definition, exoEarth candidates are on circular orbits and reside within the conservative HZ, spanning 0.95-1.67 AU for a solar-twin star ( ). We only include planets with radii smaller than 1.4 Earth radii and radii larger than or equal to 0.8a -0.5 , where a is semi-major axis for a solar-twin star. The lower limit on our definition of the radius of exoEarth candidate is derived from an empirical atmospheric loss relationship derived from solar system bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b588">(Zahnle &amp; Catling 2017)</ref>. The upper limit on planet radius is a conservative interpretation of an empirically measured transition between rocky and gaseous planets at smaller semimajor axes (Rogers 2015). All exoEarth candidates were assigned Earth's geometric albedo of 0.2, assumed to be valid at all wavelengths of interest. We adopted the exoplanet occurrence rate values from the NASA ExoPAG SAG13 meta-analysis ( , given by where N(R,P) is the number of planets per star in a bin centered on radius R and period P, R is in Earth radii and P is in years, and  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 14.</ref>2 lists the occurrence rates when integrating over the boundaries of each planet type. Within each planet type, we adopted the SAG13 radius and period distribution above. With this distribution, within a given planet temperature bin, small planets outnumber large planets.</p><p>The SAG13 meta-analysis is a crowdsourced average of published and unpublished occurrence rates, averaged over FGK spectral types. Uncertainties on the SAG13 occurrence rates are not well understood and are simply set to the standard deviation of the crowd-sourced values. Because of the large uncertainties in the SAG13 occurrence rates, we have weak constraints on how occurrence rates change with spectral type. Thus, we simply assume that the occurrence rates for each planet type bin are independent of spectral type. The LUVOIR Interim Report</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2.1.2">Exozodiacal &amp; zodiacal dust</head><p>Exozodiacal dust adds background noise, thereby reducing the SNR of a planet detection relative to the case of no exozodiacal dust. Unfortunately, we currently have only weak constraints on the amount of zodiacal dust around our target stars. Upcoming Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) measurements will better inform this current working assumption in the near term, but at the time of this report are unavailable. We therefore simply adopted a baseline exozodi level of 3 zodis. Our definition of 1 zodi is a uniform (optically-thin) optical depth producing a V band surface brightness of 22 mag arcsec -2 at a projected separation of 1 AU around a solar twin. Thus, the exozodi surface brightness drops off as the inverse square of the projected separation ( ). Because the HZ boundaries scale by the bolometric stellar insolation, the V band surface brightness of 1 zodi of exozodi varies with spectral type ).</p><p>The solar system's zodiacal brightness varies with ecliptic latitude and longitude; the closer one observes toward the Sun, the brighter the zodiacal cloud will appear. We calculated the zodiacal brightness for each target star by making simple assumptions about typical telescope pointing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b575">Leinert et al. 1998</ref>). We assume the coronagraph can observe near where the local zodi is minimized and adopted a solar longitude of 135 degrees for all targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2.1.3">Target catalog</head><p>Our input star catalog was formed using the methods of <ref type="bibr">Stark et al. (in prep)</ref>. Briefly, the target list is equivalent to the union of the original Hipparcos catalog and the GAIA TGAS catalog. For each star, we adopted the most recent measured parallax value from the original Hipparcos, updated Hipparcos, and GAIA TGAS catalogs, then down-selected to stars within 50 pc. BVI photometry and spectral types were obtained from the Hipparcos catalog. Additional bands and missing spectral types were supplemented using SIMBAD. We filtered out all stars identified as luminosity class I-III, leaving only main sequence stars, sub-giants, and unclassified luminosity classes. We note that while the accuracy of any individual star's parameters may be important when planning actual observations, yield estimates can be very robust to these inaccuracies, as their effects average out when considering a large target sample. Given LUVOIR's extremely large sample size of hundreds of stars, inaccuracies in the target catalog should have a negligible impact on yield.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2.2">Binary stars</head><p>Detecting exoplanets in binary star systems presents additional challenges. Light from companion stars outside of the coronagraph's field of view, but within the field of view of the telescope, will reflect off the primary and secondary mirrors. Due to high-frequency surface figure errors and contamination, some of this light is scattered into the coronagraph's field of view. For some binary systems, this stray light can become brighter than an exoEarth.</p><p>We directly calculate the stray light from binary stars in the final image plane. We adopt the numerical stray light models of <ref type="bibr">Sirbu et al. (2018, in prep</ref>). These models predict the power in the wings of the PSF at large separations assuming a l/20 RMS surface roughness and an f -3 envelope, where f is the spatial frequency of optical aberrations. We assume that the stray light can be measured or modeled and include it simply as an additional source of background noise. We make no artificial cuts to the target list based on binarity and allow the benefitto-cost optimization in the AYO yield code to determine whether or not stray light noise makes a target unobservable. In practice, the AYO prioritization does reject a number of binary systems with contrast ratios close to unity and/or close separations. We note that including the full amount of light scattered by the companion is actually conservative, as the companion scattered starlight could be actively reduced with specialized observation methods. For example, LUVOIR could use multi-star or super-Nyquist wavefront control coronagraphic techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b587">Thomas et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b582">Sirbu et al. 2017</ref>).</p></div>

The SNR was evaluated according to <ref type="bibr">Eq. 7 in Stark et al.

We also included a background term for detector noise, discussed in Section 14.1.2.4.2. For spectral characterizations, we required a spectrum with R=70 and SNR=5 per spectral channel which we evaluated at a wavelength of 1 micron, to search for water vapor in all detected exoEarth candidates.</p></div>

We adopted two coronagraphs designed for the LUVOIR Architecture A segmented, on-axis primary: an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) and a charge 6 vortex coronagraph (VC). The APLC coronagraph consisted of 3 masks: a small-IWA mask (10% bandwidth, 3.8-12 l/D working angle), a medium-IWA mask (15% bandwidth, 6-20 l/D working angle), and a large-IWA mask (11-33 lD working angle). To each star we independently assigned either one of the APLC masks or the VC coronagraph, based on the wavelength of observation and a cost-to-benefit ratio. We simulated the leaked starlight as a function of stellar diameter and the off-axis PSFs as a function of angular separation, providing inputs to the yield calculations according to the standards of <ref type="bibr">Stark &amp; Krist (2017)</ref>. The wave propagation model does not include some known systematic noise sources, such as residual spatial speckle noise caused by dynamic wavefront errors. Realistic estimates would require full end-toend simulations of a well-defined telescope, instrument, and observing procedure. These effects will impact the coronagraph noise floor, the properties and frequency of false positives, and the final yield.</p><p>The APLC coronagraph design consists of a binary apodizer mask in the entrance pupil, followed by an image plane coronagraph mask, followed by a Lyot stop (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2016</ref>). The apodizer is optimized to maximize coronagraph throughput while achieving 10 -10 raw contrast over a desired range of working angles (e.g., ). In the end, we designed three separate masks with overlapping working angles, allowing us to maximize the throughput for any size habitable zone. The resulting APLC designs are robust to stellar diameter and jitter (tolerance ~1 mas stellar diameter and ~0.5 mas jitter respectively for the LUVOIR Architecture A primary at 600 nm).</p><p>The apodized vortex coronagraph design ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b578">Mawet et al. 2013</ref>) consists of a grayscale apodizer mask in the entrance pupil, followed by a vortex phase mask in the focal plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b577">(Mawet et al. 2009)</ref>, and an annular Lyot stop. We chose a charge 6 vortex mask to balance sensitivity to low order aberrations and throughput at small angular separations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b580">Ruane et al. 2017</ref>). We used the Auxiliary Field Optimization algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b571">Jewell et al. 2017</ref>) to optimize the grayscale apodizer and reduce the diffracted starlight due to the central obscuration, the secondary mirror support structures, and gap between mirror segments in an annular region about the star. <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">Table 14</ref>.2 summarizes the coronagraph performance that we adopted. We note that although these metrics may provide a useful high-level understanding of coronagraph performance, some metrics should be interpreted with caution. For example, the inner working angle (IWA) estimates where the planet's throughput reaches 50% of the maximum value, but this does not mean that there is no planet signal interior to the IWA. On the contrary, the vortex coronagraph provides useful (albeit lower) throughput down to ~2 l/D, such that bright, shortperiod planets may be detectable interior to the quoted 3.7 l/D IWA.</p><p>The bandpass of the APLC designs is limited by the design of the apodized masks and was chosen based on a throughputbandwidth tradeoff analysis. To work with a segmented on-axis telescope, the vortex coronagraph design also uses an apodized mask, which was designed assuming 20% bandwidth. All of these bandwidths are less than or equal to the expected simultaneous bandwidth of the wavefront control system. High Contrast Imaging Testbed results indicate that surpassing a bandwidth of Dl/ l=0.2 is challenging with a conventional dual DM coronagraph layout, thereby justifying our adopted maximum bandwidth of 20%.</p><p>The total throughput of the system in <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">Table 14</ref>.2 is evaluated at visible wavelengths and includes the reflectivity of all optical surfaces, the detector quantum efficiency (QE), detector readout ineffeciencies in photon-counting mode, IFS throughput, and a 5% contamination budget. Detector parameters are discussed below. This throughput metric does not include the core throughput of the coronagraph, which was taken into account separately via the off-axis PSF simulations discussed above. <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">Table 14</ref>.3 lists the detector noise parameters that we adopted for yield calculations. We calculated the total detector noise count rate in the photometric aperture as where f is the photon counting rate and n pix is the number of pixels contributing to the signal and noise. We tuned f to each individual target, such that our photoncounting detector time-resolves photons from sources 10 times a bright as an Earthtwin at quadrature. We assumed the IFS splits the core of the PSF into 4 lenslets at the shortest wavelength, each of which are dispersed into 6 pixels per spectral channel for a total of 24 pixels per spectral channel at the shortest wavelength. For broadband coronagraphic detections using the imager, we adopted 4 pixels for the core of the planet. We note that the assumed detector noise is sufficiently low that small changes to the number of pixels have a negligible impact on yield.</p></div>

We will have only photometry, possibly one color, and a stellocentric separation to determine the nature of the object. Color, brightness, and the fact the source is unresolved may allow us to discriminate between many background galaxies and exoplanets. However, recent work has shown that other planets can mimic the color of exoEarth candidates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b574">Krissansen-Totton et al. 2016</ref>). Further, planets that most easily mimic Earth are small, hot terrestrial planets, which have even higher occurrence rates than exoEarth candidates <ref type="bibr">(van Gorkom &amp; Stark, in prep)</ref>; planet-planet confusion may be common. However, performing costly characterizations on all planets mimicking an Earth could decrease the efficiency of the exoplanet survey and reduce the yield of exoEarth candidates; we may need to disambiguate point sources to identify high priority planets.

For example, taking spectra of every object consistent with an exoEarth candidate immediately upon discovery would be costly, as spectral characterization times can be long and we are likely to find many other planets at coincidental phases that mimic exoEarths. A more efficient order of operations would play to the strengths of the coronagraph, e.g., by first following up initial detections with orbit measurements, followed by spectra of interesting systems when planets are known to be at advantageous phases.</p><p>Ultimately these decisions will depend on uncertain quantities, like h Earth for nearby FGK stars and the rate of confusion with background objects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.3.4">Simulating operations concepts</head><p>To simulate a given operations concept, we would need to generate a fictitious universe and simulate the execution of the mission one observation at a time, adapting to the detections, non-detections, and false positives as we go using decision-making logic. While current yield codes are capable of doing most of this ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b581">Savransky &amp; Garrett 2016)</ref>, the critical decision-making logic step is extremely complex and in its infancy.</p><p>Realistic decision-making processes require simulating the precision of multiple types of measurements, estimating the likelihood that a planet is an exoEarth versus a background object or another planet, and determining the optimum criteria for decision-making. In light of these complexities, we relied on the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b586">Stark et al. (2016)</ref>, wherein the impact of different operations concepts on yield was estimated by adopting general rules that define the observation plan. For example, to include orbit determination, <ref type="bibr" target="#b586">Stark et al. (2016)</ref> required each planetary system be observed at least six times to a depth consistent with detecting an exoEarth. Using these methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b586">Stark et al. (2016)</ref> found that for coronagraph-based missions like LUVOIR, orbit determination is not particularly costly while spectral characterization can be very costly.</p><p>Therefore, we adopt the following operations scenario:</p><p>1. Detect planets using two bands within the UV and VIS coronagraph channels simultaneously (~450-500 and 500-550 nm), likely providing color information for the majority of detections.</p><p>2. Revisit all systems as necessary with the coronagraph until the orbits of highpriority planets are sufficiently constrained (likely more than 6 times each over the course of months to years)</p><p>3. Based on the color, orbit, brightness, and phase variations, identify high-priority targets for spectral characterization.</p><p>4. Schedule and conduct spectral characterization observations on each exoEarth candidate at an optimized orbital phase to search for the presence of water vapor in the planet's atmosphere.</p><p>This operations scenario is both realistic and robust to error. By requiring orbit measurement regardless of what is detected, the operations concept is straightforward, does not rely on any confusion mitigation immediately after a detection, and proper motion will be established for free for all detected planets. Because the LUVOIR coronagraph's field of regard is greater than a hemisphere at any given time, we expect that the revisit schedule for each star can easily be optimized to maximize detections, constrain orbits, and minimize characterization time without detailed consideration of whether or not the targets are inaccessible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.4">Exoplanet yield-informed trades</head><p>Exoplanet yield was considered continuously during the LUVOIR Architecture A design study. Four major design trades were made based at least in part on yield studies:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.4.1">Optimizing the primary geometry</head><p>Concurrent with the LUVOIR Architecture A study, the Segmented Coronagraph Design Analysis (SCDA) study concluded that two major factors greatly impacted the yield of coronagraphs for segmented apertures: the obscuration ratio of the secondary mirror and the inscribed diameter of the primary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor B-10</p><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report</p><p>The LUVOIR design team and the SCDA team at STScI (PI: R. Soummer) studied 10 possible apertures for LUVOIR, ranging from engineering-optimized designs to coronagraph-optimized designs. The studied apertures produced a range of yields that varied by a factor of two. The final aperture was selected based on its high yield and scalability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.4.2">IFS vs fiber-fed spectrograph</head><p>Two proposed options were considered to obtain spectra of exoplanets: an integral field spectrograph (IFS) and a fiber-fed spectrograph. Both of these instruments have design strengths and weaknesses. The former has heritage from the WFIRST CGI, but packaging considerations and detector size place limitations on the field of view and maximum resolution. The latter is compact and provides potentially higher resolution, but only provides spectra of one source at a time and requires a potentially complex operations concept. In the end, a yield study revealed that the throughput reduction required for the fiber-red spectrograph significantly reduced exoplanet yield to an unacceptable level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.4.3">NUV coronagraph channel</head><p>In addition to introducing additional engineering challenges, the presence of a NUV coronagraph channel reduces the throughput of all coronagraph channels by ~30%, as it requires all optical surfaces after the telescope and prior to the dichroics to be aluminum. In addition, the end-to-end throughput of the NUV channel coronagraph is roughly half that of the visible channel. We considered replacing the NUV coronagraph channel with a second visible channel and co-adding the coronagraph channels to double the detection bandwidth. We found that this trade increased yield by ~15%. The STDT determined that NUV coronagraphic capability was a higher priority than a 15% increase in exoplanet yield.</p></div>

By switching to a Cassegrain design, potentially two aluminum surfaces could be removed, increasing the throughput of all instruments by ~18%. We determined that an 18% increase in throughput would increase yield by ~6%. The STDT and design team determined that a 6% increase in yield did not warrant the increased complexity of the Cassegrain design given the timeline of the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1">LUVOIR telescope temperature considerations</head><p>Lee Feinberg (NASA GSFC)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1.1">Introduction</head><p>At first glance, an obvious goal for an observatory such as LUVOIR that operates in the near infrared is that it should be as cold as possible to reduce the thermal background emission. However, there are number of technical and programmatic considerations that compete with this goal. This whitepaper discusses the issues associated with operating LUVOIR at temperatures below a nominal room temperature of 293 K. The difficulties of designing and validating a large space telescope that operates at temperatures below room temperature have been explored in great detail through the development of JWST, and primarily relate to three engineering challenges:</p><p>1. The need to fabricate and assemble a highly stable system that is guaranteed to function properly at cold temperatures.</p><p>2. The need to demonstrate the full end-toend optical and mechanical performance of the telescope before launch.</p><p>3. The need to eliminate contamination prior to and during operations in order to achieve peak performance.</p><p>All of these challenges have engineering solutions, but the question is whether the gain in science capability justifies the cost and difficulty associated with those solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1.2">Temperature vs. thermal background radiation</head><p>The first question is what temperature a telescope needs to operate at to enable the desired long-wavelength science. To assess this, one must consider the temperature of everything in the optical chain (primary mirror, secondary mirror and struts, instrument optics and components, etc.). For simplicity, consider the radiance vs. wavelength of the telescope, including coatings, for varying temperatures as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.1. This analysis assumes Aluminum-coated mirrors, which has worse emissivity in the NIR, but is the necessary coating to enable observations with LUVOIR in the UV.  The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.1 shows that the telescope temperature must be 200 K to achieve faint-source observations that are Zodi background-limited at 2.5 mm. The figure also shows that reducing the telescope temperature only 50 K from room temperature increases the background limit by only ~0.3 mm. However, achieving a Zodilimited background flux is not necessary for bright-target applications such as stellar, planetary, or exoplanetary applications, and reductions in the thermal background at long wavelengths will still lead to improvements in sensitivity. We therefore address the impacts of decreasing the telescope temperature on the overall telescope engineering design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1.3">Impacts</head><p>There are a number of issues associated with operating a telescope at cold temperatures and the impacts vary depending on temperature and system architecture. A summary of these issues and the level of complexity they add at different temperature regimes is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.2. The temperatures chosen were natural break points, which derive from both from basic physics and extensive experience. For example, we know that quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) monitors during JWST testing start to show large depositions at 260 K (a point where molecular deposition starts to happen), 200 K is above where water begins to condense on optical surfaces (roughly 140 K to 170 K), 140 K is where some materials have become CTE-stable (coefficient of thermal expansion), and 50 K is the JWST heritage where virtually all contaminants are frozen and Beryllium and JWST M55J laminates are stable.</p><p>The remainder of the white paper summarizes of each of the considerations from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.2. The topics are grouped by whether they are a significant factor in the trade space or not.  The LUVOIR Interim Report</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1.3.1">Significant factors</head><p>Molecular Sticking vs. UV Sensitivity-UV systems are extremely sensitive to even monolayers of absorbing molecules. As contaminants build up, the shortest wavelengths will first see reductions in throughput for layers as thin as a few angstroms. First order effects are due to absorption, specific to the type of molecular contamination. Quarterwave effects will also come into play for thicker layers of contamination.</p><p>To deal with molecular absorption, we must carefully select, bake, and certify all materials to minimize molecular adherence. There is a long heritage of doing this at room temperature where the sticking coefficients in vacuum are low. But even with extreme care, epoxies, plasticizers used in cables, hydrocarbons from lubricants, and many other small residuals will exist and will stick to mirrors at colder temperatures. Water also desorbs and begins to stick to surfaces in the 140-170 K range. For cryogenic optics or components, it is very possible that frequent bakeouts would be needed where baked off products are carefully managed (venting of cold fingers). There is not a lot of heritage of doing this for UV systems because of the complexity.</p><p>Given these challenges, is any reduction in the system operating temperature acceptable? During JWST instrument testing, it was routinely found that at 243 K the QCM sensor would show significant depositions, while at 258 K it did not. This suggests that 258 K is an approximate breakpoint where molecules begin depositing (how many are UV absorbing will depend on the species). An advantage of operating at a temperature of 260 K is that mirror bakeouts of contaminants would not be as time consuming or technically challenging (the power required to bake out mirrors would be a small addition compared to what would already be needed to maintain nominal operations, and the time to achieve a mirror bakeout would be reduced).</p><p>One possible strategy with cold systems is to operate above where water condenses in vacuum (170K) and is frozen in structures by operating at 200K. However, other molecular species will have already deposited. One could also use a warm window to isolate an instrument, but at shorter near-UV wavelengths the availability of wide-band, highly transmissive windows is limited Take-home Message: While it is not physically impossible to engineer solutions to achieve high UV sensitivities at cryogenic temperatures, it would add a high degree of complexity with many unknowns and with no true heritage, especially below 260 K where molecular deposition begins to significantly increase.</p><p>Mirror Stability vs. TemperatureMirror stability is driven by the architecture of the mirror subsystem, which combines the material stability of the mirror substrate, with local thermal controls designed to keep the temperature of the mirrors constant in the operational environment. However, mirror materials have different stability characteristics at room temperature compared with lower temperatures, and the engineering solution for mirror segment control will be dominated by what materials are used and the thermal conditions of the segments. Exoplanet coronagraphy with LUVOIR requires individual mirror segment stability of a few picometers RMS, which is a very significant technological challenge.</p><p>Material options for LUVOIR include ULE ® , Zerodur ® , and Silicon Carbide (SiC) for room temperature operation, and the same materials plus beryllium and silicon for colder temperatures. The current LUVOIR architecture is based on the high material stability of ULE ® or Zerodur ® with low thermal and optical control authority, operating near room temperature at 270 K. To date, ULE ® The LUVOIR mission has the potential to enable revolutionary scientific breakthroughs with the largest telescope aperture ever deployed in space. While in the more distant future, telescopes might be assembled in space, the most economical and immediate path forward is to put a large aperture in space with a single launch. In the 2030s when LUVOIR is expected to fly, the launch vehicle industry will not be exactly the same as it is now. Here we summarize our understanding of the current and future launch capabilities. The LUVOIR observatory will be in orbit at the Sun-Earth L2 (SEL2) point, which provides a stable thermal environment and excellent field of regard. Constraints on the size of the telescope aperture and the instrument suite include the mass-to-orbit and the size of the fairing that the launcher can provide. A mission with the ambitious goals of LUVOIR will surely need a heavy lift launch vehicle; however, as with all technology, the near-term landscape for launch vehicle options includes some mature options with well-known characteristics and some lessmature options whose characteristics are still somewhat in flux and therefore are more difficult to evaluate with certainty. In order to mitigate the risk (and its associated costs) inherent in each different launch vehicle option, it is prudent to adopt telescope designs with the flexibility to use a variety of different launch vehicles and fairings.</p><p>Below we outline the current options for heavy-lift vehicles and describe their various attributes.       to achieve Sun-Earth L2 orbit. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.4 depicts the outer diameters of the associated fairings, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.5 depicts the height of the associated fairings. Not all of this space will be available to the payload; margins of roughly 0.5 to 1 m around the edges are needed to allow for payload motions during launch. These launch vehicles range in maturity from existing vehicles with proven flight records to vehicles that are undergoing development. Below we highlight a few of the launch providers most relevant for LUVOIR.</p><p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) ULA's Delta IV Heavy is an existing heavy lift launch vehicle with a proven track record. It supports a fairing with a 5-m outer diameter and a 4.6-m inner diameter, and ~10,000 kg lift capacity to SEL2. United Launch Alliance (ULA) has announced contracts for Delta IV (both "Medium" and "Heavy" variants) launches through 2023. ULA is also developing the Vulcan Centaur as their next generation medium-to-heavy lift vehicle. Little detail is currently available on the Vulcan performance, other than that it will be of a similar class to other next-gen vehicles such as the Falcon Heavy and New Glenn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SpaceX</head><p>In Feb. 2018, SpaceX successfully launched of the first Falcon Heavy vehicle. It offers lift capability in excess of the Delta IV Heavy, ~15,000 kg to SEL2. Currently, SpaceX plans to use the same 5.2 m-diameter, 13.9 m-tall fairing for both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy variants; there are no plans to develop a larger fairing for the Falcon Heavy. SpaceX has also announced plans to develop the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), with capabilities exceeding that of the Saturn V.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.3">Starlight suppression with coronagraphs</head><p>Stuart Shaklan (JPL) Stellar coronagraphs are instruments designed to suppress the veiling glare of starlight so that faint planets can be seen adjacent to their parent stars. The glare is caused by both diffraction (sidelobes) from the aperture boundaries including the outer limit of the pupil, the secondary obscuration, secondary support structures, mirror segment gaps, and scatter from the imperfect optical surfaces in the telescope and instrument. Generally speaking, coronagraphs are easier to design for filled, off-axis apertures than for partially obscured, segmented, on-axis apertures.</p><p>The diffraction problem can be addressed in three ways:</p><p>• Pupil Apodization: The first solution is to apodize the pupil. Apodization, like a lowpass electronic filter, reduces sidelobes by cancelling or removing diffracted light from the beam and allowing for the use of a small central obscuration to block the undiffracted starlight. This is accomplished either by placing a specially designed mask at a pupil image, or by using optics to concentrate the beam in an advantageous way.  The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report D-13</p><p>• Nulling Interferometry: The third solution, the Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC), is to split the pupil light into two beams and then recombine them using a phase shift and beam shear to cancel the onaxis starlight but not off-axis source flux <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">(Figure 16.9</ref>).</p><p>Coronagraph designers for space-based corongraphy are gravitating toward hybrid approaches combining pupil apodization and image plane masking to deal with segmented apertures, but other solutions are still being explored.</p><p>With diffracted light eliminated from the system, scattered light originating from aberrations, coating defects, and contamination remains and must be removed. This is achieved by flattening the wavefront using one or more deformable mirrors (DMs), with typically &gt;1000 actuators within the pupil <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">(Figure 16.10)</ref>. To control the wavefront, it must first be sensed. This is done by adjusting the DM surface several times while recording the change in image plane illumination. An algorithm then determines the required wavefront The LUVOIR Interim Report correction and commands the DMs to form new surface shapes. This is repeated until a "dark hole" is formed with a level of glare low enough to expose a planet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.11 shows a dark hole achieved in the laboratory in a 10% wavelength bandpass. The desired level of suppression is 10 -10 for imaging of an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star; that is, the residual scatter in the image plane after diffraction and wavefront control is 10 billion times below the level of the incident starlight. Amazingly, this can be achieved using optics of equivalent quality to those currently used on the Hubble Space Telescope, and is limited mainly by the ability to accurately set the DM and to hold the system stable. The stability issue is perhaps the most challenging, with subnanometer requirements imposed on the wavefront. This is particularly challenging when it comes to low-order aberrations such as pointing, focus, coma, and astigmatism. To measure and control these terms, loworder wavefront sensors with fast response times using the starlight rejected by the coronagraphic masks are being developed.</p><p>The effectiveness of a coronagraph is evaluated based on several performance metrics: the inner working angle (IWA; i.e., how close to the star you can observe), wavelength bandwidth over which it can operate effectively, the throughput of the system, and the raw contrast (i.e., the level of glare suppression). Typically, achieving high performance at small IWA leads to either lower system throughput or increased sensitivity to aberrations and the finite stellar diameter. The challenge of suppression increases with bandwidth; the broader the band (more signal photons), the more background appears, and the more challenging the wavefront sensing and control becomes. Perhaps most importantly, the IWA scales proportionally with wavelength (∝ l/D, where D is the telescope diameter); the same coronagraph that works at 50 milliarcsec (mas) at a wavelength of 500 nm will be limited to about 100 mas at 1 mm. This is an important factor when characterizing exoplanet spectra in the near-infrared. </p></div>

Bolcar (NASA GSFC)</p><p>The LUVOIR mission's exoplanet science objectives require high-contrast imaging with an internal coronagraph. A coronagraph's wavefront control system uses deformable mirrors to correct amplitude and wavefront aberrations in the optical system, allowing the diffracted starlight to be suppressed so that orbiting exoplanets can be directly observed. Metallic coatings that are typically used on mirror surfaces present a challenge for a coronagraph's wavefront control system. Specifically, the orthogonal polarization states of light (often denoted by "s" and "p") are affected differently by the coating, as a function of wavelength, angle of incidence, and coating properties. There are two effects of concern. The first effect is polarization aberration, where each polarization state sees a different amplitude (diattenuation) and phase change (retardance) upon reflecting from a metallic surface (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.12). The second effect is cross-polarization leakage, where some portion of a polarization state is converted into the orthogonal state upon reflection. The result of these two effects is that when unpolarized light (such as starlight) reflects from a metallic surface, four independent (or incoherent) electric fields are created: s-incident light reflected in the s-state ("ss"), s-incident light reflected in the p-state ("sp"), p-incident light reflected in the p-state ("pp"), and p-incident light reflected in the s-state ("ps"). Since these fields are incoherent (i.e., they have uncorrelated amplitude and spatial variations), a coronagraph cannot sense and correct each one individually. Instead, the coronagraph wavefront control system will sense and correct the average of the four fields. The remaining uncorrected portion will contribute to leaked starlight that could potentially obscure an exoplanet. It is important to note that the cross-polarization terms (sp and ps) are orders of magnitude <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.12. Left: Amplitude reflection coefficient for each polarization state as a function of angle of incidence for a bare aluminum mirror (solid lines) and an aluminum mirror coated with a quarter-wave of MgF 2 (dashed lines) at a wavelength of 550 nm. Right: The reflected phase shift for the same two cases. In each case, the orthogonal polarization states experience a different amplitude and phase change upon reflection. Angles of incidence at the primary and secondary mirrors for an on-axis, ~12-m-class telescope would typically be less than 15 degrees.</p></div>

There are several ways to address the polarization issues:</p><p>Telescope Design Considerations: Both polarization effects are strongly dependent on the angle-of-incidence (AOI) of the light at the optical surface. Slower (high-F/#) optics will have lower AOIs across the surface of the mirrors, thus minimizing the polarization effects. Flat mirrors that are used to fold the optical path at large angles should also be avoided or used in crossedpairs such that the effects are cancelled out. Slower optics, however, can lead to longer optical systems with smaller fields-of-view. The impacts of polarization aberration and cross-polarization leakage must therefore be traded against volume constraints and science objectives.</p><p>Coating Properties: The polarization effects are also dependent on the coating properties, specifically the index of refraction; choosing appropriate materials can help minimize the effects. To enable the LUVOIR mission's ultraviolet (UV) science objectives requires a protected aluminum coating on at least the primary and secondary mirrors. It is expected that there is little that can be done from a coating perspective to further reduce the polarization effects, aside from ensuring that the protective overcoat material does not significantly increase the effects over the base aluminum layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b591">Balasubramanian et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Coronagraph Architecture: Another effective way to deal with polarization aberrations is to split the light at the coronagraph and only observe one polarization at a time. This can be done serially by a single instrument: a polarized filter would select a single polarization state for which the aberrations would be sensed and observed, allowing for exoplanet detection and correction in that polarization state; the orthogonal polarization state could then be selected and the observation repeated. The obvious drawback is requiring twice the amount of time to capture all of the exoplanet photons. Alternatively, the polarization states can be split with a polarizing beam-splitter, with each being sent to a separate coronagraph instrument. This allows for simultaneous observation of all of the exoplanet photons, at the expense of requiring two coronagraph instruments, each with its own focal plane, filter wheels, deformable mirrors, and associated electronics. An additional avenue of research includes introducing polarization-controlling diffractive optical elements to correct the effects.</p><p>Regardless of the approach taken, there are two questions that remain to be answered. The first question is: how effective are polarizing filters or polarizing beam-splitters at separating the orthogonal states? Achieving 10 -10 raw contrast may require polarizing optical components that are beyond the state-of-the-art. The second question regards the crosspolarization leakage term. When a single polarization state is selected (say, s), both the ss and ps components are transmitted. If the coronagraph wavefront control system senses and corrects the ss component, then the ps component will contribute a low-level static speckle background that may obscure an exoplanet. Modeling is being performed on the LUVOIR architectures to fully understand the magnitude of these polarization effects and determine if they are significant enough to be of concern.</p><p>It is important to note that coatinginduced polarization aberration and crosspolarization leakage will be generated by any metallic mirror coating. high-contrast coronagraphy performance can be significantly improved by switching from an aluminum coating to a silver coating.</p></div>

Bolcar (NASA GSFC)</p><p>Enabling the LUVOIR mission's compelling ultraviolet (UV) science goals, while also maintaining broadband capabilities to support the exoplanet science mission and other general astrophysics observations, will require a high-performance broadband reflective coating. Of the common metallic mirror coatings (gold, silver, aluminum), only aluminum is capable of providing high reflectivity into the UV at wavelengths as short as 100 nm. However, almost immediately upon exposure to air (even at very low pressures), an oxidation layer forms on the surface of aluminum-coated mirrors that dramatically reduces its UV performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Balasubramanian et al. 2017</ref>). Protective overcoats (usually a fluoride such as LiF, MgF 2 , or AlF 3 ) are used to arrest the oxidation once it has begun and protect the aluminum layer from further oxidation. These overcoat layers themselves can also impact the reflectivity of the mirror at the shortest wavelengths. Current technology development efforts are focused on improving deposition  processes to maximize protected aluminum coating reflectivity at wavelengths below 150 nm, while maintaining high reflectivity at longer wavelengths through the visible and near-infrared. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.14 shows a number of reflectivity curves for demonstrated and theoretical protected aluminum coatings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b593">Hennessy et al. 2016)</ref>. Typical protected aluminum coatings use a single, thin layer of MgF 2 as the protectant. This is the coating used on the Hubble Space Telescope and provides excellent reflectivity (&gt;85%) at wavelengths longer than ~120 nm. Shortward of 120 nm, the reflectivity sharply drops to about 20%. Current research efforts are developing Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes for depositing a very thin (~few nanometers) layer of MgF 2 , which may provide protection from oxidation while maintaining the high-reflectivity of bare aluminum.</p><p>Aluminum protected by LiF provides reflectivity greater than 80% at wavelengths as short as 110 nm and depends critically on the coating process employed. Its cutoff wavelength is around 100 nm. It is important to also note that LiF is a hygroscopic material that deteriorates when exposed to water vapor. Mirrors coated with LiF would need to be held under a constant dry purge during the entire integration and test phase, as well as launch. This will be extremely challenging for a system as large and complex as LUVOIR. Alternatively, protecting the LiF layer with a thin layer of AlF <ref type="bibr">3</ref> or MgF 2 can prevent the absorption of water vapor and stabilize the performance of the coating over long periods of time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.15). The LUVOIR Interim Report <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 16</ref>.14 also shows two theoretical curves for an aluminum mirror protected by AlF 3 only (purple curves). The first curve is a theoretical best case in which no oxide layer has formed on the Al undercoat. The second curve shows the theoretical performance assuming a 3 Å layer of oxide has formed between the Al and the AlF 3 overcoat. Layer thicknesses and process conditions affect the resulting performance and may allow further optimization.</p><p>Several technology development efforts are currently underway to optimize these coatings and the deposition processes, including both physical vapor deposition (PVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). New techniques that allow the overcoat to be deposited immediately after the deposition of the base Al layer will reduce the thickness of the oxide layer that forms or prevent it all together. Process improvements will also help increase the reflectivity, as well as its uniformity across the mirror surface. The LUVOIR Surveyor is envisioned as thèthèSpace Observatory of the 21st Century'. With up to 40 times the geometric collecting area of the Hubble Space Telescope and highly sensitive, multiplexed instruments, LUVOIR is poised to provide transformative scientific measurements of a broad range of astrophysical objects. Ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopic capabilities are central to the majority of the key scientific goals of LUVOIR, from quantifying the flows of matter between galaxies and the intergalactic medium, to understanding how host star's UV radiation regulates the atmospheric photochemistry on habitable planets. Carrying out high-precision ultraviolet astronomy across such a wide range of sources requires detector systems working below the atmospheric cut-off (100-400 nm) with low-noise and/or photon-counting capability, high quantum detection efficiency, large format size, and high temporal resolution. Ideally, all of these characteristics would be encompassed in a single detector, but multiple technologies may be required to accomplish LUVOIR's suite of science investigations. We present an overview of UV detector technologies so the LUVOIR STDT and NASA can make informed recommendations for directed technology investment to support first generation UV instrumentation for LUVOIR. We note that with the goal of serviceability, some technologies that are less mature today may be optimized by the time second generation LUVOIR instruments are proposed, and as such, a long-term but adaptable technology maturation plan would be desirable for UV detectors.</p><p>Microchannel Plate Devices: Microchannel plates (MCPs) with "solar-blind" photocathodes, low dark noise rates, and zero read noise have a rich flight heritage on astronomy, heliophysics, and planetary science missions.</p><p>Advantages: MCP-based detectors are inherently photon-counting, operate at room temperature, can be ruggedized for 10+ year lifetimes in space, are scalable to large formats, and offer relatively high quantum efficiency at short UV wavelengths (l &lt; 130 nm).</p><p>Disadvantages: MCPs have limited dynamic range for bright objects that require instrument safety protocols, do not regularly support signal-to-noise (S/N) &gt; 100 observations owing to fixed pattern noise, and experience issues with long-term "gainsag" (burn-in at locations of prolonged high illumination).</p><p>CCD and sCMOS: Charge coupled devices (CCDs) have significant heritage in space and on the ground, can be d-doped to improve UV performance, and antireflection coatings can be further optimized to offer higher QE over a selected bandpass.

Disadvantages: CCDs are not inherently "solar-blind," due to the low band-gap of silicon, so care must be taken to mitigate sensitivity to scattered visible-band radiation in UV applications. Testing and optimization of these devices for radiation hardness in an L2-like environment is also an active area of research. Initial results indicate that EMCCDs in particular suffer degrade charge transfer efficiency due to extended periods of radiation exposure. Hole-multiplying CCDs (HMCCD), a p-type version of EMCCDs, are currently under development and would be inherently radiation hard. sCMOS devices require similar investigation into radiation hardness and low-temperature operation.</p><p>Advanced Concepts: Less mature UV detector technologies, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), offer the possibility of energy resolution at the pixel level. Uncertainties in the scalability to significant pixel/spaxel counts and cryogenic operation currently limit the utility of these devices for LUVOIR, but these issues may be quantified and possibly overcome with additional technology investment. Challenges unique to UV: Key technology challenges that remain unique to the UV involve boosting efficiency and reducing noise, along with several other issues linked to these goals:</p><p>Quantum Efficiency: UV sensitive detectors have quantum efficiencies at or below 20-50% within the band, leading to the possibility that future technologies may provide factors of up to 2-5× improvement in overall UV sensitivity. Some UV sensor technologies have a comparable or higher QE in the visible, raising potential "red leak" issues that may require additional filtering. A related challenge is the low transmittance of UV bandpass filters, which limits options for efficient red-blocking or band selection. Multi-layer filter advancements offer a promising avenue of research.</p><p>Noise: The sky background is several magnitudes fainter in the UV than in the visible, which presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity is the exploitation of a low-background window for the study of faint objects. For example, for broadband FUV observations, the sky background is 28.5 mag/sq. arcsec, or fewer than ~1 photon per resol for 10-30 min exposure times on a 10-m class telescope, even less for narrowband observations or spectroscopy. The challenge is that taking full advantage of this low background requires detectors that do not themselves limit faint observations, motivating low noise or photon-counting technologies, with read noise and/or dark current typically lower than required for standard broadband visible observations. Borosilicate MCPs with anticoincidence shielding should mitigate the higher particle backgrounds inherent to operation at L2.</p><p>Dynamic Range: These same photoncounting detectors may also have limited dynamic range, particularly in the large formats required for LUVOIR, and this is a challenge that needs to be addressed by all technologies being considered. A detailed comparison of the dynamic range performance for each of the leading detector technologies, given realistic instrumentation and observing programs, would be a valuable exercise for the LUVOIR study.</p><p>Improving performance in these areas can significantly impact science return. The required exposure time to reach a given S/N for a particular target in a sky-backgroundlimited observation scales as t ~ QE and increases to t ~ QE 2 in the detector dark current-limited regime, motivating efficiency gains. Similarly, the required exposure times decrease linearly with improvement in dark current and/or read noise, down to the very low sky-background limit. No single technology leads performance in all three areas (efficiency, read noise, and dark current). At this point, the optimal UV detector is likely to be application or instrument-specific.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.1.1">Introduction</head><p>Starshades are a relatively newer idea for providing the extreme high-contrast needed for exoplanet direct observations. They have strengths and weaknesses that are complimentary to those of coronagraphs. A starshade is a independent spacecraft flying in formation with the telescope ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure  17.1)</ref>. The goal is to keep the telescope in the shadow cast by the starshade, and keep both spacecraft aligned with the target star. The larger the telescope, the larger the starshade needs to be. The edges of a starshade have a very particular shape to control diffraction and deepen the shadow at the location of the telescope. An example of a small starshade mission concept can be seen in this video: https://exoplanets. nasa.gov/resources/1015/. A lecture on the Theory and Development of Starshades given at the 2014 Sagan Summer Workshop is available here: https://www. youtube.com/watch?feature=player_ detailpage&amp;v=h5w6z0jow1Q#t=0.</p><p>A starshade blocks the unwanted bright light from an exoplanet host star before it enters the telescope, while allowing light from nearby planets to pass nearly unattenuated. Therefore, internally scattered light reaching the detector is minimized. Telescope segments and obstructions do not need to be masked out and the wavefront does not need to be corrected with deformable mirrors. A starshade can provide a very small inner working angle (IWA), approximately given by the starshade radius (R) divided by the starshade-telescope separation (z), down to around the diffraction limit of the telescope (~ 1.2 l/D). For planets in habitable zones of nearby sun-like stars, the starshadetelescope separations are tens to hundreds of thousands of km.</p><p>Starshades have no intrinsic outer working angle (OWA). They can be designed to operate over large bandpasses (a few times larger than today's coronagraph bandpasses) and to provide small IWAs at virtually any wavelength. For a fixed IWA and contrast level, the required starshade size increases with wavelength. Since the starshade is not part of the optics train, internal reflections are kept to a minimum and total throughput is high. This makes them excellent for deep spectroscopy, especially in the NIR where coronagraphs struggle to provide small IWAs. On the weaknesses side, the need to slew the starshade over huge arcs to realign it with different target stars means there are long intervals (days to weeks) between the high-contrast observations and the total number of observations is fuel-limited. The telescope can do other kinds of astronomical observations in the intervals, but starshades are relatively inefficient for high-contrast imaging surveys. The starshade and telescope must be precisely aligned during observations to maintain high contrast. Keeping the telescope in the darkest part of the starshade shadow generally translates to lateral position precision of about a meter (the separation precision is much less stringent).</p><p>Full-scale end-to-end system tests on the ground are not possible, although subscale tests are being be done in the lab and in the field (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b594">Cady et al. 2010;</ref>). The large sizes of starshades means that they must be folded up for launch and deployed in space. The exact shape of the optical edge must be accurate (on the order of 100 μm tolerance for contrast in the 10 -10 range) after deployment. Further, the thin edge of the starshade must be engineered to minimize sunlight scattering back into the telescope. More information on starshade technology deleveopment may be found at https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/technology/technology-overview/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.1.2">Scope of LUVOIR starshade study</head><p>Starshades have several attractive features, and their strengths complement those of coronagraphs. Therefore, a series of starshade designs for LUVOIR were investigated over the May/June 2017 period. Here we discuss the design parameters and constraints, the optimization methodology, and the results.</p><p>Performance Constraints: Starshade designs were created for 4 architectures with the following constraints: After consultation with the LUVOIR team, the short wavelength cutoff for the 4 architectures was set to a goal of 250 nm. The starshade inner working angle (IWA) for each architecture was chosen to match that of a coronagraph on the same architecture (3.5 l/D at 500 nm). For 9-m designs, the IWA was 40 milliarcsec (mas); for 15-m designs, the IWA was 24 mas.</p><p>For the LUVOIR designs, we set a requirement that the mean contrast in a 1.0 l/D annulus centered at the IWA in the final telescope focal plane be no greater than 1 × 10 -12 . The same metric was used for HabEx starshade designs in separate work and is consistent with producing 10 -10 contrast after running through an error budgeting process with achievable tolerances.</p><p>Engineering Constraints: Each starshade was optimized for a diameter 2-m larger than the telescope aperture, to allow ~1-m formation-flying offset between</p></div>

Petal tip sizes and inter-petal gaps were bounded at ≥1 mm, and the number of petals was fixed at 28, which had been previously preferred in other contexts for mechanical reasons. Starshade diameter and petal length were permitted to float as part of the overall optimization.</p><p>Other: Candidate designs were checked with a representation of the preliminary 15-m LUVOIR aperture provided by M. Bolcar. In the absence of a finalized LUVOIR-B design at the time of this analysis, a 9/15 scale version of the 15-m design was used instead for evaluating the 9-m cases. This preliminary aperture is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 17</ref>.2. The resulting starshade designs are not sensitive to the exact telescope aperture geometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.1.3">Starshade size and shape optimization</head><p>The optimization procedure used for the LUVOIR starshades has been covered in other works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b595">Cady et al. 2009</ref>). Very briefly, a smoothly varying radial apodization function, A(r), is approximated with a binary shape that has transmission of 1 or 0 everywhere <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">(Figure 17.3)</ref>. To select an appropriate A(r) for a LUVOIR starshade, we choose scientific constraints (IWA, bounds of science bandpass, telescope diameter) and engineering constraints (total starshade diameter, petal length, number of petals, minimum feature sizes, edge smoothness, formation-flying tolerance). These parameters are sufficient to populate a constrained linear optimization with a min-max cost function. We select the science IWA as the geometric IWA, the radius physically subtended by the starshade on the sky. The geometric IWA is defined as θ = arctan(R/z) ≈ R⁄z, where R is the starshade radius and z is the starshadetelescope separation. We choose θ based on science goals for a particular starshade, and let the distance z float as R/θ.</p><p>Other choices of science IWA are possible, such as angular radius that permits some fractional exoplanet throughput, but there are two strong advantages of using the geometric IWA. First, the parameter is independent of A(r), and so is known prior to beginning the optimization. Second, since the starshade has no structure beyond the IWA, errors in starshade manufacturing will only appear as sources from inside the angular extent of the starshade, and so using the geometric IWA as the science IWA during design means the ultimate performance will be much less sensitive to manufacturing errors.</p><p>Implicit in these designs is an assumption that the apodization is solid in the center and tapers monotonically outward, with that taper occurring over a sub-region of the radial extent. Leaving a solid central disk is a practical choice, as the spacecraft bus can be located there without interfering with the apodization profile. Manufacturing considerations require that A(r) cannot go smoothly to 0 at R or 1 at the radius of the The results of these experiments are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_50">Table 17</ref>.1, which shows that with 0.4-5.0 mm spectral coverage, LUVOIR has the potential to determine the abundance of water and methane in many TESS/K2/ PLATO targets. If the spectral coverage were limited to 2.5 mm, brighter stars are required, so substantially fewer targets would become available for study. This demonstrates the benefits of the enhanced wavelength range we are proposing, particularly for the high mean molecular weight atmosphere, which approximately corresponds to an Earthlike atmosphere. In this case, a very bright star ([H] &lt; 6.3) is required for abundance determinations with less than an order of magnitude uncertainty; stars this bright that harbor transiting planets may be rare statistically. As expected, the lower mean molecular weight atmosphere, with its larger scale height, would be much more readily observed. Several recent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b606">(Misra, Meadows, &amp; Crisp 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Betremieux &amp; Kaltenneger 2014</ref>) have highlighted the effects of refraction in the lower part of an exoplanet's atmosphere on our ability to study abundances using transit measurements. The importance of this effect depends on both the size of the star and the starplanet distance, and it will have to be taken into consideration in more sophisticated predictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.4">Summary: an infrared capability for LUVOIR</head><p>We have demonstrated that a ~10-m diameter telescope operating in space at room temperature would be able to make unique and important scientific measurements in the infrared out to at least 5 mm. By using the technique of transit spectroscopy, where for bright stars the noise is set by the stellar photons rather than the thermal background, such a telescope could outperform smaller but lower temperature telescopes for studies which could prove critical for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. It would also be capable of obtaining spectra of millions of infrared sources from the WISE catalog and provide new information about the formation of solar systems, which would link directly to the exoplanet observations. We feel that such a capability should be carefully considered for incorporation into LUVOIR, now or in the future, particularly if further studies of instrument concepts such as that presented below show that they can be easily incorporated into the payload.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.5">A fiber-fed infrared spectrometer for LUVOIR</head><p>W16 describe a fiber-fed IR spectrometer for LUVOIR. The spectral resolving power of 200 is chosen to permit disambiguation of molecular features in exoplanet atmospheres and also to permit study of the profiles of solid state absorption features in galactic protostellar and protoplanetary disks. We emphasize that other spectrograph designs and means of feeding the spectrograph could provide equivalent performance, and that coupling the starlight into and out of the fiber could stress the LUVOIR pointing system and perhaps other design parameters. An alternative approach using mirrors instead of fibers to feed the spectrograph ought certainly to be considered, for example. This particular approach was chosen because, on the surface at least, it appears to minimize the system impact of the thermal infrared capability. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">Figure 17</ref>.8 is a concept sketch of the system. A pick-off mirror will be inserted into the LUVOIR telescope focal plane to relay the star signal into a prism-based spectrometer system (f/12.5), featuring a MWIR FPA (5 mm-cutoff H2RG from Teledyne). The reflective prism is made of calcium fluoride. A 10 m IR fiber (Fluoride Fiber ZBLAN SM from Le Verre Fluore) is used to carry the light from the telescope to the spectrometer, which is mounted on the exterior structure of LUVOIR so that it can cool radiatively. To get optimal fiber coupling, 2 relay mirrors with power (f/12.5 to f/2.5) are utilized. To minimize the spectrometer background noise, a cold shield box covers the full spectrometer system, and the second relay surface illuminates the spectrometer slit, which is mounted on the side of the otherwise sealed cold shield box. The performance of this system is detailed in W16 and used in the calculations presented above. The design of the spectrometer described here was supported by a grant from the JPL Research and Technology Development fund. Portions of the work described in this paper were carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor The LUVOIR Interim Report Ron Broccolo (Harris Corporation) Eric Cady (JPL) Kerri Cahoy (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Jeff Cavaco (Northrop Grumman) Alberto Conti (Northrop Grumman) Jim Contreras (Ball Aerospace) Laura Coyle (Ball Aerospace) Brendan Crill (JPL) Javier Del Hoyo (NASA GSFC) Larry Dewell (Lockheed Martin) Jeanette Domber (Ball Aerospace) Matthew East (Harris Corporation) Mike Eisenhower (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) Michael Feinberg (Boston Micromachines) Greg Fellers (Lockheed Martin) James R.

A wide wavelength range enables higher fidelity spectral characterization by providing observations of many atmospheric species, and often multiple absorption bands of a given species. This breaks degeneracies between overlapping bands (e.g., overlapping CH 4 and H 2 O absorption features, as can be seen in the near-infrared in the Archean Earth spectra) and enables the search for non-traditional biosignatures.

The left panel shows the case of equal mass binaries, while the right panel shows the case in which the binaries have randomly selected mass ratios (down to stellar masses of 0.01 M  ). In both panels, the black line shows the case of 0% binary fraction, i.e., the output (`observed' for unresolved binaries) IMF, expressed as number of stars per mass bin. The purple and blue lines show the cases of fixed binary fractions, 20% and 70%, respectively. The orange line assumes mass-dependent binary fractions: 70% for M &gt; 10 M  , 20% for 2 M  &lt; M &lt; 10 M  and 10% for M &lt; 2 M  . Equal mass binaries (left panel) are drawn from an intrinsic IMF that is not dissimilar from the output one, with the exception of a mass break at a few M  . Conversely, binaries with random mass ratios (right panel) need to be drawn from intrinsic IMFs that are potentially very different from the observed one: the cases with fixed binary ratios display a dramatic flattening of the intrinsic slope for masses below 10 M  , while the case with variable binary fractions could be drawn from an intrinsic IMF with a steeper high-end slope than the observed one.</figDesc></figure>

The solar array and electrical power subsystem supplies 120-v power directly to the payload, and 28-v power (via a down converter) to the S/C. A 28-v battery provides power during launch and ascent.</figDesc></figure>

Light from the OTE enters from the upper right. The entrance aperture for the spectrograph is a 3 x 2 grid of microshutter arrays (Li et al. 2014). The microshutter arrays build on the design of the Near Infrared Spectrograph instrument on JWST (Kutyrev et al. 2008), with 6 individual tiles of 420 × 840 shutters with individual shutter dimensions of 100 mm × 200 mm. The microshutter array grid defines the field-of-view for multi-object spectroscopy: 3' × 1.6' for the far-UV modes and 1.3' × 1.6' for the near-UV mode. In both modes, light passing through the microshutter array is directed onto a series of six fixed gratings via a fixed convex biconic optic and a second aberration-correcting toroidal steering mirror. Piston, tip, and tilt control of second mirror selects which of the six gratings is illuminated at any given time. Of the six fixed gratings, five are used for far-UV (100-200 nm) spectroscopy, and include medium, low, and very low spectral resolution options. The sixth grating provides a medium-resolution near-UV (200-400 nm) option. Table 9.3 summarizes the spectral resolution, bandpass, angular resolution, and field-of-view for each mode of the multiobject spectrograph. All of the far-UV MOS modes are focused onto a 2 × 2 array of large-format microchannel plate detectors. The near-UV MOS mode is focused onto a 3 × 7 array of d-doped CMOS devices, similar to those used in the HDI UVIS channel (see Section 9.3.4.3.5).</figDesc></figure>

A neutral density filter can be placed via a filter wheel between these two reflective filters for bright object protection.

Coronagraph elements, showing apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph and vector vortex coronagraph features. The telescope is pointed at a target star, whose light is passed to the coronagraph, through an apodized pupil mask, and then focused on a focal plane mask. The mask suppresses the star image. The rest of the light, including the off-axis planet light, passes by the mask. Downstream, a Lyot stop suppresses residual diffracted starlight, and then the planet light is refocused onto a focal plane array detector or fed into an integral field spectrograph. Two deformable mirrors (DMs) are used to establish high contrast. Out-of-band and low-order wavefront sensors (OBWFS, LOWFS) stabilize wavefront and intensity variations to preserve contrast.

The second preferred design is the vector vortex coronagraph (VVC), which can reach the same contrast as the APLC but with smaller inner working angle (~2 l/D) and over a wide bandpass, limited only by the wavefront control system performance (Ruane et al. 2016). For centrally obscured telescope apertures, however, the VVC has significantly more sensitivity to stellar diameter than the APLC.

It would be conducted almost exclusively via ECLIPS observations of exoplanets in the habitable zones of their host stars, and LUMOS observations would obtain the UV spectral energy distribution of those host stars. It would use different bands within the ECLIPS wavelength range, depending on the distance to the target and the spectral feature in question, and likely would run ECLIPS to the point where integration on individual bands becomes time-limited. Details of this approach are below. The main difference of the approach outlined here to the main exoplanet characterization program is in how optimized the biosignature search becomes, and how the data from that search are processed.</figDesc></figure>

Also shown for comparison is 1.2× Zodi. Figure 16.1 shows that the telescope temperature must be 200 K to achieve faint-source observations that are Zodi background-limited at 2.5 mm. The figure also shows that reducing the telescope temperature only 50 K from room temperature increases the background limit by only ~0.3 mm. However, achieving a Zodilimited background flux is not necessary for bright-target applications such as stellar, planetary, or exoplanetary applications, and reductions in the thermal background at long wavelengths will still lead to improvements in sensitivity. We therefore address the impacts of decreasing the telescope temperature on the overall telescope engineering design.</figDesc></figure>

This is then followed by another mask at the reimaged pupil, called the Lyot plane, to block the outer edges of the beam and remove the diffracted starlight (Figure 16.8). Off-axis light from a nearby star passes around the first mask and then through the gap in the Lyot stop.

The 1-sigma errors per wavelength bin, obtained with the smaller LUVOIR design (D=9.2 m, T=273 K), are plotted along with the model. The total integration time is 120 hours in transit, corresponding to 60 transits of about 2 hours each. Features of H 2 O, CH 4 , and CO 2 are detected. CH 4 is blended with H 2 O at ~3.3 mm and determining its independent presence and total column would require full atmospheric retrieval; in the Earth's atmosphere, CH 4 and H 2 O contribute roughly equally to the 3.3 mm feature. A total throughput of 0.35 and an emissivity of 0.2 is assumed here. The y-axis is labelled in parts per million (ppm) relative to the total signal produced by the star. The overall depth of the transit for this case would be about 800 ppm; the features shown in the spectrum would be manifest as changes in the transit depth with wavelength. The precision of a few ppm called for here would be a challenging target for IR detector technology.</figDesc></figure>

(Luger &amp; Barnes 2015). This latter process 
can potentially build up atmospheres 
with hundreds of bars of abiotic O 2 , but is 
probably only relevant to planets orbiting M 
dwarf stars. 
Preferential loss of H from the planet's 
atmosphere raises the planet's O/H ratio. 
This sets up favorable conditions for 
photochemical accumulation of abiotic O 2 
and O 3 , as the lack of H atoms will decrease 
the rate at which O 2 and O 3 are chemically 
destroyed. These slow destruction rates 
allow O 2 and O 3 to accumulate despite 
the relatively slow production rates. In an 
extreme case, where the planet is devoid of 
H 2 O but relatively high in CO 2 , both O 2 and 
O 3 can build up in the atmosphere, as the 
recombination of photolyzed CO 2 is slow (Hu 
et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2014; Harman et al. 
2015; Gao et al. 2015). Planets with H 2 O 
can also accumulate potentially detectable 
amounts of O 3 , if they have limited reservoirs 
of reduced (H-bearing) gases such as 
methane </table></figure>

the result of oxygen photochemistry, and 
sulfur aerosols like H 2 SO 4 can be produced 

through volcanic outgassing; such aerosols 
can produce detectable spectral signatures 
that may be remotely identified as a sign 
of vigorous volcanism on terrestrial planets 

Figure 4.5. Simulated LUVOIR spectra of planets orbiting a Sun-twin star at 10 pc. The simulated 
data plotted with grey bars were generated using the online LUVOIR coronagraphic spectroscopy 
tool, assuming the LUVOIR-A architecture (15-m telescope), the current ECLIPS-A instrument 
parameters, and exposure times of 96 hours per coronagraph band. Input model spectra are 
over-plotted with colored lines. The Venus model spectrum was provided by the Virtual Planet 
Laboratory (VPL), generated using the Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART) 
model (Meadows &amp; Crisp 1996; Crisp 1997). The super-Mars model was created by scaling a 
Mars model spectrum from VPL to a radius of 1 R Earth and an orbital separation of 1 AU. The 
super-Mars data were rebinned to increase S/N. The warm Jupiter model spectra are from Cahoy 
et al. (2010) and the warm Neptune model spectrum is from Hu &amp; Seager (2014). Image credit:

program would allow us to trace the evolution 
and dispersal of the main molecular carriers 
of C, H, and O during planet assembly 
in the terrestrial and giant-planet forming 
regions, trace molecular and low-ionization 
metals from disk winds, and determine the 
absolute abundance patterns in the disk as

can be used as an example: They are 
separated by roughly 70 milliarcseconds, 
and have a magnitude difference of 6.7 
magnitudes. 
• Depth: Albedo variations on objects 
are typically a few percent. Detection 
of sublimation from active asteroids will 
have requirements similar to comets at a 
similar solar distance. 
• Comments: Irregular satellites may also 
be lumped in with asteroids. The giant 
planets have dozens of irregular satellites 
that are thought to be captured asteroids. 
For many of them no physical properties 
are available. 

Spectroscopy 

• Wavelength coverage: Major asteroid 
types typically have absorptions near 1 

and 2 mm or else a shallow absorption 
centered near 700 nm when considering 
wavelengths shortward of 2.5 mm. Very 
little asteroid data exists shortward of 
400 nm or so, but HST and spacecraft 
observations of Ceres and Lutetia show 
evidence of features at wavelengths as 
short as 110-120 nm. 
• Resolution: Spectral resolutions are 
typically low for asteroid observations, 
as absorptions are typically very broad. A 
low spectral resolution mode (R ~ 200 to 
250?) will be of use. 
• Multiplexing/IFU: possible, but difficult to 
co-locate several dynamical objects in a 
single FOV. 
• Depth: Band depths in the 1-2 mm region 
are typically a few percent.

13.14 Resolved photometry of young super star clusters 

Søren S. Larsen (Department of Astrophysics/IMAPP, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The 
Netherlands) 

13.14.1 Introduction 

Star clusters were traditionally viewed 
as excellent examples of "simple stellar 
populations"-consisting of stars with a 
single age and a single chemical composition. 
While this still appears to hold true for low-
mass open clusters, it is now clear that 
massive globular clusters that inhabit the 
Galactic halo are far more complex systems. 
Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from the 
Hubble Space Telescope show multiple 
populations that reveal themselves through 
parallel main sequences, split red giant 
branches, and other features not reproduced 
by standard models for stellar evolution 
(Gratton et al. 2012; Bastian &amp; Lardo 2017).

This approach would likely require an 
optimized search for biosignatures, spending 
as little time as possible confirming/ 
rejecting biosignatures on each planet. This 
search would likely focus on planets with 
atmospheric H 2 O, which would be found 
during LUVOIR's planet detection phase. 
In addition to weeding out dry planets, this 
initial phase would also include a search for 
H 2 O beyond the habitable zone. This would 
help test the habitable zone concept by 
mapping the presence of H 2 O water vapor 
as a function of stellar irradiation (Bean et al. 
2017).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.7.1">Introduction</head><p>The UV spectra of cool dwarf stars (F, G, K, &amp; M) are dominated by emission lines originating from the magnetically heated upper layers of the stellar atmosphere ( <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>.10); &lt;10% of their photospheric/ blackbody continuum is emitted in the UV (l &lt; 3000 K). Chromospheric, transition region, and coronal emission lines from species like H I, Mg II, C IV, Si IV, and N V are ultimately powered by the star's magnetic dynamo, which also controls the rotational evolution of these stars via magnetized stellar winds <ref type="bibr" target="#b452">(Skumanich 1972)</ref>. UV emission line fluxes and widths can diagnose temperature, pressure, density, and kinematics throughout the stellar atmosphere, even indicating H 2 fluorescence from the star's own UV photons (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b451">Kruczek et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b450">, Jaeggli et al. 2018</ref>. When obtained for a wide range of masses and ages, UV spectra can elucidate the evolutionary processes of cool stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b449">Guinan et al. 2003</ref>).</p><p>Of special note is H I Lyman alpha (1215.67 Å), the brightest emission line in the FUV and NUV spectrum of a cool dwarf. A complete UV characterization of these stars cannot be obtained without it, but Lyman alpha observations are challenging. The Earth's extended atmosphere glows brightly in Lyman alpha, and interstellar H I attenuates the entire line core for even the closest stars.</p><p>The core of the Lyman alpha line must be reconstructed from the observed line wings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b453">Youngblood et al. 2016)</ref>, which can prove difficult for faint targets.</p></div>

LUMOS will provide access to more emission lines with a wider range of formation temperatures (probing from the lower chromosphere to the corona) not only because of its increased sensitivity but also its increased spectral range compared to STIS and COS (e.g., sensitive access to 1000-1200 Å). Its microshutter array can also create a long slit, which is essential for spatially separating the stellar Lyman alpha emission from the bright geocoronal Lyman alpha emission, and the sensitivity should be great enough to measure continuum emission.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.11.1">Introduction</head><p>The planetary effective surface temperature alone is insufficient to accurately interpret biosignature gases when they are observed with LUVOIR, particularly for planets orbiting low-mass stars (K and M dwarfs). The UV stellar spectrum drives and regulates the upper atmospheric heating and chemistry on Earth-like planets, and it is critical to the definition and interpretation of oxygen species and other biosignature gases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Seager et al. 2013</ref>). As discussed in Chapter 3, the specifics of the stellar spectrum may produce false-positives in our search for biologic activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b496">Tian et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Harman et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>

H 2 O, CH 4 , and CO 2 are sensitive to far-UV radiation (FUV; 100-175 nm), while the atmospheric oxygen chemistry is driven by a combination of FUV and near-UV (NUV; 175-320 nm) radiation ( <ref type="figure">Figure 13.17)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.17.1">Introduction</head><p>Stars grow by accreting matter from their surrounding protoplanetary disk, which requires the efficient redistribution of angular momentum-a process still highly uncertain.</p><p>Simulations of disks with non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics suggest a magnetically driven disk wind may extract angular momentum from the disk, thereby leading to accretion (see <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>.28 below and reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b526">Hartmann et al. 2016 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b523">Bai &amp; Stone 2013</ref>). The accretion onto the star is readily observed (e.g., Balmer jump, H-alpha emission), but observational constraints on the physics of mass transport, with implications for planet growth and migration as well as the dispersal of the natal envelope, need new instrumentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.17.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>By the time of LUVOIR, sophisticated simulations of protoplanetary disks will exist, which will require observational tests of angular momentum transport from the mass loss rates and wind velocities in the inner AU around the central star. Current observations of disk winds are limited to unresolved line emission or line-of-sight absorption, with large uncertainties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b525">Edwards et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b527">Rigliaco et al. 2013</ref>). Similar observational challenges limit the interpretation of possible jet rotation signatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b522">Bacciotti et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b524">, Coffey et al. 2012</ref>) and jet collimation shocks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b528">Schneider et al. 2013</ref>). Currently, the major instrumental limitations are a lack of spatial resolution compared with insufficient sensitivity, e.g., the FUV emission lines require several orbits with HST for a single long-slit spectrum and several slit positions are required to sufficiently sample the spatial structure of the jet. LUVOIR will overcome these issues and is needed even in the era of ALMA, JWST or 30-m telescopes as none of these are capable of imaging disk  different flow components using the microshutter array. Roughly speaking, the flow velocity close to the jet base relates to the lunching radius. Sampling the collimation properties in several velocity channels in the range from &lt;10 km/s up to several 100 km/s will be critical for this. With expected rotation signatures in the km/s range at scales of 0.1 arcsec (nearby SF region), LUMOS is ideally suited to perform high S/N, high spectral resolution (R&gt;10,000) observations. Also, the region of interest, a few 100 AU translating to an apparent size of a few arcsec for the nearby star formation regions, is ideally matched to LUMOS.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>

These asteroids display activity in the form of particle loss at rates ranging from 10 -2 to 4 kg/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b538">(Jewitt, et al. 2015</ref>). For the currently known active asteroids, several driver processes have been identified, including solar radiation sweeping of particles, electrostatic effects, ice sublimation, and thermal disintegration of surface regolith. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to the activity on these bodies will have implications on both our understanding of the origins of the Solar System and the future of space exploration, and in particular planetary defense and mitigation. The activity of these targets can last from weeks to months. In some cases it has led to the disappearance of the target after a complete break-up, while in others the activity has been observed recurrently (see <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>.33). For the cases of a total break up, observation of the fragments is crucial and has to happen soon after the discovery. Using HST limits to the size of fragments has been placed to Hv~23.5 and a size of ~35 m ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b541">Moreno et al. 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.19.3">The science program</head><p>Size/Shape/Ring detection and characterization: This program requires high spatial and angular resolution for direct observations of rings and an observing mode allowing multiple visits or a chain of observations in order to cover a whole rotation for the shape studies (HDI). The superb angular resolution provided by LUVOIR in the UVIS mode (where there happens to be the best balance between collected light and spatial resolution) of 2.73 mas per pixel will allow detection of the ring system of Chariklo with a spread of 25 pixels (its major projected axis). See <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>.30 for the size of the ring systems in comparison with dwarf-planet Pluto.</p><p>Surface Composition: For this purpose of compositional studies we could use LUMOS and HDI. We would need low and medium spectroscopy (&lt;30000) of small bodies. According to the LUMOS-ETC provided by STScI we can obtain S/N &gt; 10 in 1 h for all targets with AB mag &lt; 22. Regular detailed observations on some targets are desirable as this may mean rotational coverage, i.e., multiple visits with time constrain.</p><p>Using the HDI we could characterize almost all known Centaurs and transNeptunian objects, which are typically fainter and more difficult to characterize (as listed in the Minor Planets Center). Using HDI ETC we find we could get spectrophotometry with high S/N in about 1 hr. of exposure per filter. Survey mode will be highly desirable.</p><p>Solar System science would extraordinarily benefit from Large Programs (to systematically collect VNIR data from targets in particular populations not reachable with other telescopes) and Fillers (to increase the knowledge on a population without any special requirement in the number of targets observed) in VNIR but also in the UV, where no data exist up to date and even a small number of targets would provide groundbreaking information.</p><p>Binary detections and characterization: This program requires HDI spectro-photometry. The minimum angular distance in TNO binaries observed in <ref type="bibr">Benecchi et al. 2009</ref> is comparable to the angular size of Chariklo's ring system (which we have showed if would have an excellent coverage by LUVOIR). Using the UVIS mode, we could easily observe binary systems with half that angular size and study the properties of tight binary systems. Observations should be carried out as large programs, with multiple visits to determine orbits.</p><p>Activity (comets and active asteroids): Exceptional imaging capabilities would allow detection of the tiniest fragments.

The remote characterization of habitability for planets detected in reflected light will require either (1) information about the near-surface atmospheric state for a confirmed terrestrial world, or (2) the direct detection of surface liquid water via ocean glint and/or polarization measurements. This brief report explores what telescope and instrument requirements would be required to make either of these two observations.</p><p>Surface liquid water stability depends on both temperature and pressure from the overlying atmosphere. Unfortunately, we know of no studies that investigate how well atmospheric pressure and temperature can be constrained from visible and near-infrared spectral observations of terrestrial planetsmore work here is clearly required. A Rayleigh scattering slope, or detection of dimer or pressure-induced absorption features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b550">Misra et al. 2014b</ref>), could indicate pressure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.21.1">Introduction</head><p>All solid objects in the Solar System undergo regular variations due to internal and external forces. However, we know now that these variations can cause measurable changes to the surface and exosphere of small, airless, bodies. The large moons of Jupiter and Saturn, for example, experience tidal heating that can trigger geysers or possibly volcanic eruptions. However, in order to measure these events requires nearly constant monitoring of an object over multiple hours or even days, so that the full range of variation in surface properties (surface temperature changes, albedo and/or compositional changes) can be measured. Spectral measurements of the erupted material (either volcanic or via geyser, see <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>.36) and comparison to the surface will provide important constraints on compositional variations of the source regions of these moons. Additionally, watching an entire eruption and being able to characterize any compositional changes that occur will provide insights into the mechanism by which these eruptions occur.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.22.1">Introduction</head><p>Studying transiting planets is highly complementary to studies of directly imaged planets: (1) we can readily measure the mass and radius of transiting planets, linking atmospheric properties to bulk composition and formation, (2) many transiting planets are strongly irradiated resulting in novel atmospheric physics, and (3) the most common temperate terrestrial planets orbit close to red dwarf stars (M-dwarfs) and are difficult to image directly, but are comparatively likely to transit at high signal to noise. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will discover transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars and should discover a small number of temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Furthermore, ground-based surveys of very-late M-dwarfs and sub-stellar primaries may yield additional targets-in fact, one of the best Earth-sized HZ targets to date is TRAPPIST-1e ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b554">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>). Follow-up of these discoveries should provide the first opportunity to place constraints on the atmospheres and habitability of temperate terrestrial planets. JWST will be a fantastic platform for examining larger and brighter planets, resulting in a revolution in our understanding of hot planets orbiting close to their parent stars. However, characterizing the smaller, cooler worlds will be incredibly time-intensive: JWST will need months of integration time to provide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere. The amplitude of spectral features for a temperate terrestrial planet transiting in front of a nearby M-dwarf is comparable to the single-transit photoncounting precision with JWST; therefore, in the absence of a systematic noise floor, 100 transits of such a planet could yield 10-s detections of greenhouse gases-and this neglects the effects of cloud opacity in damping the signal of spectral absorption ( <ref type="bibr">Cowan et al. 2014</ref>). Spending a total of one month of JWST time to characterize the atmosphere of a potentially habitable world is compelling, but the observations would have to be spread out over nearly a decade for a planet in a month-long orbit (this scheduling problem is somewhat alleviated for planets in the habitable zones of later M-dwarfs and sub-stellar companions, which have shorter orbital periods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.22.2">The role of LUVOIR</head><p>JWST will most likely make important inroads into the exploration of temperate Earth-sized planets around M-dwarfs, but it is entirely possible that little will be known about the atmospheres of these planets by the time JWST ends its mission-and further (and deeper) study will be left for a future flagship mission with equal or greater photongathering power.</p><p>LUVOIR will be a capable successor to JWST in this regard. LUVOIR Architecture A will have a collecting area 178 m 2 , a factor of 7x larger than JWST, and observations will reach the same SNR with 2.7x less integration time. The primary instrument for transit spectroscopy with LUVOIR will be the High Definition Imager (HDI), due to the broad simultaneous wavelength coverage (200 nm-2.5 µm) and the ability to spatially scan the spectra of bright stars across the large focal plane detectors. HDI will have sets of grisms and will operate similarly to the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument currently on HST. It will have the capability of full-throughput observations in either short (200-900 nm) or long (800 nm-2.5 µm) wavelength channels, or simultaneous observations with both bands but at half the throughput. Spectral resolution will be R~500, enabling full characterization of spectral bands of molecular as well as atomic species. LUVOIR will improve on JWST measurements between 0.8 and 2.5 mm, a band which covers molecular features of H 2 O and CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and therefore provides constraints on the water vapor content and oxidation state of the atmosphere. At shorter wavelengths (0.2-0.8 mm), LUVOIR's capabilities will be unique. In particular, measurements of </p></div>

(2015)</ref> modeled the yield of planets discovered by the TESS mission, determining that the mission would discover between 2 and 7 temperate Earth-sized planets orbiting M-dwarfs with K &lt; 9. These stellar hosts will be larger than TRAPPIST-1, but will also be brighter, and may therefore provide a similar SNR with the same amount of observing time. Another consideration for LUVOIR mirrors is the degree of optical figure actuation that will be needed to meet stringent wavefront performance goals. ULE ® mirrors can be equipped with mechanical actuators, to permit a certain degree of correctability. It remains to be shown how this will impact the thermal stability of the segment subsystem, however.</p><p>Other approaches are possible, with substrates with high thermal controllability and very precise thermal sensing and control, allowing use of stronger materials such as SiC and operation at a wider range of temperatures. SiC mirrors have been demonstrated with high levels of correctability by incorporating electrostrictive or piezoelectric actuators into the substrate structure. This gives SiC active mirrors the ability to operate at the required optical performance level both at 1-g and 0-g. It provides correctability for wavefront errors that can easily arise (and have often arisen in the past) during fabrication, test, assembly or launch. SiC mirrors have lower passive thermal stability at room temperature, but higher thermal controllability than ULE ® . SiC at room temperature is a viable approach for LUVOIR mirrors provided that very precise thermal controls (&lt;&lt; 0.1 mK) are used. If temperatures below 150 K are desired, SiC stability improves to be better than conventional ULE ® .</p><p>While additional details on mirror CTE and stability are controlled by International Trafficking and Arms Regulations (ITAR), the key point is that a ULE ® -based, roomtemperature approach appears to be feasible, while offering the least departure from traditional practice. While ULE ® and Zerodur ® can be tailored to cryogenic temperatures, picometer stability performance has not been assessed. At a minimum, going away from room temperature would risk the best possible stability performance that has been demonstrated and that builds on a large database and history including heritage back to the TPF-C design. While it is true other materials like SiC could have advantages for optical control, thermal control, mass efficiency, or dynamics stability, the need for these advantages is yet to be determined.</p><p>Other materials like SiC, silicon, and beryllium have high CTE at room temperature but are thermally conductive and may offer stable solutions at colder temperatures (e.g., at 150 K). While these solutions could offer stable solutions at cryogenic temperatures, more work would need to be done with substrate CTE measurements and modeling equivalent to the Eisenhower analysis. Note that while some mirror manufacturers will consider thermal conductivity when assessing stability, the LUVOIR architecture is not driven by thermal conductivity but rather is driven primarily by CTE performance and thermal inertia.</p><p>UV and high contrast systems require very tight controls on both mid-frequency wavefront and surface roughness errors. To</p><note type="other">LUVOIR The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor D-6</note><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report this end, glass mirrors like ULE ® , Fused Silica, and Zerodur ® have been used on most UV and EUV telescopes including Hubble and Fuse. Polishing of Si-clad or chemical-vapor deposition (CVD)-clad SiC can also achieve good surface roughness, although CVD SiC is harder to polish. Another solution for SiC is to embed actuators for higher control authority. Take-home Message: The mirror materials for ultra-precise mirror stability with the best demonstrated performance and highest heritage are ULE ® and Zerodur ® , but both of these materials are designed to operate at or close to room temperature. Operating at a different temperature will necessitate a significant mirror technology demonstration effort.</p><p>Damping of Dynamic DisturbancesThermal damping affects dynamic stability and the change in damping is as much as 10× from room temperature to 50 K. In general, warmer is better for dynamic damping, regardless of material. Less damping would impact wavefront error and line-of-sight dynamic stability of the system. Coronagraph Instrument Technologies vs.</p><p>Temperature-To achieve longer wavelength performance for coronagraphy, not only does the telescope need to be cold, so does the entire coronagraph instrument, including the deformable mirrors, Lyot stops, occulting mask, and optical train. All of these coronagraph technologies have an extensive technological history for picometer stability and high contrast at room temperature. While some actuators can work at colder temperatures, a whole technology development program would be needed including the picometer stability performance of such systems at colder temperatures. This essentially would restart the coronagraph technology effort and would prevent using WFIRST heritage directly. Of course, this is only applicable for coronagraphic measurements, and would not apply to other infrared instruments.</p><p>Cryo/Cold Figuring and Polishing Complexity-The wavefront budget for LUVOIR is tight for a 500 nm diffractionlimited wavefront performance. A single primary mirror segment needs to have &lt;10 nm RMS wavefront (5 nm RMS surface), which is roughly 4× better than what was done on JWST. This includes gravity backout and metrology uncertainties and is already considered a very challenging requirement at room temperature (gravity effects and the need to match radius of curvature are the dominating terms). Due to CTE effects, mirrors distort as they go cold by many nanometers. Cold optics will need to be tested at temperature and go through a cryo-figuring/cryo-polishing iteration, adding metrology uncertainty, and requiring more time. A single cryogenic test for a JWST mirror would take anywhere from 3-6 months when all of the logistics and pre-and post-integration and testing are considered. Testing many segments could add many years to the critical path of the telescope.</p><p>Material Stress and Strength Properties -Any material mismatch (mirror to mounts, mounts to flexures, etc.) will have temperature-induced stresses. This can impact strength margins and every material mismatch will need to be analyzed and likely tested at temperature via pull tests. Also, other material properties like stiffness can vary with temperature and material testing may be needed. These issues required complex flexures to be included on JWST that required a significant amount of time and testing in the design phase and additional time in the production phase. Just the additional time to design the very complex flexures for JWST likely added more than a year to the design phase of the mirror segments. able to align the system at room temperature and know that it will still be aligned at operating temperature. Otherwise accurate models will be needed to predict alignment changes at temperature. Those models must be verified with tests at temperature. Alternatively, cryo-actuators can be used to compensate for misalignments, as was done on JWST segments. This will introduce additional requirements and complexities. Operating at or near room temperature (as cold as 260 K where alignment shifts are small) would allow for alignment and even some optical testing in a cleanroom environment, which is much more efficient and lower cost. Epoxy and Bonds-Acrylics used to hold multi-layer insulation (MLI) and epoxies used to bond interfaces have glass transition temperatures that can impact their strength or cause other problems like contamination release. These transition temperatures are typically in the 240-220 K range. To deal with this, cryo-strength and contamination testing is needed. In addition, every epoxy bond and joint will not only need to be analyzed for room temperature launch loads, but also for cryo-strength margins. Likely this means considerable testing for cryo-material strength at the proposed temperature, which was a cause of cost and complexity on JWST.</p><p>Heater Power and Thermal Management-The biggest engineering advantage for cold operation of the telescope is reducing the required heater power. A well-insulated mirror would need about 20-30 Watts to maintain room temperature at a Sun-Earth L2 orbit. Total power just for the mirrors on a 12-meter telescope will be approximately 1.5 kW and the backplane could require as much or more, though efficient use of insulation can help reduce the total power requirement. While this is a large power requirement, it is within engineering capabilities. In addition, strides are being made in solar array efficiency and it may be that the mass and cost of the arrays in this timeframe are no larger than other large observatories.</p><p>Shock-At cold temperatures, shock is not absorbed as well. For JWST, shock has played a key role in driving the launch restraint mechanism selection and drove extensive cryo-shock testing. Leveraging this experience from JWST, the impact of the issue could be reduced but will still be a complexity driver depending on how cold an operating temperature is chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.1.3.2">Less significant factors</head><p>Composite Stability and ComplexityFor totally passive systems, backplane CTE for stability is a similar issue to that for mirrors. However, one not only needs to consider stability but also cryo-stress and cryo-distortion of the backplane itself. On JWST, cryogenic temperatures drove the backplane schedule in a large way. Every joint type and bond had to be assessed for cool-down stresses (in addition to launch loads). Both stability and thermal distortion had to be modeled in the design and then verified through cryogenic testing. The CTE of every tube needed to be measured and statistical studies done to assess backplane stability. A whole technology was needed to develop the 50 K-stable backplane material. There is a huge database of experience with room temperature composites. Going cold, especially to a temperature that is not 50 K, could require extensive material testing and possibly even new laminate design.</p><p>One way to mitigate backplane stability (and stability only) is to use edge sensors or laser metrology in a loop with a segmented DM to mitigate segment jitter. Segment motions due to thermal changes can be controlled with feedback to segment actuators. If a metrology solution is developed, thermal stability will prove less</p></div>

The likely edge sensor technologies also have a room temperature heritage (capacitive and laser metrology technologies) so going cold might complicate this problem. Environmental Cryo/Thermal Testing-Everything will need to be tested at its nominal operating temperature, which for cryogenic systems will take extra time and add complexity. This includes thermal balance testing and verification of all electrical connections where impedances and phase vary with temperature.</p><p>System Optical Testing and Verification-It is important to test an optical system at operating temperature in order to verify system wavefront error, alignment, wavefront sensing and control, and other optical performance metrics. If the telescope is significantly colder than room temperature, then room temperature optical testing will likely not be sufficient. The system testing of JWST was a major cost and complexity driver and just cooling down and warming up can take months and require costs to plan and practice.</p><p>Use of Lubricants-At colder temperatures, typical warm lubricants will need to be replaced. This can also mean mechanism bearings may need to be redesigned. While cryo-lubricants do exist, cryo-actuators are more complex and generally more expensive.</p></div>

We prevent this by constraining feature sizes directly in the optimization. Linear optimizations provide globally optimal solutions for their constraints, so in practice we iterate on the scientific and engineering parameters and rerun linear optimizations until an apodization function consistent with the science case is produced. Once a promising apodization is identified, it is propagated through the target telescope to the focal plane using a propagator that runs on the exact locus of edge points, rather than the azimuthally symmetric approximation used for the optimization. Final evaluation of the starshade performance is done in the focal plane.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.2.1">Overview</head><p>There are a variety of science cases that would be enhanced or enabled by an Optical/NearInfrared Spectrograph (ONIRS) with different capabilities than are already offered within the ECLIPS and HDI instruments. Some of those capabilities are:</p><p>1. Optical spectroscopy at resolutions greater than R~140 (ECLIPS IFS) or R~600 (HDI grism).</p><p>2. NIR spectroscopy at resolutions greater than R~70 (ECLIPS IFS), R~200 (ECLIPS point-source spectroscopy), or R~600 (HDI grism).</p><p>3. NIR bandpass longer than 2.0 mm (ECLIPS) or 2.5 mm (HDI), for use on bright targets where the telescope thermal background does not limit performance.</p><p>These additional capabilities would enhance a wide range of scientific investigations, including probes of the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies, studies of the dynamics and composition of the circumgalactic medium, and measurements of black hole dynamical masses. Closer to home, ONIRS would also improve our understanding of star formation and the initial mass function, protostellar outflows and jets, winds from protoplanetary disks, the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, and the surfaces of solar system bodies. Very high spectral resolution in the optical/NIR could also enable exoplanet mass measurements via the radial velocity technique.</p><p>These observing capabilities could be achieved in multiple ways, and likely are not all compatible with a single instrument. For example, solar system surface studies will demand spatially resolved spectroscopy, while the ultra-high spectral resolution (R~10 5 ) and stable wavelength calibration needed for radial velocity work are more easily achieved with a fiber-fed pointsource spectrograph. High resolution optical spectroscopy (Capability #1) could likely be added to the LUMOS instrument, a design option we will be considering in the coming months. An instrument concept that has Capability #3 appears in Section 17.3.</p><p>The LUVOIR STDT considered ONIRS for a first-generation instrument study. However, the STDT chose to defer detailed study of ONIRS, due to the limited number of instrument bays, some uncertainty about the performance of optical/NIR instruments planned for the future ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), and time/resource constraints within the present mission concept study.</p></div>

Particular enhancements in exoplanet transit spectroscopy could be achieved by extending the bandpass for low-resolution point-source spectroscopy beyond ~2 mm. A much fuller discussion of this science case appears in Section 17.3.</p><p>New high-dispersion spectroscopy methods are being used to probe exoplanet atmospheres with ground-based telescopes. This technique employs R~100,000 spectroscopy to resolve the individual lines within molecular absorption bands and cross-correlates many spectra taken over the orbital period of the planet against a highly accurate molecular absorption template. The technique is well-suited to measuring the spin of giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b599">Snellen et al. 2014</ref>) and detecting molecules in non-transiting giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Birkby et al. 2017</ref>). Coupled with a high-contrast instrument, it may allow detection of molecules in the atmospheres of Earth-size planets around M dwarf stars at relaxed contrast levels (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b600">Snellen et al. 2015</ref>). Such high-dispersion + high-contrast instruments are under consideration for the future ground-based ELTs. However, there is some uncertainty about the optimal spectral resolution for using this technique on a space-based platform and the limits of its performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b601">Wang et al. 2017</ref>). Furthermore, it is not clear how to obtain absolute molecular abundances with this technique, as the planet's continuum flux level is not measured, and systematic uncertainties and degeneracies have not been thoroughly studied. With experience gained from employing this technique on the ELTs, its value on a space-based platform will become clearer and may lead to a desire for a second-generation LUVOIR instrument.</p><p>Composition of solar system bodies. Important spectral features for characterization of solar system atmospheres and surfaces lie at wavelengths longward of ~2 mm, for example, N 2 ices at 2.15 mm and organics like ethane (C 2 H 6 ) at 3.4 mm. Such observations will demand spatially resolved spectroscopy, either with an IFS or a linear-variable filter camera. An example of the latter is the Ralph instrument on the New Horizons spacecraft. As many solar system bodies are bright, it may be possible to usefully observe them beyond ~2 mm even in the presence of the thermal background from a warm telescope like LUVOIR. Furthermore, a large space-based telescope like LUVOIR will provide unprecedented spatial resolution for such observations, as extreme adaptive optics systems on the ELTs may struggle to provide high spatial resolution over large fields of view.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.1">Introduction</head><p>The rationale for operating LUVOIR out to at least 5 mm may be summarized as follows.</p><p>One can be confident that, whenever LUVOIR launches, the study of exoplanet atmospheres will be an exciting and crucial scientific discipline. Numerous molecular species likely to be important probes of exoplanet atmospheres have bands in the infrared beyond ~2 mm including H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , NH 3 , and O 3 . Many of these same species are abundant in the Earth's atmosphere and are difficult to access from the ground but are easily studied by a space telescope such as LUVOIR. In addition, recent developments suggest that atmospheric hazes or clouds may be common in exoplanet atmospheres and that they can interfere with our ability to determine molecular abundances using optical and near-infrared measurements only (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b608">Sing et al. 2016)</ref>. Observations further into the infrared have the potential to improve constraints on molecular abundances by either punching through the haze or better defining its properties and extent. As a general principle, the study of exoplanet atmospheres will benefit greatly from inclusion of the widest range of molecules over the widest wavelength range. LUVOIR's infrared capabilities would inform our overall understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and, in ways which may be difficult to foresee at present, support our quest to identify habitable or potentially habitable planets through atmospheric studies. Of course, an infrared-capable LUVOIR could also carry out exciting studies of targets other than exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.2">Use of a warm telescope for infrared exoplanet studies from space</head><p>Sensitivity is not the only rationale for an infrared space telescope. Here we consider instead the benefits of a 273-300K space telescope, in comparison to a comparable-or even larger-sized telescope at a mountaintop observatory. For present purposes, these benefits come in four categories: Access to the entire infrared spectrum. From outside the Earth's atmosphere, we can access the entire infrared spectrum and all infrared-active molecular species. This may include important species with critical diagnostic features longward of 5 mm, as well as the prominent species with spectral features in the 2-5 mm band discussed here.</p><p>Clear skies and long observations. Many exoplanet observations-for example, transits, eclipses, and phase curves-will be of long duration and have timing constraints.

Achieving such photometric precision on a large, warm telescope in space would certainly be easier than on a similar telescope on the ground, looking through the warm and turbulent atmosphere. Sensitivity. A large space telescope should achieve higher sensitivity than a comparably sized telescope on the ground because of the absence of atmospheric absorption and emission and the routine achievement of diffraction-limited performance.</p><p>The scientific, technical, and functional considerations outlined above motivated us to explore extending the wavelength range of LUVOIR to 5 mm, without imposing a constraint on the telescope temperature, but by adding an instrument. We begin by exploring the scientific benefits of this extended wavelength coverage. We also present a strawman design for an infrared spectrometer, covering the 1-5 mm wavelength range with resolving power R = 200, which could execute the science described below with minimal system impact. The 5-micron cutoff reflects current detector technology. A more thorough study should explore longer wavelengths, noting, for example, that the 5-8 mm spectral interval is largely inaccessible from the ground. It could also include exploration of eclipse spectroscopy; here we consider only transit spectroscopy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.3.1">Telescope size can trump background noise</head><p>Transit spectroscopy thrives on observations of the brightest stars, for which the main noise source, even with a warm telescope, can be the photon noise of the star itself. For these observations of bright stars there is nothing gained, in principle, by cooling the telescope. In <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>.5, we consider the time taken (or inverse sensitivity) for three telescope configurations to detect a similar small (10 ppm at R=200) and narrow feature at 4 mm, as a function of the stellar magnitude at that wavelength. The configurations are two versions of LUVOIR and JWST (6.5-  <ref type="bibr">W16]</ref> and JWST. LUVOIR is more sensitive than JWST for bright host stars, with the 12-m LUVOIR telescope taking ~4× less time to make the same observation, as is to be expected in the stellar photon limited case. For the LUVOIR configurations, a total photon throughput of 0.35 and a (single mode) background with emissivity 0.2 is assumed; these parameters are commensurate with those of the instrument described below. For JWST, the actual expected performance of the NIRCAM grism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b604">Greene et al. 2007</ref>) is adopted. The specific example adopted here is quite stressing in terms of photometric precision requirement, but the gain of the warm telescope would be preserved in less demanding observations as well.</p><p>The Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LUVOIR</head><p>The LUVOIR Interim Report E-11 m, cryogenic telescope). LUVOIR is more sensitive than JWST for bright host stars, with the 12-m LUVOIR telescope taking ~4× less time to make the same observation for stars brighter than [L]~9, as is to be expected in the stellar photon limited case. The 15-m LUVOIR would be about 40% faster than the 12-m version. For transit spectroscopy, a large warm telescope becomes more powerful than a smaller but cooler one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.3.2">There will be targets</head><p>Exoplanet direct imaging is a major driver of the LUVOIR concept, which includes coronagraphy to obtain direct images and low-resolution spectra of exoplanets. The infrared functionality discussed here would provide a powerful complement to this direct imaging work through the use of combined light studies, greatly increasing the scope and wavelength coverage of LUVOIR exoplanet studies. Observations of transiting exoplanets with LUVOIR can yield an enormous scientific return due to the combination of a large aperture and thousands or tens of thousands of targets, each presenting a different scientific puzzle.</p><p>In addition to Kepler, K2, and TESS [scheduled for launch in 2018], the PLATO mission, to be launched by ESA in 2028 for a six+ year mission, will yield planets for study by LUVOIR. Based on information provided by David Brown of the PLATO team, PLATO should find over 3400 transiting planets around stars brighter than 11th magnitude in the visible. The predicted S/N per hour vs. planet size for the some of the most readily studied exoplanets which PLATO might discover is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>.6. We take S/N &gt; 100 as our target, because only a portion of the total transit signal is contributed by the atmosphere. This is readily achieved in a single transit for Jovian planets with R~10 R Earth . A handful of smaller planets will orbit stars of ~5th mag, and their spectra can be readily obtained. Coadding transits will reach still smaller planets. The 5th magnitude star can be observed with LUVOIR and the R=200 spectrometer described below without saturating the detectors, provided that frame rates faster than 1 Hz are achievable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.3.3.3">Abundance constraints: an example</head><p>A critical performance metric for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres via spectroscopy is the degree of constraint the measurements provide on the abundance, also termed the atmospheric mixing ratio. W16 evaluated the effects of the LUVOIR wavelength range on the constraints that LUVOIR transit spectroscopy might provide. We note a recent paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b605">Greene et al. (2016)</ref>, which, for the specific case of JWST, shows the importance of observations longward of 2.5 mm for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. As an illustrative example, W16 considered the case of a 2.6 R Earth , 6.1 M Earth transitional super-Earth/sub-Neptune planet with a 600 K atmosphere orbiting a K star, assuming solar metallicity, thermal equilibrium chemistry, <ref type="figure">Figure 17</ref>.6. Signal/noise on the transit depth for each resolution element in one hour for planetary transits at 4 mm. A 9.2-m, 293 K telescope and the R=200 fiber-fed spectrograph described below were adopted for the calculation.</p></div>			</div>
