				<p>A question driving many studies is whether the thousands of exoplanets known today typically formed where we observe them or formed further out in the disk and migrated in. Early discoveries of giant exoplanets orbiting near their host stars and exoplanets in or near mean motion resonances were interpreted as evidence for migration and its crucial role in the beginnings of planetary systems. long-scale migration has been invoked to explain systems of planets in mean motion resonant chains consisting of three or more planets linked by integer period ratios. However, recent studies have reproduced specific resonant chains in systems via short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping has been shown to capture planets into resonant chains. We investigate whether the observed resonant chains in Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60, and TRAPPIST-1 can be established through long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and/or only eccentricity damping by running suites of N-body simulations. We find that, for each system, all three mechanisms are able to reproduce the observed resonant chains. long-scale migration is not the only plausible explanation for resonant chains in these systems, and resonant chains are potentially compatible with in situ formation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>An open question is whether the thousands of exoplanets detected to date formed where we observe them today or whether migration has altered their orbital properties. Early discoveries of giant exoplanets orbiting near their host stars (e.g., 51 Peg b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref> and exoplanets in/near mean motion resonances (e.g., GJ 876 b/c, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marcy et al. 2001</ref>) were interpreted as evidence for gas disk migration and its crucial role in the beginnings of planetary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lin et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref>. Migration is considered a robust physical process as any asymmetry in disk conditions inside vs. outside the planet's orbit will result in a net torque that drives migration.</p><p>Given the theoretical robustness of gas disk migration and its invoked effect on a few observed systems, many studies predicting the properties of planets have assumed that migration is key in establishing the orbits, compositions, and occurrence rates of planets within a few AU of their star (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ida &amp; Lin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mordasini et al. 2009</ref>; Rein 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cossou et al. 2014</ref>). However, even though gas disk migration is able to explain the origin of individual systems and has been assumed to be important in establishing the properties of the observed planetary population, recent observational and theoretical studies have called into question the prevalence of planet gas disk migration. New studies have found that close-in planets might have formed in situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Batygin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee &amp; Chiang 2017)</ref>, and others have shown that properties of the Kepler population (e.g., spacings, mass, compositions) can be reproduced without in- voking migration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hansen &amp; Murray 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dawson et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dawson et al. , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">Moriarty &amp; Ballard 2016, MacDonald &amp; Dawson, in prep.)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, migration is expected to drive planets into orbital resonance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Malhotra 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Melita &amp; Woolfson 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Terquem &amp; Papaloizou 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang &amp; Ji 2014)</ref>), but most systems discovered by Kepler are not in or near orbital resonances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Veras &amp; Ford 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Migration has been invoked to explain systems of bodies in mean motion resonant (MMR) chains, most recently for exoplanet systems for which the observations constrain resonant angles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mills et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">MacDonald et al. 2016</ref>). Several of these systems feature resonant chains, which consist of three or more planets in a system linked by integer period ratios. For example, Jupiter's large moons Io, Ganymede, and Europa have orbital period ratios of 1:2:4, a configuration thought to have originated during the satellites circumplanetary disk-driven  or tidal <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yoder 1979</ref>) migration. Some resonant chains consist of a series of twobody mean motion resonances, with each resonant angle involving orbital angles of two planets. Two-body resonant angles take the form Θ b−c = j 1 λ b + j 2 λ c + j 3 ω b + j 4 ω c + j 5 Ω b + j 6 Ω c , <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> where b and c refer to two planets, λ is the mean longitude, ω is the longitude of periapse, Ω is the longitude of ascending node, and the j coefficients must sum to zero. Some resonant chains instead or additionally feature three-body MMR, with resonant angles involving orbital angles of three planets. Three-body resonant angles take the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">φ = pλ 1 − (p + q)λ 2 + qλ 3 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ i is the mean longitude of the ith body and p and q are integers. The commensurability in periods creates a repeating geometrical configuration of three-planets. Eqn. 2 is for zeroth-order three-body resonances, which are by far the strongest in the case of small eccentricities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gallardo et al. 2016</ref>). When dynamical interactions cause the resonant angle φ to librate, we consider this commensurability to be a three-body resonance. Certain combinations of librating two-body angles guarantee libration of a three-body angle. A system might instead have libration of multiple two-body resonant angles without libration of three-body resonant angles. We investigate both types of resonant chain configurations as well as three-body resonances without two-body resonances.</p><p>Resonant chains are often considered hallmarks of planetary migration. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mills et al. (2016)</ref> argued that the architecture of Kepler-223 requires gas disk migration. In their proof of concept migration simulations, the planets start beyond 1 AU and migrate to ∼ 0.1 AU star separations. However, other studies have shown that capture into resonant chains can sometimes occur without this long-scale migration. In simulations in which the planets' periods decrease by only a few percent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">MacDonald et al. (2016)</ref> captured the Kepler-80 planets into their resonant chain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong &amp; Dawson (2016)</ref> found that systems of giant planets can be captured into resonant chains without migration in simulations that included only eccentricity damping.</p><p>In this work, we assess the necessity of migration in known resonant chain systems. We investigate whether the known or suspected resonant chains in <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60</ref>, and TRAPPIST-1 can be established through this long-scale migration, as well as through short-scale migration and eccentricity damping. For each system, a resonant chain has been established in the literature in a simulation through one mechanism as a proof of concept, but it has not yet been studied whether any other mechanism is effective. These systems are all of the super-Earth systems with resonant chains. With these three dynamical histories (long-scale migration, short-scale migration, eccentricity damping only), we aim to assess if long-scale migration is integral to the formation of resonant chains, or if other mechanisms are plausible.</p><p>In Section 2, we describe our simulations and how the three dynamical histories are implemented. We analyze our simulations for each system in Sections 3-6. We discuss these results and conclude in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SIMULATIONS</head><p>In an attempt to reproduce the resonant chains known or suspected in <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60</ref>, and TRAPPIST-1, we simulate each system under three dynamical histories: long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping only. In long-scale migration, the planets start far beyond their present day orbits, with the inner-most planet starting at 1 AU and the other planets starting wide of their observed period ratios. In short-scale migration, the planets start just wide of their observed periods, essentially in situ, and only migrate for a short distance until they reach their observed periods and lock into the appropriate resonances.</p><p>For each system and dynamical history, we run a large number of N-body simulations with all planet-pair period ratios initialized wide of their observed commensurabilities. The masses and sky-plane inclinations were drawn from independent normal distributions based on the values reported by previous studies. The longitudes of ascending node and arguments of periapse were drawn from uniform distributions. Initial eccentricities for all planets were set to e = 0.0, except for simulations with eccentricity damping only (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). All integrations were performed using the WHFAST integrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rein &amp; Tamayo 2015</ref>) in the open-source REBOUND Nbody package <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rein &amp; Liu 2012)</ref>. We adopt a timestep of 5% of the innermost planet's observed orbital period.</p><p>We applied an inward migration force and/or eccentricity damping forces (at constant angular momentum for the latter) on timescales τ a ∼ 10 6 − 10 11 and τ e ∼ 10 4 − 10 7 , respectively, following the prescription in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Papaloizou &amp; Larwood (2000)</ref>. These timescales were drawn from independent log-uniform distributions. For migration, whether short-scale or long-scale, these forces were applied only to the outermost planet in the system 1 . In simulations that included eccentricity damping only, the damping was applied to all planets. The migration and eccentricity damping forces used as described above were applied using the modify_orbits_forces routine in the REBOUNDx library. These forces were turned off after integrating the system for 10 6 -10 8 days; the system was then integrated forward for an additional 10 7 -10 8 days to assess stability. We deemed a system unstable and stopped the simulation if any of the planets reached e &lt; 0, e ≥ 1.0, or P &lt; 0, where e and P are the planet's eccentricity and period, respectively. The parameters used for each suite of simulations, including τ a , τ e , the length of time migration forces were applied, and the total length of the simulation, are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1  and 2.</ref> For each simulation, we plot and examine by eye each associated three-body angles and two-body angles to determine whether the angle is librating. We list the number of simulated systems that survived, i.e., did not reach any of the instability criteria listed above, and the number of systems in resonance by the end of the simulation in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. A system was deemed to be in resonance if all of the two-body angles were librating and/or if all of the three-body angles were librating.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">KEPLER-60</head><p>Kepler-60 is a Sun-like star, hosting a planetary system of three transiting planets with orbital periods ranging from 7.1 to 11.9 days and planetary masses ranging from 4.1-4.5M ⊕ . The three planets were confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Steffen et al.

However, using solutions from TTV fitting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jontof-Hutter et al. (2016)</ref> found stable, non-resonant solutions in addition to resonant solutions. Prior to this study, Kepler-60 had not been simulated using any of the dynamical histories explored herein in an attempt to lock Long-scale Migration  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2016)</ref>, and all initial eccentricities for short and long-scale migration are zero.

TRAPPIST-1 TRAPPIST-1 is a late M-dwarf hosting a system of seven planets, with planetary masses between 0.09-1.6M ⊕ and orbital periods ranging from 1.5-19 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang et al. 2017</ref>). The system was discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref>. Several of the planets are in or near the habitable zone and therefore could host liquid water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref> measured the orbital period ratios for the inner six planets to be near the ratios of small integers, suggesting that the planets could be in two-body resonances of 8:5, 5:3, 3:2, 3:2, and 4:3, from b:c to g:f. Luger et al. (2017) followed up the discovery with additional data from K2 and found that the outermost planet (h) was near or in the 3:2 MMR with planet g. In the initial discovery paper and following discussions on the system's formation and evolution, it has generally been assumed that the planets needed to migrate to lock into the resonance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Luger et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamayo et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Papaloizou et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ormel et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It is difficult to measure any two-body resonances without the eccentricity vector. However, three-body resonances, since they only depend on the mean longitude and not the longitudes of periapse, can be measured. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Luger et al. (2017)</ref> measured the three-body angles in this system, concluding that all angles are librating. Ormel et al. (2017) modeled the system and simulated long-scale migration. They successfully lock the system into the observed period ratios, but note that many of the pairs got trapped in the 2:1 resonance and required faster migration or large gas densities in the disk to "skip" this 2:1 resonance and be captured into a tighter one. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamayo et al. (2017)</ref> argue that this chain could be formed through slow, convergent migration. At the end of their N-body simulations, all two-body angles associated with the period ratios and all three-body angles measured by <ref type="bibr">Luger</ref>  We simulate the inner six planets and apply longscale migration, short-scale migration, and only eccentricity damping to lock the planets into the chain of two-body resonances listed above of 3:4:6:9:15:24. For all three suites of simulations, we assume M = 0.08M ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>). We draw values for planetary masses and inclinations from normal distributions centered on values from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamayo et al. (2017)</ref>, and all initial eccentricities are zero. For the eccentricity damping simulations, all eccentricities are initialized at 0.04. All other values are chosen as described in Section 2.</p><p>We reproduce TRAPPIST-1 via long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping. Examples of resonant angles from simulations of each of the scenarios are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, and we compare the eccentricities and period ratios from the simulations with observational constraints in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 11 and 12</ref>. We plot the upper limits from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 11</ref> along with the eccentricity evolution of some of our simulations. These limits are rarely breached, except in the case of planets d and f for the long-scale migration simulations for the example shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  11</ref>. Other long-scale migrations simulations resulted in the eccentricities of all the planets being within these upper limits, but there were no simulations with all resonant angles librating that had eccentricities smaller than the upper limits 3 . Most simulations from short-scale migration and eccentricity damping result in eccentricities below the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref> upper limits.</p><p>For the simulations that survived, we analyze the centers and amplitudes of the librating three-body angles defined above. We show the resulting average centers and amplitudes as well as their uncertainties of the librating three-body angles from our simulations in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table  7</ref>. Given that only five long-scale migration simulations survived, and only four of them were locked into resonance, we do not have sufficient numbers to analyze the centers and amplitudes for this system for this dynamical Long-scale Migration 14.9</p><p>Period (d) <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.-Simulations of each dynamical history can produce the resonant configuration observed in Kepler-60.

In fact, angles φ 1 , φ 2 , and φ 4 only librate in single simulation. φ 3 librates in three simulations, all about a center ∼ 160 • with varying amplitudes. For these simulations, the two-body angles between planets b/c rarely lock into their suggested 8:5 resonance. Instead, they lock into 3:2, 9:5, and 7:4. The two-body angles between planets c/d usually lock into their 5:3 resonance, but a few simulations have the 9:5 angle librating instead. At least one simulation, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, shows the planets locking into the appropriate resonances. For short-scale migration and eccentricity damping, φ 1 librates about ∼ 165 • , φ 2 librates about ∼ 30 − 45 • , φ 3 librates about ∼ 140 • , and φ 4 librates about ∼ 180 • . Although there are a variety of similar centers, φ 1 , φ 2 , and φ 3 probably agree with previous studies, but φ 4 does not agree with the previous results of a center of -75.5 • . Although we were not able to reproduce this center measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Luger et al. (2017)</ref>, this does not necessarily mean that short-scale migration cannot reproduce the center, as the resonant centers are an artifact of initial conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamayo et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>All three dynamical histories were able to reproduce the observed resonant chain in TRAPPIST-1, eccentricities within the range estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref>, and the observed period ratios.</p><p>7. CONCLUSION Given that migration is such a robust process, many have invoked it to explain the architectures of exoplanet systems, including the formation of resonant chains in specific systems. However, exoplanets display a broad range of period ratios, with only a few planets in or near resonance, and recent studies have shown the feasibility of in situ formation of close-in planets. These two factors bring into question how large of a role migration plays in sculpting the exoplanetary population. Using numerical simulations, we investigated whether long-scale migration is required to form the resonant chains seen in <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60</ref>, and TRAPPIST-1 or if short-scale migration or eccentricity damping are plausible dynamical histories. For long-scale migration, we assume the planets form at least 1AU from their host star and we migrate the planets in to their present-day locations by applying forces that reduce the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the outermost planet. For short-scale migration, we apply the same types of forces, although over a shorter distance, to planets just outside of their observed commensurabilities. For eccentricity damping, we start the planets just outside of their present-day locations, but only damp their eccentricities. These latter two dynamical histories are consistent with in situ formation of the planets. We find that we cannot conclude for any given system that long-scale migration is required, as Long-scale Migration  <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>.-Simulations of each dynamical history can produce the resonant configuration observed in TRAPPIST-1. Panels from left to right: reproduced via long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping. Each panel shows the three-body angle φ 3 , the two-body angles associated with the three-body angle, and the planets' periods. Note that although only one of the three-body angles is shown here, as well as only two of the various two-body angles, they are all librating. Evolution timescales in days for long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping: τa = 9.3 × 10 8 , τe = 8.2 × 10 6 , τa = 3.5 × 10 7 , τe = 1.5 × 10 4 , τe = 1.1 × 10 4 .</p><p>we were able to reproduce the observed resonant chains in all three systems via all three possible histories.</p><p>The systems studied herein, as well as HR 8799 and GJ 876, are the only currently known exoplanetary systems containing confirmed resonant chains. With the launching of TESS and other future exoplanetary missions, we might soon find more resonant chains that can be studied to see if formation mechanisms other than long-scale migration are possible. The formation of these systems and their architectures remains an open problem whose solution might shed some light on the role of migration in establishing system architectures.</p><p>In principle, we can favor a dynamical history based on how often it creates resonances with the observed properties (e.g., resonant center and amplitude). However, any results drawn from these simulations are dependent on the initial conditions where the planets form. Studies have found that centers and amplitudes are sensitive to initial conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mustill &amp; Wyatt 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamayo et al. 2017)</ref>. A study in which a larger range of initial conditions are considered is warranted, but beyond this proof of concept exploring whether systems could have been put into resonance using these different dynamical histories.</p><p>Many simulations of long-scale migration resulted in the planets locking into the wrong resonance. This outcome was independent of how close the planets were initially to resonance. Locking into the wrong resonance occurred for nearly all long-scale migration simulations for the Kepler-223 d/e pair; the pair is in a 4:3 orbital resonance, and yet nearly all of our simulations locked the planets into the 3:2 resonance. In a similar way, the TRAPPIST-1 b/c pair is suggested to be in an 8:5 orbital resonance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>), yet in our simulations it locked into the 3:2 resonance as well as the 9:5 and the 7:4. These outcomes demonstrate that although long-scale migration is appealing for requiring less fine tuned initial conditions (i.e., the planets do not have to happen to form near resonance), planets can easily get trapped into the wrong resonance. This issue of trapping the planets in the incorrect resonance should be weighed against the less fine tuning in order to determine which dynamical history is more likely.</p><p>Analytic studies have shed some light on the formation of multi-body resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Snellgrove et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Papaloizou 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Delisle 2017)</ref>. However, the formation of resonant chains via eccentricity damping only from the gas disk has not, to our knowledge, been studied analytically. Once we understand analytically if there is any expected distinction between resonance capture through these mechanisms, we might be able to determine a preferred dynamical history. For example, if we were to find that a specific dynamical history always reproduces the measured libration center, we might be inclined to favor e g <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>.-Each dynamical history can produce eccentricities of TRAPPIST-1 smaller than the estimated maximum values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>).

For φ 1 , φ 2 , and φ 4 from the long-scale migration simulations, there was only one simulation in which the angle librated. Because of this, we do not include statistics from the simulations. For the three dynamical histories, the following number of simulations resulted in resonance: 11/300, 4/600, 5/300 for short-scale migration, long-scale migration, and eccentricity damping, respectively.

Such conclusions would, however, require the amplitude and center for the resonant libration to be known very well, as is the case with <ref type="bibr">Kepler-223 and Kepler-80.</ref> If we can distinguish between the two types of multibody resonances-one with two-body resonances librating and the other without the two-body librationthen we can gain further insight into the dynamical history. When a multi-body resonance is formed via planets locking into two-body MMR, one after another, the two-body angles and the multi-body angle all librate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski et al. 2016</ref>). In our simulations, we found most of the three-body angles to be of the first type where the two-body angles also librated. However, some of simulations result in the systems being in the other type of resonance, but since the results of our simulations can change depending on the initial conditions, we need to first understand analytically if there is any distinction between resonance capture in the different dynamical histories.</p><p>We thank the referee for a helpful review that improved this paper.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We do not know the migration rate or direction of migration for each planet since they depend on the conditions of the disk. By simulating only the outer planet migrating, we implicitly assume the case where the migration of the inner planets is on a much longer timescale. Future work could explore how the relative migration rates of the planets affect their final resonant configurations.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> The validation of outermost planet g occurred following the completion of this work. It is most likely part of this resonant chain, but is not modeled in this study.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> It is possible that we could find a set of initial conditions that formed the resonant chain as well as matching the eccentricities if we ran more simulations.</note>
