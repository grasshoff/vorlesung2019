			<abstract>
				<p>Rigorously quantifying the information in high contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the de-tectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the 2 Ruffio et al. point source and 2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Direct imaging is a method to spatially resolve exoplanets' light from their host star using large telescopes, adaptive optics, coronagraphs and sophisticated data processing. With ground-based telescopes, this technique currently allows the detection of young (&lt; 300 Myr), massive (&gt; 2 M Jup ), self-luminous exoplanets at host-star separations not yet probed by indirect methods (a &gt; 5 AU). Direct imaging surveys of previously-unobserved stars mostly produce non-detections (&gt; 98% of stars do not have a detectable planet with current instruments). A wide range of science can be drawn from these null results, but thinking about the definition of upper limits is important. We will discuss some of these applications in the following.</p><p>First, we consider cases in which the position of the object is known. Most detected point sources are background stars, therefore confirmation of their planetary nature requires follow-up observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Black 1980)</ref>. Several strategies can be adopted depending on the information in hand. It is common practice to use the upper limit from the non detection and/or the frequencies of the different astrophysical signals to make the case for a planet and reject the background or foreground hypothesis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nielsen et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chauvin et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wagner et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Macintosh et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meshkat et al. 2013</ref>). When a point-source has been detected in one of two spectral bands for example, the upper limit on the second band can place limits on its color and in some cases reject the possibility of it being a star. Generally, a red object or one showing significant spectral features characteristic of low-temperature atmospheres will favor lower masses and increase the likelihood of it being bound. This can be a powerful tool to prioritize follow up observations. Fomalhaut b is another interesting example of the use of upper limits in determining the nature of an object. The signal was discovered in the optical ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>) but all subsequent followup observations in the infrared yielded non detections casting doubts on its planetary nature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Currie et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Janson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Currie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marengo et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>). The lack of infrared emission suggests that the signal comes from starlight scattered by a disk surrounding a planetary body. A more formal statistical approach such as the one derived in this work could be used to set tighter limits on the mass of a self-luminous planet, or to compare different dust formation hypotheses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kenyon et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Another application of upper limits is to rule out models where an undetected planet perturbs some visible source, e.g. by clearing a gap in a circumstellar dust disk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ruane et al. (2017)</ref> used direct imaging data of the TW Hya system to constrain the masses or the accretion rates of hypothetical gap-carving planets. The mass upper limit is derived from the flux constraint using a planet formation model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Allard et al. 2012</ref>). In this case, the exact position of the planet is not known but the shape of the gap defines its orbit. A final example of the use of upper limits is combining radial velocity measurements and direct imaging observations. As time baselines keep growing and sensitivity improves, the overlap between the accessible mass and semi-major axis parameter space of the two methods keeps increasing. When a direct and a radial velocity detection is available, it can be combined to infer the dynamical masses of a binary system. Spectroscopic binary stars that are spatially resolved can be used this way to constrain the age of moving groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nielsen et al. 2016)</ref>. A direct imaging nondetection can still bring useful constraints on the mass of a bound companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Vaccaro et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hardy et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Joergens et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The use of non-detections in the derivation of exoplanet occurrence rates is also extremely important ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vigan et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Galicher et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bowler 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brandt et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nielsen &amp; Close 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>. In this context, combining radial velocity and direct imaging can also help yield better estimates of planet frequency ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lannier et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bryan et al. 2016</ref>). However, this problem is complex and outside of the scope of this work. Bayesian based occurrences are very sensitive to the accuracy of the noise model, the characterization of which remains an on-going effort for high-contrast imaging.</p><p>Planet flux upper-limits are commonly defined using a frequentist approach from a detection threshold (e.g., contrast curve), usually 5σ with σ the standard deviation of the noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nielsen et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mesa et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Macintosh et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meshkat et al. 2013</ref>). In principal, the detection threshold should be derived to set an acceptable false positive rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wahhaj et al. 2013</ref>), but in practice, is often set to the traditional 5σ limit. The upper-limit can also be thought of in terms of true positive fraction (i.e., completeness). By definition, the detection threshold corresponds to a 50% completeness. The fundamental conceptual differences between frequentist and Bayesian upper limits have been detailed in the context of gravitational waves detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Röver et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Abbott et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brady et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Finn 1998</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Finn (1998)</ref> emphasizes that Bayesian analysis makes a measure of our degree of belief in a proposition while the Frequentist analysis addresses our confidence in the ability of a procedure to decide if a signal is present or absent, making the Bayesian analysis better suited for the study of individual events. <ref type="bibr">Röver et al. (2011)</ref> notes that a frequentist upper limit requires the maximization of the likelihood while the Bayesian upper limits requires integration and also argues that the latter is more easily interpretable.</p><p>Although a detection threshold does provide a measure of the depth of the observation, i.e. its sensitivity to faint point sources, it is not a statement about the degree of belief in a given point-source flux given the data. While the detection upper limit indicates which planets would have been detected with a given completeness, a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of the planet flux given the data. A Bayesian upper limit f lim is defined from the planet flux posterior and a fixed probability of the true flux to be smaller than this value given the data, P(f &lt; f lim |d), referred to as the cutoff probability in the following. The cutoff probability is the value of the cumulative distribution of the posterior at the position of the upper limit. Note that the posterior needs be carefully defined as a function of the question that is asked to the data and the assumptions made. Using a detection threshold in all circumstances makes the interpretation of the results more difficult. The existing examples of combining radial velocity and direct imaging measurements treat the radial velocity data in a Bayesian framework while using the frequentist approach for direct imaging upper limits. Using the concepts presented here, <ref type="bibr">Mawet et al. (2018, submitted</ref> to AJ) will be a step toward treating both data types in a consistent Bayesian framework.</p><p>We will illustrate this approach for direct imaging by revisiting practical cases of non-detection. Section 2 assumes the location of the planet known and proposes to use Bayesian model comparison to decide the most probable nature of a candidate. Section 3 considers the case of a known orbit for the companion but no information on its precise location. This case is applicable to constraining the mass of an undetected accreting planet in a disk gap for example. In Section 4, we look at combining radial velocity and direct imaging measurements to constrain planet mass and orbital parameters. We conclude in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bayes' rule and upper limit</head><p>In this section, we address the simple problem of defining an upper limit for the flux of a point source at a known location. A typical example is when the planet was clearly detected in only one of two spectral bands. In the literature, quoted upper limits are often defined as the detection threshold (commonly 5σ) at the location of the object. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a typical example of a high contrast image 1 in which a simulated ≈ 10σ point source was injected North of the center star. The left most image is the result of combining the single exposures after the speckle noise was removed using a principal component based approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wang et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soummer et al. 2012</ref>). The The middle image is a flux map resulting from cross correlating a 10 pixel wide aperture (white empty circle in the left image) across the image. For each position, the sample standard deviation is computed from a 10 pixel-wide annulus at the same separation after the surroundings of the pixel of interest have been masked out (white filled circle). The rightmost image is the resulting Signal to Noise ratio (S/N) map.</p><p>simulated point source was injected in the individual 357 frames before the speckle subtraction is performed. The simplest approach to compute the flux of a point source is to use aperture photometry, which consist in integrating the flux inside an aperture with a diameter equal to the width of the point spread function (PSF) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mawet et al. 2014</ref>). Such a flux map is equivalent to the cross correlation 2 of that aperture with the image (middle panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). A more accurate flux could be estimated using a matched filter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ruffio et al. 2017</ref>) as shown in Section 3.1. For each position, the error bar σ on the flux estimate can be defined as the sample standard deviation computed from a 10 pixel-wide annulus at the same separation from the primary star after the surroundings of the pixel of interest have been masked out (white filled circle) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mawet et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marois et al. 2008)</ref>. This is the same standard deviation that is also used to defined the detection threshold as a function of separation. A Signal to Noise ratio (S/N) map is simply the flux map divided by the standard deviation at each separation (Right most image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Any signal brighter than 5σ is generally flagged as a possible candidate. The threshold can be defined such as to yield a reasonable number of false positives over a fixed field of view. In a direct imaging survey, it can be limited by the number of candidates on which follow-up observations can be performed or more generally by the follow-up strategy that maximizes the science return of the survey. Such a detection threshold is fundamentally not a statement about the parameter space that was ruled out by the data. An upper-limit is better understood in the context of Bayesian inference. One first needs to define a probability, hereafter cutoff probability, of the true planet flux to fall below the upper limit. The Bayesian upper limit is then defined as the value for which the cumulative distribution of the posterior is equal to the cutoff probability. From now on, we will make a distinction between such an upper limit and a detection threshold. For a Gaussian noise with known standard deviation σ, an unbounded uniform prior and a 97.7% cutoff probability, the upper limit is 2σ above the estimated flux (See <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. The flux can be estimated even if the planet is not formally detected as long as its position is known. In the unlucky event of a very negative noise sample (for example lower than −2σ) at the location of the planet, the estimated flux and the upper-limit could become negative. This might be unsettling as we know that a flux is strictly positive, but this will be corrected by a more informative prior, which will forbid negative values of the flux. For a given noise distribution, it is important to note that the upper-limit is a function of the data, here the estimated flux, while the detection threshold is a property of the noise. As we said, the choice of the threshold is also somewhat arbitrary, whereas a posterior is entirely defined by the properties of the noise, the data and the choice of a prior. As a consequence, using the detection threshold in place of an upper limit is not making optimal use of the data.</p><p>Let F be the true planet flux random variable and˜Fand˜ and˜F x as its estimate at the position x based on the observation. We denote random variables and random vectors with an upper case and their realization with a lower case. The posterior P(F | ˜ F x ) is the probability of the point-source flux given its estimated value from the observation. In this context, we define the data as being the flux map and following <ref type="bibr">Bayes' rule (Sivia 2006</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P(F | ˜ F x ) = P( ˜ F x |F )P(F ) P( ˜ F x ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P( ˜ F x |F ) is the likelihood, P(F ) the flux prior and P( ˜ F x ) acts as a normalization factor to ensure the posterior distribution has a unit integral. If the noise is Gaussian, the likelihood P( ˜ F x |F ) is given by the Gaussian distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P( ˜ F x = ˜ f x |F = f ) = 1 √ 2πσ exp − 1 2 (f − ˜ f x ) 2 σ 2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The term P( ˜ F x ) is also called the marginal likelihood (or model evidence) and can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P( ˜ F x ) = ∞ f =−∞ P( ˜ F x |F = f )P(F = f ) df. (3)</formula><p>The marginal likelihood is used in Bayesian model comparison. In the following, we use a simple uniform positive prior,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(F = f ) =    α, if f &gt; 0, with α constant 0, if f ≤ 0 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The uniform prior corresponds to the objective Jeffreys' prior (i.e., square root of the determinant of the Fisher information) for location parameters like the mean of a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kass &amp; Wasserman 1996)</ref>. The uniform prior is improper (i.e., its integral is infinite) but the likelihood will be very constraining for large values of the flux f so an upper bound for the prior of the companion flux will not make a significant difference. The inverse prior P(f ) ∝ 1/f is a common choice for positive real valued parameters because it is the only prior invariant by rescaling, i.e., P(f ) df = P(βf ) d(βf ). It means that the inverse prior does not favor any particular scale of the parameter, but it requires a strictly positive lower bound to produce a normalizable posterior. The problem is that the previous likelihood does not constrain null values, which means that the inverse prior will be dominating at small values of the flux. As a consequence, due to the divergence of the integral of the inverse function, the upper limit will be extremely dependent on the choice of the lower bound in the prior. For example, the upper limit would tend to zero for an infinitely small lower bound. The prior could also be derived from our current knowledge of planet population. This would suggest a log-uniform planet mass prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref> and the corresponding flux prior after a change of variable, but this would lead to the same difficulty near zero. In this context, the uniform prior remains a conservative choice for the definition of an upper limit. Indeed, a more relevant prior based on a planet population model would give more weights to lower fluxes and therefore decrease the upper limit. The uniform prior also facilitates the comparison of upper limits resulting from different works, because it does not include a user-defined parameter. Note that in the absence of a prior, the posterior is simply equal to the likelihood centered on the estimated flux.

The planet flux posterior can be defined as the two-sample t-test in which one of the samples has one element (corresponding to the location of the planet) and the other sample contains all the pixels of a region with similar noise properties but free of astrophysical signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mawet et al. 2014</ref>). The second sample is often defined as the pixels taken at the same projected separation but located one resolution element apart from each other. The goal of a two-sample t-test, with unequal sample sizes but equal variance, is to estimate the difference between the means of two samples given that the variance is unknown and must be estimated from the data itself. In this case, the differences of the means is no other that the planet flux and its posterior must be marginalized over the uncertainty of the sample means and standard deviation, which result in a Student-t distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P(F = f |D) ∝ t f N − 1 + 1 −((N −1)+1)/2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">t f = (f − ˜ f x ) 2 ( k ˜ f 2 k /(N − 1)) 1/N + 1 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where N is the number of elements without astrophysical signal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Bayesian model comparison: is it a star?</head><p>A recurring problem in direct imaging is to constrain the astrophysical nature of a candidate given a set of concurrent observations in different spectral bands. In this context, the nature of a point-like source can for example be a background star (H ), a galaxy, a brown-dwarf (background/foreground or gravitationally bound), a planet or a false positive (∅), also-known-as null hypothesis. Point-source detections are a common occurrence in direct imaging surveys due to the prevalence of background stars, which is why we would like to prioritize their follow-up observations to optimize the discovery of new planets. For the purpose of this section, we will assume that we have two broad-band observations, one of which could be a non detection. With a single detection, it is not possible to compare the astrometric measurements of the candidate to that of a background object. It is common practice to use the upper limit from the non detection and/or the frequencies of the different astrophysical signals to make the case for a planet and reject the background or foreground hypothesis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nielsen et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chauvin et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wagner et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Macintosh et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meshkat et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Deciding between alternative hypotheses, which are here the possible classes of astrophysical signal, can be done more generally using Bayesian model comparison.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only consider two stellar populations (high mass noted H ,high , low mass noted H ,low ) and the null hypothesis to illustrate the classification method. However, we would like to emphasize that this framework is in no way restricted to this example and should in practice at least include models of planets or brown-dwarfs.</p><p>The prior probability distributions of finding a background star as function of their position in a color-magnitude diagram, P(m 1 , m 1/2 |H ,high ) and P(m 1 , m 1/2 |H ,low ), can be calculated from the Besançon model of stellar populations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robin et al. 2003</ref>). We generated a galactic population model 3 within a solid angle of 0.23 deg 2 in the vicinity of p Puppis (HD 60863, l = 242.96 • , b = −3.87 • ).

The probability of the null hypothesis is defined such that P(∅) + P(H ,high ) + P(H ,low ) = 1.

In these scenarios, we vary the sensitivity of the JWST observation and the S/N of the GPI follow up assuming a clear detection (20σ) and two non detections (3σ,−1σ).

The follow-up epoch of the third candidate would be classified as a non-detection and yielded a negative flux, which means that it is entirely dominated by the noise.

The point-source parameters are its position on the projected orbit defined as the curvilinear abscissa S and its flux F . We also define N as a Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix Σ. In practice, the noise is assumed to be independent in which case Σ becomes diagonal. Data, signal and noise are related through,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">D = F m + N,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>with m = m(s) the planet model in the direct imaging data, which is effectively a function of the planet position S.

We can write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">P(S) = 1 T v proj (21)</formula><p>where T is the orbital period and v proj = v proj (s) is the projected velocity of a companion at the position s on the ellipse representing the projected orbit. v proj is constant in a face-on and circular orbit. If P(S) is a delta function, we get the example from Section 2.1. We have not yet specified the data term d for the likelihood in Equation 19. It is possible to choose the final combined image, however the planet model might be poorly known when over-and self-subtraction from the speckle subtraction applies. Instead, we directly define the likelihood from the individual speckle subtracted images, which are for example defined by their exposure number and wavelength for an integral field spectrograph. The speckles are here subtracted using a principal component analysis </p><formula xml:id="formula_26">i sub = i − Z K Z K i,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>with i the science image and i sub the speckle subtracted image. Generally, the model of the signal is a function of the speckle subtraction algorithm used. When using a KLIP framework, point sources are distorted by the speckle subtraction. Pueyo (2016) derived a linearized approximation of this distorted point spread function, which will be referred to as the forward model of the signal. Indeed, the existence of a faint point source in the data induces a perturbation on the principal components denoted ∆Z K . We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pueyo (2016)</ref> for the analytical expression of ∆Z K , which is outside the scope of this paper.

In practice, the assumptions that were just made result in a biased estimate of the flux and the standard deviation. For example, the covariance Σ is not truly diagonal. The forward model is also not a perfect model of the planet, which underestimates the flux. As a consequence, we define the algorithm throughput as the ratio between the measured flux and the true flux of a point source and we denote it µ x . A common practice to mitigate the standard deviation bias ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ruffio et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cantalloube et al. 2015</ref>), is to re-normalize the standard deviation such as to yield a S/N map with unit standard deviation (S x /η x −→ S x , with the η x the standard deviation of the S x map). The flux calibration is done with simulated planet injection and recovery ( ˜ f x /µ x −→ ˜ f x ), also known as algorithm throughput correction. Equation 27 now becomes: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> features a toy simulation of the approach assuming one hundred independent samples representing the pixel values along the orbit path, a unit standard deviation and a Dirac-like planet model (all the flux contained in one pixel).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effect of the size of the orbit</head><p>Intuitively, the upper limit is to the first order defined by the brightest signal in the data. As the number of elements increases, it becomes more likely to draw high S/N signals. Therefore, the larger the uncertainty on the location of the planet, the more realizations of the noise have to be considered and the poorer the upper limit will be. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows examples of posteriors when varying the number of samples in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> simulation and assuming pure noise data with no real signal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Qualitative effect of non-Gaussianity and correlation</head><p>We have assumed that the noise was Gaussian and un-correlated. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the histogram of the pixel values in uncombined speckle-subtracted images for three different separations. While the distribution approximate a Gaussian for the largest two separations, it has a very large tail in the inner-most case. In this section, we simulate the effects of the correlation and the non Gaussianity on the final upper limit in a simplified example. We assume a discrete orbit made of hundred elements similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, containing pure noise. In order to explore the effect of the size of the planet with respect to non Gaussian noise and non diagonal correlation matrix, we consider two models: a small Dirac-like point spread function (PSF) and a large PSF five-elements wide. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, we estimate the error made on the upper limit when we erroneously assume that the noise is Gaussian or independent. In order to do so, we compare the upper limits derived from the true properties of the noise with the upper limits derived with the assumption of Gaussian and independent noise. The non-Gaussianity is first tested using a Student-t distribution with ten degrees of freedom and normalized to unit standard deviation (top panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>), which was a good fit to the pixel distribution of the inner-most annulus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. In this context, the Student-t distribution is used for its wider tails compared to a Gaussian distribution, but not because of its relation to small sample statistics. Then, we try a correlated Gaussian noise with a circulant covariance matrix 4 (bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>). The correlation profile is defined as a Gaussian with a standard deviation equal to two elements. The upper limits are calculated in a similar fashion as for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> by replacing the likelihood from Equation 18 to include a non-diagonal covariance matrix or to use a student-t distribution. The student-t joint likelihood is computed as the product of the individual likelihood for each pixel, which is granted by the independence of the noise. Despite the simplicity of these simulations, we can draw some general principles from it. First, it is necessary to account for the non-Gaussian tail of the noise only when considering high cutoff probabilities (e.g. &gt; 0.999, which is equivalent to 3σ). It is therefore good practice to quote upper-limits derived from reasonable cutoff probabilities if the distribution of the noise is poorly known. In this crude simulation, the non-Gaussian noise is uncorrelated, which means that the effect is mitigated when the planet PSF is large. Indeed, the noise becomes more Gaussian when combining several pixels together because of the central limit theorem. In practice, the non-Gaussian noise comes from the correlated speckle noise with a correlation length equal to the PSF size, which means that a larger PSF will not help. However, the noise will be made more Gaussian thanks to the observing strategies -Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marois et al. 2006</ref>) and Spectral Differential Imaging (SDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Marois et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sparks &amp; Ford 2002)</ref>-where the quasi-static speckle are subtracted and the displacement of the planet relative to them is used.</p><p>Secondly, when neglected, correlated noise can create the illusion of a signal, which results in inflated upper limits. However, overestimated upper limits are a conservative choice, which makes it acceptable. This effect is partially corrected when we calibrate the standard deviation as discussed at the end of Section 3.1. Note that a large PSF here again mitigates the effects of the correlation. Increasing the correlation length and the PSF size in tandem is equivalent to reducing the number of independent realizations of the noise.</p></div>

A possible explanation for the gaps could be the presence of accreting planets carving them <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dong &amp; Fung 2017)</ref>. The goal is to use the high contrast observation of the system to set an upper limit on the mass of the hypothetical planets, which can be compared to the predictions of theoretical models of planet formation.</p><p>We will compare the different definitions of upper limit. As a reminder, our Bayesian upper limits are defined from the flux posterior and the probability of the true planet flux (or mass) to be smaller than the limit, which we called cutoff probability. The frequentist definition of upper limit relies on the detection threshold and its associated completeness. A detection occurs when the measured flux of a point source falls above the detection threshold. The completeness is the probability that a planet of a given flux (or mass) is detected. The completeness is therefore always 50% for planets with a true flux equal to the detection threshold. Otherwise, it will, for example, be equal to 16% if the true flux of the planet is 1σ below the detection threshold and 84% if it is 1σ above the detection threshold. To summarize, the frequentist upper limit makes a statement about the detectability of a planet, while the Bayesian upper limit makes a statement about the probability of the planet flux given the data.</p><p>The units of the planet flux has not yet been defined and will depend on the normalization of the planet model. In the following, we will express the flux as the planet-to-star flux ratio. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> shows the planet-to-star flux ratio of TW Hya and its corresponding standard deviation maps, which are used in the calculation of the likelihood in Equation 27. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the resulting planet-to-star flux ratio and the mass upper limits for different cutoff probabilities as a function of the planet semi-major axis (white lines). It also features the 5σ detection threshold as a function of separation (dashed red line). The location of the four gaps in TW Hya proto-planetary disk are marked with grey lines. The planet to star flux ratio to mass conversion was performed using the AMES-Cond model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Allard et al. 2012</ref>) and an age of 10Myr for the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bell et al. 2015</ref>), which only accounts for photospheric emissions and neglect possible effects of accretion. We assume a uniform positive prior in flux or mass for the calculation of the flux or mass posterior respectively. It means that the priors in both cases, mass or flux, are not equivalent. We could use a more informed mass prior based on observational results, but it is still poorly constrained for giant planets at large separation and the choice of a constant is conservative. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> does not allow for an easy comparison of the different upper limits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 10</ref> features the posterior and its cumulative distribution as well as the complete-ness for each gap, which are in substance vertical cuts through <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. For example, on one hand, the detection threshold corresponds to a ≈ 1M J planet at the 88 au gap (grey lines). A possible definition of mass upper limit would be the mass of a planet that would be detected 95% of the time, which is ≈ 1.3M J for that gap. On the other hand, the value of the cumulative distribution of the posterior at the detection threshold is already 0.9995 (≈ 3σ), which already highlight a comfortable degree of confidence in the fact that the mass of the planet is lower. In hindsight, it seems unnecessary to look for such a high completeness in this case. It is also common practice to quote the detection threshold itself as the upper limit. This approach can lead to confusion because the 5σ of the detection threshold can be easily mistaken for a cutoff probability, when it is really associated to a false positive rate. A 5σ detection threshold is not equivalent to a Bayesian upper limit with a "5σ" cutoff probability, but truly ≈ 3σ in the specific example. An upper limit should always be accompanied by a statement about its probability, which a sole detection threshold is lacking.</p><p>We have already mentioned other caveats coming from a detection-based upper limit. First, the definition of the threshold is somewhat arbitrary. The field has widely adopted a 5σ threshold but it yields many false positives in practice due to the non-Gaussianity of the noise. If we chose a larger threshold to mitigate this issue, should the upper limit change or remain the same? Secondly, a detection threshold only indirectly depends on the data through the sample standard deviation, while the Bayesian upper limit fully expresses the information contained in the data. The latter will be highly sensitive to outliers. This dependence to the data is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, where the Bayesian upper limit varies strongly as a function of the semi-major axis while the detection threshold is smoother. Finally and related to the previous point, an advantage of the Bayesian upper limit is that it is valid regardless of the strength of the signal (detection or non-detection), while the detection threshold framework requires the absence of outliers. Besides, the Bayesian approach is less sensitive to the assumed noise distribution than the frequentist approach due to the dominant impact of the strongest signal in the data.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ruane et al. (2017)</ref>, the upper limit is calculated for a 95% completeness and a detection threshold that is defined to yield 0.01 false positives within 1 of the host star. The threshold varies from 8.1σ to 4.5σ with increasing separation to the star accounting for both the larger area available at larger separation and small sample statistics using a Student-t distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mawet et al. 2014</ref>). The most conservative upper limits for the mass of a companion around TW Hya assume an age of 10 Myr and the AMES-Cond model. The reported upper limits for each gap in the system are: 2.3 M J at 24 au, 1.6 M J at 41 au, 1.5 M J at 47 au, and 1.2 M J at 88 au. Using a Bayesian analysis and 0.999 cutoff probability (3σ), this work finds mass upper limits equal to 2.4 M J at 24 au, 1.5 M J at 41 au, 1.3 M J at 47 au, and 0.9 M J at 88 au. Note that this work uses a different reduction algorithm compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ruane et al. (2017)</ref>, which has not been optimized and might explain the limited gains. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> should be used for a fair comparison of the frequentist and Bayesian approach. The upper limits for the planet-to-star flux ratio are 1.4 × 10 −4 at 24 au, 4.9 × 10 −5 at 41 au, 3.4 × 10 −5 at 47 au, and 2.2 × 10 −5 at 88 au. The corresponding absolute magnitudes are respectively 12.9, 14.0, 14.3, and 14.9, where we have assumed a TW Hya distance of 60.1±0.15 pc <ref type="bibr">(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018</ref>) and a 7.01 apparent magnitude at Wise W1 band (proxy for Keck-NIRC2 L' band) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wright et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>The previous mass upper limits do not consider possible accretion of the planet, which is most likely to occur for proto-planetary disks like TW Hya. The absolute magnitude of a circumplanetary disk is a function of the product of the planet mass with the accretion rate, M ˙ M , and the inner radius of the circumplanetary disk, R in (Zhu 2015). For small enough planets, which is most often the case, the intrinsic flux of the planet can be neglected as the accretion appears much brighter. We can compute the probability corresponding to each set of parameters (M ˙ M , R in ) using Zhu (2015) model predictions for the circumplanetary disk absolute magnitude in L band and the posterior distribution of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. We compare the map of cutoff probabilities and completeness for each gap in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. On a logarithmic scale, the 99.9% Bayesian cutoff probability leads to marginally better constraints on (M ˙ M , R in ) than the 5σ completeness based approach. However, we argue that it is easier to statistically interpret the Bayesian constraints. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dong &amp; Fung (2017)</ref> argues that hypothetical gap opening planets should have mass of the order of 0.1M J in the 20au and 80au gaps. The thermal emission of such planets would be invisible at our current sensitivity and therefore can be neglected. Therefore, assuming a 0.1M J planet, we can set constraints on the accretion rate ˙ M by adding one unit to the y-logarithmic-scale in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. As a conclusion, given the data, we are 99.9% confident that the accretion rate of a 0.1M J planet in the TW Hya gaps, if it exists, is below 9.3 × 10 −7 M J yr −1 at 24 au, 5.0 × 10 −7 M J yr −1 at 41 au, 4.5 × 10 −7 M J yr −1 at 47 au, and 3.4 × 10 −7 M J yr −1 at 88 au.</p></div>

An example of application of this method can be found in the case of Eridani in <ref type="bibr">Mawet et al. (2018, submitted to AJ)</ref> for which this section describes the theoretical concepts.</p><p>Radial velocity only provides a lower limit on the mass of the planet due to the M sin(i) mass-inclination degeneracy. Direct imaging non detection can provide a mass upper bound and therefore reject the lower inclinations. We define D RV as the time series of radial velocities and D DI as the direct imaging observation. The model parameters Θ to be inferred include the orbital elements and the mass of the planet as well as the star. We also define Θ such that Θ = {M p , Ω, Θ } with M p the mass of the planet and Ω the position angle or longitude of ascending node. D RV and D DI are independent so the posterior can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">P(Θ|D RV , D DI ) = P(D RV , D DI |Θ)P(Θ) P(D RV , D DI ) , = P(D RV |Θ)P(D DI |Θ)P(Θ) P(D RV , D DI ) .<label>(29)</label></formula><p>The radial velocity log-likelihood can be written as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Howard et al. 2014</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">log P(D RV |Θ) = − i (v i − v m (t i )) 2 2(σ 2 i + σ 2 j ) + log 2π(σ 2 i + σ 2 j ) ,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where v i are the measured radial velocities at the times t i and v m (t i ) are the corresponding projected Keplerian velocities. The standard deviations σ i and σ j are respectively the internal uncertainty for each measurement and the instrument-specific jitter term.</p><p>As it was shown in Section 3.1, the direct imaging log-likelihood can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">log P(D DI |F = f, X = x) ∝ − 1 2σ 2 x f 2 − 2f˜f2f˜ 2f˜f x .<label>(31)</label></formula><p>The planet flux f is a function of the planet mass and stellar age and the position x is determined by the orbital parameters. </p><p>with P(Ω) = 1/2π the prior for the position angle and r, ω are the cylindrical coordinates of the planet. Equation 32 shows that the radial velocity likelihood can be factored out of the integral, which leaves an integral over the sole direct imaging likelihood. The calculation of the integral is then equivalent to Section 3.1 with a circular face-on orbit. Note that it is always possible to derive an upper limit, even when the existence of a planet is still in doubt. For example, one could use this framework to constrain masses for radial velocity trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work we have addressed the differences between frequentist and Bayesian definitions of planet flux upper limits in the context of exoplanet direct imaging. The frequentist upper limit makes a statement about the detectability of a planet, while the Bayesian upper limit is about the probability of a given planet flux. While upper limits are often thought of in Bayesian way, they are mostly quoted as detection threshold in our field. This makes the interpretation of detection based upper limit more challenging. The detection threshold, or contrast curve, is somewhat arbitrary and only a property of the noise (σ), which means it is not an optimal use of the data.</p><p>Our goal is to provide a conceptual framework for the analysis of direct imaging data as well as informative examples rather than an explicit analysis recipe or formalism. Clearly defining a problem and its statistical representation before any calculation is extremely important. Our conceptual framework can also be applied to other cases such as estimating planet occurrence rates, or combining multiple measured quantities such as relative motion. Here we have illustrated three typical cases:</p><p>• deriving an upper limit on planet flux when the location of the planet is known, which happens when e.g. the planet is robustly detected in a set of filters but not in others. The set of observations can be used to inform the astrophysical nature of a candidate (planet, brown dwarf, star, galaxies. . . ) using Bayesian model comparison.</p><p>• constraining the mass of a hypothetical planet carving a gap in a protoplanetary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ruane et al. 2017</ref>). We showed that the data contains more information and is typically more constraining than the sole detection threshold suggests.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
