			<abstract>
				<p>NASA&apos;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has begun a two-year survey of most of the sky, which will include lightcurves for thousands of solar-like oscillators sampled at a cadence of two minutes. To prepare for this steady stream of data, we present a mock catalogue of lightcurves, designed to realistically mimic the properties of the TESS sample. In the process, we also present the first public release of the asteroFLAG Artificial Dataset Generator, which simulates lightcurves of solar-like oscillators based on input mode properties. The targets are drawn from a simulation of the Milky Way&apos;s populations and are selected in the same way as TESS&apos;s true Asteroseismic Target List. The lightcurves are produced by combining stellar models, pulsation calculations and semi-empirical models of solar-like oscillators. We describe the details of the catalogue and provide several examples. We provide pristine lightcurves to which noise can be added easily. This mock catalogue will be valuable in testing asteroseismology pipelines for TESS and our methods can be applied in preparation and planning for other observatories and observing campaigns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The study of stellar oscillations-asteroseismologyhas undergone a revolution, driven by space-based photometric observations from COROT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Auvergne et al. 2009</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) and K2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Howell et al. 2014</ref>). In particular, space-based photometry has provided data of unprecedented quality for solar-like oscillators, whose low-amplitude oscillations had previously been notoriously difficult to observe.</p><p>NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>) will extend this new era. Like Kepler, TESS is chiefly an exoplanet survey mission but its continuous, high-cadence observations are also suited to the study of stellar oscillations. TESS will observe most of the sky in roughly month-long sectors covering four 24 • × 24 • areas from the ecliptic poles to near the ecliptic plane. The mission will produce full-frame images (FFIs) every 30 minutes as well as light curves for a selection of targets sampled at a short cadence of two minutes, which is necessary for the seismology of cool main-sequence and subgiant stars. Once reduced to lightcurves, the FFIs will also allow asteroseismic analysis but here we restrict our attention to short-cadence targets. The satellite was launched on 2018 April 18 and began science operations on 2018 July 25. The first data release is expected about six months after science operations began ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>) i.e. late January 2019. Each month of short-cadence data is expected to include hundreds of stars in which solar-like oscillations will be detected.</p><p>In preparation for this rapid flow of data, we present here a mock catalogue of TESS lightcurves for a sample of solar-like oscillators observed at short cadence. The targets have been selected from a synthetic Milky Way population by the same method as the real Asteroseismic Target List (ATL, <ref type="bibr">Schofield et al., in prep.</ref>) of the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC, <ref type="bibr">Kjeld- sen et al. 2016</ref>). 1 These synthetic lightcurves will be used to test parameter extraction pipelines (and potentially model-fitting pipelines) with known physical parameters. Although some important quantities (e.g. rotation rates) cannot currently be predicted a priori, the rich phenomenology of solar-like oscillators derived from previous missions allows us to generate realistic lightcurves using empirical methods. These lightcurves are also provided in a simple format so that they can be supplemented with other signals, like transiting planets or systematic effects.</p><p>We first present our method for producing stellar models for a sample that mimics the ATL (Section 2) followed by the inputs and methods by which we computed lightcurves for each star in that sample (Section 3). We then describe the structure of our model catalogue and present several example results (Section 4) before discussing shortcomings and potential future applications of our methods (Section 5). We close our presentation with a brief conclusion (Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Stellar models</head><p>All of the stellar models used in this work were computed using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics 2 (MESA), revision 7385 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Paxton et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Paxton et al. , 2013</ref>). The stellar model grids used in the Galaxy simulation (see Sec. 2.2) are the same as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rodrigues et al. (2017)</ref> and the same inputs were used to recreate individual stellar model profiles at the interpolated parameter values (see Sec. 2.4). Full details are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rodrigues et al. (2017)</ref> but we give the main parameters again here.</p><p>The models use the solar metal mixture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grevesse &amp; Noels (1993)</ref>, with solar metal and helium abundances Z = 0.01756 and Y = 0.26618. Stellar models at other metallicities follow the enrichment law Y = 0.2485 + 1.007 × Z. The atmospheric model is that of <ref type="bibr">Krishna Swamy (1966)</ref>, which gives a solar-calibrated mixing length parameter α MLT = 1.9657. Opacities are taken from the OPAL tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Iglesias &amp; Rogers 1996)</ref> at high temperatures (log 10 (T / K) ≥ 4.1), <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ferguson et al. (2005)</ref> at low temperatures (log 10 (T / K) ≤ 4.0) and blended linearly between (4.0 ≤ log 10 (T / K) ≤ 4.1). The equation of state is the MESA default, which is derived from the OPAL equation of state <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rogers &amp; Nayfonov (2002)</ref> in the region relevant for our stellar models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Galaxy simulation</head><p>We simulated the population of stars in the Milky Way using TRILEGAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Girardi et al. 2005</ref>). The simulation used the default parameters described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Girardi et al. (2012)</ref>, which comprise a thin disc, thick disc, halo and bulge. The simulation includes a rough model for extinction, in which the total extinction determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref> is assumed to be caused by an exponential dust disc with a scale height of 110 pc. Bolometric corrections and extinction coefficients were calculated for the TESS bandpass in a Vega magnitude system. The stellar models (as described in the previous section) span masses from 0.60 to 2.50 M in steps of between 0.05 and 0.20 M (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rodrigues et al. 2017</ref>) and metallicities [Fe/H] from −1.00 to 0.50 in steps of 0.25. The limits of the stellar model grid naturally restrict our base population to those ranges. The population was selected to cover the whole sky down to a magnitude limit of 12.5 in the TESS bandpass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Target selection</head><p>We ranked the stars in the TRILEGAL simulation by the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations, as determined by the same code used to produce the Asteroseismic Target List (ATL, <ref type="bibr">Schofield et al., in prep.)</ref> for Working Groups 1 and 2 of the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC). The principles behind the code are described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Campante et al. (2016)</ref>, which determines the detection probability by the same method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chaplin et al. (2011)</ref>, appropriately modified for TESS using its expected noise characteristics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>). In short, the code uses empirical relations to predict the amplitude of a potential target's oscillations and compares the star's expected noise level to determine the probability that the oscillations will be detected.</p><p>In addition, we used the distance moduli provided by the TRILEGAL simulation, rather than also creating mock distances to mimic the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS, as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Campante et al. 2016)</ref> or Gaia DR2 (which is being used for the final version of the ATL).</p><p>TESS's observing strategy is important because it divides the sky into 26 partially-overlapping observing sectors of varying durations. We shall partially classify our results by these sectors. The satellite observes each hemisphere of the sky in sectors containing four 24 • ×24 • areas that cover a strip of the sky from the ecliptic pole to near the ecliptic plane. Each hemisphere is observed for 13 sectors and each sector is observed for about 27.4 days on average. After observing in one hemisphere, the satellite will re-orient to observe the other hemisphere. The first sector is centred on a galactic longitude of 315.8 • , 3 which we have replicated in our mock sample.</p><p>TESS uses an orbit in 2:1 resonance with the moon, in which the lengths of the orbits vary within a range of a few days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dichmann et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dichmann et al. , 2016</ref>. The details of the pointings depend on the precise orientation of the spacecraft and these are not known until the observations of a given sector begin. In our mock sample, we have extrapolated approximate pointings and sector durations from perigee data provided by the TESS team. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For the sector pointings, we fit the times (as Julian dates) of the mid-sector perigees t perigee with the formula </p><p>where n is the sector number, from 1 to 26. We then took the pointing of a given sector to be the anti-solar direction at that time. For the sector durations ∆t, we fit a similar formula to the durations between perigees at the start and end of each sector,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆t/d = 27.276 + 1.493 sin(2π(0.00345 t + 0.171)) (3)</formula><p>where t is the Julian date at the start of a sector. Though not perfectly accurate, these formulae give our mock sample a realistic variation in the durations and pointings of each sector all the way to the end of the nominal mission.</p><p>Running the ATL code on our TRILEGAL simulation data provided a ranking for all the stars in the simulation. To create our mock sample, we selected enough stars for each sector to contain at least 1000 stars. The mock sample contains 12731 stars and each sector contains between 1000 and 1263 targets (many of which appear in more than one sector). In the output ATL target list, 99.07 per cent of the stars are in the thin disc, 0.85 per cent in the thick disc, 0.08 per cent in the halo and none in the bulge. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows the stars in the Kiel diagram (effective temperature T eff versus surface gravity log g).</p><p>Note that the ATL target selection presumably contaminates the sample with some number of classical pulsators, in particular γ Doradus variables. Indeed, γ Doradus itself is one of the targets in the real ATL. This is a deliberate choice to better sample the transition from solar-like oscillations to coherent pulsations and to search for potential hybrid oscillators. We have assumed that all the ATL-selected stars are solar-like oscillators and have ignored this contamination. Using various estimates of the red edge of the γ Doradus instability strip (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Dupret et al. 2004</ref>), we estimate that as much as 20 per cent of our sample might be in the instability strip. Most of these stars, however, are ranked in the lowest quarter of our sample.</p><p>The target selection also does not account for the binarity of systems, even though the TRILEGAL simulation does generate stars in binary systems. The ATL selects its targets using the single star data and therefore selects targets that might actually be difficult to observe because of a companion. For reference, TRILEGAL labels 64.0 per cent of the selected targets as single stars, 28.0 per cent as primaries and 8.0 per cent as secondaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Stellar model parameters</head><p>The simulated population does not provide complete stellar models, which are required to compute mode frequencies, so we recomputed evolutionary tracks with the initial parameters in the TRILEGAL simulation and stored the final models of these tracks for the oscillation calculation. Because TRILEGAL interpolates in a grid of models to compute a star's observable properties, we expect some differences in stellar properties caused by interpolation. We initially proceeded naively, using exactly the stellar age given by the TRILEGAL data. This gave differences of up to about 5 per cent in T eff and log(L/L ).</p><p>To reduce the differences in these key properties, we instead evolved the star until the misfit in T eff and log(L/L ) reached a minimum near the age given in the TRILEGAL data. This improved the mean accuracy to better than about 0.5 per cent at the cost of introduc-ing small discrepancies in the ages, of up to about 1 per cent on average. Specifically, we minimised the misfit</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ 2 = T eff,MESA − T eff,TRI 150 K 2 (4) + log 10 (L MESA /L ) − log 10 (L TRI /L ) 0.03 2 (5)</formula><p>where the subscripts MESA and TRI indicate quantities from the recomputed MESA model or the TRILEGAL data. The uncertainties were chosen to balance the quality of the match between the luminosity L and the effective temperature T eff . This is unimportant for most stars but we chose these values to avoid local minima of χ 2 in stars on or just beyond the blue hook. Like Rodrigues et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2017)</ref>, we evolved our models starting from the pre-main-sequence. MESA sometimes fails to converge on initial models when using atmospheric T (τ ) relations so <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rodrigues et al. (2017)</ref> used different values of the initial central temperature T c for different evolutionary tracks. When recomputing models at interpolated parameter values from the TRILEGAL output, we also interpolated T c linearly as a function of mass M and metallicity Z. This still led to some runs failing to converge on an initial model. In these cases, we increased the initial central temperature by 1000 K at a time until an initial model converged and the run could proceed. About 4 per cent of all our models require this step, and just over half of those require just one change to T c .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Rotation profiles</head><p>A priori modelling of stellar rotation rates is an unsolved problem. For example, stellar models broadly predict that the cores of low-mass red giants should rotate faster than asteroseismic inferences suggest (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Eggenberger et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marques et al. 2013</ref>). Similarly, solar models incorporating rotation (e.g. TurckChì eze et al. 2010) predict differential rotation in the Sun's radiative zone, which is at odds with the helioseismic inference of solid-body rotation down to about 0.2 R (Howe 2009) from the centre. In the absence of a reliable forward model of stellar rotation, we used empirical relations to predict the rotation rates of the stars in our sample.</p><p>For each star, we first compute a rotation rate predicted by the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angus et al. (2015)</ref> using the median values of their parameters. For stars with T eff &gt; 6500 K, we use their formula for hot dwarfs (their eq. 7) and draw a rotation period P from a normal distribution with mean 5.0 d and standard deviation 2.1 d. For stars with T eff &lt; 6500 K, we use their formula for cool dwarfs 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T eff /K 10 −1 10 0 10 1 Ω env / µHz</formula><p>0.1 Gy r 1 Gy r 10 Gy r <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Envelope rotation rates for all the stars selected by the ATL code from the TRILEGAL simulation. The dashed grey lines are rotation rates for fixed ages, from top to bottom, 0.1 Gyr, 1 Gyr and 10 Gyr, evaluated using the formula for cool stars (eq. 6). The black point shows the median and standard deviation of the normal distribution (in period) used for stars hotter than about 6500 K. The Sun is indicated by its usual symbol.</p><p>(their eq. 8)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P = 0.40(B − V − 0.45) 0.31 t 0.55 (6)</formula><p>where the colour B −V is determined from T eff according to the fitting formula by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Torres (2010)</ref>. We do not use the subgiant formulae by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angus et al. (2015)</ref> because their subgiant sample has stars mostly hotter than about 6000 K and generally gives faster rotation rates than observed in low-luminosity red giants. Their model of subgiant rotation rates was principally introduced to avoid contaminating the gyrochronology relation for cool main-sequence stars. As a precaution, we set a minimum rotation period of 1 d (i.e. a maximum rotation frequency of 11.57 µHz).</p><p>For stars on the main sequence (defined by a central hydrogen abundance X c &gt; 10 −4 ), we assume that the star is rotating rigidly, so that the rotation rate is constant throughout the stellar model. Although results for radial differential rotation in main-sequence stars are limited, they are consistent with solid-body rotation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Benomar et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Nielsen et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nielsen et al. , 2017</ref>.</p><p>For stars that have depleted hydrogen in their cores, we divide the rotation rate from eq. 6 by (R/R TAMS ) 2 , where R TAMS is the radius of the star at the end of the main sequence. This factor represents a na¨ıvena¨ıve conservation of angular momentum as the star expands and gives rotation rates that agree better with the envelope rotation rates found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Deheuvels et al. (2014)</ref> in six subgiants and low-luminosity red giants.</p><p>For these post-main-sequence stars, we also draw a core rotation rate from a normal distribution with mean 0.375 µHz and standard deviation 0.105 µHz, which is derived from those stars in the sample studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mosser et al. (2012a)</ref> with large frequency separations ∆ν &gt; 12 µHz (i.e. the spacing between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial order). If this new rotation rate is greater than the first one, then the lower rate is taken as rotation rate of the convective envelope (Ω env ) and the greater rate as the rotation rate of the convectively-stable core (Ω core ). <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows the envelope rotation rates of all the stars selected by the ATL code from the TRILEGAL simulation.</p></div>

Specifically, for all the modes, we used a grid of 800 frequencies distributed linearly in frequency and, for the non-radial modes, we added extra grids of 1000, 3000 and 14000 frequencies for the = 1, 2 and 3 modes, distributed linearly in period.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Introduction</head><p>We computed artificial lightcurves using the asteroFLAG Artificial Dataset Generator, version 3 (AADG3). Variants of the code have been developed over many years and extensively used, particularly for validating the data analysis of ground-based radial velocity measurements of solar oscillations and stellar oscillations. The core of the code, which simulates stochastically-driven oscillations in the time domain, was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chaplin et al. (1997)</ref>. The Solar Fitting at Low Angular Degree Group (solarFLAG) used and developed the code to test their data-analysis packages in two hare-and-hounds exercises ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chaplin et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jiménez-Reyes et al. 2008</ref>). The code was further developed for the Asteroseismic Fitting at Low Angular Degree Group (asteroFLAG, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Chap- lin et al. 2008b</ref>) from which the current version is chiefly derived. Details of the code were most recently described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Howe et al. (2015)</ref>. The version used here has been rewritten into Fortran 95 and we are now making it publicly available 6 under the GNU General Public License, version 3. 7</p><p>The core component of AADG3 simulates the lightcurves for all modes with the same angular degree and azimuthal order m. The code first generates an exponentially-damped random walk (equivalent to a first-order autoregressive (AR) process) 8 that is the same for all modes of the specified l and m. This is the correlated driving term, which we denote u c , and is interpreted as the component of the granulation that contributes to exciting all modes of a given l and m. Then, for each radial order with the specified l and m, the code generates another exponentially-damped random walk, which is the uncorrelated driving term, denoted u u . This represents the component of the granulation that only drives a single mode of a given n, l and m. The two sequences are added to give an overall of driving term for that mode,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">u = au u + 1 − a 2 u c<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where a is a user-provided parameter, which we set at 0.45. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Toutain et al. (2006)</ref> introduced the correlated driving term to model the asymmetry in the mode profiles. The first 6 d of data are truncated from the beginning of the sequence to allow the damped random walk to relax into equilibrium.</p><p>To generate a complete lightcurve, AADG3 first generates the contribution of all overtones of a given and m using the Laplace transform solution of a driven, damped harmonic oscillator ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chaplin et al. 1997</ref>) with a sequence u (eq. 12) as the driving term. The code repeats this for each combination of l and m. The final lightcurve is the combination of the lightcurves and driving terms for each and m, weighted to reproduce the appropriate relative amplitudes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Howe et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Mode lifetimes and linewidths</head><p>Solar-like oscillations are intrinsically damped by nearsurface convection (which also excites them) and the oscillations therefore have finite lifetimes. In other words, the resonant peaks in the power spectrum, which are wellapproximated by Lorentzian curves, have measurable linewidths (except for some very long-lived mixed modes in evolved solar-like oscillators). There are currently few theoretical predictions of the linewidths of solar-like oscillators (e.g. Houdek 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aarslev et al. 2018</ref>) and even those cannot be routinely and rapidly computed for a large number of targets. We therefore use a semiempirical description based on data from the nominal Kepler mission.</p><p>We parametrise the linewidths Γ as a function of frequency using the same formula as <ref type="bibr">Appourchaux et al. (2014, eq. 1)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lund et al. (2017, eq. 30)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ln Γ = α ln(ν/ν max ) + ln Γ α +    ln ∆Γ dip 1 + 2 ln(ν/ν dip ) ln(W dip /νmax) 2    (13)</formula><p>where α, Γ α , ∆Γ dip , ν dip and W dip are all parameters that are simultaneously fit as bilinear functions of T eff and ν max . That is, each parameter x is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">x = a x + b x T eff + c x ν max<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where a x , b x and c x are the free parameters, of which there are 15 in total (3 for each of the 5 parameters in eq. 14). We fit all 15 parameters at once, using fits to each target (with all b x and c x = 0) in the LEGACY sample ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. 2017</ref>) as initial guesses, to a sample containing all the radial mode frequencies reported in the LEGACY sample as well as the 25 red giants with highest ν max in the sample studied by <ref type="bibr">Davies et al. (2018, in prep.</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the best-fitting parameters found in this way. The coupling of g-and p-modes in evolved stars affects the damping rates (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Basu &amp; Chaplin 2017)</ref>. We divide the linewidth from equation 13 by the ratio Q nn</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Q nn = I nn I 0 (ν nn )<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where ν nn and I nn are the frequency and inertia of the mode with radial order n and angular degree , and I 0 (ν) is the mode inertia of the radial modes interpolated at the frequency ν. Because mixed modes have greater inertiae than pure p-modes, Q nn is greater than one, so the mixed modes have narrower linewidths (i.e. they live longer) than the pure p-modes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Mode amplitudes</head><p>To predict the intrinsic mode amplitudes of the stellar oscillations in the power spectrum, we follow the prescription by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chaplin et al. (2011)</ref>, which is itself based on results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Samadi et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>We assume that the maximum rms amplitude of the radial modes can be scaled from the solar value by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A rms max = A rms max, β L L M M −1 T eff T eff, −2<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where A rms max, = 2.1 ppm in the TESS bandpass and we have taken T eff, = 5777 K. Besides the factor β, this is in essence the scaling relation presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding (1995)</ref>. Compared to the amplitudes measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. (2017)</ref> for the LEGACY sample (i.e. dwarfs observed for at least one year during the nominal Kepler mission), eq. (16) is consistent within about 40 per cent, and within 25 per cent for all but 6 of the 66 stars in the sample.</p><p>The factor β is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">β = 1 − exp T eff − T red ∆T (17)</formula><p>and corrects the formula for the apparent decrease in the amplitudes of the hottest dwarfs. Here, ∆T = 1250 K and T red is the temperature of the red edge of the δ-Scuti instability strip at the star's luminosity, which we take as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">T red = 8907 K · L L −0.093<label>(18)</label></formula><p>For the envelope's full-width half-maximum (FWHM) width Γ env , we use the scaling relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mosser et al. 2012b</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Γ env = 0.66 µHz · ν max µHz 0.88<label>(19)</label></formula><p>If T eff &gt; T eff, , we multiply Γ env by the factor 1 + 6 × 10 −4 (T eff − T eff, ) (Lund et al., in prep.). The rms power in the mode with radial order n and angular degree is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(A rms nn ) 2 = (A rms max ) 2 exp − (ν nn − ν max ) 2 2σ 2 env (20)</formula><p>where σ env = Γ env /2 √ 2 ln 2. Like the linewidths, the mode powers are also affected by the coupling of p-and g-modes. We divide the mode powers by Q nn (see eq. 15) so that the more strongly coupled modes are suppressed. Finally, to avoid simulating lightcurves for modes that contribute negligibly to the power spectrum, we restrict the list of modes to those with heights in the power spectrum greater than 10 −4 times the expected granulation background signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Background properties</head><p>To determine the characteristic timescale of the granulation τ gran , we use equation 10 of ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">τ gran = ν max ν max, −1 τ gran,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>with a solar value τ gran, = 250 s.

After it is generated for the mode calculation, it is added to the lightcurve after an appropriate scaling (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Howe et al. 2015</ref>). Any other background processes that are not correlated with the oscillations (e.g. supergranulation) can be added to the lightcurves we provide. The granulation timeseries is generated by averaging over 50 subcadences of each cadence, which also apodises the signal. The oscillations are not apodised.</p><p>Because we simulate the granulation with a first-order autoregressive process, its power spectrum is (e.g. De <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ridder et al. 2006</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P gran (ν) = 4σ 2 gran τ gran 1 + (2πντ gran ) 2<label>(23)</label></formula><p>which is often referred to as a Harvey law <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Harvey 1985)</ref>. While the use of a fixed power 2 in the denominator is reasonable, many studies leave the power free and often fit data better with powers around 4 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Michel et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kallinger et al. 2014</ref>). Our results are limited by the need to simulate the granulation signal in the time domain (rather than the frequency domain). While we aim to improve on the background model, or at least provide more freedom in how it is modelled (e.g. higherorder autoregressive models), we regard this as beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>The amplitude of the white noise is generated according to the same formulae as used in the ATL code. The noise model is inferred from the target's I-band magnitude, which is similar to the expected magnitude in the TESS bandpass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Mode visibilities</head><p>The apparent amplitudes of the modes are influenced by two main geometric effects: cancellation and inclination. First, as the angular degree increases, there are more and more equally-sized brighter and darker regions across the stellar surface, which cancel out when integrated over the visible stellar surface. This cancellation can be quantified by a visibility V , often normalised by the radial mode's visibility V 0 to give the normalised visibilities˜Vvisibilities˜ visibilities˜V ≡ V /V 0 . The power of a non-radial mode of degree is then multiplied by˜Vby˜ by˜V .</p><p>Though these visibilities can in principle be computed theoretically (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ballot et al. 2011</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. (2017)</ref> found that the predictions disagreed with observations, especially for the = 3 modes. We have opted to use the median normalised visibilities for the main-sequence stars studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. (2017)</ref>, which are˜Vare˜ are˜V 1 = 1.505, ˜ V 2 = 0.620 and˜Vand˜ and˜V 3 = 0.075. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lund et al. (2017)</ref> found no significant correlations with the stars' properties and found values in reasonable agreement with the red giants studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mosser et al. (2012b)</ref>. These mode visibilities are sufficiently realistic for our purposes but the visibilities do depend on the photometric bandpass and will be different in the actual TESS data.</p><p>Second, a rotating star's inclination angle influences the relative visibility of modes of different azimuthal order m. Assuming equipartition of energy between each of the 2 + 1 components of a rotationally split multiplet, the power in each m component is the intrinsic mode power multiplied by a factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gizon &amp; Solanki 2003</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">E m (i) = ( − |m|)! ( + |m|)! P |m| (cos i) 2<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where i is the inclination angle of the rotation axis and P |m| is an associated Legendre polynomial. We assumed that the rotation axis of each star is randomly distributed over the sphere (i.e. it can point in any direction), which implies that cos i is uniformly distributed. We assign the inclination i for each star by drawing a uniform variate w ∼ U (0, 1) and assigning i = cos −1 w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Other parameters</head><p>Finally, we summarize our choices for the remaining global parameters in AADG3. As mentioned before, the sequence of driving terms is allowed to relax for 6 d, which, given the 2-minute cadence of the TESS data, corresponds to 4320 data points. The output lightcurves contain 255418 or 257345 points, corresponding to the total length of all the sectors in either the northern or southern ecliptic hemispheres. The full lightcurves are subsequently divided into lightcurves for each sector in which a given star is observed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Stellar properties and lightcurves</head><p>The lightcurves are publicly available as archives for each sector. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The data repository also includes a table of comma-separated values (CSV) containing the data from all of the headers for each lightcurve, for quick analysis of the sample and target selection. We also separately provide all the scripts that were used to produce and manipulate the data. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Each lightcurve is a FITS file with a filename of the form &lt;ID&gt; &lt;SECTOR&gt; &lt;SEC RANK&gt;.fits where • &lt;ID&gt; is the overall rank of the star in the sample, which identifies it uniquely;</p><p>• &lt;SECTOR&gt; is the sector number, from 1 to 26 (inclusive); and</p><p>• &lt;SEC RANK&gt; is the rank assigned by the ATL code for that sector. So, for example, 00123 17 050.fits would be the lightcurve for the 123rd star in the sample when observed in the fourth sector in the northern ecliptic hemisphere (the seventeenth sector overall), in which the ATL ranked it 50th for the detectability of its oscillations. The file 00123 18 056.fits would be a lightcurve for the same star when observed in the fifth sector in the northern ecliptic hemisphere, in which it was ranked 56th for the detectability of its oscillations. Each file contains a header and two arrays of data, with details of each component given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The header contains a number of overall properties of the star, taken from TRILEGAL simulation, the ATL results, the MESA stellar models and the input for AADG3. The first array contains the lightcurve data. The second array contains the mode frequency information used by AADG3 to create the lightcurve. Thus, each lightcurve file contains all the information required to recreate the AADG3 input and the public pipeline repository includes a script to do this.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Typical low-luminosity red giant</head><p>As expected from the ATL and can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, most of the best targets in our sample are found at the base of the red giant branch, with T eff ≈ 5000 K and log g ≈ 3.5. This is mainly an effect of the relationship between mode amplitude and luminosity. We would in principle prioritise stars further up the red giant branch too but the oscillations of these stars will be available from the full-frame images, with a cadence of 30 minutes. The ATL therefore places a lower limit on ν max of 240 µHz. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows the power spectrum of star 00197, located near the southern ecliptic pole, as observed in sector 2. With T eff = 4933 K and log g = 3.47, this star is typical of the bulk of targets on the lower red giant branch. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> shows a power spectrum of the same star but this time computed from the full, roughly year-long lightcurve. For comparison, we have also included the power spectrum of the similar star KIC 8179973 (T eff ≈ 4949 K, log g ≈ 3.48) which was observed by Kepler during its nominal mission. We computed this and other Kepler power spectra from concatenated timeseries prepared for asteroseismic analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Handberg &amp; Lund (2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Main-sequence stars</head><p>Although the sample is dominated by subgiants and low-luminosity red giants, there are also less evolved stars.  smoothed power spectrum for KIC 11253226 is shown in green. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows the power spectrum of star 00771, observed in sector 18. This star is more Sun-like (T eff = 6052 K, log g = 4.31) and similar to the Kepler targets KIC 6106415 (T eff ≈ 6037 K, log g ≈ 4.31) and KIC 6116048 (T eff ≈ 6033 K, log g ≈ 4.29), which were also part of the LEGACY sample. A 200-point boxcarsmoothed power spectrum for KIC 6116048 is shown in green. Though the = 0 modes are clearly distorted by the = 2 modes, it remains to be seen whether or not the frequencies can be disentangled reliably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The present simulated results offer reasonably realistic predictions of what the underlying signal from solarlike oscillators observed by TESS will look like. Our lightcurves are pristine, in the sense that they contain no noise, though we provide the expected white noise parameters in the lightcurve files. We have not considered other effects that would degrade the power spectra, including instrumental effects or observing gaps. We have also not included other stellar signals like starspots or transits. Any of these, however, can be straightforwardly added to the lightcurves we provide. A more complicated contaminant is the effect of frequency changes caused by magnetic activity. As the frequencies vary over the course of an observation, so the mode profiles in the power spectrum are broadened and potentially biased ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chaplin et al. 2008a</ref>). The effect is probably small in most TESS targets because the roughly month-long observations are much shorter than known activity cycles (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Saikia et al. 2018</ref>). AADG3 has inherited the capability of modelling these frequency shifts from earlier versions of the code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Howe et al. 2015</ref>) but it has not yet been validated in the new version of the code released with this article. In addition, this would require a further semi-empirical model with which to predict the activity cycle periods and the magnitude of the frequency shifts for each star.</p><p>Finally, the code is still limited by our limited ability to predict relevant oscillation parameters, in particular the rotation profiles of the stars. The linewidths (or damping rates) also require an empirical model but at least they are well constrained by observations from Kepler. These are areas of active research and continued asteroseismic analyses will provided important constraints on theoretical models.</p><p>Our methods are naturally applicable to any set of timeseries observations of solar-like oscillators, be it preparation for upcoming missions like PLATO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>), planning for ongoing projects like the Stellar Oscillations Network Group (SONG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Grundahl et al. 2014</ref>) or testing new analyses of existing datasets like Kepler or COROT. The PLATO consortium already operates a lightcurve generator, the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator 11 (PSLS), which is based on the COROT simulator (simuLC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Baudin et al. 2007</ref>). The PLATO and COROT simulators produce an oscillation lightcurve by the inverse Fourier transform of a model Fourier spectrum and our method (which works entirely in the time-domain) is complementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a catalogue of mock observations of solar-like oscillators observed by NASA's TESS mission in its short-cadence mode. Our artificial data combines a simulation of Milky Way populations, detailed stellar models and empirical relations for less well understood physical processes. Targets have been selected from the galaxy simulation using the same method as has been used for the actual mission and the sample therefore reflects the same selection effects. Together, these provide realistic lightcurves with which to prepare for the steady stream of data expected from TESS.</p><p>Our artificial lightcurves are publicly available 12 and can be extended to include various phenomena that we have excluded, be they instrumental effects or other astrophysical signals. The methods we have presented are also applicable to any observing programme for solar-like oscillations and will be useful in the future for observatories like SONG and PLATO.</p><p>WHB would like to thank Tom Barclay for providing detailed help with and information about TESS's orbit and pointings.
