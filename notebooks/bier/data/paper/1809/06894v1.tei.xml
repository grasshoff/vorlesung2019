				<p>A comprehensive analysis of 38 previously published Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) transmission spectra is performed using a hierarchy of nested-sampling retrievals: with versus without clouds, grey versus non-grey clouds, isothermal versus non-isothermal transit chords and with water, hydrogen cyanide and/or ammonia. We revisit the &quot;normalisation degeneracy&quot;: the relative abundances of molecules are degenerate at the order-of-magnitude level with the absolute normalisation of the transmission spectrum. Using a suite of mock retrievals, we demonstrate that the normalisation degeneracy may be partially broken using WFC3 data alone, even in the absence of optical/visible data and without appealing to the presence of patchy clouds, although lower limits to the mixing ratios may be prior-dominated depending on the measurement uncertainties. With James Webb Space Telescope-like spectral resolutions, the normalisation degeneracy may be completely broken from infrared spectra alone. We find no trend in the retrieved water abundances across nearly two orders of magnitude in exoplanet mass and a factor of 5 in retrieved temperature (about 500-2500 K). We further show that there is a general lack of strong Bayesian evidence to support interpretations of non-grey over grey clouds (only for WASP-69b and WASP-76b) and non-isothermal over isothermal atmospheres (no objects). 35 out of 38 WFC3 transmission spectra are well-fitted by an isothermal transit chord with grey clouds and water only, while 8 are adequately explained by flat lines. Generally, the cloud composition is unconstrained.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>At the time of writing, we are in the transitional period between the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes (HST and JWST). In the foreseeable future, WFC3 transmission spectra spanning 0.8-1.7 µm will be superceeded by NIRSpec data ranging from 0.6-5 µm and at enhanced spectral resolution. It is therefore timely to perform a uniform theoretical analysis of a consolidated dataset of WFC3 transmission spectra, which is the over-arching motivation behind the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Observational motivation: a statistical study of cloudy atmospheres</head><p>Following the work of <ref type="bibr">Iyer et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref> recently conducted a statistical study of the transmission spectra of 34 exoplanets (mostly hot Jupiters) measured using WFC3 onboard HST, which were mostly gathered from</p><p>Email: chloe.fisher@csh.unibe.ch (CF) † E-mail: kevin.heng@csh.unibe.ch (KH) <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>. In order to isolate the spectral feature due to water 1 , they quantified the strength of absorption between 1.3-1.65 µm, relative to the continuum, in terms of the number of pressure scale heights, which they represented by AH . Based on the finding that both AH and the equilibrium temperature (Teq) follow log-normal distributions, <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref> concluded that their sample of AH is affected by observational bias. <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref> defined an Atmospheric Detectability Index (ADI) to quantify the strength of detection of the water feature, but do not explicitly link the ADI to any trends in cloud properties. They concluded that all of their WFC3 transmission spectra, except for WASP69b, are consistent with the presence of a grey cloud deck.</p><p>Our intention is to build upon the <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref> studies by subjecting their WFC3 sample to a detailed atmospheric retrieval study and elucidating the presence of assumptions, limitations and trends. It follows the principle that the same datasets should be analysed by different groups (using different codes and techniques) Also shown are the theoretical predictions of A H for cloud-free and cloudy atmospheres. For the latter, the curves correspond to transit chords probing P cloud ∼ 1 µbar, ∼ 0.1 mbar and ∼ 10 mbar if the opacity was solely due to grey clouds and the gravity is ∼ 10 3 cm s −2 . It is apparent that all of the 34 atmospheres are cloudy if only water is assumed to be present.</p><p>within the community, so as to check for the consistency and robustness of theoretical interpretations ( <ref type="bibr">Fortney et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>From a theoretical standpoint, AH is an elegant quantity to examine, because the difference in transit radii between the peak of the water feature and the continuum is simply AH = ln κmax κmin ,</p><p>where κmax and κmin are the maximum and minimum values of the water opacity in the WFC3 range of wavelengths. The preceding equation naturally derives from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>, if the volume mixing ratio of water (XH 2 O) is assumed to be uniform across altitude, and is free of the normalisation degeneracy (see next subsection). Its simplicity allows us to do a first check on if the 34 objects in the sample gathered by <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref> have cloudy atmospheres. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we show curves of AH for completely cloudfree atmospheres by assuming that the temperature (sampled by the water opacity) is the equilibrium temperature. Also shown are curves of AH corresponding to cloudy atmospheres with constant opacities. For example, an opacity of 1 cm 2 g −1 corresponds to a transit chord probing a pressure ∼ 0.1 mbar if only clouds (and not molecules) are present in the atmosphere. By comparing these theoretical curves to the measured data points of <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref>, we tentatively conclude that all of the 34 transiting exoplanets in their sample have cloudy atmospheres. It is one of the goals of the present study to examine if this conclusion is robust. Assuming that the temperature is some fraction of the equilibrium temperature merely translates the theoretical curves along the horizontal axis (not shown).</p><p>There is an additional, supporting argument for the atmospheres being cloudy. By visual inspection of measured WFC3 transmission spectra, we noticed that the continuum  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Opacities of water, hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as functions of wavelength. The ExoMol spectroscopic line list was used as input for computing these opacities. For water and hydrogen cyanide, we show a sequence of opacities from 900-2100 K. Darker shades of the same colour correspond to higher temperatures. For ammonia, the temperature sequence is terminated at 1500 K, because ExoMol does not provide any data for higher temperatures. The spectral resolution is 5 cm −1 and the pressure is fixed at P = 10 mbar, because these values are what we use in our retrievals (see text for details).</p><p>blue-wards of the 1.4 µm water feature tends to be somewhat flat, in contrast to the opacity of water which tends to be rather structured at these wavelengths ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). This suggests that most, if not all, of the WFC3 transmission spectra measured so far are probing cloudy atmospheres-at least at the atmospheric limbs. However, this argument becomes less clear if ammonia and hydrogen cyanide are present, as they may mimic these effects on the spectra.</p><p>In the current study, one of our goals is to formalise this finding by performing atmospheric retrieval, within a nestedsampling framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Skilling 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Feroz &amp; Hobson 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Feroz et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Feroz et al. , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Benneke &amp; Seager 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wald- mann et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lavie et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. 2018</ref>), on each of the 34 objects in the <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2017)</ref> sample. We construct a hierarchy of models with increasing levels of sophistication: cloud-free model (2 parameters), cloudy model with constant/grey cloud opacity (3 parameters), cloudy model with non-grey opacity (6 parameters). It is assumed that the main molecular absorber is water. If hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3) are added to the analysis <ref type="bibr">(Mac- Donald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>, then it adds two more free parameters for a maximum of 8 parameters for the isothermal model. Our non-isothermal model adds another parameter. For comparison, <ref type="bibr">MacDonald &amp; Madhusudhan (2017)</ref> employ a 16-parameter model based partly on the heritage from <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009)</ref>.</p><p>We use the computed Bayesian evidence <ref type="bibr">(Trotta 2008</ref>) from the retrievals to select the best model given the quality of the data, and hence determine if the atmospheres are cloudy, if cloud properties may be meaningfully constrained, and if NH3 and/or HCN are detected in a given WFC3 spectrum. Unlike the approach adopted by <ref type="bibr">MacDonald &amp; Mad- husudhan (2017)</ref>, we do not test for patchy clouds. Rather, we test essentially for whether the cloud particles are small or large (compared to the wavelengths probed).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Theoretical motivation: the normalisation degeneracy</head><p>Atmospheric retrievals of transmission spectrum typically specify a plane-parallel model atmosphere, assume azimuthal symmetry and then trace a transit chord through a set of atmospheric columns (each approximated by a planeparallel atmosphere) <ref type="bibr">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ben- neke &amp; Seager 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Line et al. 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Waldmann et al. 2015</ref>). This brute-force procedure for calculating the transmission spectrum was previously described by <ref type="bibr">Brown (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hubbard et al. (2001)</ref>. In the current study, our intention is to build a nested-sampling retrieval framework around a validated analytical model for computing the transmission spectrum that bypasses the need for a brute-force calculation. Complementary to previous retrieval studies, we make a different set of investments, approximations and simplifications.</p><p>Building on the work of Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr">Etangs et al.

The exponential integral of the first order is given by E1(τ ) <ref type="bibr">(Abramowitz &amp; Stegun 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr">Arfken &amp; Weber 1995)</ref>, which has the argument τ . For a WFC3 spectrum dominated by water, the opacity is κ ∝ XH 2 O, where XH 2 O is the volume mixing ratio of water. Equation (2) assumes that R0 &lt; R; if the layer of the atmosphere located at R0 is opaque in the WFC3 bandpass (τ 1), then the E1 term may be dropped. Equation (2) straightforwardly shows that there exists a three-way degeneracy between the reference transit radius (R0), reference pressure (P0) and XH 2 O, which was first noticed numerically <ref type="bibr">3</ref> by <ref type="bibr">Benneke &amp; Seager (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Griffith (2014)</ref>. The values of R0 and P0, as well as the relationship between them, are a priori unknown, because it is akin to having prior knowledge of the structure of the exoplanet. It is apparent that a small change in R0 causes a large variation in XH 2 O. Furthermore, it is XH 2 OP0, and not XH 2 O alone, that is being retrieved from the data. It is worth <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Meaning that the errors incurred are smaller than the noise floor (about 50 parts per million) of HST and the expected noise floor of JWST. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Our stand is that a numerical demonstration of an effect alone does not qualify as attaining full understanding of it, until its theoretical (analytical) formalism has been elucidated. wavelength ( µm)</p><p>1.440</p><p>1.455</p><p>1.470</p><p>1.485</p><p>1.500</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(R/R⋆) 2 (%)</formula><p>Circles: WASP-12b data from <ref type="bibr">Kreidberg et al.

The degeneracies between R 0 and the other quantities is apparent; R 0 is bounded from below because X H 2 O is bounded from above by unity. In this test, we have set P 0 = 10 bar but in our subsequent retrieval of the WASP-12b WFC3 transmission spectrum we will fit for P 0 (see text and <ref type="figure">Figure 20)</ref>. The measured data and best-fit model are shown in the top-right panel. The physical units of T and κ cloud are K and cm 2 g −1 , respectively, while R 0 is given in units of Jupiter radii (R J ). This retrieval assumes a constant mean molecular mass and ignores the effect of collisional induced absorption, which we will explore later in the current study.</p><p>emphasising that these obstacles do not exist in the forward problem, where one makes a specific set of assumptions (e.g., solar metallicity, chemical equilibrium) and computes the transmission spectrum, but they are front and center in the inverse problem. <ref type="bibr">Heng &amp; Kitzmann (2017)</ref> pointed out these issues, but they did not examine them further within a Bayesian retrieval framework, which partially motivates the current study. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a retrieval calculation performed using a new code (HELIOS-T) presented as part of the current study, which we constructed specifically to perform fast retrievals on transmission spectra at low spectral resolution. 4 (A detailed description of methodology will come later in §2.) It demonstrates that while the temperature may be robustly retrieved, there are order-of-magnitude degeneracies associated with the water mixing ratio and cloud opacity that arise from small variations of R0 (in the third significant figure), as previously elucidated by <ref type="bibr">Heng &amp; Kitzmann (2017)</ref>.

The spectral lines of isolated atoms and molecules are described rather well by a Voigt profile. As a population, collisions between them become important at high enough pressures, which modifies the shape of the far line wings of the profile. It remains unknown exactly what "far" means and how to compute these modified profiles. In practice, various workers in the field have resorted to truncating the Voigt profiles at some ad hoc distance from line centre (see <ref type="bibr">Grimm &amp; Heng 2015 and references therein)</ref>. For this study, we use a line-wing cutoff of 100 cm −1 . Fortunately, since transmission spectra probe pressures that are tenuous enough such that pressure broadening has a negligible effect for ∼ 1000 K atmospheres, this is not a limiting issue.</p><p>Another limitation is that, at the time of writing, the NH3 opacities do not exist for temperatures above 1600 K ( <ref type="bibr">Yurchenko et al. 2011</ref>). In the absence of these data, we set the opacity for NH3 to be zero for temperatures above 1600 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Cloud models</head><p>We consider both grey and non-grey clouds. For our grey cloud model, we assume a constant cloud opacity, which is physically equivalent to assuming that the cloud particles are much larger than the WFC3 wavelengths being probed. Our non-grey cloud model uses the opacity of <ref type="bibr">(Kitzmann &amp; Heng 2018)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">κ cloud = κ0 Q0x −a + x 0.2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where x = 2πrc/λ is the dimensionless size parameter, rc is the particle radius and λ is the wavelength. In their study of 32 condensate species, <ref type="bibr">Kitzmann &amp; Heng (2018)</ref> showed that Q0 ≈ 0.1-65 is a proxy for cloud composition with larger values corresponding to more volatile species. For example, water ice has Q0 = 64.98 and olivine has Q0 ≈ 10. The index a ranges from 3 to 7; a = 4 corresponds to Rayleigh scattering. Our non-grey cloud model has 4 free parameters: κ0, Q0, rc and a. The immediate implication of the preceding equation is that if the cloud is grey (a ≈ 0), then the composition cannot be decisively constrained. Conceptually, the treatment of <ref type="bibr">Lee et al.

Note that for these WASP-12b tests only <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figures 4  to 9</ref>), the molecular opacities are sampled at 1 mbar, CIA is not included and m is fixed at 2.4mH, where mH is the mass of the hydrogen atom (which we take to be one atomic mass unit, mamu), unless otherwise stated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Cloudy versus cloud-free</head><p>Another necessary check is to determine that cloudy models are necessary in the first place for WASP-12b. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5</ref>, we subject the WASP-12b WFC3 transmission spectrum to two cloud-free retrievals: the first has a fixed m = 2.4mH, while the second has a variable m. For the retrieval with a fixed m, the outcome is implausible as the water volume mixing ratio is ∼ 10%-100%. The retrieval with a variable m produces more plausible posteriors, but even by visual inspection it is apparent that the cloud-free model struggles to match the somewhat flat spectral continuum blue-wards of the 1.4 µm water feature. For the rest of the WFC3 transmission spectra, we will not show the posterior distributions associated with the cloud-free retrieval (unless it has the highest Bayesian evidence in the model hierarchy), but we will still include them in the overall analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">MCMC versus nested sampling</head><p>The next logical test is to compare cloudy retrievals obtained using  <ref type="bibr">et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares the outcome from this pair of retrievals. It is reassuring that the posterior distributions of T , XH 2 O and κ cloud are somewhat similar, although we note that the retrieval performed with MCMC produces higher values of the water volume mixing ratio in the tail of the distribution (towards XH 2 O = 1). The reason to select the nested-sampling approach over MCMC is because it allows us to straightforwardly compute the Bayesian evidence associated with each model, which in turn allows us to formally apply Occam's Razor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Choice of spectroscopic databases: HITRAN versus HITEMP versus ExoMol</head><p>Perhaps the most surprising outcome of our series of WASP12b tests is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, where we examine the retrieval outcomes using the HITRAN, HITEMP and ExoMol spectroscopic databases to construct the water opacity. The main shortcoming with HITRAN is that it omits the weak lines of water that contribute prominently to the spectral continuum when T ∼ 1000 K or hotter. HITEMP addresses this issue somewhat, but it is widely accepted by the exoplanet community that ExoMol addresses this issue most completely to date (see <ref type="bibr">Tennyson &amp; Yurchenko 2017</ref> for a review). With an equilibrium temperature in excess of 2500 K, WASP-12b is an ideal target for testing if discrepancies from retrievals arise from the use of different line lists. Yet, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows us that the choice of line list for the water opacity is irrelevant at the present spectral resolution and signal-to-noise attainable of the WFC transmission spectrum of WASP12b. It suggests that the retrievals performed on the other WFC3 transmission spectra are robust to the choice of spectroscopic line list. Despite this finding, we persist in using the ExoMol line list in order to dispel any notion that our results lack robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Insensitivity to pressure broadening</head><p>Pressure broadening is an ill-defined source of uncertainty, because there is no first-principles theory to describe it (see discussion in §2.2). Nevertheless, we quantify its effect as the final test in this WASP-12b suite. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref> shows two retrievals with P = 1 mbar versus 1 bar, which span the conceivable range of pressures probed by the WFC3 transmission spectrum. The effects on the posterior distributions of the temperature, water mixing ratio and grey cloud opac-ity are minimal, even with a factor of 1000 difference in pressure between the pair of retrievals.</p><p>For the rest of the study, we will fix the pressure associated with pressure broadening at 10 mbar. The reasoning is that departures from this value will result in minor errors to the retrieved posterior distributions, which are subsumed as errors in the grey cloud opacity. Given that the exact functional form of pressure broadening cannot be specified from first principles, this is a reasonable approach, because it allows us to include pressure broadening in a more controlled way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.6">Comparison of Bayesian evidence</head><p>Following these tests, we analyse the WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-12b using a hierarchy of models: with and without clouds, grey versus non-grey clouds, isothermal versus non-isothermal and with various permutations of the three molecules being present. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the Bayes factor for each model, which is the logarithm of the ratio of the Bayesian evidence of a given model compared to the best model. The value of the Bayes factor may be interpreted as being weak, moderate or strong evidence for the best model in favour of a given model <ref type="bibr">(Trotta 2008)</ref>. It may also be used to infer that the comparison is inconclusive, i.e., there is no evidence to favour one model over the other, if the Bayes factor between them is less than unity.</p><p>A few conclusions may be drawn from <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. First, cloud-free models are disfavoured. Second, there is weak evidence for non-isothermal behaviour, non-grey clouds and the presence of HCN and/or NH3, but overall the isothermal model with only water present and grey clouds is sufficient to fit the WFC3 transmission spectrum. In other words, there is no evidence for more complicated models to be favoured.</p><p>Again, note that the molecular opacities are sampled at 1 mbar, CIA is not included, m is fixed at 2.4mH and we have fixed R0 = 1.79 RJ and P0 = 10 bar.

This conclusion was based on the reasoning that the sodium and potassium lines may serve as diagnostics for cloudiness. The peaks of these resonant lines are hardly affected by clouds, but the line wings are, which makes the distance between the line peak and wing highly sensitive to the degree of cloudiness. If the optical transit chord is cloud-free, then we may associate the measured optical spectral slope with Rayleigh scattering by hydrogen molecules (H2), which yields a direct measurement of the pressure scale height (Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr">Etangs et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heng 2016</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">H = − 1 4 ∂R ∂ (ln λ) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where λ is the wavelength.

A uniform prior distribution of 1.619 to 1.799 RJ is set for R0, while a log-uniform prior distribution of 0.1 to 1000 bar is set for P0.</p><p>First, we create high-resolution mock transmission spectra with 100 data points that are representative of what will be possible with JWST. The uncertainty on each data point is assumed to be 10 parts per million (ppm). We explore pairs of retrievals in which R0 is held fixed and P0 is a fitting parameter, and vice versa. Second, we create a hierarchy of mock spectra to gain understanding into the retrieval outcomes: three molecules with grey clouds, water only with grey clouds and water only (cloud-free). All volume mixing ratios are set to 10 −3 for illustration, with a grey-cloud opacity of 10 −2 cm 2 g −1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the outcomes of 6 retrievals on highresolution mock spectra.

By contrast, R0 or P0 serves as a "translation factor", which shifts the spectrum up or down in transit radius or depth without altering its shape. Further insight is obtained by examining a pair of retrievals with water only but with grey clouds present. The presence of grey clouds provides an extra degree of freedom in the system in the form of a constant spectral continuum. Grey clouds mute spectral features, which may be compensated by an increase in the volume mixing ratio of water, which is clearly seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Note that the normalisation degeneracy is simultaneously present, as increases in XH 2 O and κ cloud are negated by decreases in P0 or R0. The lower bound on the water mixing ratio in this pair of retrievals is artificial and is set by the chosen upper limit of our prior on R0 or P0. This pair of cloudy retrievals with water only allows us to understand that the degeneracy may be broken, even in the presence of clouds, if multiple molecules are present to provide additional information on the shape of the spectrum. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the same suite of retrievals but for a low-resolution, WFC3-like spectrum with 20 data points. The uncertainty on each data point is assumed to be 50 ppm. For each of the 6 retrievals, we perform an additional retrieval in which R0 or P0 is held fixed at its true value (1.709 RJ or 8 bar). The lessons learnt and insights gleaned from the high-resolution retrievals carry over to the lowresolution ones. Tight constraints are obtained on the temperature. For the volume mixing ratios of the molecules, constraints are obtained at the order-of-magnitude level that encompass the true values, but it is important to note that the lower bounds are artefacts of assuming an upper limit for the prior of R0 or P0. Unlike in the high-resolution regime, the low-resolution retrievals do not provide tight constraints on either R0 or P0.</p><p>The key lesson learnt is that, for meaningful retrieval outcomes to be obtained, we have to assume a reasonable range of prior values for R0 or P0. Since we find it easier to have an intuition about P0, we will set the range of 0.1-1000 bar as the prior on P0. It then becomes important to set a value of R0 that corresponds to this range of P0 values (see §3.2.3).</p><p>To illustrate this point, we perform an additional mock retrieval in which the value of R0 is reduced and the corresponding P0 value falls outside of the 0.1-1000 bar range. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows that the posterior distribution for P0 bumps up against the upper boundary of the prior distribution, which results in errors in the retrieved values of temperature and water mixing ratio.</p></div>

The posterior distribution for P0 is only loosely constrained.

Yet, despite this inaccuracy in retrieving P0, the posterior distributions of the pair of retrievals agree well. This is somewhat surprising, because in our mock, low-resolution retrievals of WASP-17b we discovered that the volume mixing ratio of water is prior-dominated on its lower bound (and corresponds to the upper limit set on the prior of P0). To investigate this issue further, we ran an additional mock retrieval where the uncertainty on each data point is 200 ppm, instead of 50 ppm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows that the pair of retrievals now have posterior distributions that are more similar to each other, which implies that the retrieval with variable P0 is no longer as prior-dominated because there is now a larger parameter space of possibilities available to fit the mock spectrum. However, the retrieval outcomes are still better (the posterior distributions are narrower) when the uncertainties are smaller. The lesson learnt is that the lower bounds to volume mixing ratios retrieved from WFC3 transmission spectra may (or may not) be prior-dominated, depending on the measurement uncertainties.</p></div>

First, it suggests that our inferred XH 2 O values are not biased by the degree of cloudiness (or haziness) in these atmospheres. Second, the majority of atmospheric transit chords probed by WFC3 appear to have κ cloud ∼ 10 −2 cm 2 g −1 (corresponding to ∼ 10 mbar), regardless of the surface gravity or strength of insolation.

(2018)</ref>, as the one-parameter flat-line fit is among the models with Bayes factors of less than unity. For GJ 3470b, HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-11b, HAT-P-17b, HAT-P-18b, HAT-P-26b, HAT-P-32b, HAT-P38b, HD 149026b, HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b, HAT-P-41b, WASP-43b, WASP-52b, WASP-63b, WASP69b, WASP-74b, WASP-101b, WASP-121b and XO-1b, our retrieved water mixing ratios are broadly consistent with those of <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>. For WASP-39b and WASP76b, our retrieved water mixing ratios differ at the order-ofmagnitude level compared to <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>. Interestingly, these two objects also have the highest values of the Atmospheric Detectability Index (ADI) in the <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref> sample of 30 objects.</p><p>Of particular interest is WASP-76b, which is one of two <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We adopt the planetary science definition of "cloud" versus "haze": the former is formed thermochemically, while the latter is formed photochemically.</p><p>objects in our sample that requires a non-grey cloud to fit the data. <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref> reported that their retrieval favours a cloudfree interpretation, because the non-flat spectral continuum blueward of the 1.4-µm water feature may be fitted by the spectral features of TiO and VO. <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref> remark that their retrieved log XTiO ∼ −2.5 is "likely unphysical". Our retrieval yields log XH 2 O = −5.3 ± 0.61, which is inconsistent with the log XH 2 O = −2.7 ± 1.07 reported by <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>. The WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-76b demonstrates that a wider wavelength range is required to resolve the degeneracy associated with these modelling choices, which will be provided by JWST spectra. It is unclear why our retrieval outcome for WASP-39b differs from that of <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>, because they did not publish the full set of posterior distributions for this object, unlike for WASP-76b in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. For example, it is unclear if the high value of the ADI for WASP-39b translates into a cloud-free interpretation (which is the case for WASP-76b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Is there evidence for non-grey clouds? Is cloud composition constrained?</head><p>Cloud models of varying sophistication have been employed in retrieval models. Our approach is somewhat different in that we include in our hierarchy of retrievals both grey and non-grey cloud models, as well as a one-parameter flat line. For 8 out of 38 objects, the WFC3 transmission spectrum is explained by a flat line. For 35 out of 38 objects, an isothermal grey cloud model with water only is sufficient to explain the data. Only WASP-69b and WASP-76b have WFC3 transmission spectra that require an explanation by model atmospheres with non-grey clouds along the transit chord. Otherwise, there is generally no evidence for non-grey clouds being present in the sample of 38 objects.</p><p>Since the cloud composition may only be inferred for non-grey clouds, this implies that the composition is generally unconstrained, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn by <ref type="bibr">Tsiaras et al. (2018)</ref>. Even for WASP-69b and WASP-76b, the parameter Q0 is largely unconstrained because it spans the entire range of values set by the prior.</p><p>Given the retrieval outcomes, our approach to not consider patchy clouds <ref type="bibr">(Line &amp; Parmentier 2016</ref>) is justified. We have also shown that the normalisation degeneracy may be broken without appealing to the more complicated patchy cloud model, which was invoked by <ref type="bibr">MacDonald &amp; Mad- husudhan (2017)</ref> to break the degeneracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Is there evidence for non-isothermal transit chords?</head><p>For all 38 objects in our sample, we find a lack of strong Bayesian evidence to support non-isothermal transit chords probed by WFC3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">How prevalent is HCN or NH3?</head><p>Based on the best model selected by the Bayesian evidence, we find that only 6 objects have tentative evidence for the detection of ammonia: HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-17b, HAT-P-38b, HAT-P-41b, WASP-101b and HD 97658b. However, the retrieved value for HD 97658b is log(XNH 3 ) = −0.48 +0.19 −0.23 , which may be unphysically high. This is unsurprising as our model contains no chemistry, so there is nothing to prevent unphysical values being retrieved. HAT-P-17b and WASP101b also have tentative detections of hydrogen cyanide. , respectively. We estimate that log(XH 2 O) ≈ −3.2 assuming chemical equilibrium, solar abundance and a pressure of 10 mbar, which suggests that our retrieved water abundances are super-rather than subsolar as claimed by <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan et al. (2014)</ref>. The discrepancy arises from the retrievals of <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan et al. (2014)</ref> being cloud-free, while we have included a cloud model that smoothly transitions between the Rayleigh and large-particle regimes. It is consistent with the fact that cloud opacity diminishes the strength of the water feature, which may be negated by increasing XH 2 O.</p><p>4.6 What does the "metallicity" mean when interpreting spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres?</p><p>Several published studies have plotted the "metallicity" (in "solar" units) versus the mass of the exoplanet with entries from the Solar System gas and ice giants overplotted <ref type="bibr">(Krei- dberg et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wakeford et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Wakeford et al. , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">Arcangeli et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mansfield et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nikolov et al. 2018</ref>). As already elucidated by <ref type="bibr">Heng (2018)</ref>, there are several caveats to these plots. First, the "metallicity" is predominantly O/H in these studies. Second, the "mixing ratio of water at solar abundance" is a temperature-and pressure-dependent statement. Given a fixed value of O/H, the mixing ratio of water still depends on temperature and pressure. In other words, it is a function and not a number. Third, the conversion factor between the water mixing ratio and O/H is not always unity and depends on the elemental abundances (O/H, C/H, etc), carbon-to-oxygen ratio, temperature, pressure, photochemistry, atmospheric mixing, condensation, etc. For all of these reasons, we have chosen to present our retrieved water abundances as they are in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">Figure 29,</ref>   <ref type="bibr">Benneke, B., &amp; Seager, S. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, ApJ, 753, 100 Benneke, B., &amp; Seager, S. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, ApJ, 778, 153 Bétrémieux, Y., &amp; Swain, M.R. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, MNRAS, 467, 2834</ref><ref type="bibr">Biddle, L.I., Pearson, K.A., Crossfield, I.J.M., et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, MN- RAS, 443, 1810</ref><ref type="bibr">Boyajian, T., von Braun, K., Feiden, G.
