				<p>In 2015, K2 observations of the bright (V = 8.9, K = 7.7) star HIP 41378 revealed a rich system of at least five transiting exoplanets, ranging in size from super-Earths to gas giants. The 2015 K2 observations only spanned 74.8 days, and the outer three long-period planets in the system were only detected with a single transit, so their orbital periods and transit ephemerides could not be determined at that time. Here, we report on 50.8 days of new K2 observations of HIP 41378 from summer 2018. These data reveal additional transits of the long-period planets HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f, yielding a set of discrete possible orbital periods for these two planets. We identify the most probable orbital periods for these two planets using our knowledge of the planets&apos; transit durations, the host star&apos;s properties, the system&apos;s dynamics, and data from the ground-based HATNet, KELT, and WASP transit surveys. Targeted photometric follow-up during the most probable future transit times will be able to determine the planets&apos; orbital periods, and will enable future observations with facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope. The methods developed herein to determine the most probable orbital periods will be important for long-period planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, where similar period ambiguities will frequently arise due to the telescope&apos;s survey strategy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the conception of the K2 Mission, one of its major goals has been to detect small transiting planets orbiting nearby bright stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Howell et al. 2014</ref>). The original Kepler mission revealed a diversity of planets with widely varying sizes and equilibrium temperatures. It also showed that small planets, intermediate in size between the Earth and Neptune, are among the most common planets in our Galaxy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). Due to Kepler's narrow and deep survey strategy, most of its discoveries orbit stars that are too distant and faint for detailed follow-up study, so that only limited information can be gleaned about the physical properties of the newly discovered planet population beyond those discernible from the light curves.</p><p>After the original Kepler mission came to an end in , which are particularly amenable to follow-up studies, such as precise radial velocities and transit transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the yield from K2 includes six of the ten small planets (with R p &lt; 3R ⊕ ) with the best prospects for transmission spectroscopy discovered to date ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rodriguez et al. 2018b</ref>). These kinds of follow-up observations could significantly improve our understanding of these planets, yielding information about their interior structure and bulk composition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>), how they have been sculpted by processes like photoevaporation <ref type="bibr">(Ehren-reich et al. 2015</ref>), how, why and to what extent some planets form aerosols and hazes high in their atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crossfield &amp; Kreidberg 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">May et al. 2018)</ref>, and what kind of molecules constitute their atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morley et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>One of the most remarkable discoveries from the K2 mission was the HIP 41378 system, a bright (V=8.9, K=7.7) F-type star which was shown to host at least five transiting planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Vanderburg et al. 2016a</ref>, denoted as V16a hereafter). The HIP 41378 planetary system has a rich architecture reminiscent of some of Kepler's most famous planetary systems ), but orbits one of the brightest stars found by Kepler to host planets. As such, the HIP 41378 planets remain prime targets for follow-up measurements such as transmission spectroscopy. In particular, HIP 41378 f, with a radius only slightly smaller than Jupiter at 10.2 R ⊕ , provides a unique opportunity to study in transmission the atmosphere of a temperate gas giant. However, the precise orbital periods of the three outer planets (HIP 41378 d, e, and f) could not be determined from the original Campaign 5 data, since these planets were each only detected with a single transit. Without a precise transit ephemeris, it has not been possible to schedule and carry out transmission spectroscopy observations of these three planets.</p><p>Fortunately, however, K2 had the opportunity to observe HIP 41378 during the mission's 18 th campaign for an additional 51 days. Here, we analyze these new observations and show that K2 managed to catch two of the long-period planets a second time in transit. We combine previous results from V16a with the new Campaign 18 observations of HIP 41378 to make an updated assessment of the properties of this planetary system. In particular, we identify a set of discrete, precise, possible orbital periods for planets HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f, and assess the likelihood that each possible period is the true orbital period. Identifying these possible periods paves the way towards transmission spectroscopy and other follow up observations. Our methods for identifying the most probable orbital periods also demonstrate a strategy for determining a planet's period/ephemeris when multiple transits are observed, but not with sufficient duty cycle for the orbital period to be uniquely determined. This situation has been moderately common in K2, and will be even more important with upcoming observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. The data from the K2 Campaign 18 are described in Section 2.1, with a focus on the outer planets HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f, which were seen in transit during the observational window. This additional data is used to provide updated constraints on the properties of the HIP 41378 planetary system. In Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, we present observations from the KELT, HATNet and WASP surveys, respectively, which provide additional constraints on the system. In Section 3, we present results from the analysis of all four data sets, including updated stellar parameters and preliminary period estimations for HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f. In Section 4, we use a dynamical analysis to place improved constraints on the possible distributions of orbital periods and other orbital elements. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a summary of the results and a brief discussion of their implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>HIP 41378 was observed by Kepler for a total of about 126 days in both Campaigns 5 (C5) and 18 (C18) of the K2 mission. The data from K2 C5 showed evidence of the transits of five planets, three of which transiting once each during the original 74-day campaign (V16a). HIP 41378 has also been observed by several ground-based planet-hunting surveys, including the Hungarian-made Automated Telescope (HAT), Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) surveys, and the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">K2 data</head><p>During C5, HIP 41378 was only observed in longcadence mode (29.4 minute co-added exposures), but it was observed in short-cadence mode (58.34 second coadded exposures) during Campaign 18 due to the discovery of its planetary system. Analysis of the shortcadence data will likely yield improved parameters for the planets in the system and a detection of asteroseismic oscillations, but we defer this work until the final, pipeline-calibrated data is released by K2 team later in 2018. In this work, we focus on analysis of the longcadence data to determine precise possible orbital periods for HIP 41378 d and f, with a goal of determining the orbital periods as soon after the last transit of each planet as possible, so that the periods we identify as most likely can be monitored and eventually the true orbital periods will be identified by follow-up work.</p><p>2.1.1. Campaign 5 HIP 41378 was observed along with 25,850 other targets by the Kepler space telescope during C5 <ref type="bibr">April 27 -2015</ref> of the K2 mission. Upon downlink of the data, the K2 team processed the data with their photometric pipeline, to produce calibrated pixel files. V16a downloaded the pixel-level data, produced a light curve using the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref>, and then rederived the K2 systematics correction by simultaneously fitting the long-term stellar variability, pointing-related systematics, and transits of the five detected planets following the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vanderburg et al. (2016b)</ref>. We use the highly-precise (36 ppm scatter per 30 minute exposure) light curve produced from the simultaneous fit by V16a for our analysis. The C5 light curve is plotted in the third panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Campaign 18</head><p>HIP 41378 was observed along with 20,419 other targets by the Kepler space telescope during C18 <ref type="bibr">( May 12 -2018</ref> July 02) of the K2 mission. After the data was downlinked from the spacecraft, the raw cadence files were immediately uploaded to the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), before pixel-level calibration had been performed by the K2 team. In the interest of time, we used the raw, un-calibrated cadence files to produce a quick-look light curve of HIP 41378. We downloaded the cadence files from the MAST and used the kadenza software tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barentsen &amp; Cardoso 2018)</ref> to produce a pseudo-target pixel file containing the longcadence Kepler images from the postage stamp region around HIP 41378. We then used the procedure of <ref type="bibr">Van- derburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref> to process the K2 pixel data into a systematics-corrected light curve. We manually identified and excluded cadences from our systematics correction when Kepler was undergoing a reaction wheel desaturation event. We also manually excluded a continuous stretch of seven hours of data around time BJD -2454833 = 3431.85 when Kepler experienced a pointing anomaly. The systematics corrected light curve showed transits of four of the five known HIP 41378 planets: HIP 41378 b, c, d, and f. After performing a first-pass systematics correction with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref> method, we re-derived the systematics correction and re-processed the light curve following the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vanderburg et al. (2016b)</ref> to simultaneously fit for the long-term variability, pointing-related systematics, and the transits of the four planets seen in C18. This reprocessed light curve is plotted in the second panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The photometric precision of the light curve is about 40% worse (51 ppm scatter per 30 minute exposure) than the light curve from C5 as a result of using the un-calibrated pixel data.</p></div>

HATNet data HIP 41378 was a target observed by HATNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2004</ref>) between November 2, 2010 and June 3, 2011. HATNet is a telescope network which consists of six 11-cm, wide-field (10.6 degrees by 10.6 degrees field of view) aperture lenses on six different fully-automated telescope mounts, four of which are in Arizona and two of which are in Hawaii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2004</ref>). The HATNet observations for HIP 41378 were reduced as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>, using aperture photometry routines from image processing software FITSH (Pál 2012). The resultant light curves were outlier-clipped, smoothed, and detrended using the TFA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kovács et al. 2005</ref>). Due to the brightness of HIP 41378 the innermost pixels containing the center of the point spread function (PSF) are saturated in the HATNet observations of this star. Because the Apogee U16m 4K×4K CCDs used by HATNet incorporate anti-blooming gates, electrons exceeding the full pixel well are suppressed rather spilling over into neighboring pixels. To account for this, aperture photometry is performed only on the unsaturated pixels and then corrected for the flux not counted in the saturated pixels using the estimated PSF. This leads to bright/saturated stars having lower photometric precision than somewhat fainter/unsaturated stars. For HIP 41378 the HATNet observations have a RMS scatter of 14 mmag, compared to ∼ 4 mmag for the brightest unsaturated stars in the same images.</p><p>The full HAT data set for HIP 41378 is also plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, and consists of 12903 observations.</p><p>2.4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Updated Stellar Parameters</head><p>Our analysis to determine the most likely orbital periods of the long-period HIP 41378 planets depends directly on the adopted stellar parameters, especially the stellar density. V16a used observations from the TRES spectrograph on the 1.5m telescope at Mt. Hopkins, AZ to derive spectroscopic properties (including stellar metallicity, temperature, and V band magnitude) using the Stellar Parameter Classification (SPC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchhave et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Buchhave et al. , 2014</ref>) method. These values are reproduced in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. V16a determined fundamental stellar parameters (like the stellar mass and radius) using a parallax from the Hippacos mission, but since the publication of their work, the Gaia mission has released significantly more precise parallax measurements <ref type="bibr">(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016</ref>. Using the updated parallax from Gaia Data Release 2 (reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>), and the previous measured values of stellar metallicity, temperature, and V band magnitude, we used an online interface 1 to interpolate onto Padova stellar evolution tracks (da <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Silva et al. 2006</ref>). The resulting, updated values of stellar mass, stellar radius, and surface gravity are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>; thanks to the new, precise Gaia parallax, we are able to determine the stellar density, an important quantity for our dynamical analysis, with much higher precision than V16a.</p><p>We obtained an independent, empirical measure of the stellar radius via the method described by  Time <ref type="formula">(</ref> Although we do not know the true orbital period of any of these three planets, we plot the results of a LevenbergMarquardt fit of the transit model to the transit center for each event and center the plot on each fitted center.

The free parameters of the SED fit are then only the extinction (A V ) and an overall flux normalization. The bolometric flux at Earth (F bol ) is then obtained simply by direct summation of the (non-reddened) SED model. Finally, the stellar radius then follows from the F bol and T eff via the Stefan-Boltzmann relation.</p><p>We constructed the observed stellar SED using broadband fluxes spanning 0.2-20 µm from GALEX NUV, Tycho-2 B T V T , APASS BV gri, 2MASS JHK S , and WISE 1-4. We limited the maximum permitted A V to be that of the full line-of-sight extinction from the Galactic dust maps of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref>. The resulting best fit SED model, with a reduced χ 2 of 2.9, gives A V = 0.01 ± 0.01 and F bol = 6.91 ± 0.16 × 10 −9 erg s −1 cm −2 . Adopting the Gaia DR2 parallax, but adjusted by +0.08 mas to account for the systematic offset found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stassun &amp; Torres (2018)</ref>, we obtain R = 1.35±0.02 R , consistent with the radius from our analysis using the Padova isochrones.

Because the un-calibrated C18 data is of somewhat lower quality than the fully processed C5 data, we only performed the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization over one free parameter, the mid-transit time, while fixing the transit shape parameters (R 2 p /R 2 * , transit duration, impact parameter, and quadratic limb darkening parameters) to the values reported by V16a.</p><p>The resulting mid-transit times from our oneparameter optimizations of the C18 light curve and the mid-transit times determined by V16a from C5 are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.

Period Constraints from the K2 baseline and transit likelihood Planets HIP 41378 b and HIP 41378 c have welldetermined periods, as they transited multiple times in the C5 Kepler data. We also detect these two planets in our C18 dataset (three transits of HIP 41378 b and one transit of HIP 41378 c), but we defer a full analysis of these two planets in left for future work. Here, we focus our analysis on determining the orbital periods of HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f, which is a particularly promising target for transmission spectroscopy of a cold Jupiter, if its times of future transit could be determined.</p><p>In V16a, when we only had detected a single transit each of HIP 41378 d, e, and f, we were able to place broad constraints on their orbital periods. In the C18 data, HIP 41378 d and f each transit one more time each, yielding a discrete spectrum of possible orbital periods. Here, we combine broad constraints on the orbital periods and the discrete possible periods based on the times of the two detected transits to determine the most likely orbital periods for HIP 41378 d and f.</p><p>Our analysis to place broad constraints on the orbital periods of these planets closely follows that of V16a, with a handful of differences. In particular, V16a imposed a transit prior on the calculated orbital periods to account for the fact that planets HIP 41378 d, e, and f transited once during the 74-day baseline of C5 (see Equation 3 of V16a). Now that we have re-detected planets d and f in C18, we can update our prior on the orbital periods based on these new observations. As such, we impose a prior on both planets orbital periods which account for the fact that both HIP 41378 d and f were detected during both C5 and C18:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P i (P i , D i , B 1 , B 2 ) =    1 if P i − D i &lt; B 1 (B 1 + D i )/P i if B 1 &lt; P i − D i &lt; B 2 (B 1 + D i )(B 2 + D i )/P 2 i else,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P i is the chance of seeing planet i, B k the time baseline of the observations for campaign k, D i the planet's transit duration, and P i the orbital period of the planet in question. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we show the comparison between this analytic prior and a Monte Carlo simulation of transit probabilities for 20000 randomly chosen periods on the interval (0, 1000] days, with random centers of transit times on the same interval, and with randomly selected baseline separations (defined as the time between the last data point of the first campaign with baseline B 1 and the first data point of the second campaign with baseline B 2 ) on the range [0, 3000) days. The true separation between the end of C5 and the start of C18 was 1037.13 days, but Equation 1 describes the general transit probability for a planet with a given period which transits only twice in the K2 data: once in one campaign, and once in another. This prior (Eq. 1) describes generally the relative chances of planets with various orbital periods transiting over two observing campaigns. This general result can be applied to targets with unknown periods seen over multiple K2 campaigns, and will also be applicable to similar planets observed in two separated baselines by TESS. In this work, we will apply this probability as a prior in our calculation of the likelihood of each possible period for HIP 41378 d and f, as shorter period planets are more likely to transit over the observed baselines.</p><p>As done in V16a, we can find lower limits on the periods of HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f from then length of out-of-transit observations taken on either side of each event (see the middle two panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> to see visually the out-of-transit baseline on each side of each transit event). In C5, the data was acquired at times (BJD-2454833) between 2307.55 and 2381.41, for an official baseline of 73.86 days 2 . For C18, the data was acquired at times (BJD-2454833) between 3418.56 and  <ref type="bibr">[BJD]</ref> 2458271.0740± 0.0008 Transit Duration D <ref type="bibr">[hours]</ref> 18.998± 0.051</p><p>Note. -Parameters for host star HIP 41378 and considered planets HIP 41378-d and HIP 41378-f.

(2016a)</ref>, and stellar properties (M, R, stellar age, B-V magnitude, and log g) have been updated with values using the Gaia parallax (9.37993950 mas ± 0.059037831). The time of transits are reported for both campaign 5 (C5) and campaign 18 (C18).</p><p>3469.40 days, for a total baseline of 50.86 days. We assumed that for a 'detection' to occur, any part of the planet's ingress or egress must have occurred during the K2 observations. Using these times, as well as the center of transit times and duration for each transit event, we can compute the minimum periods which are allowed given the single detection in each campaign as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P min = max(t c + D/2 − B i , B f − t c + D/2) (2)</formula><p>where B i denotes the beginning time of the campaign, B f denotes the end time of the campaign, t c denotes the measured center time of transit for the observed transit event, and D denotes the planetary transit duration. The C5 center for HIP 41378 d (with transit duration 12.71 hours) was 2457166.2629 BJD, and the C18 center was 2458279.709 BJD. Similarly, the C5 center for HIP 41378 f (with transit duration 18.998 hours) was 2457186.91451 BJD, and the C18 center was 2458271.0740 BJD.</p><p>From this, we compute a minimum period of 48.1 days for HIP 41378 d and a minimum period of 46.4 for HIP 41378 f. Both of these limits come from the C5 data, which had a longer observational baseline. From these limits, we can exclude any periods for these planets less than these values: if the true periods were smaller than these values, we should have seen evidence of a second transit in the C5 data.</p><p>Finally, the fact that HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f transit twice allows us to define their orbital periods as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P j = t j,18 − t j,5 i ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>when j denotes the planet and i is some integer. This equation, combined with the lower limits previously derived, provides a discrete set of possible orbital periods for each planet. For example, there are 23 possible orbital periods for HIP 41378 f, ranging between ∼47.1 days (the lowest possible value that exceeds our lower limit on the period) and ∼1084 days (if no intermediate transits occurred in between the two we observed). The possible periods for each planet are given in the first column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2 and Table 3</ref> respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">REFINING PLANETARY ORBITAL PERIODS</head><p>4.1. Excluding orbital periods using all HAT/KELT/WASP data In Equation 3, we gave an expression for the possible orbital periods for each planet, based on the time at which the two observed events occur for each planet. The HAT/KELT/WASP data subtend a significant observational baseline, and the transit event of HIP 41378 f is relatively deep (0.5%). As such, these ground-based surveys should be able to detect the transit, if the transit happened to occur while the surveys were observing the star. There are a large number of possible orbital periods, so we evaluate the KELT/HAT/WASP evidence  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-We show the normalized probability density function for the chance of observing at least two transits, with at least one in each of two K2 campaigns, for some planet. Plotted here is a comparison of the analytically derived Equation 1 (solid line) with a numerically computed Monte Carlo simulation of observability probability by orbital period (histogram). The distributions plotted here were computed for planet HIP 41378 f, for two K2 campaigns with baselines B 1 = 74 days and B 2 = 51 days, separated by some unspecified length of time. This generalized form describes the chance that only two transits of a planet would be seen over two K2 campaigns, and the good agreement between the simulation and analytic form suggests that Eq. 1 can be adopted as the baseline prior in cases where a planet with an unknown period is observed over multiple K2 campaigns. Also plotted in comparison is the minimum value of eccentricity (in red) at each orbital period that allows recreation of the observed duration, and (black dotted line) the probability distribution for each eccentricity, as derived from the cumulative density function of the Kipping beta distribution eccentricity prior (where all values larger than the minimum eccentricity at each period are considered able to reproduce the true transit duration).</p><p>for each orbital period by computing the likelihood ratio for two models: a flat line and the transit model. To do this, we first clipped the light curve by removing all points 3.6σ from the median flux level. Then, we phasefolded the light curve at each possible orbital period, and computed the following likelihood ratio:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L = exp [− i=N i=0 (0.5(f (t i ) − m(t i )) 2 σ −2 i )] exp [− i=N i=0 (0.5(f (t i ) − ¯ f ) 2 σ −2 i )]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where f (t i ) denotes the KELT, HAT, or WASP flux at each exposure time t i , m(t i ) denotes the transit model (using the best-fit parameters from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> and the transit model from Mandel &amp; Agol 2002) at some exposure time, ¯ f denotes the weighted mean KELT/HAT/WASP flux (a flat line model set to be the weighted mean of the out-of-transit baseline, which is expected to be the best model if no transit occurs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref>, and σ i denotes the error on the flux measurements, which is set to be σ i = kσ obs,i , where the measured errors σ obs for all data points of the each data set have independently been scaled by a factor of k, so that the reduced χ 2 for the flat line model for each full data-set is roughly 1. The errors on the KELT, HAT, and WASP data-sets are derived and scaled independently.</p><p>The likelihood ratio defined in Eq. 4 is the ratio of the likelihood of the flat line model to the likelihood of the transit model. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we show the phase folded HAT/KELT/WASP light curve at each orbital period. For each orbital period, we compute the likelihood ratio using the entire HAT/KELT/WASP combined, phasefolded data-set. The result is one likelihood ratio L for each orbital period, describing the relative likelihood of the two models. For likelihood ratios L greater than 10 4 , where the flat line model is highly preferred to the transit model, we consider the corresponding orbital period ruled out.</p><p>In each panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we label the orbital period depicted and color the text corresponding to the computed value of the likelihood ratio L: red text indicates that an orbital period can be considered ruled out, and blue text indicates that a particular period cannot be ruled out. For likelihood ratios less than 10 4 , we consider the evidence too weak to discriminate between the models. Our choice of 10 4 as the significant likelihood ratio was purposefully conservative, decreasing the probability of incorrectly rejecting a particular orbital period. For the orbital periods we could rule out based on this test, we set the probabilities to be unlikely (defined as &lt; 0.1%) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. The analysis of the combined KELT, HAT, and WASP data allowed us to eliminate 16 of the 23 possible orbital periods for HIP 41378 f to this significance level. We note that analysis of any of the individual data sets alone could not rule out all 16 orbital periods: the full result of this method was achieved by combining the three ground-based data sets.</p><p>We also performed the same algorithm described above on the predicted orbital periods for HIP 41378 d, but no periods could be excluded (as expected for a transit event of the much smaller measured depth of HIP 41378 d). Additionally, we conducted a pre-recovery search in the KELT data using the fixed-duration and fixed T C BLS method, as implemented in the VARTOOLS package <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hartman &amp; Bakos 2016)</ref>, with an approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yao et al. (2018)</ref>. Using the transit time and transit duration for HIP 41378 f as determined from V16a, we searched 300,000 trials evenly spaced in frequency from 150 to 450 days. The strongest peak in the BLS output corresponds to 328.59 days, with a signal-to-pink noise statistic of 2.4, which is below the 10% confidence level for a transit with the corresponding depth and duration, as determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yao et al. (2018)</ref>. As such, this is not considered a plausible detection.</p></div>

We then compute the likelihood ratio between the two cases to determine whether a flat model is preferable to the transit model. In red are the orbital periods with likelihood ratios of 10000 or more, where the flat line model is heavily preferred. In blue are the orbital periods for which a determination between the two models cannot be made. Grey points are true data points from the HAT and KELT surveys, and red points are the weighted mean for each bin, with errors equal to the weighted error on the mean.

The resultant series of 10000 orbital periods all geometrically produce the observed transit durations, and can as such be considered plausible.</p><p>The orbital periods drawn from this distribution are not necessarily equally physically likely, however. To ensure their feasibility, we use two additional criteria based on the dynamical stability of the planetary system as a whole. V16a used an extensive set of numerical simulations to determine that eccentricities above e ∼ 0.37 lead to dynamical instability (defined as collisions or ejections within 1 Myr) in the five-planet HIP 41378 system. Additionally, systems are generally expected to be dynamically unstable when their drawn initial conditions are Hill-unstable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>). As such, we exclude from our distribution of dynamically feasible periods any draw which either is Hill-unstable or has planetary eccentricities above 0.37. The result is roughly 5100 orbital periods for each planet that are both consistent with the measured transit duration and adhere to our dynamical stability criterion. A normalized histogram of these orbital periods is shown for each planet in <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>. This histogram represents the probability distribution for the orbital period of each planet, based on only its measured duration and the orbital elements physically likely to cause such a duration.</p><p>We note that for future analysis for other systems, the eccentricity cut we use to exclude dynamically unstable systems will need to be re-derived, as it was derived from numerical simulations for this specific system. The probabilistic exclusion used here will not apply to all systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Final period constraints for HIP 41378 d and</head><p>HIP 41378 f In this paper, we have constructed various constraints from direct analysis of the light curve, statistical analysis, and dynamical modeling. We list here the constraints that we have placed on the planetary periods:</p><p>• A list of possible periods based on the measured times of transit center for each planet (Eq. 3)</p><p>• The statistical baseline prior (Sec. 3.3; also see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>)</p><p>• Lower limits on the orbital periods from the outof-transit C5 baseline (Section 3.3)</p><p>• A distribution of dynamically feasible periods, based on the measured durations and orbital stability</p><p>• Exclusions of particular orbital periods from the combined KELT data and HAT data (this constraint is available only for HIP 41378 f, which had the deeper transit event)</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, we illustrate the final continuous probability distribution with a solid line. This distribution is the normalized product of the baseline transit probability (Eq. 1) and the PDF constructed by convolving a Gaussian kernel with the histogram of dynamically feasible periods (generated from Eq. 5 and described in the previous section). Squares denote the possible orbital periods based on Eq. 3, and some of these periods can be excluded using the KELT and HAT data. Notably, all of the periods below ∼ 100 days can be excluded for HIP 41378f. Using these constraints, we construct individual probability estimates for the possible orbital periods in the following way. First, we exclude all orbital periods generated by Eq. 3 that fall below the lower limit derived by Eq. 2. Then, for each remaining orbital period, we extract the probability from the interpolated product of the baseline prior and the PDF of dynamically feasible periods (this function is plotted as the solid line in <ref type="figure">Fig.  4</ref>) at exactly that orbital period. We repeat this for each possible period, and then normalize the total probability for all discrete periods to be equal to one. The resultant periods and their corresponding normalized probabilities are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2 and Table 3.</ref> 4.4. Final period constraints for HIP 41378 e HIP 41378 e transited once during K2 C5, but did not transit during C18 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). As such, we do not have discrete guesses for its true orbital period; however, we can exclude any orbital period that would have led to a transit being observable during C18. To construct an additional PDF that represents this scenario, we test each possible orbital period for HIP 41378 e between 72 days (the minimum orbital period permitted by Eq. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>) and 1200 days. Then, we allow t e,18 to vary between the times of the first and last data points of C18. If Eq. 3 is satisfied for some integer i for any value of t e,18 on this range, then we consider this particular period "observable" in C18, and set the probability that it is the true orbital period of HIP 41378 e to zero. The result of this pruning (normalized so the maximum probability is equal to the maximum probability of the PDF constructed from the results of the baseline PDF and dynamical analysis) is shown in grey in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>The final orbital period for HIP 41378 e cannot be directly constrained due to the lack of a transit in the C18 data; the best that can be done without follow-up observations is the probabilistic period estimation presented in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.    <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.-The derived probability distributions for orbital period for HIP 41378 d (top panel) and HIP 41378 f (bottom panel). The histogram denotes the periods consistent with the measured transit duration, and the height of each bin describes the relative likelihood of each period from dynamical constraints alone. The solid line is the product of the histogram convolved with a Gaussian kernel and the baseline prior (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>), which assigns a higher probability to orbital periods with a higher likelihood of transiting during the observed K2 campaigns. At each square point (which correspond to the possible discrete orbital periods), we read off the value of the solid line to get the relative probabilities, which must subsequently be normalized once all possible periods are identified. The results of this analysis at each discrete periods are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Tables 2 and 3</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we have identified a discrete set of precise possible orbital periods for the long-period transiting planets HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f, and have assessed the likelihood that each of these possible orbital periods is indeed the true orbital period. While we have significantly constrained the possible orbital periods of these two planets (we have ruled out about 25% of the possible periods at confidence &lt;1.5% for planet d and 80% of possible periods for planet f), our analysis is so far unable to uniquely determine the true orbital periods of these planets. Additional follow-up observations will be necessary to ultimately identify the true orbital periods and enable future studies with facilities like JWST.</p><p>To determine the true orbital periods for HIP 41378 d and f, the strategy is fairly straightforward. The additional transits during C18 and our identification of precise possible orbital periods makes it possible to schedule targeted transit follow-up observations at these most likely periods. The 0.5% transit depth of HIP 41378 f makes it possible to detect the transit with groundbased telescopes, although the long (19 hour) transit duration will make it impossible to observe the transit from a single observatory. The multi-site Las Cumbres Observatory telescopes, which have demonstrated the ability to produce continuous precise light curves across multiple observing sites around the globe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boyajian et al. 2018</ref>), may be well suited to detect the long duration transit of HIP 41378 f. The shallower (800 ppm) transits of HIP 41378 d, however, will likely require space-based resources such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, or potentially the CHEOPS space telescope once it launches in 2019, for confirmation.</p><p>Because of HIP 41378 d's shorter orbital period, and the fact that our ground-based data from HAT and KELT were unable to detect or rule out its shallow transits, there are a large number of possible orbital periods, many of which have roughly equal probabilities of being the true orbital period. Observing transits at all of these possible transit times would be an expensive observing program for a precious resource like Spitzer. However, it should be possible to significantly increase the efficiency of Spitzer follow-up observations for these possible orbital periods because of how many of these periods are related to one another by harmonics. For example, a single Spitzer non-detection of a transit of HIP 41378 d on the observation opportunity on 2019 June 16 (371.149 days after the C18 transit) would rule out four possible orbital periods <ref type="bibr">(371.149, 185.574, 123.716, and 61.858 days)</ref>. Taking advantage of these harmonic relationships between the possible orbital periods may significantly decrease the amount of observing time needed to identify the true period of HIP 41378 d.</p><p>Determining the orbital period of HIP 41378 e is significantly more difficult than HIP 41378 d and f. Since K2 reobserved HIP 41378 for 51 days and did not detect a second transit of HIP 41378 e, it is likely the orbital period is longer than that of HIP 41378 d, despite their very similar transit durations. The shallow transit depth of only about 0.15% will likely require long stares with highly precise space-based photometers to re-  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The grey line describes the relative probability of each orbital period, given that HIP 41378 e did not transit during C18.

In the bottom panel, we show the normalized product of the Baseline + Dynamics PDF and the grey curve.</p><p>detect. The first opportunity for a re-detection will come fairly soon with the newly commissioned TESS spacecraft. TESS will observe HIP 41378 f in early 2019 (2019 January 7 to 2019 February 2) during Sector 7 of its prime mission 3 and should have sufficient photometric precision to detect the transit of HIP 41378 e. If no transits are detected during the Sector 7 TESS monitoring of HIP 41378, TESS may monitor HIP 41378 for a longer period of time in an extended mission, which could provide additional opportunities to detect the transit of this planet. If TESS is unable to re-detect HIP 41378 e, CHEOPS may be able to, if HIP 41378 is added to its monitoring program. The long duration of the transit could make it an efficient CHEOPS target, where only sparse observations are necessary to sample the transit shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The uniqueness of HIP 41378 f</head><p>The detection of a second transit of HIP 41378 d and f provides a path towards determining their precise orbital periods and enabling follow-up opportunities for these two long-period gas giant planets. While both planets present intriguing prospects for observations like transmission spectroscopy, HIP 41378 f is a particularly unique target. Depending on its true orbital period, the equilibrium temperature of HIP 41378 f likely ranges between 300 K and 400 K (assuming an albedo similar to Jupiter's), significantly cooler than all other transiting gas giant planets well suited for transmission spectroscopy. We queried the NASA Exoplanet Archive 4 Confirmed Planet Table on 2 September 2018, and identified all transiting planets larger than 0.8 R J and orbital periods longer than 150 days. Among the nine stars which host planets satisfying these criteria, HIP 41378 is the brightest by a factor of about 15 in H-band. Once a unique transit ephemeris has been determined, the brightness of HIP 41378 should make transmission spectroscopy observations of this long-period temperate gas giant feasible.</p><p>HIP 41378 f will likely remain a uniquely interesting target for transmission spectroscopy into the TESS era as well. We downloaded the predicted TESS planet detection yields from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref> and searched again for planets larger than 0.8 R J with orbital periods longer than 150 days. Over the course of its two year prime mission, TESS is expected to detect only about three such planets. In the TESS realization from <ref type="bibr">Sulli- van et al. (2015)</ref>, none of the host stars of these planets are brighter than HIP 41378. It is also likely that any similar long-period planets detected by TESS will have similar orbital period ambiguities to those posed by HIP 41378 (more than 1200 single-transit planets are expected to be found in the full frame images, some of which will have periods longer than 250 days; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Villanueva et al. 2018</ref>), so it may be a long time before any longperiod TESS discoveries will have precisely determined transit ephemerides to enable follow-up. Now that HIP 41378 f has a straightforward path towards a well determined orbital period, it is likely this planet will be one of the best to study the atmosphere of Jovian planets in temperate, nearly Earth-like irradiation environments. Note. -Possible orbitals periods and their relative likelihoods, based on the dynamical analysis described in Section4. Values may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Errors on orbital periods were computed with σ = (t 2 c,5 + t 2 c,18 ) 1/2 /n, when n denotes the number of full cycles between C5 and C18, and tc denotes the uncertainty on center time of transit in each campaign. Errors on the orbital period are lower when a larger number of periods have elapse since the C5 observation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">HIP 41378 as a road-map for TESS period determinations</head><p>A additional motivation of the work in this paper is to provide a blueprint for future period-recovery efforts. In the era of TESS, many more planets for which the exact orbital period cannot be determined will be discovered. Due to the TESS survey strategy, in some cases, stars will be observed with significant gaps in between periods of observations. For example, according to the Web TESS Viewing Tool 5 , the southern circumpolar star δ Mensae will be observed by TESS during Sectors 1,5,8,12, and 13 for 28 days each, with gaps of 84 days, 56 days, and 84 days between subsequent periods of observation. Any planet detected by TESS in this region of sky with a period longer than about 28 days could have ambiguous orbital periods due to the observational strategy. The different constraints we used to narrow down the possible orbital periods for the HIP 41378 planets provided in Section 4.3 can serve as a starting point for future analysis on TESS planets with similar orbital period ambiguities.</p><p>Some results, such as the generalized transit probability by transit baseline (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>), can be derived merely by substituting in the values for campaign baseline and other easily obtained parameters. Similarly, the expected period distribution can be derived from transit duration (Eq. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>), as long as sensible priors are applied. For example, in V16a, we pointed out the importance of allowing planets to have non-zero eccentricities when computing period estimates from transit durations: a null eccentricity prior artificially narrows the distribution of possible orbital periods.</p><p>On the other hand, some additional constraints may take significantly more work to derive for some systems. In particular, for multi-planet systems with ambiguous orbital periods, dynamical constraints should be derived uniquely (either using numerical simulations or other dynamical techniques) for each system, and may place tighter limits in some systems than others.</p><p>Finally, period estimations can be improved by using additional data. The analysis in this paper also shows the importance of legacy ground-based surveys in the TESS era. Through a combination of existing photometric data from such as HAT and KELT and dynamical analysis, the most likely orbital periods for individual planets can be determined, which allows for an efficient use of limited follow-up telescope resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY</head><p>In this paper, we have refined the estimates for the orbital periods of HIP 41378 d and HIP 41378 f to provide updated predictions of the transit ephemerides. Although unique orbital periods cannot yet be determined, we have constrained the possibilities and have identified the most likely candidate orbital periods. Additional observations that probe each of the most likely orbital periods will allow a determination of the true orbital period for each planet. The orbital periods that should be tested are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Tables 2 and 3</ref>. One of the primary motivations for this analysis is to recover the transit of HIP 41378 f, a Jupiter-size planet which may be a particularly interesting target for additional in-transit study (such as transit spectroscopy).</p><p>The methods developed in this work can be applied to multi-planet systems discovered in the future (e.g., where only single transits are observed). The TESS mission is expected to discover many such systems. In addition, some of the TESS targets are expected to have variable baselines between continuous viewing periods, resulting in a cadence similar to the gaps between campaigns in K2. As a result, true period and ephemeris determinations will be imperative for the subsequent study of many planetary systems discovered by TESS.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of a parallel paper on the new K2 observations of HIP 41378: <ref type="bibr">Berdaro et al.
