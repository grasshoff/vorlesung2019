				<p>Photochemistry induced by stellar UV flux should produce haze particles in exoplanet atmospheres. Recent observations indicate that haze and/or cloud layers exist in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, photochemical processes in exoplanetary atmospheres remain largely unknown. We performed laboratory experiments with the PHAZER chamber to simulate haze formation in a range of exoplanet atmospheres (hydrogen-rich, water-rich, and carbon dioxide-rich at 300, 400, and 600 K), and observed 2 the gas phase compositional change (the destruction of the initial gas and the formation of new gas species) during these experiments with mass spectrometer. The mass spectra reveal that distinct chemical processes happen in the experiments as a function of different initial gas mixture and different energy sources (plasma or UV photons). We find that organic gas products and O 2 are photochemically generated in the experiments, demonstrating that photochemical production is one of the abiotic sources for these potential biosignatures. Multiple simulated atmospheres produce organics and O 2 simultaneously, which suggests that even the co-presence of organics and O 2 could be false positive biosignature. From the gas phase composition changes, we identify potential precursors (C 2 H 2 , HCN, CH 2 NH, HCHO, etc.) for haze formation, among which complex reactions can take place and produce larger molecules. Our laboratory results indicate that complex atmospheric photochemistry can happen in diverse exoplanet atmospheres and lead to the formation of new gas products and haze particles, including compounds (O 2 and organics) that could be falsely identified as biosignatures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last two decades, but the majority of them do not have an analogue in our solar system, such as those planets with size or mass between Earth's and Neptune's (i.e., super-Earths and mini-Neptunes). These two types of exoplanets are the most abundant types of planets and are expected to exhibit a wide variety of atmospheric compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, which launched in April 2018, will find more super-Earths and mini-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other future telescopes. Clouds and/or hazes are present in every solar system planetary atmosphere and are expected to be present in exoplanet atmospheres based on our understanding of particle formation in planetary atmospheres. Recent observations have shown that clouds and/or hazes play a significant role in the atmospheres of small, cool exoplanets 6-10 , such as GJ 1214b, HD 97658b, GJ 436b, and GJ 3470b. Although a variety of equilibrium cloud decks are expected at various temperatures as specific molecular and atomic species condense in the atmosphere, photochemical hazes can potentially be formed over a range of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</p><p>However, very little is known about the photochemical processes for haze formation in these exoplanet atmospheres as the atmospheric phase space (sub-Neptune atmospheres in the 300-600 K temperature range) has been largely unexplored. This lack of knowledge about haze formation will limit our ability to interpret the exoplanet observations and characterize exoplanet atmospheres. It is extremely challenging to theoretically simulate the complex chemical processes for haze formation over a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres. Laboratory simulations have improved our understanding of haze formation in Solar System bodies (e.g., Titan <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ) and could provide critical information on haze formation/properties for exoplanets. We have performed a series of laboratory atmosphere simulation experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> that explored a broad range of atmospheric parameters relevant to super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We reported haze production rates and the particle size distributions measured in these experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . These experiments started with nine different gas mixtures that yielded a wide variety of haze particle production rates. We monitored the gas composition with a mass spectrometer during these experiments. Here we present the gas phase chemistry in the experiments. We first evaluate the destruction of the original gases and identify newly formed gas species from the mass spectra, and then try to find out the gas precursors that may be indicative of photochemistry and haze formation. We also investigate connections between gas composition and haze production rate and explore possible photochemical pathways in these atmospheric scenarios. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Schematic of the PHAZER experimental setup used for this work. The PHAZER setup allows us to use one of two energy sources: a cold plasma generated by an AC glow discharge or FUV photons produced by a hydrogen lamp. Note that the schematic shown here provides a concept of our setup. The details of the setup varied due to the large variety of gases used for these experiments. Detailed description of the setup and experimental procedure can be found in our previous papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</p></div>

The PHAZER chamber allows us to conduct simulation experiments over a broad range of atmospheric parameters with one of two energy sources (AC plasma or FUV photons). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the initial gas mixtures for our experiments, calculated from the chemical equilibrium models 3 for 100×, 1000×, and 10000× solar metallicity over a range of temperatures (300, 400, and 600 K). More details about the chemical equilibrium model and the gas mixtures can be found in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Residual Gas Analyzer</head><p>Metallicity is a simple proxy that captures the enhancement of elements heavier than hydrogen over solar nebular values. The higher metallicity represents more heavier molecules (hydrogen-poor) in the atmosphere. A much more compositionally diverse range of atmospheres are expected for hydrogen-poor atmospheres, which could lead to a much wider variety of atmospheric chemistries. A deeper investigation into gas-phase chemistry and haze production in hydrogen-poor atmospheres is warranted, and for the time being, the 10000× solar metallicity atmosphere is representative of one possible outcome for such an atmosphere. Many exoplanet atmosphere forward models and retrieval codes assume thermochemical equilibrium, so it is important to investigate experimentally how photochemistry might alter the equilibrium gas concentrations in an exoplanet atmosphere. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The initial gas mixture compositions used in our experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . The phase space spans temperature from 300 to 600 K and metallicity from 100 to 10,000× solar. Note that equilibrium chemistry calculations assuming various enhancements over solar nebular values were used to determine initial gas mixtures 3 . The 100× (H 2 -rich), 1000× (H 2 -rich for 600 K, or H 2 O-rich for 400 and 300 K), and 10000× (CO 2 -rich) solar metallicity here is used to describe the abundance of heavier molecules present in exoplanet atmospheres. We only included gases with a calculated abundance of ≥1% to maintain a manageable level of experimental complexity. The pressure, temperature and gas compositions used in the experiments are self-consistent based on the model calculations.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , the chemical equilibrium calculated atmospheric composition scenarios provide a reasonable starting point for our study. Premixed gas mixture flows through a heating coil, which heats the gas mixture to the experimental temperature (600, 400, or 300 K). The gas flow rate is 10 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) and the pressure in the reaction chamber is maintained at a few mbar (depending on the temperature). The heated gas mixture is exposed to AC glow discharge (plasma), or UV photons from a UV lamp (HHeLM-L from Resonance Ltd., a hydrogen light source producing UV radiation from 110 to 400 nm). The plasma or the UV radiation dissociates and/or ionizes the reactant gases and initiates chemical reactions in the chamber. Newly formed gas products and remaining reactant gases flow out of the chamber, while any solid produced in the experiment remains. The experiments run continuously for 72 hours and gases flowing out of the chamber are monitored with a Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA, a quadrupole mass spectrometer). The detailed experimental procedure was described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The spectrum of the UV lamp used in these experiments (right axis) (as provided by the manufacturer, Resonance Ltd.) and the absorption cross sections of the gases we used in these experiments (left axis). Note that the cross sections of N 2 and CO are not shown here because they are very low (near zero) in this wavelength range. UV radiation and electrical discharge are the two main types of energy sources used to mimic one or several of the energy sources capable of generating radicals and other activated species in planetary atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Since it is impossible to perfectly replicate the energy environment of a planetary atmosphere in the lab, we compare the results from two different energy sources. UV photons are the main drivers of photochemistry in atmospheres of solar system bodies (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, and Pluto), and stellar UV radiation should induce photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres. The UV lamp we used here is similar to that used for simulating photochemistry in the atmospheres of early Earth and Titan <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . The spectrum (110 to 180 nm) of the lamp and the absorption cross sections of the gases used in our experiments are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The photons produced by the lamp (110 to 400 nm) are not sufficiently energetic to directly dissociate very stable molecules such as N 2 or CO, but previous studies with similar UV lamps suggested that nitrogen can be incorporated into the molecular structure of haze particles through an unknown photochemical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</p><p>The energy inputs of charged particles (i.e., cosmic rays, magnetospheric protons, and electrons) could also play a significant role in the upper atmosphere. The plasma produced by the AC glow discharge might be able to simulate electrical activities and/or charged particles in planetary upper atmospheres. The plasma can provide sufficient energy to directly break very stable molecules such as N 2 or CO. In addition, the AC glow discharge is a cold plasma source and does not alter the neutral gas temperature significantly, which is often used as an analogue for the relatively energetic environment of planetary upper atmospheres 15 .</p><p>The AC glow discharge and the UV photons we used in the experiments are two different types of energy sources to simulate different processes in planetary atmospheres. Because photochemistry in planetary atmospheres usually occurs on extended time scales, laboratory simulations usually use power densities that are greater than what is actually experienced in a real atmosphere 15 in order to observe obvious compositional change and/or yield a sufficient quantity of material for analysis in a reasonable time period. We estimated the energy densities of two different energy sources and compared them to small (2 Earth radius), cool (equilibrium temperature: 300 to 600 K) exoplanets around a given host M-star (3000 K). The energy density of the AC glow discharge is about 170 W/m 2 , which is ~5 times greater than that of the UV lamp (110 nm to 400 nm, 36 W/m 2 ). The UV flux (110 to 400 nm) from the host M-star that reaches to the exoplanet is about 0.312 W/m 2 (300 K equilibrium temperature) to 4.62 W/m 2 (600 K equilibrium temperature).</p><p>The energy densities of both energy sources are higher than that in the hypothetical small, cool exoplanets. In our experiments, 72-hour of exposure to the AC glow discharge roughly corresponds to between 110 days (for 600 K exoplanet) and 1600 days (for a 300 K exoplanet) of UV irradiation from the host M-star; 72-hour of exposure to the UV photons is equivalent to between 23 days (for 600 K exoplanet) and 346 days (for a 300 K exoplanet) of UV irradiation from the given host M-star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Gas Phase Composition Measurement</head><p>A small portion of the gas mixture flowing out of the chamber is channeled into the RGA (Stanford Research Systems) where the gas phase products are analyzed. The RGA is a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a mass range of 1 to 300 amu, a resolution of approximately 0.5 amu, and a minimum detectable partial pressure of 10 -11 torr. It has an electron ionization (EI) source and a standard 70 eV energy is used in our measurements.</p><p>The scanning mass range is 1-100 amu and each scan takes about 2 minutes. Before introducing gas mixture to the RGA chamber, the background in the RGA chamber (a few 10 -7 Torr) is first measured (50 scan). After the background scan, the gas mixture is introduced into RGA chamber (a few 10 -5 Torr) and a 50-scan average mass spectrum of the gas mixture is collected before turning on the plasma or the UV lamp. After turning on the plasma or the UV lamp, we allow the gas mixture to flow for 30 minutes to reach steady state before we take gas phase measurements. In each experiment, we take the RGA measurements multiple times, and the resulted mass spectra are consistent aside from the noise. We average all the scans (1000 scans) for the duration of each experiment to lower the noise level, and obtain an average mass spectrum (MS). The RGA background is removed from both mass spectra of the gas mixture with the plasma (or the UV lamp) off and on. The total intensity of all peaks (1 to 100 amu) in each spectrum is used as a fixed reference to normalize the peaks because the flow rates of the mixtures are the same for all the experiments. Thus, we can compare the normalized mass spectra and find out the changed peaks.</p><p>To minimize potential contamination, our chamber was cleaned thoroughly with detergent and solvents, further cleaned by using an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 minutes, and then baked at 400 K for 12 hours. The chamber was pumped down to 10 -3 Torr and was continuously pumped for 24 hours before running the experiment. We also ran a reference experiment without plasma or UV exposure at 600 K with the 600 K-10000× metallicity gas mixture for 72 hours. During the reference experiment, we monitored the gas mixture with the RGA and did not observe any compositional changes in the gas mixture. When analyzing the RGA data from the plasma and UV experiments, we removed the RGA background, normalized the mass spectra, and then determined the changed peaks in the normalized mass spectra. Therefore, the changed peaks are due to the photochemistry induced by plasma or UV photons, rather than contamination from the chamber or the initial gas mixture. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The mass spectra of gas mixture for the 400 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment, with plasma off (gas scan, black) and on (plasma scan, red). MS peaks from 1 to 60 amu are shown since the heavier peaks are near the noise level (8×10 -11 ). The initial gases, H 2 , (2 amu, 1.9%), He (4 amu, 14.7%), CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the mass spectra (MS) of the gas mixture for the 400 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment with plasma off and on (the RGA background is removed from both spectra). The initial gases are shown in the spectra, including H 2 , (2 amu), He (4 amu), CH 4 (16 amu), H 2 O (18 amu), N 2 (28 amu), and CO 2 (44 amu). Besides the molecular ion peaks, the isotope peaks and fragment peaks (caused by 70 eV electron impact) are also shown in the MS. The species listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> are the most probable, most abundant species. The resolution of the mass spectra is not high enough to resolve the species with identical nominal mass for higher mass, thus there are several possibilities for higher mass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mass Spectra of Gas Phase Products</head><p>Since we are trying to understand the gas chemistry induced by the energy source, we focus on the peaks that have significant intensity change after turning on the plasma in 400 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Changes in peaks are the result of destruction of the initial gases and/or production of new gas phase species. For instance, the increase at 1, 2, and 3 amu are caused by the production of H 2 when the plasma is on.</p><p>The decrease at 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 amu are associated with the depleting of CH 4 , and the decrease at 28 amu is due to N 2 depletion. With the plasma on, some CH 4 and N 2 molecules are dissociated and converted to other species. The increased peaks on <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> indicate the new formed species, which are also listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> and/or C 2 H 3 ON for 57 amu. Each molecular formula can have several different structures (isomers); for example, C 3 H 7 N has 9 stable isomers. With current information, it is difficult to identify the molecular structures of these species. However, the increased peaks clearly demonstrate the formation of C4 species in the gas phase of the 400 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Gas Molecule Changes during the 100× metallicity Experiments</head><p>In order to clearly show the gas phase composition change, we subtract the mass spectrum of the initial gas mixture from the gas mass spectrum with the plasma (or the UV lamp) on, and find the peaks with significant change. For those changed peaks that correspond to gas molecules, we plotted them against m/z, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 5, 7</ref>, and 9. Those changed peaks that are mostly due to fragments (like CH 4 fragments) are not shown in the figures.</p><p>It should be noted that 3 spectra (600, 400, and 300 K) are shown in the same plot to provide more information at once but not to compare the intensity ratios from one experiment to another since the initial mixtures are different and the changes in chemical pathways are not only dependent on temperature or energy source. In these figures, the negative peaks represent the gas molecules whose abundances decrease, while the positive ones are the gas molecules whose abundances increase. After turning on the plasma (or the UV lamp), some gas molecules are dissociated and converted to other species, thus leading to the decrease of some compositions in the initial mixture and the increase of newly formed products.  The initial gas compositions for the 100× metallicity experiments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref> shows the changed gas peaks in the 100× metallicity experiments for both energy sources: plasma (A) and UV (B). The 100× metallicity experiments started with H 2 -dominated gas mixtures for all three temperatures. In both plasma and UV experiments, the abundances of H 2 and He do not change significantly, but the other components in the initial gas mixture all decrease. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref>, CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>   The gas composition changes indicate that different chemical pathways resulted in gas to particle conversion in these experiments. The energy input, plasma or UV radiation, modifies the initial gases and starts reactions in the system, eventually resulting in the creation of new gas and solid phase species. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> shows end products of the 100× metallicity experiments. The initial gas mixtures for the 100× metallicity experiments are H 2 -dominated at all three temperatures. From the gas phase mass spectra, we learned that the destruction of CH 4 and H 2 O provides carbon and oxygen sources for both energy inputs (plasma and UV) at three temperatures, and additionally ammonia provides a nitrogen source for the 300 K experiments. Under plasma or UV radiation, these initial gases undergo complex chemical processes and produce new gas and solid phase compounds.</p><p>The new gas phase products are hydrocarbons, oxygen-containing, or nitrogen-containing species, up to C6 species ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5 and 6</ref>). The processes lead to the formation of different gas products for different cases, but also affect the formation and growth of the solid particles. From the destroyed and new species in the gas phase, we can infer the elemental compositions of the solid species. For both the plasma and UV experiments, the solid samples should consist of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) at 600 K and 400 K;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>100X Metallicity</head><p>those at 300 K should also have nitrogen (N). The elemental composition of the solids will be confirmed by further composition analysis, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry.</p><p>The gas phase chemical processes also determine the production rate of the solids. The production rates in all the 100× metallicity experiments are relatively low for both energy sources. As previously reported, the presence of H 2 in the initial gas mixture reduces haze particle formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . The H 2 -dominated gas mixture in our experiments provides a highly reducing environment, which could inhibit chain growing and thus decrease the formation of larger molecules. However, both the plasma and the UV photons initiated complex reactions in such reducing environments, which produced new gas products and solid particles. For example, hydrocarbons up to C6 species (benzene) are detected in the gas phase of the 100× metallicity experiment with UV at 400 K. C 2 H 2 is formed in all 100× metallicity experiments, which could be a key precursor for heavier molecules. C 2 H 2 is readily formed from photochemistry of CH 4 as previously reported in laboratory simulations of Titan's atmosphere 25,26 , and possible formation mechanism has been proposed in photochemical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . C 2 H 2 can react with a wide range of compounds (including itself) to generate bigger molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . In our 100× metallicity experiments, newly formed C 2 H 2 can serve as a precursor and react with other species in the system to form more complex compounds in both gas phase and solid phase. The initial gas compositions for the 1000× metallicity experiments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref> shows the changed gas peaks in the 1000× metallicity experiments. The 600 K-1000× experiment started with a H 2 -dominated gas mixture. For the 600 K experiments with both energy sources, we did not observe significant changes for H 2 , He, or CO 2 , but saw decreases for CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 7</ref>). The starting gas mixtures for the 1000× metallicity experiments at 400 K and 300 K are H 2 O-dominated, and are made up of the same gases. However, the mixing ratios of the gases in the mixtures are different, which could drastically affect the gas phase chemistry.</p></div>

The difference in gas products formed at 400 K and 300 K <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 7)</ref> suggests that the chemical pathways and resulting solid products may be also distinct. More detailed work is required to understand the complex chemical processes in the gas mixtures that yield so many haze particles.  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The changed gas peaks in the 10000× metallicity experiments for both energy sources: plasma (A) and UV (B).

The initial gas mixtures are CO 2 -dominated and relatively oxidizing for the 10000× metallicity experiments. There is no CH 4 in the initial gas mixtures, but haze particles are produced at all temperatures with both energy sources. CO 2 (and CO at 600 K) provides the carbon source in these experiments. The formation of both new gas products and haze particles demonstrates that CH 4 is not necessarily required for organic haze formation. Newly formed gas products <ref type="figure">(HCN, HCHO, CH</ref>   Specifying the source of carbon (CH 4 , CO, or CO 2 ) is not sufficient to determine the complex atmospheric chemistry. The total oxidizing/reducing environments, the ratios of C/H/O/N, and the forms of other species are all involved in the chemical processes. The experiment at 600 K with plasma has the highest haze production rate among the 10000× metallicity experiments, although they all have relatively low production rate. The Ncontaining molecules in the gas phase (HCN, CH 3 CN) indicate N chemistry may contribute to the higher haze production rate in this case.

Thus, it is very difficult to calculate the absolute yield of gas products from the mass spectra. In order to compare the yields of the gas product between experiments, we estimated the relative yield of gas products by assuming the molecular peaks are quantitative for the gas products (In other words, we assume that the cross sections are the same for all the species, and all species follow the same linear calibration curves on the RGA mass spectrometer). Due to the variety of gas products in different experiments, we calculate the yield by combining the peak intensity increase (I) and the number of heavy atoms (non-H atoms) in the gas products (N). For each experiment, the total yield of the gas products (Y) equals:</p></div>

This could be due to the highest mixing ratio of CH 4 in the 400 K-1000× metallicity experiments, but other gases (N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O) in the initial gas mixture can also have strong influences on the photochemistry. The 300 K-10000× metallicity plasma experiment yields the least gas products out of the 18 experiments (both plasma and UV), which is two orders of magnitude lower than the highest yield case. The 400 K-10000× metallicity UV experiment is the lowest among the nine UV experiments. The low yields of gas products and low production rates of solid particles in the 10000× metallicity experiments may be due to the oxidizing environment of the initial gas mixtures. The only carbon source (CO 2 ) is oxidized in the initial gas mixtures of 10000× metallicity experiments at 400 K and 300 K ( <ref type="figure">Figure   2</ref>).</p><p>We have reported the haze production rates in these experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . We normalized the haze production rates by using the highest production rate experiment (300 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment) as reference (100%) and plotted the relative yields of solid products (haze particles) in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> along with the gas products. There is a positive correlation between the yields of new gas products and the production rates of solid particles for the plasma experiments. The two experiments that have highest yields of gas products also generate the most solid particles. Such correlation is not observed in the UV experiments. <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> shows that the gas phase production yields are on the same order of magnitude for the plasma and UV experiments for most cases. However, in 8 out of 9 cases, the solid particle production rates of the plasma experiments are higher than those of the UV experiments 13,14 with only one exception (the 300 K-100× case). The 300 K-100× case has a better solid phase production yield with UV, which is also the only gas mixture that contains NH 3 . NH 3 could play an important role in the production of solid particles, and we will look into its role in future investigations. Our results indicate that the conversion from gas to solid phase is much more efficient in the plasma experiments than in the UV experiments, for 8 out of 9 cases. The higher haze production rates in the plasma experiments could reflect the higher energy density of the AC glow discharge than that of the UV photons. It should be noted that the experiments started with nine different gas mixtures. The photochemical processes in nine cases with two different energy sources are very complex, and the nucleation and growth of the solid particles are related to temperature and vapor pressure as well. Therefore, more comprehensive study is necessary to understand the complex chemical and physical processes happening in these atmospheres. <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. Relative yield of gas products and solid products (haze particles,) in the plasma and UV experiments. The 400 K-1000× metallicity UV experiment has the highest gas products yield and is used as a reference (100%) for gas products yields in other experiments. The 300 K-1000× metallicity plasma experiment has the highest haze production rate and is used as a reference (100%) for solid products (haze) yields in other experiments. Note that three UV experiments (600 K-100×, 600 K-1000×, and 400 K-10000×) have low haze production rate and their relative yields are lower but very close to 0.1%.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> . However, that is easier said than done because it requires sufficient data to identify atmospheric compositions and constrain a wide variety of possibilities (geochemical settings, surface and atmospheric chemistry, and photochemistry scenarios of exoplanets).</p><p>Besides O 2 , many organic molecules that are produced by life on Earth are also considered to be potential exoplanet biosignatures 41 , since these molecules could be produced and accumulate in exoplanet atmospheres. However, these molecules can be also generated abiotically <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> . Our experiments show that some of those organics (such as C <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref>  simple organics (could be pure hydrocarbons and/or reduced nitrogen-/oxygen-containing organics) in several simulated atmospheres, which indicates that even the simultaneous presence of O 2 and organics could be false positive biosignature. Thus, we must consider the possibility of false positives of these potential biosignature gases. The surface and atmospheric chemistry on exoplanets should be carefully examined and all possible abiotic sources of these gases should be evaluated in those alternative planetary environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Key precursors in the gas phase</head><p>As we mentioned above, several newly formed molecules in the gas phase could be very important precursors of larger molecules in the gas phase and solid phase. These species include C 2 H 2 , HCN, NH 3 , CH 2 NH, HCHO, and H 2 C=C=O. It should be noted that we could not definitively identify HCHO and H 2 C=C=O from only the mass spectra. However, these two species are probably formed in the 10000× metallicity experiments and play a major role for producing haze particles in these cases. Photolysis of CH 4 produces C 2 H 2 that is a key molecule for the production of heavy hydrocarbons, as demonstrated in laboratory simulations of Titan's atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45</ref> . In fact, we observed the formation of C 2 H 2 in all our experiments in which the gas mixture includes CH 4 .

In the presence of a dissociating or ionizing energy source, all these potential gas precursors and their photochemical products can react with each other and further react with the resulting products, eventually resulting in particle formation. Efforts are underway to measure composition of the resulted haze particles in order to better understand the complex photochemical processes.</p><p>Although observations with current facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope (the observations by Hubble were wavelength-limited, 0.5 to 1.7 microns) have largely revealed featureless transmission spectra for mini-Neptunes and super-Earths, future ground-based facilities and JWST will be able to probe spectral features of major gas compositions and possible clouds/hazes in exoplanet atmospheres. Gas phase species composition is often easier to measure using remote sensing techniques than solid phase species, particularly for complex solids like the photochemical hazes formed in our experiments. When we can only measure gas phase species in an exoplanet atmosphere, the detection of those species may still provide information about composition of particles present in the atmosphere.</p><p>The gas precursors we identified here could be important atmospheric chemical indictors of photochemistry and haze formation in exoplanet atmospheres.</p><p>In addition, HCHO and HCN are also important prebiotic precursors since they readily undergo a variety of reactions to give products of biological significance including sugars, amino acids, and nucleobases 36,48-52 . Since both HCHO and HCN are formed in several of our experiments, we will particularly search for prebiotic molecules (sugars, amino acids, and nucleobases) during our composition analysis of the resulting solid materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We conducted laboratory experiments with the PHAZER chamber to simulate haze formation in cool exoplanet atmospheres and monitored the gas phase chemistry happening during these experiments. Using mass spectroscopy, we measured a variety of new gas phase species formed from diverse initial gas mixtures that we subjected to either energetic cold plasma or UV photons. We found that the yields of the gas products vary greatly in the experiments with different initial gas mixtures, and the energy sources (plasma or UV) clearly affect the chemical processes and the gas product yields in the experiments starting with the same gas mixture. There is a positive correlation between the yields of new gas products and the production rates of solid particles for the plasma experiments, but such correlation is not observed in the UV experiments.</p><p>Combining the gas composition change and the haze production rate in each experiment, we suggested possible chemical processes that lead to the formation of haze particles, which were distinct for the experiments with different initial gas mixtures. There are multiple chemical pathways to haze formation. Additionally, we observed new organic gas molecules and haze formation in the 10000× metallicity experiments that do not have CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> in the initial gas mixtures, confirming that CH 4 is not necessarily required for the formation of organics (gas and/or solid phase) and CO 2 (and CO at 600 K) can provide an alternative source of carbon for organics.</p><p>We identified some key gas precursors (C 2 H 2 , HCN, NH 3 , CH 2 NH, HCHO, and H 2 C=C=O) that are indicative of haze formation and could be detected by JWST. O 2 and organic gas products are formed through photochemical processes in simulated atmospheric scenarios, demonstrating that we should eliminate abiotic production channels of these molecules before considering them as biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres. In conclusion, our results show that complex atmospheric photochemistry can happen in diverse exoplanet atmospheres, and produce new gas products and haze particles. The gas phase products we identified here are very important to understand the gas-solid composition connections and the possible chemical processes that lead to the haze formation in exoplanet atmospheres.</p></div>

species. In the 300 K-1000× experiment with plasma, we also noticed decreases for CH 4 

and N 2 , and increases for H 2 , C2, and C3 species. The C2 (C 2 H 2 , HCN, CH 2 NH, 

C 2 H 6 /HCHO) species are the same as those in the 400 K experiment, but the C3 species 

are different [C 2 H 5 N, C 2 H 7 N/HCONH 2 (45) besides CH 3 CN]. In the 400 K-1000× 

experiment with UV, CH 4 and N 2 in the initial gas mixture decrease, while new C2 (C 2 H 2 , 

HCN, CH 2 NH) and C3 (C 3 H 4 , CH 3 CN, C 3 H 6 /CH 2 N 2 /C 2 H 2 O) species are produced in the 

gas phase. In the 300 K-1000× experiment with UV, CH 4 and H 2 O decrease, while C 2 H 2 , 

O 2 , and C 3 H 4 are formed. Again, C 2 H 2 is formed in all of the 1000× metallicity 

experiments. HCN is formed in most of these experiments except the UV experiment at 

300 K. We noticed that O 2 was only produced in the 300 K-1000× UV experiment, but not 

in the 400 K-1000× UV experiment, although both experiments started with H 2 O-rich gas 

mixtures. The photodissociation of water could be a major source of O 2 . There is less CH 4 

in the 300 K experiment (6.6%) than in the 400 K experiment (11%), which could result in 

more UV photons in 115 to 140 nm (Figure 3) remaining to dissociate H 2 O and produce 

O 2 . More detailed study is required to fully understand the possible mechanisms. 

As we did for the 100× metallicity experiments, we show the end products of the 1000× 

metallicity experiments in Figure 8. For the 1000× metallicity experiments, the initial gases 

at 600 K are different from those at 400 K and 300 K (H 2 -dominated versus H 2 O-

dominated). At 600 K, both CH 4 and CO can serve as carbon source, while H 2 O and N 2 are 

the oxygen and nitrogen sources. At 400 K and 300 K, ample H 2 O molecules provide 

oxygen source, while the initial CH 4 and N 2 serve as carbon and nitrogen sources. Although 

we did not observe significant decrease of CO 2 in the 1000× metallicity experiments, CO 2 

could serve as an additional source for carbon and oxygen in these experiments. For the 

UV experiment at 300 K, we did not observe the decrease of N 2 or the formation of any 

nitrogen-containing molecule in the gas phase, which could result in no nitrogen in the solid phase (C x H y O using the PHAZER chamber 17 . This indicates that H 2 O-dominated gas mixtures efficiently 

produce haze particles with cold plasma as an energy source. These two gas mixtures also 

have a higher CH 4 content than our standard Titan experiment. The photolysis of H 2 O 

and/or CH 4 can produce H 2 . The increase/production of H 2 in the gas phase indicates that 

H 2 O and/or CH 4 could be important contributors for generating big organic molecules in 

our 1000× metallicity plasma experiments at 400 K and 300 K. The production rate is not 

simply a function of CH 4 content. The nitrogen-containing molecules identified in the gas 

phase </table></figure>

Figure 9 shows the changed gas peaks in the 10000× metallicity experiments that started 

with CO 2 -dominated gas mixtures. For the 600 K experiment with plasma, H 2 , H 2 O, and 

CO/N 2 in the initial gas mixtures decrease, while HCN, C 2 H 6 /HCHO, O 2 and CH 3 CN 

increase. For the 600 K experiment with UV, H 2 and CO/N 2 also decrease, but H 2 O 

increases along with newly formed C 2 H 6 /HCHO, O 2 and C 3 H 6 /CH 2 N 2 /C 2 H 2 O. For the 400 

K and 300 K experiments with plasma, we observed a decrease of H 2 O and increases of 

C 2 H 6 /HCHO and O 2 . For the 400 K UV experiment, we only saw H 2 O decreasing and O 2 

increasing. At 300 K, besides the change of H 2 O and O 2 , we also observed increases of 

C 2 H 6 /HCHO and C 2 H 6 O/HCOOH (formic acid). Bar-Nun &amp; Chang 34 also reported that 

C 2 H 6 and HCHO were produced from irradiation of CO and H 2 O. Since there is neither

In our experiments, O 2 is formed in all of the 10000× metallicity cases (the initial gas mixtures are most akin to atmospheres expected for terrestrial exoplanets), and also in the 1000× metallicity case at 300 K with UV. The result here clearly demonstrates that O 2 can be produced abiotically through photochemical processes in multiple atmospheric scenarios, probably via photochemical reaction of CO 2 and H 2 O (Reaction 1). Thus, we should reconsider O 2 as a biosignature in exoplanet atmospheres; we can assume O 2 as a biosignature gas only if we rule out that O 2 is generated photochemically or geochemically</figDesc><table>100X
