				<p>Continuous data releases throughout the TESS primary mission will provide unique opportunities for the exoplanet community at large to contribute to maximizing TESS&apos;s scientific return via the discovery and validation of transiting planets. This paper introduces our independent pipeline for the detection of periodic transit events along with the results of its inaugural application to the recently released 2 minute light curves of low mass stars from the first two TESS sectors. The stellar parameters within our sample are refined using precise parallax measurements from the GAIA DR2 which reduces the number of low mass stars in our sample relative to those listed in the TESS Input Catalog. In lieu of the follow-up observations required to confirm or refute the planetary nature of transit-like signals, a validation of transit-like events flagged by our pipeline is performed statistically. The resulting vetted catalog contains seven probable blended eclipsing binaries, eight known TOIs, plus eight new planet candidates smaller than 4 Earth radii. This work demonstrates the ability of our pipeline to detect sub-Neptune-sized planet candidates which to-date represent some of the most attractive targets for future atmospheric characterization via transmission or thermal emission spectroscopy and for radial velocity efforts aimed at the completion of the TESS level one requirement to deliver 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii with measured masses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With our current observational capabilities, nearby transiting planets offer the best targets to characterize exoplanetary systems in detail. By their proximity many of these planets are amenable to follow-up observations to, for example, refine their radii and orbital ephemerides nearby transiting planets smaller than Neptune around stars within ∼ 1000 pc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stassun et al. 2018)</ref>. Indeed TESS has already produced a number of new confirmed planet detections <ref type="bibr">(Es- posito et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gandolfi et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Huang et al. 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Trifonov et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Vanderspek et al. 2018</ref>) in addition to its set of TESS Objects of Interest or TESS 'alerts'.</p><p>TESS features four refractive lens that provide a combined wide field-of-view of 24 • × 96 • (i.e. ∼ 2300 square degrees) for a single sector. The primary TESS mission splits the sky into 26 equal sectors (13 per hemisphere) anchored on the ecliptic poles and extending towards the ecliptic plane where fields at the lowest ecliptic latitudes (∼ 63% of the sky) will be continuously monitored for ∼ 27 days. Conversely, fields centered at the galactic poles (∼ 2% of the sky) will be continuously monitored for ∼ 350 days and overlap with continuous viewing zone of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST ). In total TESS will survey ∼ 85% of the entire sky over its two year-long survey targeting 2-4×10 5 predominantly bright dwarf stars listed in the TESS Input Catalog (TIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stassun et al. 2018</ref>) with 2 minute cadence. Full Frame Images for all visible objects within each field will also be released with a 30 minute cadence. From these data products TESS is expected to discover thousands of new transiting exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ballard 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barclay et al. 2018</ref>) plus potentially thousands more from a variety of proposed extended missions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bouma et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Huang et al. 2018a</ref>). The launch of TESS and its recent large data release marks the beginning of a new era of exoplanetary survey science that will carry on the legacy of the infamous Kepler space telescope which was decommissioned on November 16 2018, after nearly a decade of transformative exoplanet observations and thousands of planet discoveries.</p><p>TESS is also unique to past space-based transiting exoplanet survey observatories (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ke- pler, CoRoT )</ref> in that its bandpass extends further redward into the near-IR: 600-1000 nm. This enables TESS to access more cool M dwarf stars at high signal-to-noise than previous missions. Systems of sub-Neptune-sized planets are common around M dwarfs <ref type="bibr">(Dressing &amp; Char- bonneau 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton &amp; Swift 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015</ref>) and are required in order to provide a global view of outcomes of the planet formation process across the Initial Mass Function. Given their lower luminosities relative to Sun-like stars, detecting close-in planets around low mass stars probes a subset of exoplanets with systematically lower equilibrium temperatures including temperate planets orbiting within the habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kopparapu et al. 2013</ref>). Given their relative abundance within the solar neighbourhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Winters et al. 2015</ref>), planet masses around nearby low mass stars may be readily characterized with radial velocities to build up a statistically significant view of the mass-radius relationship for small planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Rogers 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wolfgang et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen &amp; Kip- ping 2017)</ref>. The small sizes of low mass stars also works to increase observational signatures of transiting planets thus making their planetary systems of particular interest for the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial to superEarth-sized planets whose scale heights are expected to be inherently small <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">( Miller-Ricci et al. 2009</ref>) and thus difficult to detect even with state-of-art instrumentation on-board the up-coming JWST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Morley et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The recent public data release from the first two TESS sectors, processed and validated by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jenkins et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Twicken et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Li et al. 2018</ref>), provides an opportunity for members of the extended exoplanet community to pursue a variety of unique science cases. This includes the search for new transiting planets using transit detection algorithms that are in-TESS candidates around low mass stars 3 dependent of those used by the TESS Science Team and on distinct subsets of stars targeted by TESS. In this study, focus on low mass dwarf stars from the TIC and use GAIA parallaxes to infer precise stellar parameters and the refine the sample probable M dwarf TICs. We then search for transiting exoplanets around these low mass dwarfs in the high cadence TESS light curves using our custom-built transit detection pipeline described herein.</p><p>In Sect. 2 we present the derivation of our input target list of low mass TICs. In Sect. 3 we present the details of our transit detection pipeline ORION. In Sect. 4 we present our pipeline results and our supplementary efforts to classify flagged transit-like events via human vetting and statistical validation before culminating our final list of planet candidates and astrophysical false positives. We conclude with a discussion in Sect. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">STELLAR SAMPLE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Initial stellar sample</head><p>Our initial stellar sample is retrieved from version 7 of the TESS Input Catalog (TIC-7) which is accessed via the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescope (MAST) Portal <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Among other parameters, the TIC-7 table contains estimates of each star's physical parameters (i.e. effective temperatures T eff , surface gravities log g, radii R s , masses M s , etc.), astrometry (either from the Tycho-GAIA astrometric solution; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016a,b or from Hipparcos), G-band magnitude from the GAIA data release 1, and 2MASS photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Cutri et al. 2003</ref>). To identify putative low mass dwarf stars within the TIC-7, we first restrict our sample to sources flagged as dwarf stars based on their 2MASS colors and the reduced proper motion criterion from <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stassun et al. (2018)</ref>, modified from Collier <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Cameron et al. (2007)</ref>. We further restrict our sample to stars whose 'priority' is ≥ 10 −3 where the TIC priority metric is based on the relative probability of the TIC of detecting small planetary transits. As such, the priority is dependent on R s , the expected photometric precision, the number of TESS sectors in which the TIC will be visible, and its contamination ratio: the ratio of contamination to source flux where contamination is computed over ten TESS pixels from the source (∼ 3.5 arcmin).</p><p>Next we establish our initial sample of low mass stars based on the physical stellar parameters from the TIC-7 and using the following criteria:</p><p>• T eff ∈ [2700, 4200] K,</p><p>• log g &gt; 4,</p><p>• R s &lt; 0.75 R ,</p><p>• M s &lt; 0.75 M .</p><p>We note that these criteria are not intended to reflect the exact M dwarf parameter ranges of interest but instead are chosen to be intentionally conservative as to avoid missing any potential M dwarfs prior to their final classification (for use within this study) based on T eff and near-IR luminosities (M K S ∈ [4.5, 10]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Delfosse et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Benedict et al. 2016</ref>) that will be refined in Sect. 2.2 using GAIA parallaxes. At this stage we find a total of 93090 TICs that obey our criteria. Of these, 2849 TIC are observed in one or both of TESS sectors 1 and 2 and are depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Refined stellar sample based on GAIA DR2</head><p>The stellar parameters used to derive our initial stellar sample were obtained from a variety of sources as outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stassun et al. (2018)</ref>. Effective temperatures within our sample were predominantly obtained from the cool 4 R. Cloutier <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Distributions of TESS apparent magnitudes T , effective temperatures, stellar radii, and stellar masses for our initial (translucent orange markers) and final (dark red markers) stellar samples. Our initial sample contains 2849 low mass stars observed in sectors 1 and/or 2 and identified by their stellar parameters from the TIC-7. Our final sample contains 1599 low mass stars with refined stellar parameters based on GAIA DR2 parallaxes. The median parameter values for each sample are annotated above each histogram. dwarf catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Muirhead et al. 2018</ref>) or alternatively from spectroscopic catalogs or V -K S colors. Most stellar masses and radii also come from the cool dwarf catalog or from the Torres et al. (2010) spectroscopic relations. Stellar surface gravities follow from measurements of R s and M s . The TIC-7 stellar radii are typically known at the level of ∼ 16% which often dominates the error budget of the measured planetary radii from transit observations. Here we aim to produce a homogeneously-derived set of precise stellar parameters by exploiting the exquisite precision of their 2MASS photometry and stellar parallaxes from the GAIA DR2 Gaia <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Collaboration et al. (2018)</ref> available for the majority of stars in our initial sample.</p><p>For the accurate and precise characterization of transiting planets we are principally interested in the measurement of host stellar radii R s . Additionally, the derivation of other fundamental parameters such as stellar masses and effective temperatures are of importance for a more complete understanding of the effect that stars can have on their host planetary systems. Here, we re-derive the stellar parameters of our initial sample by deriving their near-IR absolute magnitudes coupled with empirically-derived M dwarf radius-luminosity relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. 2015</ref>). We begin by querying the GAIA DR2 archive using the star's right ascension and declination (α, δ) with a search radius of 10-60 arcseconds. Cross-matching the TIC-7 with the GAIA DR2 data is necessary to obtain each star's updated parallax from the DR2, additional GAIA photometry (i.e. G BP and G RP ) which was not included in the TIC-7, and pointestimates of their respective measurement uncertainties that we will approximate as Gaussian distributed. Our querying procedure utilizes the astropy.astroquery python package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ginsburg et al. 2017</ref>). Next we identify source matches according to their predicted photometric colors based on the 2MASS-GAIA colorcolor relations reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Evans et al. (2018)</ref>. Explicitly, we use the quadratic polynomial fits from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Evans et al. (2018)</ref> to predict each of the colors G − K S , G BP − K S , G RP − K S and G BP − G RP and then compare those predictions for potential source matches to the measured TIC colors. Each of the four color-color relations is accompanied by a characteristic scatter of 0.3692, 0.4839, 0.2744, and 0.2144 magnitudes respectively. We claim a source match when all of the calculated colors are within 3σ of their predicted values. Based on numerous checks of individual known TICs, we determined that such a tolerance is required to ensure accurate TESS candidates around low mass stars 5 source matches. This dispersion is also expected given that higher order effects not taken into account by the polynomial fits, can have stark effects on the accuracy of the photometric predictions.</p><p>We proceed with identifying bona-fide low mass TICs within our initial stellar sample by using the GAIA data of matched sources to refine the stellar parameters that were initially used to flag low mass stars. We will classify low mass stars within this study based on their absolute K S -band magnitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Delfosse et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Benedict et al. 2016)</ref> and effective temperatures which are derived in the coming sub-sections. We focus our analysis on the K S -band in this study due to the reduced effects of dust extinction at near-IR wavelengths compared to in the visible. The absolute K Sband magnitude is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M K S = K S − µ − A K S ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where K S is the source's K S -band apparent magnitude, µ = 5 log 10 (d/1 pc) − 5 is the distance modulus given the distance to the source d, and A K S is the source extinction in the K Sband. Therefore, in order to compute M K S for our stellar sample we must first obtain the parameters d and A K S .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Stellar distances from GAIA</head><p>The GAIA DR2 reports precise stellar parallaxes for the majority of stars in our initial sample The typical parallax uncertainty for the stars in our sample is ∼ 0.2%. As noted by numerous authors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bailer-Jones 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Astraatmadja &amp; Bailer-Jones 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Luri et al. 2018)</ref>, reliable distances to the majority of stars in the GAIA DR2 cannot be obtained by simply inverting the stellar parallax. Given values with posterior probability density functions (PDFs) that are presumed Gaussian distributed, and are therefore fully described by their mean values and 1σ dispersions, the nonlinearity of the transformation from to d will result in an asymmetric d posterior PDF whose skewness is dependent on the absolute measurement value and its signal-to-noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Luri et al. 2018)</ref>. By the proximity of the majority of sources in the TIC-7, their parallaxes are measured with high precision such that the resulting d PDF obtained using the standard formula (d/ pc) = (/arcsec, can be well-approximated as a Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bailer-Jones et al. 2018</ref>). The median relative distance uncertainty therefore corresponds to that of the measured parallax (i.e. ∼ 0.2%). The maximum a-posteriori (MAP) d value and its 1σ uncertainty are then propagated to the calculation of µ which we will ultimately use in Eq. 1 to calculate M K S after the extinction coefficient are obtained (see Sect. 2.2.2).</p><p>There are known systematic effects in the GAIA astrometric solution in the form of a non-zero parallax zero-point that is dependent on the source position, G-band magnitude, and possibly color ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lindegren et al. 2018</ref>). In computing d from we first apply a simple correction by adding the globally-averaged parallax zero-point of 29 µas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lindegren et al. 2018</ref>) to the verbatim stellar parallaxes from the GAIA DR2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Source extinction estimates</head><p>The source extinction is dependent on the source's location on the sky and particularly on its proximity to the galactic plane where the dust column density is highest. To estimate the K S -band extinction for each source we utilize the mwdust package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bovy et al. 2016</ref>) which queries one of three E(B-V) reddening maps (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Drimmel et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Marshall et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Green et al. 2015</ref>) based on the applicability of each map to the input source position. Given the source's galactic coordinates (l, b), GAIA distance, and uncertainties as input, mwdust queries the reddening maps and returns the extinction coefficient A λ = R λ E(B-V) in the desired band using the extinction vector scaling R K S = 0.31 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Schlafly &amp; Finkbeiner (2011)</ref>. Uncertainties in A K S are derived from the d measurement uncertainty and from inherent uncertainties in the value of R K S ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Green et al. 2018</ref>, e.g.) which we attempt to account for via the quadrature addition of a 30% fractional uncertainty on R K S following the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Fulton &amp; Petigura 2018</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Deriving the set of refined stellar radii</head><p>Combining the retrieved values of K S , µ, and A K S into Eq. 1 returns the distribution of M K S for all of the 2489 stars in our initial sample for which 2MASS photometry and GAIA parallaxes are available.</p><p>Calculations of M dwarf stellar radii from their bolometric magnitudes would require K Sband bolometric corrections which for cool stars, are known to often suffer from comparatively large inaccuracies (T eff 4100 K; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Berger et al. 2018)</ref>. We therefore adopt the alternative approach from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Berger et al. (2018)</ref> which used the empirically-derived M dwarf radiusluminosity relation (RLR) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. (2015)</ref> to update M dwarf stellar radii in the Kepler field using GAIA distances. The fitted RLR uses a quadratic function to map M K S to directly measured R s from interferometry and parallaxes. Because we are interested in deriving a self-consistent sample of low mass stellar radii, we restrict our analysis to TICs with M K S values that are applicable to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. (2015)</ref> RLR which is valid for M dwarfs with M K S ∈ (4.6, 9.8). This condition will be used to establish our final sample of low mass dwarf stars following the derivation of T eff within our initial sample. The radii inferred from the RLR have a fractional residual dispersion of 0.0289 R s which we add in quadrature to the radius uncertainty propagated from M K S . <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> compares the TIC-7 stellar radii (compiled from various input sources) with those derived from GAIA distances and and the M dwarf RLR from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al.

The subpanel compares the distributions of fractional stellar radius uncertainties in each catalog. The refined stellar radii based on GAIA parallaxes have a typical precision improvement of ∼ 4 − 5 compared to the TIC-7 parameters.</p><p>largely one-to-one but with a slight translation of the updated R s distribution to larger radii (∼ 3.7% median increase). The effect is already known ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Berger et al. 2018)</ref> and is the result of many sources having their distance measures increased following the release of the GAIA DR2 parallaxes. More notably for the measurement of transit planet radii is the significant reduction in the fractional radius uncertainty as evidence in the histogram included in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The typical fractional radius uncertainty σ Rs /R s within our updated sample is ∼ 4 − 5 smaller than in the TIC-7. The median fractional uncertainty on our GAIA-derived stellar radii is ∼ 3%. Similarly to the RLR, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. 2015</ref>) also parameterized an empirically-derived M dwarf temperature-color-metallicity relation (TCMR). Our sample contains both 2MASS and GAIA photometry so we use these photometric systems to infer T eff for the stars in our newly refined sample. Specifically, we adopt the fitted TCMR from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. (2015)</ref> which is cubic in G BP -G RP and quadratic in J-H. The latter color is used as a proxy for metallicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Leggett 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Johnson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mann et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Newton et al. 2014</ref>). The TCMR used here has a residual temperature dispersion of 49 K which we add in quadrature to the uncertainties in T eff propagated from the input photometric uncertainties.</p></div>

The stellar masses span 0.12-0.63 M with a median M s = 0.47 M . Owing to the increased distances of many TICs in our final sample, the distributions of R s and M s are both translated to slightly larger radii and masses compared to the values listed in the TIC-7.</p></div>

The six steps within ORION are 1) to obtain the extracted TESS light curves and ancillary data for of input TIC, 2) to derive an initial systematic model for light curve de-trending, 3) to perform a linear search for transit-like events, 4) to perform a periodic search for repeating transitlike events, 5) to subject putative PCs to a set of vetting criteria in an automated way, and 6) to re-model the light curve with a joint systematics plus transit mode for all vetted transit-like events. These stages are described in detail in the succeeding sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">TESS light curve acquisition</head><p>The execution of ORION on a TIC begins with downloading the star's publicly available 2 minute TESS extracted light curves and target pixel files for all available sectors. The TESS data is downloaded from the MAST data service 2 . Only TICs observed at 2 minute cadence are considered at this time with their extracted light curve made available following its processing by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center. Efforts to extract 30 minute light curve data from the TESS Full Frame Images and significantly expand the list of TESS targets accessible to ORION are underway but are reserved for a future study. Target pixels files are principally used to quickly assess the data quality and will be used to infer the TIC's point spread function during the statistical validation of putative PCs in Sect. 4.2.</p><p>For each available sector of data, the chronological vectors of valid observing times t (i.e. not NaNs), measured fluxes f , and the associated 1σ flux uncertainties σ f are constructed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Initial light curve de-trending</head><p>Residual systematic effects are clearly visible in the many of the extracted light curves. Due to the inherent photometric and pointing precision of the first TESS sectors, these systematic effects are often largely attributable to astrophysical noise sources such as flicker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bastien et al. 2013</ref>) in Sun-like stars but more commonly for low mass stars from large-scale variability caused by active regions on the rotating stellar surface. As an initial de-trending step to correct for temporally-correlated noise sources from either systematics or intrinsic stellar phenomena, a semi-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression model is fit to the extracted TESS photometry.</p><p>GP regression models provide a flexible and probabilistic framework to model the temporal covariances between photometric measurements following the removal of a mean model µ(θ) which is parameterized by the set of observable parameters θ (e.g. orbital period, time of mid-transit, etc.). The posterior PDFs of the θ elements can be sampled simultaneously with the GP hyperparameters Θ which parameterize the residual covariances through the covariance matrix K(Θ) and are fit by optimizing the ln likelihood function</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ln L(θ, Θ) = − 1 2 (f − µ(θ)) T · K(Θ) −1 · (f − µ(θ)) + ln detK + N ln 2π] (2)</formula><p>along with appropriately chosen priors on the parameters in θ and Θ. Here, N is the num-TESS candidates around low mass stars 9 ber of photometric measurements in the light curve. Similar routines based on GP regression have been adopted for K2 systematic corrections (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aigrain et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Crossfield et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aigrain et al. 2016</ref>) and can also be used to infer accurate photometric stellar rotation periods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Angus et al. 2018</ref>). For cases in which the origin of the apparent photometric variations are likely dominated by active regions on rotating spotted stars, the resulting photometry will vary non-sinusoidally as the active regions evolve in size, brightness, and location over the observational baseline. This physically motivates the use of a quasi-periodic covariance matrix K i,j = δ i,j σ f,i + k i,j where δ i,j is the Kronecker delta and k i,j is the covariance kernel of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">k i,j = a 2 GP exp − |t i − t j | 2 2λ 2 − Γ 2 sin 2 π|t i − t j | P GP .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The covariance kernel is parameterized by the four hyperparameters Θ = {a GP , λ, Γ, P GP } where a is the correlation amplitude, λ the exponential timescale, Γ the coherence scale, and P GP the periodic timescale of the correlations. Moreover, a quasi-periodic covariance kernel is favorable for cases in which the origin of apparent photometric variations are dominated by systematics which need not have a strong periodic component. In this limit, the coherence parameter Γ approaches small values such that the covariance kernel becomes well-approximated by a squared exponential kernel with a single effective timescale. Note that because systematic and astrophysical noise sources within the GP noise model are not distinguished, the fitted hyperparameter values are unable to be used to interpret the origin of the photometric variability. Furthermore, during the remainder of this paper the covariance structures modelled by the GP will be solely referred to as 'systematics' despite the possibility that their (partial) origin may be astrophysical.</p><p>The logarithmic hyperparameters are initialized and subsequently optimized in an iterative manner and are performed on each TESS sector independently assuming a null mean function (i.e. µ = 0). The periodic GP timescale P GP is initialized by peaks in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP; Scargle 1982) of the extracted light curve whereby in each of the iterations performed, P GP is initialized to the i th most significant peak in the LSP where i is the iteration index ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>. Periods within 5% of a 1 day are excluded due to the inherent LSP noise at sampled frequencies close to 1 days −1 . Following the use of GP regression modelling for radial velocity (RV) activity mitigation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Dittmann et al. (2017b)</ref>, where the physical source of activity is largely common between the optical RVs and broadband TESS photometry, ln λ is initialized to ln 3P GP . In each iteration ln Γ is initialized to 0 and ln a GP = ln max(|f bin − median(f bin )|) where f bin is the vector of binned photometric points whose temporal bin width is set such that a single periodic GP timescale is sampled by at least eight measurements.</p><p>For each iteration in each TESS sector, the uniquely initialized GP hyperparameters are optimized using the scipy.optimize.minimize python function to minimize the negative ln L(Θ) from Eq. 2 given the Jacobian of ln L(Θ) with respect to the hyperparameters in Θ. During optimization the ln GP hyperparameters are bounded by broad uninformative priors which are explicitly reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. Broad ln uniform priors enable the generalization of the ORION de-trending method across all of the input TESS light curves which greatly benefit from semi-parametric modelling given the wide range of covariance timescales exhibited by TICs in photometry. Given an optimized set of hyperparameters, the resulting GP posterior PDF is a N -dimensional multi-variate 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R. Cloutier</head><p>Gaussian distribution whose mean function is taken to be a potential systematic correction. The mean function of the GP from the iteration whose optimized hyperparameters maximize ln L(Θ) is assigned as the initial systematic correction and is used to de-trend the photometry prior to the search for periodic transit events. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> depicts two examples of the results of this iterative de-trending procedure over individual TESS sectors for TICs 235037759 and 262530407. The accuracy of each mean GP regression model, with maximum ln likelihood hyperparameters, is clearly exhibited. The systematics model for TIC 235037759 is required to be much more aggressive than that for TIC 262530407 given the star's large photometric variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude in the binned light curve of 280,000 ppm and a 85,000 ppm rms. Unlike in the raw light curve, the de-trended light curve lacks any low frequency variations and exhibits a significantly reduced rms of 12,000 ppm.</p><p>The TIC 262530407 light curve also exhibits photometric variability albeit with a much lower peak-to-peak amplitude and rms of 1700 and 1000 ppm respectively. After de-trending, the rms is slightly reduced to 810 ppm. The most important residual feature of the de-trended light curves is that they appear free of the majority of large-scale systematic effects. This fact will facilitate the linear search for transitlike events with minimal contamination from residual systematic features. Indeed a transiting planet candidate is detected around each of these systems although the putative PC around TIC 235037759 is ultimately favored by an astrophysical false positive interpretation as presented in Sect. 4.3.</p><p>One notable limitation to the effectively corrected light curve systematics is the prevalent increase in rms for TIC 235037759 between BJD -2,4570,00 ∼ 1347 − 1349 during a brief period of loss of TESS pointing precision. This is a common feature to many of the TICs observed during TESS sector 1. During this time, the extracted light curve is only partially corrected for the pointing precision loss while the systematic GP model provides only marginal improvements if any at all. To ensure that the GP hyperparameters were not being strongly affected by the anomalous systematics structure during this period, those measurements were masked and the GP hyperparameters re-optimized with the remaining data. The resulting GP systematics only varies marginally from that shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> for TIC 235037759 such that we are confident that the ORION de-trending is largely robust to the loss in pointing precision for TICs observed in TESS sector 1.</p><p>Recall that in the initial de-trending step discussed in this section that the methodology assumes a null mean function which implies that any transient events such as flares or transits are still present during the optimization of the detrending model. The principal caveat with this methodology is that one cannot guarantee that the GP model does not (partially) capture any of the in-transit light curve deprecations that ORION is searching for. If partially suppressed by the initial GP model, planets will be more difficult to detect due to the reduced signal-tonoise (S/N) of individual transit events. Furthermore, transit events that remain detectable within the de-trended light curve could result in underestimated transit depths and correspondingly smaller planet sizes. To ensure a selfconsistent planet+systematics model for putative PC from ORION, the light model is revisited in Sect. 3.6 with the inclusion of a transiting planet mean function in place of the null mean function used during the de-trending step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Linear transit search</head><p>Next a linear search for individual transitlike events is conducted on the de-trended light curves over their full duration. The following methodology is reminiscent of a number of indi- Large panels: the 2 minute raw and binned TESS light curves with temporal binning chosen to sample eight GP periodic timescales (40.1 and 78.9 minute bins for TIC 235037759 and 262530407 respectively). Solid red curves and their surrounding shaded regions depict the mean GP model used for de-trending and its 1σ confidence intervals which are often small and difficult to visualize everywhere except during the data transfer gap at the centers of each light curve. Vertical ticks along the abscissa axes are indicative of the transit times of planet candidates which will ultimately be flagged by ORION as possible planet candidates at 6.2 and 2.9 days around TIC 235037759 and 262530407 respectively. Shallow panels: the raw and binned light curves after de-trending.</p><p>vidual transit event search algorithms (e.g. Box Least Squares, BLS; <ref type="bibr">Kovács et al. 2002, Tran- siting Planet Search, TPS;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jenkins et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Christiansen et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Pe- tigura et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015</ref>). The aim here is to identify high S/N transit-like events along with their associated mid-transit times T 0 , durations D, and depths Z which will feed into the search for repeating transit-like events and ultimately the list of putative transiting PCs.</p><p>The linear search for transit-like events begins with stepping through a two-dimensional grid of T 0 and D. At each (T 0 , D) grid point a simple box model of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m(t) =    1 − Z if T 0 − D 2 ≤ t ≤ T 0 + D 2 1 otherwise,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>is constructed with fixed T 0 and D. The box depth Z (or mock transit depth) is fit by ln likelihood maximization and saved along with the value of ln L given the unique set of parameters {T 0 , D, Z}. Computing ln L with Eq. 2 implicitly assumes that the flux uncertainties are Gaussian distributed which allows for the construction of a diagonal covariance matrix K with elements K i,j = δ i,j σ f,i . The linear search along the T 0 dimension proceeds by stepping through the observation epochs t in 30 minute bins and assigning t bin,i to T 0 ∀ i = 1, . . . , N bin . This fixed binning is the first of many ORION free parameters which are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> along with their default values and brief explanations of their effects. Initial ORION tests on synthetic light curves with injected transit models determined that finer temporal binning did not result in a significant variation in the number of detected high S/N transit-like events. This is likely due to 30 minute bins being more comparable to typical transit durations of the types of planets that can be detected in 27-54 day baselines. The D dimension is sampled on a much coarser grid given that the precision of the box model parameters are not yet required to infer planet properties but only to identify epochs at which transit-like events are likely to have occurred. Explicitly, the adopted linear search D grid contains three possible transit durations of either 1.2, 2.4, or 4.8 hours.</p><p>This procedure produces a N bin × 3 matrix of transit times and durations with each entry having an associated ln likelihood and optimized transit depth Z. From the ln likelihoods a S/N spectrum as a function of transit times is computed for each D value considered. By translating the ln likelihoods by their median value and normalizing by their median absolute deviation (MAD), the aforementioned linear search S/N spectrum versus transit times is calculated. The linear search S/N spectrum is analogous to the Signal Detection Efficiency in the BLS algorithm. The conversion from ln likelihoods to the ad hoc S/N spectrum centered around zero such aids in its interpretation as each TIC's spectrum can be searched in absolute terms. In adopting the median and MAD ln likelihood values over the mean and standard deviation, the S/N is less sensitive to contamination by stochastic, short timescale photometric features and results in a S/N spectrum whose baseline is dominated by the light curve's inherent photometric precision. An example linear search S/N spectrum is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> for a fixed duration of 1.2 hours. We note that referring to the linear search S/N spectra as a S/N is a misnomer given that its values over T 0 can be negative. However, we find this language to be a clear descriptor of the quantity's aim and its interpretability.</p><p>The S/N spectra are then searched for high S/N transit-like events analogously to the individual significance events in the primary Kepler mission which are combined and flagged as Threshold Crossing Events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jenkins et al. 2010)</ref>. High S/N transit-like events are flagged as peaks in the linear search S/N spectrum when S/N thresh ≥ 5. All n T transit times T 0 with S/N exceeding S/N thresh for any value of D, are compiled into a set of potential transit-like events. Because transit times in the linear search are sampled on a fixed grid (i.e. t binned to ∆t), each transit time is refined by Gaussian smoothing the light curve around ±2D of T 0 using scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian filter and updating T 0 to the central time of the box model minimum before proceeding to search for periodic events that may be indicative of transiting PCs. In the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, a PC exists with ∼ 1.4 day orbital period. Six out of the nineteen transit events that occur within the sector 1 baseline are detected above S/N textthres . This includes two consecutive transits between 1341 and 1343 BJD -2,457,000 which are used in the subsequent section to infer its possible period equal to the time difference between the two events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Periodic transit search</head><p>The chronologically sorted set of n T high S/N transit times in T 0 are used to construct a matrix of differential transit times with elements P i,j = T 0,i − T 0,j ∀ i, j = 1, . . . , n T . A separate matrix is populated for each unique value of D. An example of P is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> for TIC 234994474 for the fixed duration of 1.2 hours. The n T × n T matrix P represents potential transit periods of PCs whose individual transit events may be separated in time by any of the off-diagonal elements of P or some multiple thereof. By its construction, the matrix P is skew-symmetric implying that only the positive non-zero matrix elements below the main diagonal are valid periods for consideration, or n T −1 i=1 i periods. Because this search if for repeating transit-like events, it is required that n T &gt; 1. In this way, more than two transit events are not required in order to detect a repeating putative PC. This fact extends the ORION detection sensitivity to nearly the full observational baseline or ∼ 27 days for the majority of TICs.</p><p>Because each linear search with a unique D is independent of the others, the P matrices of differential transit times are considered together. In this way a single master set of periods is compiled whose elements are referred to as Periodsof-Interest (POIs). Recall that each POI has an associated time of mid-transit T 0 , duration D, depth Z and L from the linear search. At this stage, the computationally tractable box transit model is substituted in favor of a more physical transit model whose model parameters are initialized using the box model parameters before optimization. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> transit model is used through its implementation within the batman python package (Kreidberg 2015) to compute model <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.

Left panel : the n T × n T P matrix of possible periods of repeating transit-like events from the n T = 6 high S/N transit times detected in the linear search stage (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>). P is skew-symmetric such that only the periods &gt; 0 below the diagonal are valid potential periods. Each P element is annotated in each grid cell along with its ratio to the true orbital period. Because all of the transit times detected during the linear search are associated with a transit of the PC, the P matrix elements are all close to integer multiples of the true orbital period. Right panel : the n T × n T matrix of data ln likelihoods under a box transit model with orbital periods from the matrix P, and with mid-transit times, depths, and fixed duration (i.e. 1.2 hours) from the linear search stage. ln likelihood values along the diagonal correspond to the null hypothesis: a transit model with zero period. The PC period at ∼ 1.4 days is clearly seen with the largest ln likelihood which then discards all other potential periods as multiples of P .</p><p>realizations given the input parameters θ = {P, T 0 , a/R s , r p /R s , i, e, ω, a LDC , b LDC } where e is orbital eccentricity, ω is the argument of periastron, and {a LDC , b LDC } are the quadratic limb darkening coefficients. In practice, only the parameters θ = {P, T 0 , a/R s , r p /R s , i} are optimized by assuming circular orbits and fixing the quadratic limb darkening coefficients in the TESS bandpass to the values interpolated from the Claret (2017) grid over T eff , log g, and assuming solar metallicity. The θ parameters are optimized using the same routine which was used to optimize the GP hyperparameters during the initial de-trending stage (see Sect. 3.2). With each POI's optimized transit model, the ln likelihood of the data is computed for use during the succeeding steps aimed at identifying repeating transit-like events from the initial set of POIs.</p><p>A series of cuts is performed on the set of optimized POIs to identify the most likely independent periods within the data. The first cut is to remove repeated period multiples. If POIs with integer period multiples (i.e. 2P i , 3P i , . . . ) are indeed due to a transiting planet, then those POIs are likely to be manifestations of the same object. The exact P value that is retained from a set of apparent period multiples is that with the largest ln likelihood. Any arbitrary pair of POIs (P i , P j ) is flagged as a period multiple if P i and n · P j are within f P = 1% for any n = 2, . . . , n transit where n transit is the number TESS candidates around low mass stars 15 of transits can occur within the TIC's observational baseline given P i and T 0,i . One important caveat to the removal of integer multiple periods is that resonant multi-planet systems are undetectable within the periodic transit search because all but one of the POIs will always be rejected in favor of its maximum ln likelihood multiple.</p><p>Similarly, because the set of POIs are derived from peaks in the linear search S/N spectrum, rational multiples of each POI must also be sampled (i.e. P i /2, P i /3, . . . ). Consider a S/N spectrum derived from a light curve containing a single transiting planet with n transit &gt; 2 but whose individual transits are only marginally detectable due to their amplitude relative to the photometric precision. Consider in this case that only a fraction of transit events detected during the linear search. The detection of only some transit events may result in a misidentified POI that is an integer multiple times greater than the underlying true period if one or more intermediate transit-events go undetected due to the effects of random noise. Therefore fractional multiples of each POI must be considered. These new periods are equal to P i /n for all integers n resulting in a reduced period greater than or equal to the minimum orbital period considered by ORION: 0.5 days. The ln likelihood of the data under the box model with reduced period P i /n and remaining parameters {T 0,i , D i , Z i } is calculated to be compared with the L value for the model with P i . Here, the latter three parameters are fixed regardless of the input period. In the search over period multiples retains the period with the largest ln likelihood. The lower period limit of 0.5 days is imposed to limit the number of rational multiples of each POI that are investigated and because the temporal bin width used during the linear search stage already limits the sensitivity to short-period planets whose transit durations are comparable to the 30 minute bins used therein. Limiting the periodic search to orbital periods &lt; 0.5 is unlikely to result in a large number of missed transits owing to the intrinsically low occurrence rate of ultra-short-period planets ( 1%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>The result of the cuts to the initial set POIs are a set of repeating transit-like events which may or may not correspond to a transiting planet or some other form or periodic astrophysical source such as an eclipsing binary. The next steps in ORION are to vet the surviving POIs for systematic false positives and eclipsing binaries given their distinctive light curve features that can largely be vetted in an automated way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Automated planet vetting 3.5.1. Automated vetting based on light curve features</head><p>Here, POIs are automatically vetted using a set of eight vetting criteria which investigate the flagged transit-like features in the de-trended light curve (see Sect. 3.4). This automated vetting stage is intended to identify false or insignificant transit-like events and thus provides a preliminary list of putative PCs prior to more selective human vetting and statistical vetting for astrophysical false positives.</p><p>The automated vetting criteria are controlled by the set of free parameters {c i } for i = 1, . . . , 10 which are described below and are included in the summary <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The adopted values of these parameters controls the performance of ORION in terms of its detection sensitivity and false positive rate and were derived from early ORION executions on both archival Kepler and simulated TESS light curves 3 prior to the first TESS data release. We do not however make any significant claims of their optimality.</p><p>The eight automated vetting criteria are defined as follows:</p><p>1. It is required that each POI's transit depth Z from its optimized transit model be &gt; 0.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">2. The transit S/N is S/N transit = Z σ f,transit n transit (P, T 0 , t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where σ f,transit is the photometric precision over the transit duration timescale and acts as a proxy for the Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP transit ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Christiansen et al. 2012</ref>). The number of observed transits is n transit given the vector of observations t, the POI's orbital period P , and mid-transit time T 0 . The S/N transit is required to be &gt; c 1 = 8.4.</p><p>3. The transit parameters P , a/R s , Z, and i are used to phase-fold the light curve and compute the transit duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Winn 2010)</ref> such that the in-transit points, including those in ingress or egress, can be isolated. It is required that the difference in the median in and out-of-transit fluxes exceed c 2 = 2.4 median absolute deviations of the out-of-transit flux.</p><p>4. If a misidentified POI happens to be a less than the true period, then the phasefolded light curve will appear to contain out-of-transit points in-transit. This is combated by requiring that the number of in-transit points lying below Z + σ Z (where σ Z is the 1σ uncertainty on the transit depth) accounts for at least the a c 3 = 0.7 fraction of all in-transit points.</p><p>5. It is required that the in-transit sampling be approximately symmetric in time by insisting that the number of points between T 1 and T 2 be ∈ [50 − c 4 , 50 + c 4 ]% of the total number of in-transit points (i.e. between T 1 and T 4 ). c 4 is set to 10%. 8. The optimized transit models of the POIs that satisfy all of the seven aforementioned criteria are removed from the light curve. This produces a maximally clean light curve whose residuals should only arise from random noise in photometry or from inaccuracies in the independent systematic GP and transit models. The numpy.correlate python function is used to compute the autocorrelation of the residual light curve as a function of time delay as light curves demonstrating large autocorrelations due to imperfect systematic models, can often mimic transit-like events which satisfy the previous vetting criteria. This criterion is particularly important for the use of ORION on K2 light curves which often exhibit significant temporal correlations due to the thrusts used for re-orientation of the spacecraft and its imperfect correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Vanderburg &amp; Johnson 2014)</ref>.

At this point the modelling of systematic light curve effects using a 1-dimensional GP regression model from Sect. 3.2 is revisited. The alternative is to simultaneously sample the joint GP plus transit light curve parameter posterior PDF using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Explicitly, the light curve model is modified by replacing the previously null mean model µ(t) with a</p><note type="other">full transit model containing all putative PCs. Overfitting by the systematic model, which can partially fill in planetary transits, is mitigated by simultaneously modelling systematics and PCs. The resulting joint systematic+planet model is therefore derived in a self-consistent manner with more robust solutions for the transiting PC parameters of interest. MCMC sampling of the transit parameter marginalized posterior PDFs allows us to compute point estimates of their MAP values and uncertainties for later use.</note><p>For systems containing N PC PCs, 4 + 5N PC ) parameter PDFs are sampled by continuing to insist on circular orbits and fixed limbdarkening coefficients. Explicitly, the GP hyperparameters Θ = {ln a GP , ln λ, ln Γ, ln P GP } are fit along with the transiting planet parameters θ = {P i , T 0,i , a i /R s , r p,i /R s , i i } ∀ i = 1, . . . , N PC . The GP hyperparameters are initialized to their maximum likelihood values from the de-trending stage and are continued to be bounded by the broad uniform priors listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. Transit parameters are initialized by their maximum likelihood values assuming fixed GP hyperparameters from de-trending. The adopted prior PDFs on the transit model parameters are also reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> for the most common case of fitting transiting PCs with multiple transits over the observational baseline. As we will see in Sect. 4.1.2, some priors will be modified when sampling transit parameters used to model only a single transit. MCMC sampling is performed with the emcee ensemble-sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). One hundred walkers are initialized in small Gaussian balls centered on each parameter's initial value. Throughout the MCMC, each walker's acceptance fraction is monitored and warns the user when its mean value over all walkers does not fall within the desired range of 20-60% in either of the burn-in or final sampling stages. The desired duration of each MCMC stage is 10 autocorrelation times. Warnings are again produced if the MCMC chains fail to reach this length.</p><p>The main ORION output is a list of objects of interest (OIs) along with samples from the model parameter marginalized posterior PDFs and point estimates of each parameter's MAP value and uncertainties derived from the 16 th and 84 th percentiles of their 1-dimensional marginalized PDF. The raw light curves and models sampled at observation times t are also saved to produce summary images such as the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>  For its inaugural application we apply the ORION transit detection pipeline to the 2 minute extracted light curves from the first two TESS sectors. Overall, ORION produces a set of 121 OIs around 96 of the 1599 low mass TICs in our stellar sample after automated vetting. It is expected that many of these postulated PCs will be false positives due to imperfect corrections of systematic effects or to astrophysical false positives other than eclipsing binaries as EBs have certain distinct photometric features which are flagged during the automated vetting stage. As such, we proceed with manual vetting of all ORION OIs via human inspection of the pipeline's output. This step is particularly important for newly developed transit search algorithms to develop an understanding of common sources of false positives and if or how they may be corrected in future versions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Manual vetting of ORION planet candidates</head><p>We conduct a visual inspection of each of the raw, de-trended, and phase-folded light curves for each OI produced by ORION. In this analysis we flag 97/121 PCs as being residual systematic effects which are misidentified as transits. Of those, 19 appear to have been directly affected by measurements obtained between ∼ 1347 and 1349 BJD -2,4570,000 during sector 1 at times when TESS briefly lost much of its pointing precision. This effect is not perfectly corrected for in many of the sector 1 extracted light curves nor by our own systematic modelling. Most of the remaining OIs flagged as false positives are attributable to residual systematics mimicking transits. Visual inspection indicates that these OIs are clearly inconsistent with being a planetary transit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Peculiar light curve features</head><p>The two OIs 63037741.01 and 434105091.01 produced by ORION exhibit peculiar light curve features which do not appear to be consistent with planetary transits or residual systematics. These features are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>. Each of the two TIC 63037741 features and the TIC 434105091 feature are clearly seen at a high S/N either above or below the surrounding flux continuum. The TIC 63037741 flux excess feature ('a' in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>) is approximately 4% brighter than the baseline flux and has a temporal evolution which is inconsistent with being a transient flare given its lack of a steep rise in flux followed by an exponential decay ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hawley et al. 2014</ref>). The second TIC 63037741 feature ('b') has a 6% decrease in flux with a similar structure to feature 'a', except that it is inverted and with approximately half of the timescale. Feature 'b' also appears to have a slightly longer egress time than its ingress which can be a signpost of an ex-20 R. Cloutier tended transiting object if astrophysical in origin. Lastly, feature 'c' around TIC 434105091 shows 2-3 flux dips over the entire 'transit' duration lasting ∼ 6 hours. We remain agnostic as to the exact interpretation of these features but their existence is highlighted here for any interested parties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Single transit events</head><p>The interpretations of the remaining 24/121 OIs as transiting planets are deemed plausible by our manual vetting. These preliminary PC dispositions are based purely on the resemblance of the light curve features to periodic transit events or in some instances, to single transits (ST) events that do not show compelling evidence for periodicity over the observational baseline. We note that ORION is not optimized nor intended to be sensitive to the detection of ST events. However, some ST events with moderate to high S/N can be detected but incorrectly classified as periodic events if at least one other transit time in the linear search S/N spectrum exceeds S/N thresh , even if that event is resulting from noise (see Sect. 3.3). In this case, the ST event is folded to the time difference between the ST and any of the other S/N events exceeding S/N thresh . If the ST event has a sufficiently high S/N on its own then the addition of noise by phase-folding to the incorrect period, but correct T 0 , may result in a feature that still passes our automated vetting criteria due solely to the significance of the ST event. The inferred period of such a ST event in ORION will therefore always be less than its true period if the feature is indeed the result of a singly transiting planet.</p><p>Three OIs resembling ST events are identified during manual vetting around the TICs 49678165, 92444219, and 415969908. The latter TIC already hosts the known TOI-233.01 at 11.7 days but the proposed ephemeris for TOI-233.01 is inconsistent with the T 0 of our putative ST event.

Cloutier</head><p>and the other individual systems is reserved for Sect. 5.1.</p><p>For each of the three OIs classified as a putative ST, we refine their transit parameters by re-modelling their transits by isolating the light curve around 10D and using MCMC to sample the transit model parameters with just a single transit <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003)</ref>. In these simulations the P , T 0 , and a/R s priors are modified as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The orbital period of the ST is further restricted to periods greater than the largest time difference between T 0 and both edges of the light curve's baseline. The resulting periods are largely uncertain with their posterior PDFs showing extended tails out to long periods 100 days, as is expected for transit models which lack multiple events to constrain P . The revied transit parameters for our three putative ST events, derived from the isolated data and with the aforementioned updated priors, are used in place of the transit model solutions produced by ORION with their likely underestimated periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Statistical validation of transiting planet candidates</head><p>We are currently not in a position to distinguish between confirmed planets and various astrophysical false positive scenarios in an absolute sense. This is because of the lack of followup observations in this study which are ultimately required to validate or disprove the planetary nature of our OIs. Despite the lack of such follow-up observations, it is still advisable to attempt to statistically validate OIs by inferring the relative probabilities of a variety of astrophysical false positive (AFP) scenarios which can be compared to the planetary interpretation. Such considerations are further motivated given that the rate of AFPs in the 2 minute TESS light curves is expected to be significant (∼ 60%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>We attempt to statistically validate our 24 OIs around 22 TICs using the PyMultinest ( <ref type="bibr">Buch- ner et al. 2014</ref>) implementation of the probabilistic transit validation software vespa <ref type="bibr">(Mor- ton 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">(Mor- ton , 2015</ref>) which computes the planetary false positive probability (FPP) for use in establishing the final dispositions of our OIs. vespa considers six AFP scenarios as potential explanations for transit-like signals. These include undiluted eclipsing binaries (EB), hierarchical triple EBs (HEB), and blended background or foreground EBs which are not physically associated with the target (BEB). Each of these scenarios then have two instances with the first assuming the input orbital period and the second assuming twice the input orbital period. We note however that the forthcoming statistical OI interpretations are not treated as abolsutely definitive in lieu of follow-up observations aimed at distinguishing transiting planets from AFPs.</p><p>For vespa input we use the TIC's celestial coordinates (α,δ), stellar parameters T eff , log g, and , along with the star's JHK S photometry. vespa also requires the photometric band in which the putative transit is detected but the code cannot properly handle the TESS bandpass in its current version. Fortunately, the central wavelengths of the TESS bandpass and the Cousins I C -band are similar but with the TESS band being much wider ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>). Given the similarity of the I C and SDSS i-band, and the compatibility of the latter within vespa, we use T and K S to derive i using the color relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Muirhead et al. (2018)</ref>. We also pass to vespa the OI's orbital period and planetto-star radius ratio along with its de-trended light curve following the removal of all candidate transit models that are not associated with the OI being statistically validated. The light curves are phase-folded and restricted to ±3D around T 0 for comparison to light curve models generated under the transiting planet and each AFP scenario.</p><p>vespa also requires constraints on the maximum angular separation (maxrad) from the target star that should be searched for potential blending sources. We limit this separation to be less than the median full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the target's approximate point spread function (PSF). The FWHM of the PSF is derived by fitting a 2-dimensional Gaussian profile to the target image in each target pixel file over time and adopting the median FWHM as vespa input. The median FWHM value among the 22 TICs is ∼ 37 arcsec or nearly two TESS pixels across. Over such a large field, it is reasonable to expect that many of the OIs may be favored by either the BEB or BEB2 models.</p><p>Lastly, vespa requires the maximum permissible depth of a secondary eclipse of an EB (secthresh) to be specified. Recall that attempts within ORION were made to automatically vet EBs among our OIs in Sect. 3.5.2. We therefore expect that vespa is unlikely to detect any probable EBs. Nevertheless, the input secthresh value for each TIC is derived from the box model depths fitted to each transit time in T 0 during the linear search stage (see Sect. 3.3). After masking measurements occurring within the PC's transit window and extrapolating the fitted depths to the PC's transit duration, we adopt the 95 th percentile of the depth distribution depths as the value of secthresh ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Crossfield et al. 2018</ref>). The median secthresh is ∼ 2100 ppm. The input maxrad and secthresh for each OI are reported in Table 5 along with the results of our vespa calculations.</p><p>The true power of vespa is realized when additional follow-up observations such as contrast curves from AO-assisted imaging or photometric follow-up are used to inform the interpretation of transiting PCs. Given the lack of such data in this study, we adopt conservative limits on the interpretation of the resulting vespa probabilities. Similarly, we also do not claim to validate planets with ultra low FPP (&lt; 0.01; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Montet et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Crossfield et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Livingston et al. 2018</ref>) as we will caution in Sect. 4.3 that vespa results should not be taken absolutely in the absence of follow-up observations. Our limiting values on interpreting FPPs are as follows: OIs with FPP&lt; 0.1 are classified as PCs. Similarly, OIs are classified as AFPs when FPP ≥ 0.9 and have their dispositions assigned to the specific AFP model with the highest probability. OIs with intermediate FPPs are classified as putative planet candidates (pPC).</p><p>The statistical validation calculations with vespa result in 13/24 of our OIs being classified as PCs plus 3/24 as pPCs. The OIs 49678165.01, 415969908.02, and 92444219.01 correspond to the three ST events detected during the manual vetting stage. We reclassify these objects as STs and a pST respectively. Seven of the remaining eight OIs are favored by either BEB model with 4/7 BEBs and 3/7 BEB2s. The MCMC during the vespa calculation of the lone remaining OI 235037759.01 failed to converge leaving its disposition as of yet undefined. We will show in the following subsection that despite the failure of the FPP calculation, the nature of OI 235037759.01 is likely to be an AFP. Although we are unable to distinguish between the different AFP scenarios. The derived rate of AFPs from this small sample of OIs is ∼ 33 ± 12% which is somewhat lower than expected AFP rate of 60% from the TESS simulations by <ref type="figure">(Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>

These synthetic results can be supplemented by querying the GAIA DR2 in the vicinity of each TIC to investigate the number density and brightness distribution of nearby sources on the sky. In this way, we hope to find supporting empirical evidence for any of the BEB interpretations of OIs</p></div>

The resulting maps of GAIA sources around the 22 TICs with OIs in our sample are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref>. Querying the GAIA DR2 is performed identically to the method used in Sect. 2.2 to match TICs with the GAIA DR2 catalog although here we conduct our searches with a fixed radius of 105 arcseconds or ∼ 10 TESS pixels in diameter.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref> it is clear that many of the statistically favored interpretations as either some form of planet candidate or a BEB are consistent with the lack or prevalence of nearby bright sources to the targeted TIC respectively. All panels with planet candidate OIs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref>, with the exception of panel 'l', show no or minor sources of comparable brightness within or very close to the target PSF edges as to significantly contaminate the measured TIC photometry and consequently result in a probable FP. Similarly, all AFP panels other than 'q' and 's' do have at least one neighbouring source of comparable brightness that may be responsible for the favorability of an AFP scenario by vespa. This includes the TIC 235037759 whose vespa calculation failed. Two bright sources are clearly seen to contribute to the flux within the target's PSF thus supporting the probable interpretation of the OI 235037759.01 transit-like event as being caused by an AFP.</p><p>We note however that some discrepancies between the distributions of GAIA sources and our vespa interpretations still persist. Particularly with regards to the TICs 100103200 and 100103201 (panels 'l' and 'p' in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref>) which strongly favor the PC and BEB models respectively despite being located within 1 TESS pixel of one another on the sky, having very similar brightnesses (i.e. J = 7.50, 7.66), and being located at effectively identical distances (i.e. d = 16.745 pc). Such properties are reminiscent of an M dwarf binary system. Perhaps naively, we might expect this architecture to favor almost any AFP scenario for both TICs including blends, an EB, or an HEB. Indeed the apparent flux dips which appear qualitatively consistent with a transiting planet around either one of the TICs, is also seen to have a clear manifestation in the light curve of the other as evidenced in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. This is almost certainly caused by the overlap of each target's PSF. However vespa results indicate FPPs that differ by over two orders of magnitude between the two TICs. Perhaps it is feasible, although seemingly unlikely, for TIC 100103200 to host a detectable transiting PC while being blended with the nearby TIC 100103201 whose transitlike events are strongly favored by the BEB scenario. Indeed the transit times of each TIC's transit-like events flagged by ORION appear out of phase as they do not align nor do they overlap in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> implying that transit-like events detected around each TIC by ORION do not affect the transit-like events in the light curve of the other. Even if there are regions of the outof-transit light curve that are mutually affected. We are therefore left with the questionable interpretation of these OIs by the aforementioned conflicts. We opt to use the vespa results to conclude final dispositions of these OIs but we also exercise caution by modifying the statistical disposition of OI 10010300.01 from a PC to a pPC.</p></div>

Our candidates have orbital periods from 1.4-20 days for PCs and from 35-50 days for ST events. Although ST periods exhibit large uncertainties of order the MAP period value. Our candidates have radii between 1.1-3.8 R ⊕ potentially making them targets of interest for the completion of the TESS level one science requirement of delivering 50 planets with r p &lt; 4 R ⊕ with measured masses. In Sect. 5.3.1 we will discuss the prospects that our candidates have for contributing to the realization of the TESS level one science requirement. We do not detect any hot sub-Neptunes in the photoevaporation desert <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lundkvist et al. 2016</ref>) nor any small planets ( 1.5 R ⊕ ) on orbits longer than ∼ 20 days. This is largely attributable to our poor detection sensitivity in that regime due to the limited TESS baselines of just 27 days. <ref type="figure">Fig. 12</ref> also depicts our candidates as a function of insolation. The majority of candidates (11/16) experience incident insolation levels S in excess of twice that of the Earth. However five candidates, including all three ST events and two pPCs, are likely more temperate and experience insolations 1.5 S ⊕ . This S limit marks the 'recent-Venus' inner edge of the low mass star habitable zone (HZ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kopparapu et al. 2013</ref>). Our STs also lie within the more conservative HZ definition bounded by the 'waterloss' inner edge, where an increase in insolation results in the photolysis of stratospheric water vapor causing the atmosphere to experience rapid hydrogen escape, and the 'maximumgreenhouse' outer edge where an increase in CO 2 no longer results in a net surface heating due to the increased albedo. Our five temperate candidates may represent attractive targets for the characterization of HZ exoplanets around nearby low mass stars. We will address the prospect of atmospheric characterization of these planets in Sect. 5.3.2.</p></div>

This candidate is likely the coldest object in our sample with a MAP S = 0.3 S ⊕ and a corresponding equilibrium temperature of T eq = 212 K assuming zero albedo and perfect heat redistribution.</p><p>OI 92444219.01. A pST based on its moderate FPP. This cool 3 R ⊕ candidate is has an estimated period between 22-95 days placing it at S = 0.5 S ⊕ with an equilibrium temperature T eq = 238 K.</p><p>OI 100103200.01. The pPC with ultra low FPP but is seen to likely be contaminated by the nearby TIC 100103201 based on the GAIA astrometry. This pPC orbits a J = 7.5 star with an 18.4 day period and whose size is 2 R ⊕ making it a attractive target for both RV characterization and possibly transmission spectroscopy observations with JWST if impending difficulties of observing bright targets can be strategically mitigated (see Sect. 5.3.2). OI 231702397.01. This PC has already been reported as TOI-122.01. The ORION orbital period is consistent with that of TOI-122.01 although we derive a 15% larger radius (2.8 R ⊕ ) corresponding to the 13% larger stellar radius in our sample. Given its large size, the expected mass from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chen &amp; Kipping (2017)</ref> massradius relation is 8.26 M ⊕ making it an attractive target for rapid RV follow-up despite being relatively dim with J = 11.5.</p><p>OI 234994474.01 : This PC has been reported as TOI-134.01 and is being validated with RVs from HARPS and PFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Astudillo-Defru et al. 2019</ref>). The ORION parameters are largely consistent with the TOI-134.01 parameters albeit with a slightly smaller radius of 1.38 R ⊕ (12% reduction) for an unchanged stellar radius. Being by-far the hottest target in candidate sample (T eq = 965 K) and orbiting an early M dwarf with J = 7.9, this PC is one of the best targets for any further RV characterization to search for longer period companions, transmission spectroscopy, and even thermal emission spectroscopy. Regarding the latter, TOI-134.01 is even more favorable than the previously most attractive terrestrial-sized planet for such observations: GJ 1132b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Morley et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>OI 260004324.01. A new terrestrial-sized PC which is the smallest in our sample at 1.15 R ⊕ with a 3.8 day period. Its small size and small expected mass of 1.6 M ⊕ around a 0.56 M ⊕ early M dwarf (J = 8.8) will make this a slightly more challenging target for RV follow-up but may still be of interest for probing the low mass end of the 50 planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ targeted for completion of the TESS level one science requirement.</p><p>OI 262530407.01. This PC has already been reported as TOI-177.01. The ORION orbital period is consistent with that of TOI-177.01 although we find a 12% smaller radius of 1.87 R ⊕ for an unchanged stellar radius. The short period and host star brightness (J = 8.17) make this PC an exceptional candidate for transmission spectroscopy observations and is one that is less affected by the NIRISS bright limit of its SOSS mode compared to other close-in superEarth-sized planets in this catalog.</p><p>OI 278661431.01. A new pPC based on its moderate FFP. If validated, the candidate would have an orbital period of 17 days and a radius of 2.8 R ⊕ . This pPC is temperate at S = 1.1 S ⊕ and near to the 'water-loss' HZ inner edge. This pPC orbits one of the cooler TICs in our candidate-hosting sample (T eff = 3300 K) with a correspondingly small radius of 0.28 R , thus making it an attractive target for transmission spectroscopy observations. OI 305048087.01. This PC has already been reported as TOI-237.01. The ORION orbital period is consistent with the 5.4 day period and 1.7 R ⊕ radius of TOI-177.01.</p><p>OI 307210830.01. This PC is one of the three reported TOIs around TIC 307210830 (i.e. 175-01, 02, 03). Only TOI-175.01 is detected by ORION for the reasons discussed in Sect. 5.2. The ORION planet parameters for this, the middle planet in this candidate three planet system, are all consistent with those for TOI-175.01. This PC is in the closest planetary system in our sample and is correspondingly an attractive target for RV characterization of individual masses and the RV analysis of the possible resonant pair 175.01/175.02 for comparisons to TTV analyzes from follow-up photometry. This PC is also a viable target for the atmospheric characterization of a terrestrial-sized planet (1.3 R ⊕ ).</p><p>OI 415969908.01. This PC has already been reported as TOI-233.01. The ORION orbital period is consistent with that of TOI-233.01 but finds a 26% smaller radius (1.9 R ⊕ ) in part because of the refined stellar radius being reduced by 21% in our sample.</p><p>OI 415969908.02. The ST event detected in the light of TIC 415969908 which already hosts the aforementioned candidate TOI-233.01 at 11.7 days. The estimated period of OI 415969908.02 is 32-108 days which effectively spans the conservative HZ limits from <ref type="bibr">Koppa- rapu et al. (2013)</ref> and whose MAP value is 53 days or S = 0.5 S ⊕ . The measured radius is 2 R ⊕ (r p /Rs = 0.05) making this ST event the most difficult to follow-up from the ground among the three ST events in our candidate catalog.</p><p>OI 441056702.01. A new PC with an orbital period of 6.3 days and radius of 2 R ⊕ thus potentially being located within the photoevaporation valley around M dwarfs. Orbiting a moderately bright early-M to late-K dwarf (T eff = 4030 K) and with an expected mass of 4.5 M ⊕ , this PC represents another attractive target for RV characterization aimed at addressing the TESS level one science requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">TOIs undetected by ORION</head><p>Our stellar sample using refined stellar parameters based on GAIA distances, contains ten TICs with TOIs listed as part of the TESS alerts 5 . These ten systems host a total of twelve TOIs in nine single PC systems and TIC 307210830 which hosts three TOIs. The ORION results presented in this paper include the independent detection of 8/12 TOIs with an additional ST event around TIC 415969908 which already hosts TOI-233.01. The discrepancies between the TESS alerts and our ORION results are described in what follows.</p><p>TIC 259962054. This TIC was observed in the consecutive TESS sectors 1 and 2. The TOI-203.01 has an orbital period of 52 days, longer than any repeating candidate in our catalog. A signal at ∼ 52.1 days is found in the ORION linear and periodic search stages with an or-5 As of <ref type="bibr">December 19, 2018.</ref> bital phase that is consistent with that reported for TOI-203.01. This suggests that the TOI-203.01 transit-like signal at 52 days does exist in the light curve. The phase-folded light curve satisfies all but the second criterion from the automated vetting stage (see Sect. 3.5.1) with S/N transit = 5.6 &lt; c 1 = 8.4. This is principally because the fitted transit depth within ORION is Z = 1839 ppm which is just ∼ 73% of the TOI's reported depth thus making it difficult to confirm the nature of the repeating signal as due to a transiting planet with just two transits observed.</p><p>TIC 307210830. This system contains three TOIs (175.01, 175.02, 175.03) at 3.69, 7.45, and 2.25 days respectively. The innermost planet candidate is not found during the linear and periodic search stages. This is likely caused by the candidate's depth of 571 ppm (as reported in the TESS alert portal) being less than the median photometric uncertainty of its light curve (i.e. median(σ f ) ∼ 770 ppm). The two remaining planet candidates were each seen to be detected in the ORION linear search stage owing to their ∼ 3 times larger transit depths. However, this candidate pair has an orbital period ratio that is within 1% of a 2:1 resonant configuration. Recall that pairs of periods of interest which are that close to an integer period ratio will have one of those periods automatically discarded in the periodic search stage due to the detected periodic signals likely being aliases of the each other rather than being due to two separate planetary candidates.</p><p>TIC 316937670. TOI-221.01 has an orbital period of 0.624 days and a low transit depth of 954 ppm. By adopting the reported TOI-221.01 transit depth and duration, we estimate CDPP transit and find that Z/CDPP transit ∼ 1.1. Because of this, the results of the ORION linear search only detect a single transit-event above the S/N threshold such that no periodic events can be found. If the linear search S/N thresh-32 R. Cloutier old is lowered such that multiple transits from TOI-221.01 are detected in the linear and periodic search stages, then the expected S/N transit is ∼ 7.2 which would still be insufficient to detect the PC in a single TESS sector. We are further discouraged by the prospect of lowering the linear search S/N threshold as this would drastically increase the number of FPs purely from the noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Comparison to yield simulations</head><p>Ballard (2018) performed a set of yield simulations focusing on M dwarfs not unlike the stellar population considered in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ballard (2018)</ref> derive an ensemble completeness function for M dwarfs observed by TESS based on the simulated TESS yield from <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al.

The expected TESS yield around M dwarfs is then derived by applying the completeness as a function of P and r p to M dwarf planet occurrence rates. Said occurrence rate are derived from <ref type="bibr">Dressing &amp; Char- bonneau (2015)</ref> and corrected for the eccentricity distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Limbach &amp; Turner 2015)</ref>, dynamical stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>), and multiplicity effects according to the 'Kepler dichotomy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ballard &amp; Johnson 2016)</ref> of M dwarf planet populations: either high multiplicity systems (N &gt; 5) with low mutual inclinations or systems with lower multiplicity (N ∼ 1−2) and high mutual inclinations. The resulting TESS yield around M1-M4 dwarfs is predicted to be 990 ± 350 planets.</p><p>The following back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals how the expected M dwarf planet population to be discovered with TESS compares to our ORION results from the first two TESS sectors. First we note that the <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref> stellar population is a synthetic one derived from TRILEGAL galaxy model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Girardi et al. 2005</ref>). It contains 200,000 stars targeted by TESS which is effectively the size of the TIC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Stassun et al. 2018</ref>). Using the stellar parameters from the TIC-7 we find 53204 TIC M1-M4 dwarfs (T eff ∈ [3200 − 3700] K; <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Pecaut &amp; Mamajek 2013)</ref>. Of these, 1624 and 1869 are targeted in sectors 1 and 2 respectively with 2849 being unique TICs. However unlike in the TIC-7, our stellar sample is derived using parallaxes from the GAIA DR2 which results in a distinct population of just 1149 M1-M4 dwarfs observed in either or both of TESS sectors 1 and 2. We use a simple correction factor to the expected TESS yield to account for the fractionally fewer M1-M4 stars that we target for transit searches compared to the TIC-7. This factor is f = 1149/2849 = 0.40 ± 0.01 where the f uncertainty is propagated from Poisson statistics.</p><p>The predicted number of M dwarf TESS planets discovered in sectors 1 and 2 is 990w ∼ 53 ± 19 where w = 2849/53204 is the fraction of all M1-M4 dwarfs targeted in those sectors. Correcting this expected number of planets from the first two TESS sectors by the f times fewer M1-M4 dwarfs in our stellar sample compared to in the TIC-7, we find that we are expected to detect ∼ 21 ± 8 planets. Note that this calculation inherently assumes that the detection completeness of ORION is equivalent to the ensemble completeness derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ballard (2018)</ref>.</p><p>If we include putative planet candidates, then recall that the total number of PCs detected around M1-M4 dwarfs in this study is sixteen (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref>). If each of these candidates become validated planets that this many planets would consistent with the expected number of M dwarf planet detections from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ballard (2018)</ref>. Although, our yield is somewhat on the lower end of what is expected. If the TESS alert TOIs around M1-M4 dwarfs that remain undetected by ORION in this study are included, then TESS has discovered 19 M1-M4 PCs in its first two sectors. The consistency between the ORION yield and the expected TESS yield speaks highly to TESS's overall performance compared to its expected completeness from <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ballard (2018)</ref>, as well as to the outstanding performance that the TESS mission has already achieved so early-on in its lifetime.

Flare events are therefore searched within each light curve by first flagging individ- ual flux measurements which are &gt; c 5 = 8 median absolute deviations brighter than the median flux baseline. However, by the aforementioned criterion, individual stochastic flux jumps can also mimic flares. It is therefore required that any window over which a possible flare event occurs must contain &gt; c 6 = 2 successive bright measurements above the c 5 thresh- old in order to identify a flare. Flux mea- surements occurring within a flare window are identified from the q th percentile of the light curve flux distribution where q is the fraction of the observational baseline that occurs within a flare's duration. The total flare duration over the light curve is calcu- lated from the number of detected flares multiplied by the characteristic M dwarf flare duration c 7 = 30 minutes (Moffett 1974; Walkowicz et al. 2011; Hawley et al. 2014). Transit-like events with an identi- fied flare occurring within c 8 = 4 transit durations from T 0 of a POI are vetted as flares. 7. Visual inspection of a number of TIC light curves observed during sector 1 frequently reveals sharp flux losses at the light curve edges. This signature is often falsely at- tributed to transit-like signal but is clearly a systematic effect that is not always well- modelled during de-trending stage. Be- cause this edge effect appears to operate over the final ∼ 4 − 5 hours of the light curve, POIs with mid-transit times within c 9 = 4.8 hours of either the first or fi- nal flux measurements are automatically flagged as probable false positives.</figDesc></figure>

Measurements initially flagged as being potentially associated with a flare event are highlighted by the large orange markers in the light curve. Only windows containing at least two successive bright measurements above this threshold are flagged as flares. TIC 25200252 is found to shows nine flares during the TESS sector 1 baseline which are marked by the vertical ticks along the abscissa axis. This includes two flares in quick succession near BJD-2,457,000 = 1345.2.
