				<p>Planet-star interactions with precise transit timing. I. The refined orbital decay rate for WASP-12 b and initial constraints for HAT-P-23 b, KELT-1 b, KELT-16 b, WASP-33 b, and WASP-103 b ABSTRACT Theoretical calculations and some indirect observations show that massive exoplanets on tight orbits must decay due to tidal dissipation within their host stars. This orbital evolution could be observationally accessible through precise transit timing over a course of decades. The rate of planetary in-spiralling may not only help us to understand some aspects of evolution of planetary systems, but also can be used as a probe of the stellar internal structure. In this paper we present results of transit timing campaigns organised for a carefully selected sample of hot Jupiter-like planets which were found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal interactions on the Northern hemisphere. Among them, there is the WASP-12 system which is the best candidate for possessing an in-falling giant exoplanet. Our new observations support the scenario of orbital decay of WASP-12 b and allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter of the host star Q ′ * = (1.82 ± 0.32) × 10 5 is in agreement with theoretical predictions for subgiant stars. For the remaining systems-HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103-our transit timing data reveal no deviations from the constant-period models, hence constraints on the individual rates of orbital decay were placed. 2 The tidal quality parameters of host stars in at least 4 systems-HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103-were found to be greater than the value reported for WASP-12. This is in line with the finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency of tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak. Key words: planet-star interactions-stars: individual: HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-12, WASP-33, WASP-103-planets and satellites: individual: HAT-P-23 b, KELT-1 b, KELT-16 b, WASP-12 b, WASP-33 b, WASP-103 b</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the first detections of massive planets on tight orbits around solar-like stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Latham et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Marcy &amp; Butler 1996</ref>) it has been possible to investigate planet-star tidal interactions outside the Solar Sytem. The mechanism of tides is well studied in the Earth-Moon-Sun system. The tidal force, which is raised by one body on the other, is proportional to the mass of the body rising the tide, and inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between both bodies. For some very hot Jupiter-like exoplanets (with orbital periods shorter than a couple of days), the orbital separation is as small as several stellar radii, making such systems great laboratories for studies of tidal effects.</p><p>The tidal and rotational bulges deform figures of both the star and the planet. This departure from spherical symmetry entails that the quadrupole component of the gravitational field makes the planetary orbit to precess. <ref type="bibr">Ragozzine &amp; Wolf (2009)</ref> found that apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters is driven mainly by the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge. Its rate depends on properties of the planetary interior. Calculations show that the precession period could be as short as a few decades for the most promising systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Birkby et al. 2014</ref>). The precession motion could be detected using the method of precise transit timing if only the planetary orbit is non-circular. However, tidal interactions tend to circularise planetary orbits in relatively short timescales, so any non-zero eccentricity would need to be invoked and sustained by a certain process, such as gravitational perturbations induced by nearby low-mass planets.</p><p>A bulk of hot Jupiters are far from tidal equilibrium. They are expected to be spiralling towards host stars because of the dissipative nature of tides, caused by the friction of the tidally induced fluid flow ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Levrard et al. 2009</ref>). In such systems, the host star usually rotates slower than the planet orbits it. There is a phase lag in the tidal response that results in transferring the orbital angular momentum into the star -the orbit shrinks and the star spins up. The dissipation of energy stored in the equilibrium tides is thought to occur in stellar zones where the viscosity is induced by the turbulent convective motions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Zahn 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Goldreich &amp; Nicholson 1977</ref>. The numerical simulations show, however, that the effective viscosity can be reduced in the systems with high tidal frequency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ogilvie &amp; Lesur 2012</ref>). On the other hand, the tidal dissipation can be boosted by radiative damping of the dynamical tides that are produced near radiative-convective boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Goldreich &amp; Nicholson 1989</ref> and reference therein).</p><p>The efficiency of tidal dissipation in the host star can be characterised with the dimensionless tidal quality parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q ′ * = 3 2 Q * k 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966)</ref>, where Q * is the inverse of the phase lag between the tidal potential and the tidal bulge (or the ratio of energy stored in tidal distortion to energy dissipated in one tidal cycle), and k 2 is the second order tidal Love number which is a dimensionless measure of the density profile inside the star. The tidal quality parameter depends on the properties of the star such as the mass, structure, and rotation rate. A smaller value of Q ′ * translates into a stronger or more efficient tidal dissipation and vice versa. Theoretical studies of turbulent damping of equilibrium tides predict Q * of 10 8 -10 9 for main-sequence stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Penev &amp; Sasselov 2011</ref>). The studies of binary stars in stellar clusters show that Q ′ * might be of order 10 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Meibom &amp; Mathieu 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Milliman et al. 2014</ref>). On the other hand, a statistical analysis of the destruction rate of hot Jupiters, which is based on the population of currently known planets, yields Q ′ * &gt; 10 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Penev et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Jackson et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Husnoo et al. (2012)</ref> obtained Q ′ * ∼ 10 6.5 , while Hansen (2010) found 10 7 &lt; Q ′ * &lt; 10 9 . An investigation of orbital parameters for a sample of 231 hot planets allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bonomo et al. (2017)</ref> to conclude that Q ′ * must exceed 10 6 -10 7 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Penev et al. (2018)</ref> studied hot-Jupiter systems with known stellar rotation periods and found that the tidal quality parameter may also depend on the amplitude and frequency of the tidal excitation. The authors concluded that the value of Q ′ * might be in a wide range between 10 5 and 10 7 with the dependence on tidal frequency. This dependency could reconcile apparently inconsistent values of Q ′ * which are reported in the literature. Orbital decay can be detected through transit timing. For some planets, the cumulative shift in transit times may be of order 100 s after ten years if Q ′ * = 10 6 is assumed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Birkby et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Essick &amp; Weinberg 2016</ref>. So far, the only candidate for a spiralling-in exoplanet is WASP-12 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hebb et al. 2009</ref>). The planet has a mass of ∼ 1.4 M Jup (Jupiter mass) and bloated radius of ∼ 1.9 R Jup (Jupiter radius). It orbits its F/G host star within 1.09 d. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Maciejewski et al. (2016)</ref> employed the method of precise transit timing to detect the apparent shortening of the orbital period. Departure from a linear transit ephemeris by ∼ 5 minutes was observed in the course of 8 years. This finding translates into the rate of orbital period shortening of ∼ 2.6 × 10 −2 s yr −1 , giving Q ′ * = 2.5 × 10 5 . Although transit times were found to follow the quadratic ephemeris very well, there is still an alternative scenario in which the observed period shrinkage is de facto a part of a long-period cycle caused by either tidally induced orbital precession ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Maciejewski et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Patra et al. 2017</ref>) or dynamical interactions with a planetary companion <ref type="bibr">(Maciejew- ski 2018)</ref>. New transit timing observations are expected to help distinguish between both models.</p><p>Being motivated by the case of the WASP-12 system, we have initiated a systematic transit timing monitoring programme for a sample of hot giant exoplanets for which period shrinkage could be detected in the course of a decade. In this paper, we discuss sample selection criteria and present the first results obtained for the systems of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The sample</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Selection criteria</head><p>Our procedure of sample selection was based on the catalogue of transiting exoplanets which was provided by the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia <ref type="bibr">1 (Schneider et al. 2011</ref>). Using an on-line tool, a list of confirmed transiting exoplanets was extracted. With one-meter class telescopes, which are used by us for transit observations, it is possible to acquire photometric time series with a precision of ∼ 1 ppth (parts per thousand) of the normalised flux per minute for stars brighter than 12-13 mag. Such datasets allow us to determine individual mid-transit times with errors between 20 and 40 s, and when they are combined together, an averaged timing precision down to or even below 10 s (≈ 1σ) can be achieved in time scales of months. Therefore we considered only planets for which the predicted cumulative shift in transit times T shift is greater than 30 s (&gt; 3σ) after 10 years. To estimate T shift for individual systems, we transformed the equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Goldreich &amp; Soter (1966)</ref> to derive</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T shift = − 27 4 π Q ′ * M p M * a R * −5 1 P orb (10 yr) 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P orb is the orbital period, M p is the planet's mass, M * and R * are the host star's mass and radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. In our calculations, the canonical value of Q ′ * = 10 6 was assumed. Since our one-meter class telescopes are located on the northern hemisphere, we considered only systems with declination greater than 0 • . To meet the photometric quality criterion, we rejected systems with stars fainter than ∼ 13 mag in the V band and systems with transits shallower than 3 ppth.</p><p>Six systems passed our criteria: HAT-P-23, KELT-1, <ref type="bibr">KELT-16, WASP-12, WASP-33, and WASP-103</ref>. Their values of T shift were found to be in a range of -640 (KELT-1 b) to -34 (WASP-33 b) s per 10 years. Since the uncertainty of the assumed Q ′ * dominates the error budget of T shift , we treat the calculated values as estimates without uncertainties. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the location of the exoplanets of our sample in the diagram of T shift vs. P orb .  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Objects of the sample</head><p>HAT-P-23 b is a 2.1 M Jup planet orbiting an early G dwarf star within 29 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2011</ref>). The radial velocity follow-ups show that its orbit is prograde and aligned ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Moutou et al. 2011</ref>), and together with occultation observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(O'Rourke et al. 2014)</ref> show that the orbit is circular with a 2σ upper limit for its eccentricity equal to 0.052 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bonomo et al. 2017</ref>). The planet was initially found to have a radius of R b ≈ 1.4 R Jup , so it was classified as a highly inflated transiting planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2011</ref>). However, the follow-up transit observations by , <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ciceri et al. (2015), and</ref> do not confirm that finding, yielding a more compact planet with R b ≈ 1.2 R Jup . One must note, however, that this discrepancy is produced by a smaller value of the redetermined stellar radius in a study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ciceri et al. (2015)</ref> while the value of the planet-to-star radii ratio k is reproduced, and by an apparently smaller value of k reported by  and .</p><p>With a mass of ∼ 27 M Jup , KELT-1 b was classified as a low-mass brown dwarf or a super-massive planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Siverd et al. 2012)</ref>. The boundary between planets and brown dwarfs is not clearly defined, ranging from ∼ 10 M Jup of the formationbased definition (Schlaufman 2018), through ∼ 13 M Jup from a deuterium burning criterion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Spiegel et al. 2011</ref>), to 25 − 30 M Jup resulting from the intersection of the mass distribution of sub-stellar objects (Udry 2010). KELT-1 b fulfils criteria of being a high-mass giant gaseous planet as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hatzes &amp; Rauer (2015)</ref>. The body orbits its mid-F star on a circular and aligned orbit within 29 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Siverd et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Beatty et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Croll et al. 2015</ref>). With a radius of 1.1 R Jup , the planet was found to be significantly inflated when compared to standard evolutionary models without insolation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Siverd et al. 2012</ref>). Occultation observations indicate that the day side has an average brightness temperature of ∼3200 K (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beatty et al. 2017</ref>) and there is a weak or moderate redistribution of heat in the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beatty et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baluev et al. (2015)</ref> used amateur transit observations to refine a transit ephemeris and found that the orbital period is ∼ 0.6 s shorter compared to that one in the discovery paper.</p><p>KELT-16 b belongs to a group of exoplanets with orbital periods shorter than 1 d. It has a mass of ∼2.8 M Jup and a radius of 1.4 R Jup , and needs only 23.5 h to orbit its F7 host star . In this paper, we present the first followup observations acquired a number of cycles after the discovery of the system. WASP-12 b is the only hot Jupiter planet for which long-term variations in transit times have been detected from ground observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Maciejewski et al. 2016)</ref>. At the time of discovery, it was found to be one of the most intensely irradiated planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hebb et al. 2009</ref>). The planet's proximity to the star results in a high equilibrium temperature of 2500 K, thus encouraging numerous studies on the properties of the planetary atmosphere. The optically opaque planet is tidally distorted and occupies a significant fraction of the Roche lobe (e.g. Budaj 2011). Observations indicate that the globe is surrounded by a translucent exosphere which overfills the Roche lobe and escapes, forming a stable and translucent circumstellar cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Debrecht et al. 2018</ref> and references therein).</p><p>The A5 star WASP-33 was found to harbour a ∼3.3 M Jup and ∼1.5 R Jup giant planet on a 29 h orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Christian et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Kovács et al. 2013</ref>). The fast rotation of the star precludes acquiring accurate radial velocity measurements, so the line-profile tomography during transit was used to confirm the planetary nature of WASP-33 b <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collier Cameron et al. 2010</ref>). The retrograde, nearly polar orbit was found to undergo nodal precession ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Johnson et al. 2015</ref>) which is a manifestation of classical and general relativistic non-Keplerian orbital effects (Iorio 2011). The star was found to be a non-radial pulsator of the δ Scuti type <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collier Cameron et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Herrero et al. 2011</ref>). Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Essen et al. (2014)</ref> identified 8 discrete pulsation components with amplitudes between 0.4 and 1.0 mmag. Occultation observations result in a high brightness temperature, suggesting that the redistribution of heat from the day side of the globe to the night side, as well as within the day side, is highly inefficient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Smith et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>With a period as short as 22.2 h, WASP-103 b belongs to a group of ultrashort-period giant planets close to tidal disruption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gillon et al. 2014</ref>). It has a mass of ∼ 1.5 M Jup and radius of ∼ 1.5 R Jup , and orbits an F8 dwarf. <ref type="bibr">South- worth et al. (2015)</ref> acquired 17 follow-up transit light curves that allowed them to refine the transit ephemeris and to detect a variation of the planetary radius with optical wavelength. This effect was thought to be caused in part by Rayleigh scattering in the planetary atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Southworth et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Southworth &amp; Evans 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Turner et al. 2017</ref>). However, the strong scattering slope is not supported by transmission spectroscopy observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Lendl et al. 2017</ref>). The system parameters were revised by a global analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Delrez et al. (2018)</ref> in which new transit and occultation photometric time series were used together with literature data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observations and data reduction</head><p>Photometric observations, which are reported in this paper, were acquired between March 2016 and November 2018. A bulk of the photometric time series were acquired with instruments which are listed below according to mirror diameter:</p><p>• the 2.0 m Ritchey-Chrétien-Coudé telescope at the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria), equipped with a Roper Scientific VersArray 1300B (by December 2017) or ANDOR iKon-L 936 (from January 2018) CCD camera -ROZ 2.0, • the 0.6 m Cassegrain telescope at the Białków Observatory of the Wrocław University (Poland), equipped with an Andor CCD camera -BIA 0.6.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">•</formula><p>To suppress flat-field inaccuracies, all telescopes were automatically or manually guided with a precision of a few arc seconds. The instrumental set-ups were usually defocused to avoid saturation for longer exposures that reduced dead-time needed for a CCD read-out. Observations usually started 1-2 hours before an expected transit ingress and lasted additional 1-2 hours after the egress. Those out-of-transit portions of the data were used to monitor trends in photometry that were caused by differential atmospheric extinction and instrumental effects. These requirements were not always met, mainly due to technical or weather reasons. A bulk of the time series were acquired in white light or through a blue blocking (λ &lt; 500 nm) long-pass filter (LP500). This approach allowed us to increase the instrumental efficiency, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio which is crucial for precise transit purposes. Some light curves were acquired through Cousins R filters in which the instruments were found to have the highest efficiency. One transit of WASP-12 b was observed in the Johnson B band, and another one through a wide V +R filter, optimised for transit observations of Sun-like stars. For WASP-33, three light curves recorded in the Johnson V band to avoid significant defocusing and hence blending. Since the time survey plays a pivotal role for timing purposes, the timestamps were synchronised to UTC with at least sub-second accuracy via GPS or Network Time Protocol. In total, we acquired 82 photometric time series: 16 for 13 transits of HAT-P-23 b (one transit was observed simultaneously with two instruments and another one with three), 9 transit light curves for KELT-1 b, 11 for KELT-16 b, 22 for 19 transits of WASP-12 b, 11 for WASP-33, and 13 for 12 transits of WASP-103 b. Details on individual runs are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, sorted by target names and then by dates.</p><p>Data reduction and preliminary analysis of all observations, except those from GTC 10.4, were performed with AstroImageJ (AIJ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collins et al. 2017)</ref>. A standard calibration procedure, which included subtracting a median bias or dark frame and dividing by a median sky flat, was applied to science frames. Timestamps were converted to barycentric Julian dates in barycentric dynamical time (BJD TDB ) using a built-in converter. Fluxes were derived with the differential aperture photometry method against an optimised set of comparison stars which were available in the field of view. The radius of the photometric aperture was related to the full width at half maximum of the averaged stellar profile, multiplied by a factor which was optimised for individual light curves. The value of this factor was usually in the range of 0.8-1.3, mainly depending on the scale of defocusing. If justified by the improvement in the goodness of fit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collins et al. 2017)</ref>, simultaneous de-trending against the airmass, position on the matrix, time, and seeing was applied along with a trial transit model. In the final light curves, fluxes were normalised to unity outside the transits. Two white light curves, acquired for WASP-33 b's transits with GTC 10.4, were generated from series of low-resolution spectra used for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. The data reduction and light curves extraction were performed with IRAF following the procedure described in details in von <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Essen et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>The final light curves are available at the project web page http://www.home.umk.pl/˜gmac/TTV and via CDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis</head><p>The method of data analysis was similar for all 6 exoplanets of our sample. Some deviations from the adopted scheme were required for the WASP-12 and WASP-33 systems; they are described in subsections of Section 5. In the first step, the new light curves were modelled with the Transit Analysis Package (TAP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gazak et al. 2012</ref>) to redetermine systemic parameters and determine individual mid-transit times T mid . A transit phenomenon is coded with the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> which is parametrised with the orbital inclination i orb , the semimajor axis scaled in star radii a/R * , and the ratio of planet to star radii R p /R * . Circular orbits were assumed for all planets of our sample. The limb darkening (LD) law in the quadratic form <ref type="bibr">(Kopal 1950</ref>) was used to model the apparent emission across the stellar disk. Gaussian priors were set upon the linear and quadratic LD coefficients using values bi-linearly interpolated from tables of Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011) with formal uncertainties of 0.1 as the centre and width of the priors.</p><p>In trial fitting runs, LD coefficients were kept free, and their values were found to agree with the theoretical predictions within 2-3 σ. This finding justified our final approach. For white-light data, the theoretical LD coefficients were calculated by averaging those of B, V , R, and I bands. A similar approach was applied to the LP500 and V +R data by averaging V , R, and I and just V and R coefficients, respectively.</p><p>For each system, i orb , a/R * , and R p /R * were linked together for all new light curves. Mid-transit times were determined for each observed epoch, so if multiple photometric time series were available, their T mid 's were linked together. LD coefficients were linked for the data acquired in the same bands.</p><p>The best-fit solutions were found in a result of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random walk process based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and a Gibbs sampler. A time-correlated (red) noise was determined with the waveletbased technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carter &amp; Winn 2009</ref>). The priors were taken from the most recent papers for the individual systems. In the final run, 10 MCMC chains with 10 6 steps each were calculated. For each chain, the first 10% of trials were rejected in order to compensate for the impact of the initial values. The median value of marginalised posteriori probability distributions were used to determine the best-fit parameters. Their 1-σ uncertainties were derived as 15.9 and 84.1 percentile values of the cumulative distributions.</p><p>To obtain a complete set of mid-transit times determined in a homogenous way, the similar procedure was applied to light curves available in the literature. In the light curve modelling procedure, TAP was additionally allowed to search for possible linear trends for each light curve in order to account for de-trending imperfections and to include associated uncertainties in the total error budget of the fit. Only redetermined mid-transit times with their uncertainties were considered in further studies.</p><p>The sets of mid-transit times were used to refine the linear transit ephemerides in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T mid (E) = T 0 + P orb × E ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where E is a transit number from the reference epoch T 0 given in the discovery paper. The final values of T 0 and P orb and their uncertainties were derived from the posterior probability distributions of those parameters generated with the MCMC algorithm. We employed 100 chains, each of which was 10 4 steps long after discarding the first 1000 trials. The median value and 15.9 and 84.1 percentile values of each cumulative distribution were adopted as the best-fit parameter and its uncertainties, respectively. To place a constraint on the rate of the orbital decay, and hence on Q ′ * , a quadratic ephemeris in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T mid = T 0 + P orb × E + 1 2 dP orb dE × E 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where dP orb dE is the change in the orbital period between succeeding transits, was tried. Again, the MCMC method with configuration parameters as for the linear case described above, was used to determine the best-fit parameters. The value of Q ′ * was calculated after rearranging eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> to the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q ′ * = − 27 2 π M p M * a R * −5 dP orb dE −1 P orb .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>If no orbital decay was detected and dP orb dE was found to be indistinguishable from 0 within 2σ, the lower constraint on Q ′ * at the 95% confidence level was placed from the 5th percentile of the posterior probability distribution of dP orb dE .</p></div>

The smaller values of a/R * that are reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. (2011)</ref> and  are caused by adopting non-zero eccentricity by those authors.

The linear ephemeris was found to reproduce transit times with χ 2 red of 0.7. A trial fit of the quadratic ephemeris results in dP orb dE = (−0.1 ± 1.4) × 10 −9 days per epoch 2 that allows us to eliminate Q ′ * &lt; 1.1 × 10 5 at the 95% confidence level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">WASP-33 b</head><p>Although the complex photometric variability of WASP-33 remains outside the scope of this paper, it affects the transit light curves and must be included in the modelling to determine correct values of the transit parameters (e.g. von <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Essen et al. 2014</ref>). Since variable flux baseline is not implemented in TAP, additional steps were introduced to our data analysis procedure. First, a trial transit model with the parameters taken from von <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Essen et al. (2014)</ref> was fitted to a raw light curve. Then, the stellar variation was modelled using the data outside the transit and at the flat bottom phase. The ingress and egress were masked out with the margins of ±5 minutes to eliminate those portions of the data that could be affected by the transit morphology. In the next step, the residuals were modelled with the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f (t) = a 0 + a 1 t + a 2 t 2 + 8 ∑ i=1 A i sin (ν i t + φ i ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where a 0 , a 1 , and a 2 are the coefficients of a parabolic trend against time t , and A i , ν i , and φ i are the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of sinusoids which correspond to 8 pulsation frequencies reported by von <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Essen et al. (2014)</ref>. The parameters A i and ν i were fixed at the literature values because our photometric time  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1.</ref> series were not long enough to redetermined them in a reliable way. Since the phase of pulsations can change, we allowed φ i to float. Because of the complex variation signal, the raw light curves were subjected to de-trending against time only. The parabolic component was used to account for any possible trends caused by changes in airmass or weather conditions, or induced by instrumental effects. The best-fit of f (t) was found with the least squares method. The model of stellar variations was subtracted in magnitudes from the raw light curve which was then normalised to out-of-transit flux. The standard transit modelling procedure was performed to determine system parameters. The individual light curves with the stellar variation and the transit component split are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Our determinations of the transit parameters were compared to those literature studies which took stellar variability into account. As it can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, our results agree within 1-σ with most of the values reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kovács et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">), von Essen et al. (2014</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Zhang et al. (2018)</ref>. We note that the value of R p /R * obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kovács et al. (2013)</ref> appears to be significantly overestimated as compared to the other determinations.</p><p>In the transit timing analysis, we used mid-transit times from Collier <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cameron et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">), von Essen et al. (2014</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Johnson et al. (2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Zhang et al. (2018)</ref> which are based on professional photometric observations. As some fraction of the data may still be affected by stellar variability, a 3-σ clipping was iteratively applied while refining the transit ephemeris. The final set of mid-transit times used is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 7</ref>, and the timing residuals against the linear ephemeris are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>. Our new observations extend the time span of WASP-33 b's monitoring and hence allow us to refine the planet's transit ephemeris with unprecedented accuracy. The goodness of the fit χ 2 red = 2.5 was found to be degraded by determinations affected by the stellar variability. The trial quadratic ephemeris gives dP orb dE = (−0.3 ± 1.3) × 10 −10 days per epoch 2 , hence we conclude that Q ′ * of WASP-33 must be greater than 8.8 × 10 5 with 95% confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">WASP-103 b</head><p>Our analysis of the new transit light curves, which are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 8</ref>, resulted in the best-fit model that reproduces the literature values of transit parameters well within 1-2σ. For timing purposes, we reanalysed the transit photometry from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gillon et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Southworth et al. (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Delrez et al. (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Turner et al. (2017)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Lendl et al. (2017)</ref>. Our new timing dataset almost doubles the time span covered with observations. Thanks to this, the period uncertainty was reduced by one order of magnitude. The model assuming pure Keplerian motion of the planet was found to reproduce the timing observations with χ 2 red of 1.1. Applying the quadratic ephemeris gives dP orb dE = (1.03 ± 0.36) × 10 −9 days per epoch 2 . This positive value of dP orb dE , which is consistent with zero within the ∼3σ level, prevents us from placing a constraint on Q ′ * at the 95% confidence level. We find, however, that Q ′ * must be greater than 10 6 at the 99.96% (i.e., 3.5σ). While looking at the bottom panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 8</ref>, one can note that four transits observed ∼2 years after cycle zero appeared ∼1 minute earlier than the linear ephemeris predicted. Although those mid-transit times were re-determined using datasets from different sources ( <ref type="bibr">, Turney et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Lendl et al. 2017</ref>, their deviations are caused rather by accidental systematic errors than by a real astrophysical signal. No other deviations from the linear ephemeris can be detected in following observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding discussion</head><p>Employing the formalism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ivanov et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chernov et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrated that the rate of the orbital shrinkage of WASP-12 b might be consistent with theoretical predictions which assume the host star is a dwarf. In this scenario, the WASP-12 system would be nowadays observed in the final stage of its existence, which appears to be unlikely ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Patra et al. 2017</ref>). On the other hand,  found that the observed rate of orbital decay could only be explained if WASP-12 were a subgiant -a star during the transition phase between the end of the main-sequence stage and the beginning of stable hydrogen burning in a shell on the red-giant branch. This scenario is supported by the stellar properties which are consistent with a ∼1.2 M ⊙ subgiant star. Models of the internal structure of subgiants predict that the efficiency of the tidal dissipation is boosted by several orders of magnitude due to nonlinear wave-breaking of the dynamical tide near the star's centre <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2010)</ref>. If this mechanism operates in WASP-12, the calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barker &amp; Ogilvie (2010)</ref> yield Q ′ * ≈ 1.9 × 10 5 that is in an excellent agreement with our empirical Q ′ * ≈ 1.8 × 10 5 . The high value of Q ′ * 10 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2009)</ref> would have prevented the planet from spiralling inward over the course of ∼4 Gyr of WASP-12's evolution on the main sequence. The evolutionary changes in the star's interior structure would then trigger a rapid orbital decay that is observed nowadays <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2010</ref>). Our new transit timing observations fully support this scenario. We note, however, that further observations, including precise occultation timing, are still required to verify this interpretation. HAT-P-23 has an effective temperature of ∼5900 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2011</ref>) and is the most Sun-like star in our sample. Tidal dissipation occurs mainly in the convective layer. However, the weakly non-linear wave interactions close to the centre of a solar-type star may still play an important role, enhancing the rate of tidal dissipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Essick &amp; Weinberg 2016</ref>. For the HAT-P-23 system, the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Essick &amp; Weinberg (2016)</ref> predicts Q ′ * ≈ 6.7 × 10 5 that is not rejected by our empirical constraint of Q ′ * 5.6 × 10 5 . On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Penev et al. (2018)</ref> obtained Q ′ * ≈ 3 × 10 6 assuming that HAT-P-23 with its rotational speed observed nowadays has been spin up by tides being raised by its hot giant planet. Further precise transit timing data are expected to empirically verify the proposed models.</p><p>Our calculations show that the massive KELT-1 b is the best candidate for the detection of planet-star tidal interactions. Our preliminary constraint allows us to reject Q ′ * 8.4 × 10 5 that is consistent with theoretical predictions for F-type dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2009)</ref>, as well as with Q ′ * ≥ 1 × 10 6 obtained for the similar star WASP-18 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Wilkins et al. 2017</ref>). On the other hand, estimates of the stellar rotation period suggest that the star and its companion might be in a state of tidal equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Siverd et al. 2012</ref>). If both the rotation period of the host star and the orbital period of KELT-1 b are synchronised there is no tidal lag and a transfer of angular momentum due to tidal interactions does not take place. Further transit timing observations may provide tighter constraints on Q ′ * in order to address the questions on the dynamical state of this system.</p><p>KELT-16 and WASP-103, just like WASP-12, have effective temperatures close to the Kraft break which separates stars with radiative and convective envelopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Kraft 1967)</ref>. Assuming that both stars are dwarfs, they are expected to posses convective cores and thin -if any -convective outer layers. For such interior structure, the tidal dissipation is expected to be rather weak ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Penev et al. 2018</ref>). For KELT-16, the time span of timing monitoring is just 3 years, and is definitely too short to place a reasonable constraint on Q ′ * . The case of WASP-103 shows however that the expected value of Q ′ * is likely 10 6 . This finding is strengthened by spectroscopic observations showing that both hosts, unlike WASP-12, are main sequence stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Gillon et al. 2014</ref>). Further transit timing observations shall provide tighter constraints on Q ′ * for those stars. With an effective temperature of ∼7300 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collier Cameron et al. 2010</ref>), WASP-33 has a convective core and a radiative envelope. Observations of binary stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Khaliullin &amp; Khaliullina 2010)</ref> confirm that dynamical tides, which are excited at the boundary between the convective core and radiative envelope, may be dissipated through the radiative damping of internal gravity waves in the nonadiabatic layers located near the stellar surface (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Zahn 1975</ref>). The efficiency of this dissipation mechanism may be however orders of magnitude lower than for Sun-like stars with extensive convective envelopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Zahn 1977)</ref>. The WASP-33 system is a great laboratory for testing the rate of tidal dissipation in A-type stars. Although the photometric variability of the host star makes accurate transit timing challenging, our observations demonstrate that it is possible to determine mid-transit times with sub-minute precision. and Competitiveness (MINECO), co-funded with EU FEDER funds.
