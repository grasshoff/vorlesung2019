				<p>Context. Future instruments like NIRCam and MIRI on JWST or METIS at the ELT will be able to image exoplanets that are too faint (because of a low mass, and hence a small size or low effective temperature) for current direct imaging instruments. On the theoretical side, core accretion formation models predict a significant population of low-mass and/or cool planets at orbital distances of ∼ 10-100 au. Aims. Evolutionary models predicting the planetary intrinsic luminosity as a function of time have traditionally concentrated on gas-dominated giant planets. We extend these cooling curves to Saturnian and Neptunian planets. Methods. We simulate the cooling of isolated core-dominated and gas giant planets with masses of 5 M ⊕ to 2 M. The planets consist of a core made of iron, silicates, and ices, surrounded by a H/He envelope, similar to the ice giants in the solar system. The luminosity includes the contribution from the cooling and contraction of the core and of the H/He envelope, as well as radiogenic decay. For the atmosphere we use grey, AMES-Cond, petitCODE, and HELIOS models. We consider solar and non-solar metallicities as well as cloud-free and cloudy atmospheres. The most important initial conditions, namely the core-to-envelope ratio and the initial (i.e., post formation) luminosity are taken from planet formation simulations based on the core accretion paradigm. Results. We first compare our cooling curves for Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, Saturn, GJ 436b, and a 5 M ⊕ planet with a 1% H/He envelope with other evolutionary models. We then present the temporal evolution of planets with masses between 5 M ⊕ and 2 M in terms of their luminosity, effective temperature, radius, and entropy. We discuss the impact of different post formation entropies. For the different atmosphere types and initial conditions magnitudes in various filter bands between 0.9 and 30 micrometer wavelength are provided. Conclusions. Using black body fluxes and non-grey spectra, we estimate the detectability of such planets with JWST. It is found that a 20 (100) M ⊕ planet can be detected with JWST in the background limit up to an age of about 10 (100) Myr with NIRCam and MIRI, respectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>During the last few years, the Kepler satellite has detected numerous exoplanets of which many are in the sub-Neptunian or super-Earth mass range (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Batalha et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Burke et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Petigura et al. 2013</ref>). Different from the solar system, especially in close-in orbits, sub-Neptunian planets seem to be very abundant in the solar neigbourhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Howard et al. 2012</ref>). Various studies about sub-Neptunians and super-Earths have been conducted. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bodenheimer &amp; Lissauer (2014)</ref> studied the origin and evolution of lowdensity planets in the mass range from 1-10 M ⊕ , which are within 0.5 au from their star. In particular, they wanted to find out if these planets formed in situ or further out and then moved inwards. Another analysis conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chen &amp; Rogers (2016)</ref> was dedicated to compute mass-radius-composition-age relations for low-mass planets and how these depend on the evo- In the literature, evolutionary calculations for gas giants are abundant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Podolak et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2011</ref>). But studies of the thermodynamic evolution of low-mass planets are scarce so far (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Howe &amp; Burrows 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Beichman et al. 2010)</ref>. In this paper we want to extend calculations of the thermodynamic evolution and cooling curves to lower-mass planets in a small parameter study. An important initial condition for planetary cooling calculations is the post formation entropy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Marleau et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2017</ref>). For low-mass planets, the core-envelope mass ratios are also important. We study non-irradiated planets in a mass range of 5-636 M ⊕ (2 M ) and provide magnitudes corresponding to filter bands from various instruments/systems. While non-irradiated planets are simpler in the sense that the 1 arXiv: <ref type="bibr">1812</ref> three-dimensional redistribution of insolation energy through the planetary atmosphere does not have to be modeled, they still present a unique set of challenges when trying to model their atmospheric structures and spectra. For once, we expect the atmospheres of the objects studied here to be heavily enriched in metals, because the bulk enrichment of a planet appears to be a function of its mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Miller &amp; Fortney 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thorngren et al. 2016)</ref>, and so may the atmospheric enrichment (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2016)</ref>. The degree to which the the bulk enrichment of a planet is visible in its atmosphere is not straightforward to assess and hence remains an open challenge (see the discussion in Section 2.4.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2016</ref>). In addition, the question of when and how clouds form in self-luminous planets is far from being understood. The challenge lies in understanding and quantifying the multitude of microphysical processes which lead to cloud formation and evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Rossow 1978)</ref>. Because of this, most cloud models currently in use are heavily simplified or parametrized ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Tsuji et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allard et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allard et al. , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Zsom et al. 2012;</ref>, and remove certain cloud species as a function of temperature in an ad hoc fashion in order to mimic the settling of these species below the planet's photosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Morley et al. 2012;</ref>. Even with the use of a sophisticated micro-physical model, the cloud properties depend strongly on the unknown vertical mixing and the detailed atmospheric chemistry and hence remain a priori under-determined without further observational constraints ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gao et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ohno &amp; Okuzumi 2018)</ref>. Moreover, the recovery of the optical properties of such a vast variety of potential condensates is still an ongoing endeavor <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kitzmann &amp; Heng 2018)</ref>. Finally, in the light that some self-luminous sub-stellar objects cannot be reasonably fitted with current cloud models, an altogether different process has been suggested to affect the atmospheres and spectra of planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Tremblin et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>In terms of imaging observations of exoplanets, the soonto-be-launched JWST as well as the next generation of groundbased optical/near-infrared telescopes with 30-40 m primary mirrors will probe currently uncharted parameter space in terms of exoplanet mass and luminosity. JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI will provide unprecedented sensitivity to cool and/or low-mass objects at near-and mid-infrared wavelengths, respectively, and instruments like the Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brandl et al. 2016</ref>), to be installed at ESO's 39-m Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), with its unparalleled spatial resolution and superior sensitivity compared to current ground-based instruments, will be able to search for lowluminosity objects in the Solar vicinity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Crossfield 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Quanz et al. 2015</ref>). Hence, evolutionary models extending to smaller masses (ice giants, super-Earths) are needed to inform these future observations and interpret possible detections.</p><p>The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, the model and the improvements made in the planetary evolution code for calculating the evolution of (low-mass) planets are described. Section 3 shows various example and benchmark calculations, where the results obtained in this work are compared to measurements and earlier theoretical evolution calculations. The initial conditions for the final calculations are presented in Sect. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>. Following in Sect. 5 is the description of the atmospheres used in this work. After this, the results and discussion are presented in Sect. 6. Section 7 summarizes the findings and major conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Evolutionary and internal model</head><p>The evolutionary calculations presented here were obtained with the evolutionary model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jin et al. (2014)</ref>, which is itself based on the model of planetary evolution of <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. (2012b,a)</ref>. This model describes the planets as consisting of three distinct homogeneous layers, namely a H/He envelope (using the Equation of State (EoS) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Saumon et al. 1995</ref>), an ice layer (for planets which have accreted outside of the iceline), and a rocky core, which itself consists of silicates and iron. To address the cooling and contraction of very low-mass planets, we have extended the model regarding two aspects.</p><p>In our previous simulations, the source of luminosity of the planets were the cooling and contraction of the H/He envelope, the radiogenic luminosity due to long-lived radionuclides, and the luminosity generated from to the contraction of the solid core, when the external pressure exerted by the envelope changes. The contributions resulting from the non-zero temperature of the core were, in contrast, not considered. Therefore, the contraction of the core due to a change of its mean density, because of a decrease in its mean temperature, as well as the decrease of the core's internal energy, were neglected. While the contribution of the core to the total luminosity is negligible for H/He dominated giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>), neglecting it for core-dominated low-mass planets leads to inaccurate cooling sequences, as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref>. We have therefore added a first order temperature correction of the mean core density to take into account the temperature dependency of the core radius, which is described in more detail in Appendix A. We also take into account additional terms in the energy equation that is used to calculate the temporal evolution and thus the luminosity of the whole planet. This addition is described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Thermal energy of the core</head><p>As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. (2012b)</ref>, the calculation of evolutionary sequences in our model is based on the fundamental relation between the change of the total energy of the planet, and its luminosity because of energy conservation, dE tot /dt = −L (for other energy based approaches, see <ref type="bibr">Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014</ref>). In previous versions of our planet evolution model (except for <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Linder &amp; Mordasini 2016)</ref>, the thermal energy of the core was, however, neglected. As the second modification of the code, we include it here, considering both the isothermal and adiabatic case.</p><p>The total energy E tot of the planet consists of four terms</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E tot = E grav,e + E int,e + E grav,c + E int,c<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which are the gravitational potential energy of the gaseous envelope E grav,e , its thermal (internal) energy E int,e , the potential energy of the core E grav,c , and finally its thermal energy E int,c . Additional sources of luminosity we include are the radiogenic decay (calculated as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>, assuming a chondritic abundance of radionucleides) which is important for low-mass planets, as well as deuterium burning <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mollì ere &amp; Mordasini 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bodenheimer et al. 2013</ref>), which is in contrast negligible for the planets we study here. The potential energy of the gaseous envelope is found as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E grav,e = − M M core Gm r dm<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where M core is the core mass, M the total planet mass, r the distance from the planet's center, and G is the gravitational con-stant. The internal energy is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E int,e = M M core u dm (3)</formula><p>where u is the specific internal energy of the H/He gas which is directly given by the SCvH EoS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Saumon et al. 1995)</ref>. For the core's gravitational energy we assume for simplicity a (mean) density that is constant within the core, as density contrasts in the cores are smaller than in the gaseous envelope, even if this is strictly speaking not self-consistent with the internal structure model of the core. We then have for the potential energy of the core</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E grav,c = − 3GM 2 core 5R core (4)</formula><p>where R c is the core's radius that is found as described in the previous section. To relate the pressure with the density in the core we use the modified polytropic EoS of <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> for iron, rock (perovskite: MgSiO 3 ) and ice. Finally, for the core's internal energy we consider two cases, reflecting the uncertainty in the heat transport mechanism in the core ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>). First, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref>, we consider the isothermal case, where the internal energy is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E int,c,iso = c v M core T ceb (5)</formula><p>where c v is the specific heat capacity which is set to 10 7 erg g −1 K −1 for rocky material <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Guillot et al. 1995)</ref>. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref>, this value is compatible with the predictions by ANEOS in the relevant pressure and temperature range. For (water) ice we assume c v = 6 × 10 7 erg g −1 K −1 . For cores consisting of both rocky material and ice, we use the mass weighted average.</p><p>We also consider an adiabatic thermal structure of the core to estimate the core's thermal energy content. Under the (rough) approximation that in the core, the density ρ, heat capacity at constant pressure c p , and thermal expansion coefficient α are constant with radius, one can find the temperature as a function of radius r from the adiabatic temperature gradient</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dT dP = T α ρc p<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and the pressure as a function of radius</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P(r) = P ceb + 3GM 2 core 8πR 6 core (R 2 core − r 2 )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where P ceb is the pressure at the core-envelope boundary, i.e., at R core . Integrating the first equation and replacing the pressure using the second one yields the temperature structure as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T (r) = T ceb exp αGM core 2c p R 3 core (R 2 core − r 2 )</formula><p>In the simulations presented below, this is used as the nominal expression for the core thermal energy, since the core's energy transport is assumed to be convective. However, as already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Linder &amp; Mordasini (2016)</ref>, we find that using E int,c,adia instead of E int,c,iso has a much smaller impact on the results compared to neglecting the temperature dependence of the core material or its energy contribution in general. The influence on the luminosity of an isothermal vs. an adiabatic core is biggest for the 5, 10, and 20 M ⊕ planets. The simulations with an isothermal core are up to 21% smaller in luminosity, whereas for simulations where the core is excluded the luminosity is up to 86% smaller than in the adiabatic case. For the 50 M ⊕ planet the luminosity with an isothermal core is 11% smaller compared to the luminosity with an adiabatic core, and the luminosity without any core contribution is 57% smaller than in the adiabatic case. For higher masses the differences become smaller, but the general trend that simulations without any core contribution included have a much smaller luminosity compared to those with an isothermal or adiabatic core stays the same. In both the isothermal and adiabatic cases, we assume that the temperature is continuous across the core-envelope boundary. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref> this should be the case for planets with an envelope sufficiently massive that the surface of the rocky core is partially or completely molten (T ceb 2000 K), allowing an efficient heat transfer, as also discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ginzburg et al. (2016)</ref> in the context of icy cores. For the smallest planetary masses studied in this work for ages younger than 1 Gyr, T ceb is always above 2000 K. For the heavier masses this is true for even later times. These times are much later than the time when the planets could be detected, such that this does not pose a problem.</p><p>In this paper we deal with planets at large orbital distances, therefore a mechanism that is in principle also included in the evolution model, namely atmospheric escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jin &amp; Mordasini 2017)</ref>, can be neglected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Atmospheric models</head><p>The atmospheric models provide boundary conditions for the cooling of the planet and also determine the spectral appearance of the planet. In this work we use the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chabrier &amp; Baraffe (1997)</ref> to couple externally calculated atmospheres to the interior calculation. Briefly, for a given log g and T eff reached in the course of evolution, this simply means looking up (interpolating) the pressure and temperature in the convective very deep layers of the atmospheric model, and using this (P, T ) pair as the starting point for the inward structure integration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref> for the structure calculation). Further details will be given in Marleau et al., in prep. For petitCODE and HELIOS we use a pressure of 50 bar as the connecting level but verified that taking another pressure does not change the cooling curves and that the error in the radius from neglecting the layers above 50 bar is negligible (∼percent level, smaller than the effects of model uncertainties such as cloud types or metallicities). For the AMES-Cond model, we took the structures available on F. Allard's website 1 and extracted the layer at τ std ≈ 100, where all models are convective (this is almost but not quite the case at τ std ≈ 30), where the index "std" stands for "standard" and refers to 2.15 µm (F. <ref type="bibr">Allard 2014, priv. comm.)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally we also calculate evolutionary tracks using socalled Eddington atmospheres (Eddington atmospheres as al-ways simply use T = T eff at P = P phot = (2 g)/(3κ); <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref>.) Since Eddington atmospheres as relevant for this work have been described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. (2012b)</ref>, we only summarise the main features of AMES-Cond and briefly describe the more recent models petitCODE and HELIOS.</p><p>When the planet leaves the atmospheric grid, we extrapolate linearly from the last two grid points for the AMES-Cond grid. For the petitCODE and HELIOS grid we extrapolate using splines when the planet leaves the atmospheric grid. We have verified that this extrapolation is reasonable and similar to a linear extrapolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">AMES-Cond grid</head><p>The AMES-Cond grid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allard et al. 2001</ref>) consists of cloudfree atmosphere calculations which have been obtained with the PHOENIX code <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hauschildt &amp; Baron 1999</ref>). The models are calculated assuming radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium. While clouds are not included in these calculations, the sequestration of elements into condensates is treated. The AMES-Cond models treat condensation in strictly local chemical equilibrium, which means that the condensated particles do not rain out and are therefore still available for chemical reactions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allard et al. 2001</ref>). The models contain opacities important for young, high temperature brown dwarfs (e.g. oxides as TiO, VO, as well as hydrides such as FeH and MgH). Molecules which are important at intermediate to low temperatures, such as H 2 O and CH 4 , are also included, where the CH 4 line list with 47,415 lines is likely very incomplete when compared to modern CH 4 line lists with ∼ 10 10 lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Yurchenko &amp; Tennyson 2014)</ref>. Convection in the AMES-Cond models is treated using mixing length theory. AMES-Cond models have been widely used in the literature for the calculation of planet evolutionary tracks, but also for the spectral fitting of brown dwarf and dwarf star atmospheres (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>).</p></div>

The main assumptions of the code are radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium.</p><p>petitCODE treats condensation of solids in chemical equilibrium. This means that gas phase chemistry will be affected by the depletion of elements into solids. Rain-out is neglected, however. The choice to neglect feldspar condensation in the equilibrium chemistry calculations effectively mimics the rain-out of silicon atoms into silicates (which are included). Hence the alkalis, which would otherwise condense into feldspars, will stay in the atmosphere until Na2S and KCl condense, which seems to be confirmed by observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Line et al. 2017</ref>). Indeed petit-CODE spectra and structures agree with calculations including rain-out ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Baudino et al. 2017</ref>). The equilibrium condensate mass fractions are used as an input to the Ackerman &amp; Marley cloud model, as described in . This cloud model includes rain-out of the cloud particles, but this is not coupled back to the chemical equilibrium calculations.</p><p>Convection is modeled applying adiabatic adjustment: petit-CODE solves the radiative temperature structure of the atmosphere from top to bottom. If, during that process, the temperature gradient from one layer to the next is found to be steeper than the adiabatic temperature gradient, the temperature of the bottom layer is corrected to follow the adiabatic temperature gradient instead. This process is repeated until the bottom of the atmosphere is reached, and the full atmospheric temperature structure has been found. SeeMollì ere et al. (2015) for more details on how the adiabatic adjustment is implemented. The radiative transfer implementation treats absorption, emission and scattering. Clouds can be added self-consistently, making use of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> model, or a model which simply parametrizes the cloud particle size and maximum cloud mass density Mollì ere et al. 2017).

Water clouds are expected to form at temperatures from 300-400 K (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Morley et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Morley et al. (2014)</ref>). This is especially relevant for planets with masses smaller than 20 M ⊕ , which start their evolutions at temperature below 300 K. Water clouds can heavily impact the spectra by absorbing flux in the 4.5 micron region at higher temperatures (300 K) and heavily absorbing across the full spectral range for even cooler planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Morley et al. 2014</ref>). Thus the models are not very realistic at low temperatures, until very low temperatures are reached where the water cloud has disappeared below the photosphere and cloudless models become relevant again (until methane and ammonia condense). This has a potentially large effect on the surface boundary conditions as well as the predicted magnitudes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Examples of evolutionary calculations</head><p>In this section examples of cooling curves of simple models for a Neptune-, Uranus-, Jupiter-, and Saturn-like planet, for a planet like GJ 436 b, and for a close-in core-dominated sub-Neptunian planet are presented. The results are compared with other thermal evolution models to validate our evolutionary model. The thermal evolution of the planets is modeled with a three layer interior of the planet, namely an iron/silicate core, potentially an ice layer, and a (pure) H/He envelope, as it was described in more detail in Sect. 2. This is a similar to but simpler than the approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann (2010)</ref>, who include water mixed into the H/He layer, and H/He mixed into the water layer above the rock core. Assuming a mixed envelope composition is favored from a planet formation point of view, because planetesimals might get dissolved in the envelope of the accreting planet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Podolak et al. 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Mordasini et al. 2006</ref>). In contrast to the calculations further down, a grey atmosphere is assumed here as boundary condition for the inward integration, as introduced in Sect. 3. The metallicity [M/H] enters the opacity calculation, using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Freedman et al. (2014)</ref> Rosseland mean opacity. Note that our aim is not to present detailed models for the evolution of the giant planets of the solar system for which numerous observational constraints exist. Rather, we want to understand how our simplified model that is used for exoplanets compares to existing more detailed simulations. For exoplanets we usually only have little observational constraints like for example a rough age and magnitudes in some bands. This makes a simplified approach appropriate, as more complexity would in any case remain unconstrained.</p><p>The evolution of the planet is calculated in the following way. First, with static interior structure calculations, the envelope-to-core mass ratio is determined for the planet today, given its measured mass, luminosity and radius. Then, with the derived core-to-envelope mass ratio and a starting luminosity that is several orders of magnitudes higher than the one measured today, the planets' temporal evolution is calculated. Since the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale is short in the beginning, the exact starting luminosity respectively starting entropy is not important at present time anymore. The evolution is then calculated by taking into account the contraction of the envelope as well as its cooling, and the contraction, cooling and radioactive energy production in the core, as explained in Sect. 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Neptune and Uranus</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> the bottom right panel shows the luminosity as a function of time for our simplified Neptune model. The planet has a total mass of 1 M = 17.147 M ⊕ . The atmospheric opacity corresponds to a [M/H]=1.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014</ref>). An ice mass fraction of 50% in the core is assumed for all four giant planets in the solar system. A similar value is expected for a condensation of water ice in the solar nebula ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Min et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lodders 2003)</ref> and is also motivated from planetary formation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014</ref>). Much higher ice mass fractions have sometimes been used in interior structure models, which is difficult to understand from a formation point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014)</ref>. For this fixed ice mass fraction, the core and envelope mass is determined with static interior structure calculations so that the planet has for its observed intrinsic luminosity L = 9.85 × 10 −3 L (Guillot &amp; Gautier 2007) a radius of 1 R = 3.87 R ⊕ . We find a composition with a H/He envelope mass of 1.80 M ⊕ . The central part, built of an ice layer wrapped around an iron/silicate core, thus has a mass of 15.347 M ⊕ . An overview of these values is given in Tab. 1. This composition can be compared with the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Podolak et al. (1995)</ref>. Their Neptune model 1 (2) has a H/He envelope of 2.2 (0.9) M ⊕ , and a total heavy element mass of 14.9 (16.2) M ⊕ . These values bracket the ones found in our model. The bulk mass of heavy elements in Neptune found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. (2013)</ref> is 14 − 14.5 M ⊕ , which is also similar to our value.</p><p>We then followed the thermal evolution of this planet, starting with a high luminosity of 50 L . The total luminosity is split in the contributions coming from the core cooling, core contraction, envelope cooling and contraction as well as radiogenic heating. The total luminosity at the age of the solar system agrees well (difference of 3 %) with the observed value, which is shown as a black dot. Our cooling curve for Neptune is overlapping especially at later times with the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2011)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>, the change of the radius in time is shown, where the measured radius of today of the respective planet is given as a colored dot. Neptune's measured radius of today is by construction well reproduced (within 0.5 %) by our simulations.</p><p>The change in intrinsic luminosity over time of Neptune (bottom right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 1</ref>) follows a t −4/3 slope, which is analytically expected for the cooling of a planet where the dominant energy source is the thermal cooling of the core ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>We also simulated the cooling of an Uranus-like object. It is well known that Uranus is much fainter than expected from fully convective cooling models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Podolak et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Podolak et al. , 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013</ref>). We therefore expect that it is not possible to find a correct cooling age with our model. This is indeed the case: for the simulation of a simple Uranus model we assume that the planet has a total mass of 1 M = 14.536 M ⊕ with an opacity corresponding to [M/H]=1.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014)</ref>. In order to reproduce the radius of Uranus today R = 3.98 R ⊕ with the current upper limit of its intrinsic luminosity of L = 1.01 × 10 −3 L (one order of magnitude less than Neptune, Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014), we need   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 1</ref>. Temporal evolution of the luminosity of the simplified solar system gas giants. The different contributions to the total luminosity are indicated with colors, the luminosity of today is shown as a black dot. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 1</ref>. Overview of the simulated solar system planets. For all of them, a helium abundance of 0.27 and an ice mass fraction in the core of 0.5 was assumed. The [M/H] metallicities, the radii R meas. as well as the luminosities L meas. of the planets today were taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Guillot &amp; Gautier (2014)</ref>. With this interior composition of Uranus, we simulated the cooling of the planet, starting from a high initial luminosity (50 L as for Neptune, but the precise value is not important as long as it is high). Our evolution calculation of Uranus agrees at later times very well with the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2011)</ref>. We find that at the current age of the solar system the simulated planet has a luminosity that is 8 times too high relative to the upper limit of the observations, which can also be seen in the bottom left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 1</ref>. We therefore recover the result (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013</ref>) that standard fully convective cooling models fail to explain Uranus's very low luminosity. This is also mirrored in the fact that the simulated radius is 5 % too big compared to the measured radius of today (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>). So even though we matched a static model of the planet with the present measured luminosity and radius of the planet, these may not be reproduced by the modeled evolution of the planet at 4.5 Gyr.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Planet [M/H] R meas.

This could be due to a sta- ble stratification in the interior of Uranus and origin from a giant impact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013</ref>). We conclude that Uranus and Neptune might have very different internal structures and/or thermodynamic states despite their similar masses and radii.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Jupiter and Saturn</head><p>Jupiter is simulated with a total mass of M = 317.83 M ⊕ . We assumed again an ice fraction of 50% in the core as for Uranus and Neptune and an opacity corresponding to [M/H]=0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014</ref>). As before, we matched todays' given radius to the observed present-day luminosity by varying the core-envelope mass ratio. With static interior calculations, we obtain the radius of the planet today (R = 10.97 R ⊕ ) for a model with a central part containing of iron, silicate and ice of 27.50 M ⊕ and a H/He envelope mass of 290.33 M ⊕ (Tab. 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann (2010)</ref> conclude that the current Jupiter models show a range in the core mass of 0 − 18 M ⊕ and heavy element mass in the envelope of 0−37 M ⊕ . The more recent analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Wahl et al. (2017)</ref> based on Juno data finds core masses between 6 to 24 M ⊕ , and total heavy element masses (core and metals mixed in the envelope) of 24 to 46 M ⊕ , depending on assumptions on the core's state and the EOS. Thus, keeping in mind that the core mass in our model rather represents the bulk heavy element in the planet, our results lie in a similar interval for the heavy element content of Jupiter.</p><p>We then followed the evolution of this planet. The evolution of the luminosity and the radius can be seen in the top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 1</ref>, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>. Our modeled Jupiter is slightly too bright compared to the measured luminosity (difference of 13 %), as it was already found by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2011)</ref>. For the Neptune model, the biggest contribution to the total luminosity came from the core cooling, as it is expected for coredominated planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>). However, for our Jupiter model, the biggest contribution comes from the envelope contraction. Our modeled Jupiter is cooling too slowly compared to the real planet, reaching the observed luminosity at 4.91 Gyr. Therefore, also the modeled radius of the planet is slightly too big (1.0014 × R ) at the present age, which can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.  2</ref>.</p><p>We also modeled the evolution of Saturn. The planet was simulated with a mass of 1M = 95.159 M ⊕ . As for the other solar system planets, we assumed an ice mass fraction of 50% in the core, but an opacity corresponding to [M/H]=1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2014</ref>). We find a solution for the static interior model with an envelope mass of 72.159 M ⊕ and a central part of 23 M ⊕ (Tab. 1). Following the evolution of the planet over time, we expect a cooling time for our homogeneous adiabatic models of 2-3 Gyr, as in <ref type="bibr">Püstow et al. (2016)</ref>. Our modeled Saturn reaches the luminosity of today at 3.1 Gyr, while at 4.6 Gyr the simulated Saturn is 48% too dim (note the logarithmic scale). The difference between today's simulated luminosity and the measured one for Saturn is much larger than for Jupiter, by a factor of 3.7. Also the radius of the simulated planet is thus smaller than the measured radius. The modeled Saturn is therefore cooling too fast. Hence, we reproduce the common result in the literature that adiabatic homogeneous models underpredict Saturn's current luminosity, or in other words that Saturn exhibits a strong excess luminosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Stevenson &amp; Salpeter 1977)</ref>. This is commonly attributed to H/He demixing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Stevenson &amp; Salpeter 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fortney &amp; Hubbard 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Püstow et al. 2016</ref>), but other explanations exist as well <ref type="bibr">(Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2013</ref>). We note that for a Saturnian-mass planet, the demixing sets in at an age of 1-2 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr">Püstow et al. 2016</ref>), so for objects younger than that it should not pose a big problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">GJ 436 b: comparison with Baraffe et al.

The age of the system is unconstrained by observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> assume a system age of 1-5 Gyr and do not take irradiation on the planet into account because of the low luminosity of the parent star. They find a good match with the observed radius within the uncertainty of the age of the system for a 22.6 M ⊕ planet with a 21 M ⊕ water core surrounded by a 1.6 M ⊕ H/He envelope. We want to test whether we can match the observations of this planet with the same composition which is what we find.</p><p>Due to its core-dominated nature, GJ 436 b is a good example to study the contributions of the core and envelope to the planet's temporal evolution. The contributions to the gravothermal energy release for the water core look qualitatively similar if the structure of the planet is calculated with the EoS SESAME or ANEOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baraffe et al. (2005)</ref>, Baraffe 2015 personal communication). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows the luminosity from the core cooling and contraction as a sum and separate relative to the total luminosity L over time, as well as the contribution from the envelope relative to the total L. Shown are the luminosities predicted by our model assuming a water core together with the results from Baraffe <ref type="bibr">(2015, personal communication)</ref>.</p><p>In constrast to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 10</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al.

Looking in more detail at the calculation employing ANEOS, which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref> (blue and black lines), the biggest contribution to the gravothermal energy release comes from the core with a fraction of ∼ 0.85 from the total luminosity averaged over time. The total contribution from the core is split into a bigger part coming from the thermal cooling of the core with a fraction of ∼ 0.55 between 10 to 100 Myr and then rising to reach ∼ 0.8 around 1 Gyr. The smaller part of the total core contribution comes from the contraction of the core with a fraction of ∼ 0.3 from 10 to 100 Myr and then sinking to ∼ 0.1 at 1 Gyr. The envelope contribution to the total luminosity of the planet is the smallest with a fraction of ∼ 0.15.</p><p>Note that the relative contributions do not strictly sum up to 1, as it is expected. This is due to the fact that the total luminosity is calculated using the entropy that is given by the EoS, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L tot = − T (dS /dt) dm.</formula><p>If the applied EOS would be thermodynamically coherent, one would have −T dS /dt = −PdV/dt − dU/dt. However, this is not exactly the case with ANEOS (from Baraffe 2015, personal communication). Therefore, the sum of the volume work and the internal energy terms, that are shown separately in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref>, do not sum up to the total luminosity obtained from the entropy change.</p><p>The gravothermal energy contributions from this work are similar (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref> as well, olive and orange lines), namely a fraction of ∼ 0.9 for the biggest contribution to the total energy from the core which is split in a contribution of ∼ 0.73 from the cooling of the core and ∼ 0.17 from the contraction of the core.The smallest contribution to the total luminosity originates again from the envelope (fraction of ∼ 0.1). Different to the calculation by Baraffe 2015, the energy contributions sum up to 1.</p><p>In this calculation, we aim to reproduce the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> and use the same model parameters. Accordingly, the core is composed of pure water and thus there is no radiogenic contribution to the luminosity, as the radioactive material content of the planet is assumed to be proportional to the rock mass fraction of the planet. Simulating a planet with the same core and envelope mass fraction as above, but containing 0.8 M ⊕ of iron and rock in the core (corresponding to an ice mass fraction in the core of 50%), so containing 0.53 M ⊕ rock, the radiogenic luminosity contributions can be estimated. For example, it accounts for 0.01% (0.5%) at 1 (100) Myr of the total luminosity.</p><p>As we discussed above, the overall agreement between the two simulations regarding the luminosity contributions in the planet is good, as expected, especially regarding the fact that the core gives the dominant energy contribution to the total luminosity budget of the planet, and therefore neglecting the core's contribution in the evolution calculation of such a planet has a significant impact.</p></div>

All these three settings mimic the ones made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref>. The adiabatic model for the core (Eq. 10) leads in this case to total luminosities that are about 66% higher compared to the isothermal core. This comes from the fact that the thermal energy of the core is more than twice higher for the adiabatic core model than for the isothermal core model. For planets with a less extreme core-envelope mass ratio, the impact is correspondingly smaller, as discussed in Sect. 2.1. For giant planets, the difference is completely negligible.</p><p>A comparison of the two simulations in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows that the overall agreement is very good, with a tendency of our model to predict a somewhat dimmer planet at earlier times ( ≤100 Myr). After 300 Myr, the luminosity found in our model is slightly higher than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref>, with a difference of about 9% at 10 Gyr. A feature that is shared in both models is the dominance of the radiogenic heating mainly caused by 40 K decay ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>) over the cooling of the core at intermediately late times (0.7-5 Gyr). Further comparison shows that our model predicts a somewhat higher contribution of the core at later times, whereas it is the opposite at earlier times. The radiogenic luminosity is virtually identical in the two models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Initial conditions</head><p>For the simulation of the thermodynamic evolution of the planets and the calculation of their magnitudes we need to specify the post formation properties of these planets. As exemplified by the large impact of cold vs. hot starts for giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2017</ref>) the post formation properties can have a very strong influence on the predicted detectability and observational characteristics. To find such initial conditions for the simulations the output of planetary population syntheses based on the core accretion paradigm (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2017</ref>) was studied. Population synthesis is the attempt to model planet formation globally. Therefore, a model containing many sub-models coming from specialized studies about one aspect of planet formation (for example gas and dust disk dynamics, type I &amp; II migration, ice-line behavior, planetary accretion) is constructed. By simplifying and putting these specialized models together, a global planet formation model can be built. The initial conditions, such as the total disk (gas) mass, the dust-to-gas-ratio, and the lifetime of the disk, are sampled in a Monte-Carlo way from probability distributions that are derived as closely as possible from observations. In the particular population synthesis used for this work, ten planetary embryo were inserted in a disk around a solar-like star. More model settings used in the population synthesis are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. (2012a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. (2017)</ref>. Formally, the synthesis was conducted under the assumption of cold gas accretion. However, for low-mass planets studied here, there is no hot vs. cold accretion difference in the same way as for giant planets. For giant planets, the dominant fraction of their mass is accreted after detachment from the protoplanetary nebula (at ∼ 100 M ⊕ ) through a potentially entropy reducing shock. Low-mass planets only detach from the nebula when the nebula itself has already almost completely dissipated. Because of this, only a very small amount of gas is accreted after detachment through a potentially entropy lowering shock. Different formation histories of the individual planets (e.g., moment when gas and solids are accreted, surrounding disk conditions, etc.) however still induce a diversity in post formation properties. Additional physical mechanisms such as solid accretion at late times, giant impacts, enriched envelope composition or semi-convection might change the outcome of our planet formation model, but are currently not considered.</p><p>From the planet population synthesis, the planets' core and H/He envelope mass fractions as well as the luminosity at the end of formation was estimated. The output from the population synthesis was studied at an age of 3 Myr, the typical life-time of the synthetic disks. We do not include planets which are still undergoing strong planetesimal accretion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results and Discussion</head><p>In this section, cooling curves resulting from our evolution code using the initial conditions given in Tab. 2 for different planetary atmosphere models and metallicites are shown. Following this, the impact of different post formation entropies on the planet's evolution is studied. Finally, magnitudes for various typical filters that can be found for instance in VLT/NACO, VISIR, SPHERE or on JWST are calculated and the influences on JWST magnitudes from different atmospheric models or post formation entropies are estimated. Also, a comparison with the JWST sensitivity limits for the simulated planets during their evolution is done. For all planets, the ice mass fraction in the core was set to 0.5 as direct imaging is sensitive to planets at large orbital distances. Because of this, stellar irradiation was neglected.</p><p>It is important to note that in the simulations of this work time zero is when the gas disk disappears. The stellar age could thus be up to ∼ 10 Myr higher, depending on the specific disk lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Cloud-free solar metallicites models</head><p>At first, the evolution with cloud-free solar-metallicity model atmospheres was studied. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref> shows the evolution for 8 planetary masses from 5 M ⊕ to 636 M ⊕ (2 M ) and 4 different atmosphere types, from 0.1 Myr to 10 Gyr for the heavier planets. The dotted line corresponds to a grey (Eddington) atmospheric boundary condition, the solid to a cloud-free atmosphere with solar-metallicity from the petitCODE grid, the dash-dotted to a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere from the HELIOS grid and the dashed line finally shows the evolution with the pioneering AMES-Cond atmosphere. The luminosity of Jupiter and Saturn is given for reference as squares in the color corresponding (roughly, for Saturn) to their masses. Planets with M tot &lt;20M ⊕ are not plotted with an AMES-Cond atmosphere, as these masses evolve outside of the atmospheric grid (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). For the AMES-Cond, petitCODE and HELIOS atmospheres, the tracks are shown as long as the planet is evolving on the atmospheric grid. The dots represent the luminosities , temperatures, and radii from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>.</p><p>The differences between <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> and our cooling curves at early times in the luminosity and temperature panel simply reflect the choice of different initial luminosities, and at later times, the two different cooling calculations agree well. For example, at 50 Myr the difference for the 636 M ⊕ planet between the luminosity curve with an AMES-Cond atmosphere vs. a HELIOS (petitCODE) atmosphere is 14% (29%). The mean difference is around 25%. The mean was obtained by averaging over the maximal procentual differences in bolometric luminosity for the different atmospheric models at 1, 10, and 100 Myr for the four heaviest planets. These differences are smaller than the    <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>. Solid lines show the evolution with a cloud-free atmosphere with solar-metallicity from the petitCODE grid, dashed lines show it with an AMES-Cond atmosphere, dash-dotted lines show it with a solar-metallicity cloud-free atmosphere from the HELIOS grid and dotted lines finally show the evolution calculated with a grey atmosphere. Since the three smallest masses are evolving outside of the AMES-Cond grid (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>), these masses are not plotted for an AMES-Cond atmosphere. For the AMES-Cond, petitCODE and HELIOS atmospheres, the tracks are shown as long as the planet is evolving on the atmospheric grid. For better visibility, three /two evolution curves (159, 50 , and 318 M ⊕ ) are not shown in the entropy /radius plot. The horizontal lines at 100 and 150 K in the T eff plot show the lower limit of the HELIOS and petitCODE grid, respectively. errror bars today for measured luminosities (e.g. 48% for Eri b in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Macintosh et al. 2015</ref>). With future more precise measurements, it could be possible to distinguish between different atmospheric models. We conclude that the choice of the atmosphere has most of the time only a limited impact on the evolution of the bolometric luminosity, as also found in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burrows &amp; Liebert 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burrows et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saumon &amp; Marley 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dupuy et al. 2015</ref>. A posteriori, it is therefore justified to use a grey atmosphere for the comparison calculations in Sect. 4.</p><p>In the limit of core-dominated planets with very low M enve , where the luminosity is dominated by the core cooling, and in the approximation of a constant radius, the analytical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ginzburg et al. (2016)</ref> predicts L ∝ t −4/3 for a constant mass. However, the M enve even of the 5 M ⊕ planet in this work is sufficiently massive so that the radius change can not be neglected, and numerically, a decrease rather like t −1 is found for a fixed mass, even for the low-mass planets. This is similar to what was found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burrows &amp; Liebert (1993)</ref>, and is valid for grey and non-grey atmospheres. It can be understood from the fact that at the radiative-convective boundary (RCB), the bottleneck for the transport of the luminosity occurs, independent of the atmospheric model, at the high optical depth of the RCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lee et al. 2018</ref>). Radiative transport occurs there by diffusion, meaning that only the Rosseland mean opacity matters, and not the specific wavelength-dependent opacity of the different atmospheric models.</p><p>In the top right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref>, the decline of the specific entropy in the inner convective zone with time is shown. The entropy is a good measure of the total gravothermal energy of a planet because it contains both the inner energy content and the gravitational energy (volume work). The entropy contained in our simulated planets ranges from 7.6 to 9.5 k B baryon −1 at young ages and from 7.0 to 8.7 k B baryon −1 at 10 Myr. Note that   <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Evolution of the planets in the log g-T eff space, together with the coverage by the atmosphere grids given as rectangles. The color-code for the masses is given in the top right panel. Thick lines indicate cooling curves that are in the atmosphere grid and thin lines that it is outside of the grid. The top left panel shows the evolution in the AMES-Cond grid. In the top right panel the evolution in the petitCODE grid for the cloudy ( f sed =0.5) and solar-metallicity atmosphere is shown. This is representative also for other types of petitCODE atmospheres. The bottom panel finally shows the evolution in the HELIOS grid for a cloud-free atmosphere with a [M/H]=0.6 and is representative also for the solar metallicity evolution paths.</p><p>we have fixed the post formation luminosity. This means that the post formation entropy varies for a given mass depending on the atmospheric model <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Marleau &amp; Cumming 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We also studied the effective temperature. The effective temperature varies slowly until about one Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale (τ KH ) has passed. The initial τ KH = E/L ranges from 8.96 Myr to 9.62 Myr for the 318 M ⊕ to 13.50 Myr to 14.52 Myr for the 5 M ⊕ planet, depending on the atmosphere model. For example, the effective temperature of the 100 M ⊕ planet decreases from 565 to 603 K at 0.11 Myr to 107 to 116 K at 1 Gyr depending on the atmospheric model. The difference between the temperatures from this work and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> correspond to the differences in luminosity which were discussed before.</p><p>The bottom right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref> shows the temporal change of the radius. It corresponds to τ = 2/3 for the Eddington grey atmosphere and to the coupling pressure (50 bar) for the other atmosphere grids. The radii from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> are constantly bigger than the radii from our simulation of the planets with an AMES-Cond atmospheric grid. When simulating the planets with a luminosity as was chosen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>, and assuming a core mass of 0.5 M ⊕ to mimic the settings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> we find a much better agreement in the radii. For example, at 1 Myr the radius from this work would then be 0.4% bigger (1.9% smaller) than the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> radius for the 1 (2) M planet. We see that initially there is a non-monotonic relationship between mass and radius, with the biggest radius occurring for the 20 M ⊕ planet with the AMES-Cond atmosphere. This is a consequence of the initial conditions (L pf and M enve vs. M core ), which predicts for the 20 M ⊕ planet a rather high envelope mass fraction relative to the total mass of the planet. At later times, the radii computed with different atmosphere models converge, the radius also becomes monotonically increasing with mass, even though there is a spread of up to 0.9 R (for the 20 M ⊕ ) at early times.</p><p>It is important to note here that the AMES-Cond grid was not designed for such low-mass planets. To give an overview, <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> illustrates the cooling of the planets in the log g-T eff plane. The top left panel shows the cooling in the AMES-Cond grid. Thick lines indicate that the evolution path is inside the AMES-Cond grid, which starts at logg = 2.5 and an effective temperature of 100 K. As it can be seen, the 636 M ⊕ planet is evolving on the  AMES-Cond grid, whereas all the others fall partially off the grid due to either too small surface gravities at early times or too low temperatures at later times. This means that all AMES-Cond results for planets below 50 M ⊕ must be taken with caution.</p><p>For the petitCODE and the HELIOS grid, the coverage in log g-T eff is in contrast good, initially, when T eff is larger than 150 K (petitCODE) or 100 K (HELIOS). These limits are shown in the T eff panel. Again, once the planets are below these temperatures, caution must be used when employing the cooling tracks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Non solar or cloudy atmospheric models</head><p>In contrast with the former section we now study the influence of non-solar metallicities and clouds on the evolution of the planets.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref> in the top left panel, the evolution of the intrinsic luminosity from 0.1 Myr to 10 Gyr for planets from 636 M ⊕ (2 M ) down to 5 M ⊕ is shown; again the lower-mass planets are only shown as long as they are evolving not too far from the boundary of the atmospheric grid. The color code is given in the top left panel. These evolution calculations were done with the petitCODE and HELIOS grids described in Sect. 3. As a baseline model the evolution of the planets with a cloud-free solarmetallicity atmosphere in the petitCODE grid is shown with a solid line, these are the same lines as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref>. The evolution with a cloud-free atmosphere and a metallicity of [M/H]=0.6 is shown as a dotted line, the evolution with a solar-metallicity but cloudy atmosphere (settling parameter f sed =0.5) is given as a dashed line, both using the petitCODE grid. We note that a f sed =0.5 is probably not realistic for the coldest planets studied here (T int 300 − 400 K), because the cloud species implemented in our simulations (Na 2 S and KCl) form deep in the atmosphere in these cases. A low f sed potentially mixes the clouds to locations too high up in the atmosphere. However, the evolution with a f sed =3.0 was also calculated in the petitCODE grid. Since the difference to the cloud-free evolution is not visible on the scale chosen here (the cloud-free luminosity is less than 1% fainter at 5 Myr than the luminosity calculated with an atmosphere with f sed =3.0), it is not shown. This is not surprising, as the high f sed corresponds to a strong cloud settling or weak cloudiness. As mentioned before, at such low temperatures a  more realistic choice for the cloud description would have been to also include the effect of water clouds. Finally, the evolution in the cloud-free atmosphere with a metallicity of [M/H]=0.6 in the HELIOS grid is given as a dash-dotted line.</p><p>In the top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref>, the change of the bolometric luminosity over time is shown. For example, at 16 Myr the cloudfree HELIOS atmosphere with [M/H]=0.6 predicts a 1.11 times brighter luminosity than the clear solar metallicity petitCODE atmosphere, whereas the cloudy petitCODE atmosphere predicts a 0.15 times fainter luminosity. Analyzing the figure in more detail, the evolution of the bolometric luminosity of the planets shows average deviations (calculated as explained in Sect. 6.1) of about 6% for metallicities of 0.6 instead of 0.0. This is smaller than the deviations seen in Sect. 6.2 where we compared different clear atmospheric models with solar composition, and thus smaller than the error bars in current luminosity measurements. We thus see a non-negligible, but also not very large effect of the atmospheric model on the bolometric luminosity of the planet. We however remind that <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref>  We caution that we have not investigated systematically the consequences of all cloud parameters for the bolometric luminosity.</p><p>Again the result from the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burrows &amp; Liebert 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burrows et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saumon &amp; Marley 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dupuy et al. 2015</ref>) is reproduced, as in the former section, that the choice of the atmospheric model has only a limited impact on the evolution of the bolometric luminosity, at least within the models studied here.</p><p>The change of the entropy over time is given in the top right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref>. For clarity the evolution of the 318, 159, and 50 M ⊕ mass planet is not shown. It is again important to keep in mind that the simulations start always with the same luminosity, which corresponds to a different entropy at the beginning depending on the atmospheric model. The biggest post formation entropy spread occurs for the three lightest planets with a difference of up to 0.4 k B baryon −1 . The discrepancy between the atmospheric models can be attributed to a large extent to differences in the employed opacity sources. Since petitCODE and HELIOS use different line lists for some of the absorbing species, like e.g. H 2 O, NH 3 , H 2 S and the alkali metals, and use different scatterers, their calculations may result in somewhat deviating atmospheric temperature profiles. This directly impacts the coupling to the deep convective adiabat and the corresponding entropy value. With increasing metallicity this discrepancy is exacerbated as the relative amount of absorbing gases increases.</p><p>The bottom left panel shows the evolution of the temperature of the planets and mirrors the luminosity evolution in the top left panel. As an example, the 100 M ⊕ planet has a temperature of 585 to 605 K depending on the atmosphere model at 0.1 Myr and cools down to 107 to 125 K at 1 Gyr, respectively.</p><p>Finally, the change of the radius over time can be seen in the bottom right panel. The spread in radius at early times can be up to 0.2 R for the 10 M ⊕ mass planet, up to 0.3 R for the 20 M ⊕ mass planet, and up to 0.1 R for the 100 M ⊕ planet. However, they all approximately converge at later times, qualitatively similar as for cloud-free, solar-metallicity atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Varying the post formation luminosity</head><p>Different post formation luminosity or entropy (S pf or L pf ) can be used to represent different planet formation scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2017</ref>).

At late times, much longer than τ KH,pf , the influence of the initial condition has disappeared, therefore, the choice of the post formation entropy (S pf ) is considered to have only a minor influence on the late planetary evolution. However, since τ KH,pf ∝ 1/L pf , a low post formation luminosity (a very cold start) can influence the L(t) over extended and observationally relevant times of up to ∼ 1 Gyr for giant planets (Marley . In contrast, a planet with a "hotter start" will converge on the same evolutionary track as a "hot start", again because of τ KH,pf ∝ 1/L pf . Not surprisingly, very low S pf (implying low L pf ) can have a strong impact on the predicted magnitudes of giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>, with magnitudes that are 1-6 mag fainter than standard hot start models. The very low post formation luminosities found in the original core accretion model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> were originally thought to be a diagnostic distinguishing core accretion from other formation pathways (disk instability, turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds). However, later core accretion models showed that core accretion can also lead to warm and even hot starts depending on the mass of the planets' core <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Mordasini 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Marleau et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Berardo et al. 2017</ref>). This means that the brightness is likely not a property distinguishing strictly the formation modes, and recent population syntheses based on the core accretion paradigm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. 2017</ref>) rather find warm starts. Hence, because we want to make predictions about detectability of young planets, it is important to quantify the impact of the S pf and also to consider how long the impact on the evolution of the planets remains. To study the impact of different S pf , the cooling of planets with a L pf 10 times brighter (hot scenario) or fainter (cold scenario) relative to what is noted in Tab. 2 (nominal) was simulated. Such a spread in luminosity is suggested by population synthesis calculation of planet formation and can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref>. The resulting spread in S pf reaches from 8.4 to 10.5 k B baryon −1 (difference of 2.1 k B baryon −1 ) for the 318 M ⊕ planet, and from 6.9 to 8.5 k B baryon −1 for the 5 M ⊕ planet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref> shows the cooling curves for four different planetary masses <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">100</ref>, and 318 M ⊕ ) and various L pf . The evolution is calculated with a cloud-free atmosphere with solar-metallicity in the petitCODE grid. The solid lines represent the nominal scenario and are therefore the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 8 and Fig. 6</ref>. The cooling curves with a 10 times higher L pf are shown as dashed lines, those with a 10 times lower L pf are given as dash-dotted lines.</p><p>The left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> shows the evolution of the intrinsic luminosity. It can be seen that the cooling curves for different L pf converge as expected (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Marleau &amp; Cumming 2014</ref>). The planets of the hot scenario have a KelvinHelmholtz-time (τ KH,pf ) of ∼1 Myr, the ones with nominal L pf as shown in Tab. 2 have a τ KH,pf of ∼10 Myr and finally, the planets in the cold scenario have a τ KH,pf of ∼100 Myr. This means that the post formation state (e.g. the initial condition) influences the planets' properties during about τ KH,pf ∼1,10, and 100 Myr after formation for cold, nominal, and hot scenario. These phases can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> as these parts of the lines which do not yet follow a L ∝ t −1 behavior, but that are more horizontal. As an example, at 1 Myr, the hot scenario model for the 100 M ⊕ planet is 1.6 times brighter than the nominal evolution, and the cold scenario model is 5 times fainter than the nominal model.

(2007)</ref>, L pf is independent of the planetary mass because a larger mass fraction for the more massive planets went through an entropy reducing shock, and therefore τ KH,pf ∝ M 2 tot . Here we find that τ KH,pf is approximately independent of M tot (at least for M tot &lt; 100 M ⊕ ), as circa L pf ∝ M 2 tot , and the planetary radius , which enters linearly into τ KH,pf , only changes by factors of 2-3 between hot and cold scenarios.</p><p>Note that because of the non-uniqueness of the M − L pf relation, there is a mass-luminosity dependency during ∼ τ KH,pf , as already widely discussed in the literature in the context of giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mordasini (2013)</ref>). For example, if the age of a planet could be estimated to be 1 Myr and the planet has a brightness of 2 × 10 −7 L , then this could correspond to either a 20 M ⊕ mass planet with a high post formation luminosity, or to a 100 M ⊕ mass planet with a low post formation luminosity. With a further mass measurement through for example the astrometric or radial-velocity method, it is possible to disentangle this mass-luminosity ambiguity. In principle, if the planetary temperatures can be measured precisely enough, it would also be possible to reduce the degeneracy. This should be possible for differentiating between the hot and cold scenario for planets that are heavier than 2 M ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Samland et al. 2017)</ref>. Fortunately, at 10 Myr (a more likely observable age), none of the hot vs. cold scenario lines representing 5, 20, 100, and 318 M ⊕ from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> overlap any more, so that at least a very rough mass estimate should be possible.</p><p>The right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> shows the evolution of the temperature over time. At 1 Myr the temperature for the 318 M ⊕ planet in the hot, nominal and cold scenario is 1014 K, 781 K, and 536 K respectively. For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> have at 1 Myr a T eff of ∼850 and ∼550 K for their hot and cold case for a 318 M ⊕ planet, which is similar to our result.</p><p>If planet masses and luminosities could be determined observationally at early times (&lt; τ KH,pf ), important constraints about hot vs. cold scenarios could be made for planet formation theory, regarding for example the heating by giant impacts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anic et al. (2007)</ref>), the efficiency of heat transport in the interior ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013</ref>) or the magnitude and timing of heating by planetesimal accretion Mordasini (2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">JWST magnitudes and fluxes</head><p>Magnitudes for the most relevant JWST filters for exoplanet imaging, namely, JWST/MIRI <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(F560W, F770W,  F1000W, F1280W, F1500W, F1800W, F2100W, F2550W</ref>), JWST/NIRCam <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W</ref>, F356W, F444W) were calculated. The wide (W) filters were chosen as they are considered the standard imaging filters and also because Fig. 12. Spectra for cloud-free solar-metallicity atmospheres from the petitCODE grid together with the theoretical blackbody for four planetary masses. The age is given in color, the x-and y-axis are the same for all the figures. The temperature of the blackbodies corresponds to the temperature of the planet at the age given in color. The grey dots show the background sensitivity limits for the JWST/NIRCam filters included in this work, the black dots those for JWST/MIRI. There are 2, 3, 5, and 7 spectra shown for the 5, 20, 100, and 318 M ⊕ planet.</p><p>we quantify the detection of planets in the background limited regime and not necessarily in the contrast limit, where certain coronagraph-filter combinations may be the preferred choice. The zero points of the magnitudes were obtained with a Vega spectrum 2 . To check our magnitude calculation, the spectra from F. Allard's website 3 were downloaded, convolved with the filter profiles and the resulting magnitudes were compared with the magnitudes given on F. Allards website 4 as well. It was found that the magnitudes are the same. The magnitudes of the modeled planets were obtained by convolving their spectra with the filter transmission profiles. For this we interpolated their spectra to the desired log g-T eff combination given the grid of atmospheres. As an illustration, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 11</ref>, the absolute magnitudes in the F356W filter (centered at 3.45 µm) and the F444W filter (centered at 4.44 µm) are shown for the 5, 20, 100 and 318 M ⊕ mass planets and for different atmosphere grids with different parameters, such as metallicity and f sed , as well as for the variation in post formation luminosity (L pf ) introduced in Sect. 6.2. These two filters were chosen for reasons discussed below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 13</ref>. Overview of all evolutionary models that were calculated for this work. As an example, the SPHERE/IRDIS H band magnitude is shown. Note that some of the lower mass planets might not be visible on the axis range chosen here. The petitCODE grid clear magnitudes for the nominal post formation luminosity which are shown as thick solid lines in the first column are repeated in the other panels as thin lines for comparison between clear vs. cloudy cases. In the clear solar metallicity panel ( first panel, second row), we also show the magnitudes corresponding to an evolution with a ten times higher post formation luminosity (brighter, dotted) and with a ten times lower post formation luminosity (fainter, dashed) than the nominal case. This simulations were introduced in Sect. 6.3. The magnitudes are only shown as long as the planets evolve in the atmospherig grid, and for the cloudy models, as long as they are above 200 K.</p><p>Note that the clear solar-metallicity line in the petitCODE grid is sometimes hard to see due to the other lines. For the case of a 10 times lower L pf , the 5 M ⊕ mass planet is too cool to still be on the atmosphere grid and hence these magnitudes were not calculated. Since the 5 and 20 M ⊕ planet are evolving outside of the AMES-Cond grid, the magnitudes corresponding to this atmosphere are not shown for these two low-mass planets.</p><p>In principle, the AMES-Cond, the HELIOS, and the petitCODE magnitudes for a clear and solar-metallicity atmosphere should be the same. However, because of different input line lists, this is not the case. We quantified this for the 159 M ⊕ planet. In all the JWST/MIRI filters we calculated, the magnitudes calculated with these atmospheres for the evolution of the 159 M ⊕ planet differs at most by 0.5 to 2 magnitudes. In the JWST/NIRCam filters we considered, the maximum difference ranges from 0.3 magnitudes up to 6 magnitudes in the F227W and F115W filter at a few 100 Myr. In the F356W filter, which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 10</ref>, and chosen because the impact of the line lists is very strong, the heavier planets are brightest when calculated with an AMES-Cond atmosphere. For example, the 100 M ⊕ planet is 2.9 mag brigher at 100 Myr with an AMES-Cond atmosphere than with a clear solar petitCODE atmosphere. A strong methane absorption feature is located at this wavelength, which makes the corresponding flux emission very sensitive to the employed methane line list. The petitCODE and HELIOS models use the recent EXOMOL line list for CH 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Yurchenko &amp; Tennyson 2014</ref>) turning the atmosphere more opaque than assumed in the older AMES-Cond models before. Hence there is more flux passing through in the AMES-Cond spectra, which leads to a much brighter planet at shorter wavelengths and is most prominent in some filters at shorter wavelengths. Note that for example in the F356W filter the different methane line lists can have a higher impact than a higher post formation luminosity. A higher L pf influences the magnitudes only early on, by about 1 mag for the 20 M ⊕ for example. In contrast, the same planet with a lower L pf is up to 3.2 magnitudes fainter in the F356W band early on. For higher planetary masses, when the atmosphere becomes warmer, the effect of the methane becomes smaller as the relative abundance of methane decreases and hence its spectral effect compared to water diminishes, even in the methane bands. The F444W <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 11)</ref> filter is in contrast to the F345W not sensitive to the methane abundance. Hence, all atmospheres lead to similar magnitudes. The largest impact is now due to different L pf . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 12</ref> shows the temporal evolution of the blackbody and non-grey spectrum for four planetary masses. The color code gives the objects' age. The spectra are calculated for a cloudfree solar-metallicity petitCODE atmosphere by interpolating to the required temperature and surface gravity and are thus given as long as the planet is evolving on the atmospheric grid. We over-plot the sensitivity limits for the JWST/NIRCam instrument (grey dots) and for the JWST/MIRI instrument (black dots) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . These are background limits and do not take the final contrast performance of the instruments into account, which will only be known after commissioning of the high-contrast imaging modes and which will also depend on the selected targets and observing strategy. The prominent features that can be seen, for example, at 1-2 µm and the peak at 4.7 µm originate from the water and methane opacities. Especially the cut-off at 1.6 µm is typical for methane. At longer wavelengths, the calculated spectral emission resembles more closely the theoretical blackbody emission. However, for certain temperatures and surface gravities, the spectral flux at shorter wavelengths of 1-2 µm can be up to orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical blackbody flux. As an example, the 5 M ⊕ object shows a blackbody flux at 1 Myr and at 1.6 µm that is 13 orders of magnitudes lower than the one from the calculated spectrum. This can be understood because at the corresponding low temperature of 182 K there are very few absorber in the atmosphere; water is condensed to quite high pressures in the atmosphere (0.5 bar), and we do not model water clouds here. Therefore, the depth that is probed in the atmosphere is strongly influenced by collision induced absorption (CIA) in addition to the water and methane opacities. As it can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12</ref>, when the atmosphere of the planet becomes warmer or the planet is more massive, this mechanism is diminished. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12</ref> also shows the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST at thermal infrared wavelengths. For young nearby stars, such as, for instance, members of the β Pictoris moving group with an estimated average age and distance of 23 Myr and 15 pc, respectively (Mamajek 2016), planets with masses below that of Neptune seem to be within reach at separations from the star where background limited performance is achieved. This is truly uncharted territory in comparison to what has been achievable up to now with exoplanet imaging in terms of mass limits (see, e.g., Bowler 2016, for a recent review).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Predictions for space and ground-based observations</head><p>While JWST will remain unchallenged in terms of sensitivity in the thermal infrared for many years to come, the currently operational extreme-AO, high-contrast imaging NIR instruments, such as VLT/SPHERE or Gemini/GPI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Beuzit et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>), achieve better detection limits at small separations close to the diffraction limit, i.e., in the contrast limited regime. To put our models in context with the exoplanet imaging surveys presently conducted, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.   5</ref> The sensitivity limits are taken from https://jwst-docs. stsci.edu/display/JTI/NIRCam+Sensitivity, <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table  1  and</ref> https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JTI/MIRI+ Sensitivity, <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 1</ref>, respectively, and they correspond to a signalto-noise of 10 for an integration time of 10 4 s (page accessed 24 May 2018). 13 our model predictions for the SPHERE/IRDIS H filter. The magnitude was calculated as described in Sect. 6.4</p><p>For the solar-metallicity and clear atmosphere, simulations with a ten times higher /lower post formation relative to the nominal scenario were calculated, as introduced in Sect. 6.3. This was done for 4 planetary masses, namely for the 5, 20, 100, 318 M ⊕ mass planets. Since the 5 M ⊕ is too cool to still be on the atmosphere grid, "fainter" magnitudes are not calculated for this mass. The range in post formation luminosity can lead up to a magnitude difference in the SPHERE/IRDIS H band of about 10, 5, and 4 mag for the 20, 100, and 318 M ⊕ (1 M ) mass planet at 1 Myr. At 30 Myr, the different cooling paths for the 100 and 318 M ⊕ are not distinguishable any more, which is in agreement with what was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> for masses of 1-2 M .</p><p>Also note the mass-magnitude degeneracy in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 13</ref>, similar to the mass-luminosity degeneracy already noted in Sect. 6.3 and in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>. For example, at 3 Myr a 20 mag object could correspond to a 159 M ⊕ planet with nominal post formation luminosity or to a 318 M ⊕ planet with a cold scenario post formation luminosity. From 10 Myr on however the lines representing the different masses and post formation luminosities do not overlap any more, so that a rough mass estimate should be possible at this more likely observable age.</p><p>For comparison, the thin lines in the background show the evolution in a clear petitCODE atmosphere (the same lines as in the first column). It is interesting to note that, depending on the metallicity, the clouds seem to have a dimming (for high metallicities) or brightening (for low metallicites) effect.</p><p>For further reference, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 14</ref>, isochrones for the VISIR SiC magnitude are shown for a solar metallicity HELIOS (solid lines) and petitCODE (dashed lines) grid atmosphere for times starting at 1 Myr. Magnitudes are calculated as long as the planet is evolving within the atmospheric grid. For the HELIOS grid, all the masses considered here evolve on the atmospheric grid from 1 to 100 Myr. On the other hand for the petitCODE grid, all the masses evolve on the grid from 3 to 10 Myr. This difference comes from the different temperature coverage of the grids: the petitCODE grid goes from 150 K to 1000 K, whereas the HELIOS grid goes from 100 K up to 1200 K (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). At 1 Gyr, masses from 50 M ⊕ on are still in the HELIOS grid.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Summary and conclusion</head><p>In this study, we first presented (Sect. 2) the extensions made to our evolution model that was originally designed for gas giants but now we applied it to core-dominated low-mass planets. In Sect. 4 the updated model was then validated against the solar system gas and ice giants. The results we find are in agreement with the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nettelmann et al. 2013</ref>). Comparing our simulations with two independent cooling calculations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. 2008 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014</ref>), we find a satisfactory agreement as well. We then turned to the main subject of the paper, which is the extension of classical cooling models like <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref> to lower mass planets. For this, we computed initial conditions from formation models (Sect. 5.) and applied three different sets of atmosphere models (Sect. 3).</p><p>The models used in this work include simple Eddington grey atmospheres, the AMES-Cond atmosphere, and recent petitCODE Mollì ere et al. 2017) and HELIOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Malik et al. 2017)</ref> atmospheres. Th e clouds in the petitCODE models are Na 2 S and KCl. Cloud species that are important at lower temperature such as water are not (yet) included in the cloudy atmospheric models. The surface boundary conditions and therefore the predicted magnitudes has the potential to be significantly affected by water clouds which could form at low temperatures. When comparing the condensation curves of water with the atmospheric p-T structures one finds that planets with masses below 20 M ⊕ could have water clouds from the start of the evolution in the outer atmosphere. For the more massive planets, water clouds could appear at about 30 (100) Myr for a 50 (100) M ⊕ planet.</p><p>In this first publication we have not considered different C/O ratio in the atmosphere. The C/O ratio gives constraints on a planets formation path (e.g., ¨</p><p>Oberg  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref>), and to study the impact of a varied C/O on magnitudes will be an important next step.</p><p>The petitCODE , HELIOS and the AMES-Cond grid s assume chemical equilibrium. Although we expect disequilibrium processes like turbulent mixing and photo-chemistry to have a nonnegligible influence on the atmospheric composition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Moses et al. 2016)</ref>, we focus in this study on the treatment of clouds. We postpone the consideration of disequilibrium chemistry to future work.</p><p>The initial conditions together with the atmospheric grids and p-T structures were then used to calculate the evolution of a set of 8 planetary masses (Sect. 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3). These are ranging from 5 M ⊕ to 2 M . The atmospheric models as well as the post formation luminosities were varied. Following this, magnitudes for 35 filters were calculated for clear and cloudy atmospheres for various metallicities (Sect. 6.4 and Sect. 6.5). The magnitudes were calculated as described in Sect. 6.4. The calculated magnitudes together with the applied filter profiles are available online on: http: //www.space.unibe.ch/research/research_groups/ planets_in_time/numerical_data/index_eng.html. We summarize the main findings in the following.</p><p>-When simulating hot and cold formation scenarios (Sect.</p><p>6.3), it is found that the spread in the initial (i.e. post formation) luminosity as suggested by formation models, has a greater influence on a planets' bolometric luminosity than atmospheric model, as already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref>. -In the SPHERE/IRDIS H filter for example, the difference between hot. vs. cold start can be up to 10 mag for the 20 M ⊕ planet (Sect. 6.5). Also note that there is a mass-magnitude indeterminacy with initial conditions in certain filter bands at young ages, similar to what was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref>. But after 10 Myr a rough mass estimate should be possible <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 13)</ref>. -The atmospheres have a large impact on magnitudes in specific filter bands. In, e.g., JWST/NIRCam F356W the magnitude calculated with an AMES-Cond atmosphere is up to 2.9 mag brighter at 100 Myr for the 100 M ⊕ planet than with a clear solar petitCODE atmosphere (Sect. 6.4). This can be explained by the differences in methane line lists. We assume that the newer line list ExoMol yields more accurate results because it should be much more complete, especially at higher temperatures. -Comparing the sensitivity limits of JWST with the emergent flux from the planet, we find that a 20, 100, and 318 M ⊕ (1 M ) mass planet should be detectable with JWST/MIRI in the background-limited regime until 10, 100, and 1000 Myr after formation, respectively (see Sect. 6.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12)</ref>. -Filters at wavelengths around 4.7 µm seem to be favorable for exoplanet detection, as there is a prominent window in the water and methane opacities (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12</ref>) which enhances the emergent flux relative to a black body of the same temperature.</p><p>While it seems unlikely that (sub-)Jupiter mass planets are within reach of current instruments like SPHERE or GPI for a large sample of targets, there are a few special cases, where our models are applicable. A good example is the nearest premain sequence star AP Col ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Riedel et al. 2011</ref>), where groundbased high-contrast imaging can actually probe for young Jupiter analogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Quanz et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>More importantly, however, our models will be of relevance when planning future observations with JWST and/or the next generation of 30-40 m ground-based telescopes and their exoplanet imaging instruments. While JWST will provide unprecedented sensitivity at mid-infrared wavelength future ground-based facilities will remain unchallenged in terms of spatial resolution for many years to come and provide complementary discovery space in comparison to JWST. Most notably METIS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brandl et al. 2016</ref>) and PCS (formally called EPICS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kasper &amp; Beuzit 2010)</ref> for the ESO ELT will be equipped with highcontrast imaging cameras and search for exoplanets around the nearest and nearby young stars. This opens up the exciting perspective of detecting young and forming (e.g., van ) low-mass planets and old gas giants instead of young giant planets only (e.g., Bowler 2016) and will put important new constraints on theoretical models of planet formation and evolution. For these future observations, this paper provides a theoretical framework for interpretation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ρ = ρ 0 1 + α(T ceb − T ref ) (A.1)</formula><p>where ρ 0 is the mean density yielded by solving the structure equations with the EoS of <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>. It is a function of the core mass M core , the pressure P ceb exerted by the gaseous envelope at the core-envelope boundary, and the ice mass fraction f ice (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>). The iron-silicate ratio is fixed at 2:1 in mass , inspired by Earth's composition and condensation models of solarcomposition gas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Santos et al. 2015</ref>). The other quantities are the thermal expansion coefficient α, the reference temperature T ref which we set to 300 K, and the temperature at the core-envelope boundary T ceb .</p><p>The thermal expansion coefficient is found by using the ANEOS equation of state <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Thompson 1990</ref>) and the Maxwell relations as where the two derivatives are an output of the EoS. We consider the ANEOS data for water ice and dunite at higher pressures, and measured values at lower ones (Poirier 2000) for a set of pressure-temperature pairs representative for the Earth's mantle, the Earth's center, Jupiter's center, and the center of a 10 M super-Jupiter. <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>1 shows the α of these two materials, while the data is given in Tab. A.1. The plot shows that the measured (horizontal part) and ANEOS data can be approximated with a broken power law, so that we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">α = min        a × P ref P ceb b , α 0        . (A.3)</formula><p>The parameters are a = 4 × 10 −6 1/K, b = 0.45, and α 0 = 1 × 10 −4 1/K for ice, and a = 2 × 10 −6 1/K, b = 0.5, and α 0 = 1.5 × 10 −5 1/K for dunite. The latter value is chosen to be somewhat lower than the typically used value of 2.0 × 10 −5 1/K since we use it for the entire rocky core consisting of silicate and iron, which has a lower α (Poirier 2000). The reference pressure P ref is 10 13 dyn/cm 2 in both cases.</p><p>It is clear that our description represents only a simple approximation of the actual physical process, as it assumes for example a uniform expansion coefficient for the entire core. The comparisons with more complex models (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Thomas &amp; Madhusudhan 2016)</ref> and observational data presented below nevertheless indicate a relatively good match. A simple model as a first step also seems appropriate given our goal of studying the luminosities of young extrasolar planets, and not for example the detailed internal structure of solar system planets. In future work, we will still include the more accurate description of Alibert (2014).   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>esther.linder@space.unibe.ch lution history of the planets.

Temporal evolution of fundamental properties of the 8 simulated planets with initial conditions given in Tab. 2. The change in intrinsic luminosity, entropy, temperature, and radius is shown. The color code for the masses is given in the bottom left panel. Jupiter's and Saturn's luminosity are indicated as squares in the top left panel. The dots in the luminosity, effective temperature, and radius panel show the results from Baraffe et al. (2003). Solid lines show the evolution with a cloud-free atmosphere with solar-metallicity from the petitCODE grid, dashed lines show it with an AMES-Cond atmosphere, dash-dotted lines show it with a solar-metallicity cloud-free atmosphere from the HELIOS grid and dotted lines finally show the evolution calculated with a grey atmosphere. Since the three smallest masses are evolving outside of the AMES-Cond grid (see Fig. 7), these masses are not plotted for an AMES-Cond atmosphere. For the AMES-Cond, petitCODE and HELIOS atmospheres, the tracks are shown as long as the planet is evolving on the atmospheric grid. For better visibility, three /two evolution curves (159, 50 , and 318 M ⊕ ) are not shown in the entropy /radius plot. The horizontal lines at 100 and 150 K in the T eff plot show the lower limit of the HELIOS and petitCODE grid, respectively.</figDesc></figure>

As equation of state, the modified polytropic equation of state (EoS) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> is used. This simple equation of state yields the density as a function of pressure for a wide pressure range including the degenerate limit, but neglects the change of the density with temperature. At a given moment in time, this has only little effect on the resulting radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Valencia et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Grasset et al. 2009</ref>), especially for the more massive super-Earth/Neptunian and Saturnian planets considered here ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Seager et al. 2007</ref>), but for the long-term cooling we need to consider it by adding a first order temperature correction of the mean density. From the law of thermal expansion we estimate the variation of the mean core density ρ with temperature as</p></div>			</div>
