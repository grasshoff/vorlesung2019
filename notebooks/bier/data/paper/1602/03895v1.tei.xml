			<abstract>
				<p>HAT-P-13b is a Jupiter-mass transiting exoplanet that has settled onto a stable, short-period, and mildly eccentric orbit as a consequence of the action of tidal dissipation and perturbations from a second, highly eccentric, outer companion. Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the magnitude of HAT-P-13b&apos;s eccentricity (e b) is in part dictated by its Love number (k 2 b), which is in turn a proxy for the degree of central mass concentration in its interior. Thus, the measurement of e b constrains k 2 b and allows us to place otherwise elusive constraints on the mass of HAT-P-13b&apos;s core (M core,b). In this study we derive new constraints on the value of e b by observing two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We fit the measured secondary eclipse times simultaneously with radial velocity measurements and find that e b = 0.00700 ± 0.00100. We then use octupole-order secular perturbation theory to find the corresponding k 2 b = 0.31 +0.08 −0.05. Applying structural evolution models, we then find, with 68% confidence, that M core,b is less than 25 Earth masses (M ⊕). The most likely value of M core,b = 11M ⊕ , which is similar to the core mass theoretically required for runaway gas accretion. This is the tightest constraint to date on the core mass of a hot Jupiter. Additionally, we find that the measured secondary eclipse depths, which are in the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm bands, best match atmospheric model predictions with a dayside temperature inversion and relatively efficient day-night circulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The interiors of gas giant planets provide ground truth for planet formation theories and the properties of materials under high pressure and temperature.</p><p>Accordingly, many studies aimed at deriving the interior states of giant planets in our solar system have been undertaken in the past half century (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Safronov 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mizuno 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stevenson 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pollack et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ikoma et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubickyj et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rafikov 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nettelmann et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Helled &amp; Guillot 2013)</ref>. The study of giant planets in our solar system has been recently augmented by the growing body of mass and radius measurements for transiting extrasolar planets. These measurements have enabled the first studies of the heavy element components of gas giants orbiting other stars, as has been done for the super-Neptune HATS-7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2015</ref>) and the hot Saturn HD 149026b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sato et al. 2005</ref>), and in the statistical characterization of heavy-element enrichment in extrasolar gas giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller &amp; Fortney 2011</ref>). Nonetheless, characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets−in particular, determining the presence of a heavy element core−remains chal-lenging, since mass and radius measurements alone cannot in general uniquely constrain the interior density profile nor the chemical makeup of a planet. In particular, determining whether heavy elements are concentrated in the core or distributed uniformly within the envelope is especially difficult for Jupiter-sized planets since the large, predominantly light-element envelope masks the signal of the radial distribution of heavy elements.</p><p>However, the orbital configuration in a subset of multiplanet systems is such that the dynamical evolution of the system depends on the Love number (k 2 ) of its innermost planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. 2009</ref>). The Love number (k 2 ) quantifies the elastic deformation response of a planet to external forces and thus encodes information about its interior structure, including clues about its core mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Love 1909</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Love , 1911</ref>. Utilizing the secular theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mardling (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref> showed that, in a system of two planets orbiting a central body, k 2 of the inner planet can be determined if (i) the mass of the inner planet is much smaller than the mass of the central body, (ii) the semi-major axis of the inner planet is much less than the semi-major axis of the outer planet, (iii) the eccentricity of the inner planet is much less than the eccentricity of the outer planet, (iv) the planet is transiting, and (v) the planet is sufficiently close to its host star, such that the tidal precession is significant compared to the precession induced by relativistic effects. The HAT-P-13 system is the first and only currently known system to fulfill these criteria.</p><p>The HAT-P-13 system consists of three bodies in orbit around a central star with a mass of M A = 1.3 M ⊙ and radius R A = 1.8 R ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Southworth et al. 2012</ref>). HAT-P-13b is a low-eccentricity transiting planet with mass M b = 0.9 M J , radius R b = 1.5 R J , and an orbital period of 2.9 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Southworth et al. 2012</ref>). HAT-P-13c is a radial velocity companion with a minimum mass M c = 14.2 M J , an orbital period of 446 days, and an eccentricity of 0.66 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010</ref>). This system also exhibits a long-term radial velocity trend indicative of a third companion located between 12 − 37 AU with a minimum mass of 15 − 200 M J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Becker &amp; Batygin (2013)</ref> demonstrated that the existence of this third companion does not disrupt the secular dynamics that allows the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b (e b ) to be related to its Love number (k 2 b ).</p><p>Using existing constraints on the orbital eccentricity of HAT-P-13b from radial velocity measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref> were able to place an upper bound on the core mass (M core,b ) of 120 M ⊕ (41% M b ). In this study we present new observational measurements of secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b (i.e. when HAT-P-13b passes behind its host star) obtained using Spitzer Space Telescope, which we use to place stronger constraints on the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b. We combine these new secondary eclipse times with the most recent transit and radial velocity measurements of the system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Southworth et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>) in order to derive an improved constraint on k 2 b and M core,b .</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. First, we describe our data acquisition, post-processing, and analysis (Section 2). We then present the results of the secondary eclipse measurements and corresponding determination of the eccentricity, k 2 , core mass, and atmospheric properties of HAT-P-13b (Section 3). Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS 2.1. Observations and Photometric Time Series</head><p>Extraction Two observations of HAT-P-13 were taken using the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fazio et al. 2004</ref>), one using the 3.6 µm band on UT 2010 May 09 and the other using the 4.5 µm band on UT 2010 June 08, 11 orbits later (PI J. Harrington, Program ID 60003). Each dataset comprises 68,608 sub-array images taken with 0.4 s integration times over 8.7 hours of observation.</p><p>We extract the UTC-based Barycentric Julian Date (BJD UTC ), subtract the sky background, and remove transient hot pixels from each of the images as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kammer et al. (2015)</ref>. To calculate the flux from the HAT-P-13 system in each image, we first estimate the position of the star on the array using the flux-weighted centroid method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kammer et al. 2015</ref>) with radii ranging between 2.0-5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments. We then calculate the corresponding stellar flux using a circular aperture with either a fixed or time-varying radius. We consider fixed radii ranging between 2.0-5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments, and calculate the time-varying aperture using the square root of the noise pixel parameter as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. (2013)</ref>. This parameter is proportional to the full width at half max (FWHM) of the star's point spread function, and is calculated for each image using a circular aperture with radii ranging between 2.0-5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments. We then either multiply the square root of the noise pixel parameter by a constant scaling value of [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.00, 1.05, 1.10, 1.15, or 1.20] pixels or add a constant offset of [-0.9, -0.8, -0.7, -0.6, -0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5] pixels in order to determine the aperture radius for each image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Instrumental Noise Model and Optimal Aperture</head><p>Selection We next create a time series for each photometric aperture where we trim the first 90 minutes <ref type="bibr">(11,904 images)</ref> of each time series in order to remove the well-known ramp that occurs at the start of each new telescope pointing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deming et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kammer et al. 2015</ref>). We replace nonnumerical (NaN) flux values with the median flux value of each time series and replace values that deviate by more than three standard deviations from the local mean, determined from the nearest 100 points, with the local mean. We compare this approach to one in which we instead trim outliers from our light curves and find that our best-fit eclipse depths and times change by less than 0.2 sigma in both channels. 0.2% of the measurements were outliers or NaN in each channel. We then normalize each time series to one by dividing by the median value.</p><p>The photometric time series in both channels is dominated by an instrumental effect related to IRAC's wellknown intrapixel sensitivity variations, combined with the pointing oscillation of the SST. We correct for this effect using Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD), as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming et al. (2015)</ref>. This method models the variation in flux intensity in each image due to this instrumental effect by tracking the change in intensity over time within a small box of pixels centered on the flux-weighted centroid. We use a total of nine pixels arranged in a 3x3 box centered on the position of the stellar centroid. We remove images from the time series where one of these nine pixels deviates from its mean flux by more than 3σ (0.3% of the data at 3.6 µm and 0.1% of the data at 4.5 µm). Most of these deviations correlate with large pointing excursions in the photometric time series. We identify two pointing excursions in the 3.6 µm data, one of 0.7 pixels for 10 s and one of 0.5 pixels for 20 s, and one of 0.9 pixels for 10 s the 4.5 µm data.</p><p>We divide the flux in each individual pixel by the summed flux across all nine pixels, weighting each pixel by its contribution to the flux and thereby isolating the instrument noise from astrophysical signals (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming et al. 2015</ref>), and repeat this operation for each image in our photometric time series. We also incorporate a constant and a linear term in time to model baseline instrument noise. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming et al. (2015)</ref>, we do not include a quadratic term because we found that the linear fit has an equivalent RMS (root mean square residual) to the quadratic fit and so adding the quadratic parameter is not justified. In addition, the quadratic term was correlated with the eclipse depth in our model fits.</p><p>We fit a combined instrumental noise and eclipse <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002)</ref>  Standard Deviation of Residuals 4.5 micron <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-The standard deviation of the residuals are normalized to match the standard deviation of the unbinned residuals for the PLD performed on data that was optimally binned before fitting (green), PLD that was not binned before fitting (blue), and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wong et al. (2014)</ref> pixel mapping fit (red) and plotted for each bandpass as a function of bin size. The vertical dashed line indicates the timescale of the eclipse ingress and egress. The expected M/(n × (M − 1)) Gaussian scaling relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Winn et al. 2008</ref>) of the standard deviation of the residuals as a function of the number of points per bin is also plotted (black dash-dot line is normalized to the Poisson noise and black dashed line is normalized to the standard deviation of the unbinned residuals for the PLD performed on data that was optimally binned before fitting; M is the number of bins, n is the bin size). The 1σ uncertainties in the RMS (RM S/ √ 2M ) of the binned PLD model are plotted in light green.</p><p>listed in Sec. 2.1 using the 'leastsq' routine in SciPy v0.14.0 with Python 2.7.6 and examine the residuals from the best-fit solution in order to determine the optimal aperture set for each bandpass. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deming et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kammer et al. (2015)</ref>, we first bin the photometric light curves and time series for individual pixels by a factor of 512 (∼4 minute intervals) before fitting the model, then apply the resulting best-fit model coefficients to the unbinned light curve. This allows us to identify solutions that minimize noise on longer time scales, which are most important for determining the best-fit eclipse parameters, in exchange for a moderately higher scatter in the unbinned residuals. We allow the center of eclipse time, eclipse depth, pixel weights, constant, and linear terms to vary as free parameters in our fits.</p><p>We excluded from consideration any apertures with an unbinned RMS more than 1.1 times that of the aperture with the lowest RMS in each band, focusing instead on the subset of apertures with low scatter. We then compared the relative amounts of time-correlated or "red" noise in the remaining apertures by calculating the standard deviation of the residuals as a function of bin size. For light curves with minimal red noise, we would expect the standard deviation of the residuals to vary by the M/(n × (M − 1)) Gaussian scaling relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Winn et al. 2008</ref>) where n is the number of points in each bin and M is the number of bins. We evaluate the actual amount of red noise in the time series for each aperture by calculating the least-squares difference between the observed and theoretical noise scaling ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref> and select the aperture that minimizes this quantity in each bandpass.</p><p>We next find the optimal bin size to use to fit the lightcurve in each channel via the same least-squares approach with which we find the optimal aperture. After determining the optimal bin size in each bandpass, we repeat our aperture optimization at the new bin size. We iterate on searching for the optimal aperture and bin size until we converge on the optimal pairing of aperture and bin size for each bandpass.</p><p>After optimizing our choice of bin size and aperture, we found that the 4.5 µm light curve displayed a residual ramp-like signal despite our decision to trim the first 90 minutes of data. We therefore experimented with fits where we trimmed up to 3 hours of data from the start of the light curve (i.e., up to the beginning of the eclipse). We found that the best-fit eclipse times were correlated with the amount of data trimmed from the start of the light curve over the full range of trim durations considered, indicating that the ramp extended to the start of the eclipse. We then considered an alternative approach in which we returned to our original 90 minute trim duration and deliberately used larger than optimal bin sizes in our fits, effectively forcing the models to identify solutions with less structure on long time scales. We found that fits with bin sizes larger than 100 points (40 s) effectively removed the ramp from the light curve, avoiding the need to increase the trim interval to values larger than 90 minutes. These fits resulted in bestfit secondary eclipse times approximately 2 minutes (0.6 σ) earlier than our original fits with a smaller bin size. We tested for a residual ramp by repeating the large bin size fits with trim intervals ranging from 30 minutes up to 3 hours, and found no evidence for a correlation between the trim interval and the best-fit eclipse time. We then repeated our optimization for bin size considering bin sizes between 128-2048 points in powers of two. We found that our best-fit eclipse depths and times varied by less than 0.4σ across this range, and were in good agreement with the best-fit values for the 3-hour trim interval using the smaller bin size. We also considered fits using a smaller bin size where we included an exponential function of time to account for the observed ramp, but found that this exponential function was a poor match for the shape of the observed ramp. We speculate that a sum of several exponentials might provide a better fit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2010</ref>), but felt that the added free parameters were not justified given the success of using larger bin sizes. We also find that enforcing larger bin sizes in the 4.5 µm channel leads to better agreement of the secondary eclipse timing between the two channels.</p><p>We also tried decorrelating instrumental noise in our data using pixel-mapping (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ballard et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wong et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>This nonparametric technique constructs an empirical map of the pixel response across the chip by comparing the measured flux from each image to those of other images with similar stellar positions. We model the pixel sensitivity at each point in our time series using a Gaussian spatial weighting function over the 50 nearest neighbors in stellar centroid x and y position and noise pixel parameter space. The inclusion of the noise pixel parameter in the weighting ensures that the pixel map incorporates systematics unrelated to changes in the star's position that affect the shape of the stellar point-spread function. The number of neighbors was chosen to be large enough to adequately map the pixel response across the range of star positions in each eclipse data set while maintaining a reasonably low computational overhead ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Deming et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2015)</ref> found that PLD is generally more effective in removing time-correlated (i.e., red) noise than other decorrelation methods as long as the range of star positions across the data set remains below ∼0.2 pixels. The range of star centroid positions in our eclipse data sets lies below this threshold, and therefore, we expect PLD to perform optimally. We also directly compare the performance of PLD for cases where we fit to either the unbinned or optimally binned photometry, as well as to the fit acquired from photometry using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wong et al. (2014)</ref> pixel mapping technique described in the previous paragraph. We find that that the optimally binned PLD have lower levels of correlated noise than the other methods ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). In addition, binned PLD gives center of eclipse phases in the two bandpasses that are most consistent with each other (at the 1.3σ level); the unbinned PLD and pixel mapping techniques produced center of eclipse phases consistent at the 2.6σ and 5.0σ levels, respectively. We therefore select the PLD technique applied to the binned dataset for our final analysis.</p><p>For the fits described in the rest of this paper we use the following optimal aperture set and bin size. For the 3.6 µm channel we select a bin size of 21 points (∼8 sec), a 3.0 pixel radius aperture to find the centroid, a 2.0 pixel aperture to find the noise pixel parameter, and add 0.3 pixels to the square root of the noise pixel parameter to obtain the aperture within which we sum the flux. For the 4.5 µm channel we select a bin size of 128 points (∼50 sec), a 4.5 pixel radius aperture to find the centroid, a 4.0 pixel aperture to find the noise pixel parameter, and add 0.3 pixels to the square root of the noise pixel parameter to obtain the aperture within which we sum the flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Eclipse Statistical Errors</head><p>We determine the uncertainties on our model parameters using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code emcee v2.1.0 (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) on Python 2.7.6. We allow the center of eclipse time, eclipse depth, pixel weights, constant, and linear terms to vary as free parameters in our fits. We set the uncertainties on individual points in each light curve equal to the standard deviation of the residuals after subtracting the best-fit solution in each bandpass. We run the MCMC with 250 walkers for 20,000 steps; the first 5000 steps from each walker were 'burn-in' steps and removed from the chain.</p><p>For the observations in the 4.5 µm band we found that the 1σ uncertainties on the RMS overlap with the errors theoretically expected in the absence of correlated noise on the timescale of the eclipse ingress and egress (30 min; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) and therefore report the uncertainties in measurements from the 4.5 µm band directly from the MCMC analysis. However, for the observations in the 3.6 µm band, the calculated RMS consistently deviate above the expected improvement with increased binning for timescales longer than 1 min. We therefore choose a conservative approach and multiply the uncertainties in the center of eclipse time derived from the MCMC in the 3.6 µm band by a factor of 1.3, the factor by which the RMS lies above the theoretical improvement at the 30 min timescale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pont et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Winn et al. 2007</ref>). Since the timescale of the eclipse is approximately half of the length of the dataset, we are unable to accurately estimate the red noise on that timescale and so adopt the same factor of 1.3 scaling for the eclipse depth uncertainty in this band.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Eccentricity Determination</head><p>We next calculate an updated value for the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b using the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fulton et al. (2013)</ref>. We fit the available radial velocity observations for this planet from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. (2014)</ref> simultaneously with the best-fit transit ephemeris from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Southworth et al. (2012)</ref> and measured secondary eclipse times from this study. We first allow the apsides of each planet (ω b and ω c ) to vary independently and then repeat the fits imposing a prior that the posterior distribution of ω b matches the posterior distribution of ω c that was calculated from the fit in which ω b and ω c were allowed to vary independently. We use the latter version of the fits in our final analysis, and discuss the rationale for this assumption in Sec. 2.6 and 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Interior Modeling</head><p>We use the MESA code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Paxton et al. 2011</ref>), a 1-dimensional thermal evolution model, for interior modeling. In the pressure-temperature space relevant to HAT-P-13b, MESA uses the SCvH tables ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Saumon et al. 1995)</ref> for the equation of state.

Specifically, we consider core masses of 0.1-80 M ⊕ and dissipation rates equal to 0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.50% of the insolation. The thermal dissipation range we adopt here encapsulates both (i) the energy deposition typically quoted for hot Jupiters residing on circular orbits (e.g. Ohmic dissipation, kinetic deposition) and (ii) an additional component of energy arising due to the sustained tidal dissipation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bodenheimer et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. 2009</ref>).

Both models assume a solar composition, plane-parallel atmosphere with molecular abundances set to the local thermal equilibrium values. The Fortney et al.

In these models the zero redistribution case is labeled as '2π' and the full redistribution case is labeled as '4π'. We also consider versions of the model with and without an equilibrium abundance of TiO; when present, this molecule absorbs at high altitudes and produces a temperature inversion in the dayside atmosphere. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burrows et al.

Effects of Coplanarity and Apsidal Alignment</head><p>Correlations between the apsidal orientation (ω) and eccentricity (e) introduce errors on the determination of eccentricity of HAT-P-13b (e b ). Since e b is relatively small, we obtain a correspondingly poor constraint on ω b of 231 +17 −42 degrees in fits where we allow ω b to vary independently of ω c . However, since e c is large, we are able to measure ω c with an uncertainty of less than a degree alignment, although the relatively large uncertainties on ω b preclude a definitive determination.</p><p>When we allow ω b to vary freely in our fits we find that e b = 0.0108 +0.0069 −0.0035 . This eccentricity is nonzero at the 3.1σ level, providing independent confirmation that the orbit of HAT-P-13b has not yet been circularized and therefore that the secular orbital coupling mechanism discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mardling (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref> is applicable to this system. Note that the uncertainty in e b is more than five times greater than in the case when we assume apsidal alignment.</p><p>If the planets are coplanar, their apsides will align in much less than the age of the HAT-P-13 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mardling 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. 2009</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Mardling (2010)</ref> showed that an initial mutual inclination between the orbits of HAT-P-13b and HAT-P-13c would evolve to a limit cycle in e b and apsidal orientation, rather than to a fixed e b and apsidal alignment. That study explored the effects of the inclination angle between the orbits of HAT-P-13b and HAT-P-13c (∆i b−c ) on e b and found that if the orbits are nearly coplanar (∆i b−c ≤ 10 • ) then the limit cycle in e b will have a width of less than 3% e b and the width of the limit cycle of the angle between the apsides is 4 • (calculated from <ref type="bibr">Eq. 15, 16, and 17 of Mardling 2010</ref>). Thus, the e b measured at a particular epoch of the HAT-P-13 system is insensitive to this limit cycle if ∆i b−c is low.</p><p>We propose that ∆i b−c is indeed likely to be small, based on both observational constraints and theoretical arguments. First, the exploration by <ref type="bibr">Mardling (2010)</ref> found that a configuration of either (i) prograde, near-coplanar orbits or (ii) 130 • ∆i b−c 135 • is strongly favored. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. (2010)</ref> measured the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rossiter 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">McLaughlin 1924</ref>) during a transit of HAT-P-13b and found that the spin axis of the star and the angular momentum vector of HAT-P-13b's orbit are well aligned on the sky (λ = 1.9 ± 8.6 • ). This is significant because HAT-P-13b orbits far enough from the star that the the orbital precession rate is dominated by torque from HAT-P-13c rather than the J 2 quadrupole moment of the star <ref type="bibr">(Mardling 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010</ref>). If ∆i b−c were large, as in case (ii) of Mardling <ref type="formula">(2010)</ref>, nodal precession of HAT-P-13b's orbit around HAT-P-13c's orbital axis would ensue, manifesting as cyclic variations in the angle between stellar equator and the orbital plane of HAT-P-13b (ψ * ,b ). Therefore, it is unlikely that a small value for ψ * ,b would be measured at a randomly selected epoch unless ∆i b−c is small ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010</ref>). However, the initial orbital configuration of the system is unknown and the sky-projected angle (λ), rather than the true ψ * ,b , is measured, so it is not possible to definitively determine ∆i b−c from the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement alone. We therefore argue that ∆i b−c must be small, without attempting to place a definitive upper limit on ∆i b−c .</p><p>A direct measurement of ∆i b−c may be forthcoming by studying transit timing variations (TTVs) in the orbit of HAT-P-13b, since mutual inclination can induce a detectable TTV signature (Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2009). <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Southworth et al. (2012)</ref> found that there is no compelling evidence for large TTVs in the orbit of HAT-P-13b, although TTVs of less than 100 s are possible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fulton et al. 2011</ref>). Payne &amp; Ford (2011) explored theoretical TTVs for HAT-P-13b and found that HAT-P-13c should induce TTVs on the order of tens of seconds, and that a precise determination of TTVs would make it possible to discriminate between the two allowed scenarios (∆i b−c near 0 • or 130-135 • ) found by <ref type="bibr">Mardling (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Astrometry of HAT-P-13 could also be used to probe ∆i b−c . We calculate an expected astrometric signal from HAT-P-13b of either (i) 61 µas, if the orbit of HAT-P-13c is effectively edge-on as seen from Earth or (ii) 86 µas if it is inclined at 135 • as seen from the Earth. Astrometry from the Gaia mission should be accurate to ∼10 µas (Lindegren 2009) and thus will be sensitive enough to for the HAT-P-13 system parameters measured by different studies, including the fourth order polynomial approximation given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al.

Although a direct measurement of the apsidal precession of the system (i.e., ˙ ̟ c ) would allow a direct check of the secular perturbation theory that allows us to calculate k 2 b , we calculate that the precession rate for this planet is on the order of 10 −4 deg/year and is therefore beyond the reach of current radial velocity observations. However, the presence of a third companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>) in the system may complicate the determination of ∆i b−c using any of these methods.</p></div>

Based on radial velocity data alone they concluded that M core,b must be less than 120 M ⊕ at the 1σ level, and argued that core masses greater than 40 M ⊕ were disfavored based on the required effective tidal dissipation (Q b ) 3 . More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kramm et al. (2011)</ref> used updated measurements of the HAT-P-13 system from <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. (2010)</ref> to find an allowed range of k 2 b based on the 1σ error on e b by using the polynomial relating e b and k 2 b given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref>. They then used that k 2 b range to place constraints on the interior structure of HAT-P-13b using the values of M b and R b from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakos et al.

However, caution must be exercised when using the polynomial equation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref>, since the shape of the curve strongly depends on all of the measured system parameters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5)</ref>. In addition, the polynomial does not include uncertainties in the e b -k 2 b relationship due to observational measurement uncertainties.</p><p>Our analysis offers an improved estimate of M core,b (less than 25M ⊕ with 68% confidence) by taking into account both the change in the dependence of k 2 b on e b due to updated measurements of M b , M c , M * , R b , T b , T c , and e c and the effect of the uncertainties in those measured values on the e b -k 2 b relationship and M core,b determination, which had been neglected in previous studies. When combined with new radial velocity measurements from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. (2014)</ref>, the secondary eclipse measurements of HAT-P-13 provide strong constraints on e b and our assumption of apsidal alignment further reduces uncertainty on this parameter. Our method also allows us to explore the full probability distribution for M core,b instead of only placing an upper bound on its value.</p><p>There are several caveats worth mentioning in regard to our estimated core mass. We note that k 2 is only the lowest harmonic describing the internal yielding of a body to external forces, and is thus an inherently degenerate quantity (as noted for specific models of HAT-P-13b by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kramm et al. 2011</ref>). The effects of metallicity on atmospheric opacity may also affect the thermal evolution and thus the radial structure of the planet (as noted for brown dwarfs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burrows et al. 2011</ref>) but are neglected here. We adopt a solar composition envelope for definitiveness and expect that increasing the metallicity will have only a small effect on our predicted core mass based on the extensive exploration of this effect on interior models performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kramm et al. (2011)</ref>. We also note that an inhomogeneous heavy element distribution may lead to an overestimation of M core,b <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012</ref>). Thus, our estimate is specific to a model with a refractory element core and a solar composition envelope. Imperfect knowledge of the equations of state of materials at high pressure and temperature also introduces additional uncertainties (e.g. Fortney &amp; Nettelmann 2010) that are not accounted for in this study.</p><p>In addition, strong constraints on the internal heat dissipation are not available, although we can determine how the uncertainty in the internal dissipation impacts our conclusions for M core,b by re-calculating the M core,b probability distribution assuming either extremely high or extremely low dissipation rates. We find that the main effect of the dissipation rate is to shift the peak of the probability distribution for M core,b lower for higher values of dissipation, while maintaining a comparable distribution shape. When we specify dissipation as 0.05% I, the probability distribution peaks at M core,b = 22 M ⊕ . For a dissipation of 0.50% I, the probability distribution peaks at M core,b = 3 M ⊕ . We therefore conclude that uncertainties in the internal heat dissipation introduce modest, but not overwhelming, uncertainties in the estimate of M core,b (i.e., lack of knowledge of the heat dissipation yields uncertainties that are within the 1σ errors from the observational uncertainties). <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schwartz &amp; Cowan (2015)</ref> compare the irradiation temperatures (T 0 = T * R * /a b ) of a large sample of hot Jupiters to their measured dayside brightness temperatures (T d ) from secondary eclipse observations, and find that hotter planets appear to have relatively inefficient day-night circulation.

The T d /T 0 that we obtain for HAT-P-13b (0.7720 ± 0.0377) indicates relatively efficient redistribution of energy to the night side for the case of zero Bond albedo (see  <ref type="figure">. 13)</ref>. The circulation model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref>, which depends on the equilibrium temperature of the planet, also predicts moderately efficient energy redistribution such that the nightside flux from HAT-P-13b should be 0.55-0.75 that of its dayside flux, depending on the drag timescale.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparison to Other Systems</head><p>Our analysis indicates that M core,b is comparable to the core masses of Jupiter (M core,J &lt; 18M ⊕ , Fortney &amp; Nettelmann 2010) and Saturn (M core,S = 5-20M ⊕ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Helled &amp; Guillot 2013</ref>) in our own solar system. Core accretion models for gas giant planet formation suggest that minimum core masses of approximately 10 M ⊕ are needed in order to form Jovian planets, although this limit depends on both the composition of the core and the properties of the gas disk near the planet's formation location (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mizuno 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pollack et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ikoma et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubickyj et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rafikov 2006</ref>). Although our observation is consistent with core accretion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Safronov 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stevenson 1982)</ref>, our 1σ confidence interval extends down to zero core mass and therefore does not preclude alternative formation models such as disk instability (e.g., Boss 1997), nor does it provide a definitive test of post-formation core erosion (e.g. Stevenson 1982; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guillot et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Work has been undertaken to probe the heavyelement fractions of gas giant planets across a broad range of planets, from the hot super-Neptune HATS7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2015</ref>) and hot Saturn HD 149026b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sato et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ikoma et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fortney et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Southworth 2010</ref>) to superJupiters (e.g. GJ436b and HAT-P-2b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>). The constraints on the heavy-element component of these planets are often accompanied by statements about their inferred core mass, with the caveat that there are degeneracies between models with heavy element cores and models with heavy elements distributed throughout the envelope (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>). Avenues for partially breaking the degeneracies between thermal evolutionary models with heavy-elements distributed throughout the planet and models with heavyelement cores are available for extremely metal-rich planets, such as HATS-7b and HD 149026b. However, in general, measurements of mass and radii can only be used to constrain the overall fraction of the planetary mass composed of heavy elements. The inference of a radial distribution of refractory elements, and therefore assertions related to the mass of a solid core, require additional information (e.g. knowledge of k 2 ). In this regard HAT-P-13b is unique because it is the only member of the extrasolar planetary census for which this additional information exists.</p><p>Our constraint on the core mass of HAT-P-13b is consistent with the determination of heavy-element enrichment, with the accompanying inference of the presence of cores in hot Jupiters by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Torres et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. (2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Torres et al. (2007)</ref> invoke the presence of heavy element cores to explain the small radii of the metal-rich 0.60 M J HAT-P-3b and 0.62 M J XO2b, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. (2007)</ref> investigated a sample of 14 hot Jupiters and found that a subset of those planets had smaller radii than allowed by models without either a solid core or metal-rich envelope. We stress, though, that the independent measurement of the degree of central mass concentration, such as done in this paper, is necessary to determine the radial distribution of heavy elements for Jovian-mass planets.</p><p>Finally, we also compare the results of our study to empirical scaling relations from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller &amp; Fortney (2011)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2012)), we find an estimated heavy element mass of 242 +568</head><p>−160 M ⊕ , i.e., 84% of the total mass of HAT-P13b, a much higher percentage than we determine for the core mass of HAT-P-13b and also a higher percentage than is found for most of the planets considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller &amp; Fortney (2011)</ref>. This may indicate that the empirical relation cannot be extrapolated to planets around stars with metallicities higher than those of the stars they studied, or that there are additional parameters, such as formation location, that can affect the final core masses for these planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Future Measurements</head><p>Other systems analogous to the HAT-P-13 system, i.e., systems that allow us to measure the k 2 of the inner planet, will be useful for exploring the distribution of core masses over a larger sample of giant planets. In order to exploit the models utilized in this study we require that such a planet (i) be transiting, (ii) have a circularization timescale less than one third of the age of the system, (iii) have an equilibrium eccentricity large enough to be measured with high precision (Eq. 36 of Mardling 2007), and (iv) have a ˙ ̟ b tid comparable to or larger than ˙ ̟ bGR (Eq. 12 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Batygin &amp; Laughlin 2011</ref>). Radial velocity observations of the Kepler-424 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Endl et al. 2014</ref>), WASP-41 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Neveu-VanMalle et al. 2015</ref>), HAT-P-44, HAT-P-45, and HAT-P-46 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hartman et al. 2014</ref>) systems indicate that they may have architectures that would make them amenable to this kind of study. We note that many of the hot Jupiters detected by ongoing transit surveys have relatively sparse radial velocity observations, making it difficult to determine whether or not they have a suitable outer companion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. (2014)</ref> find that approximately half of all hot Jupiters have massive long-period companions, suggesting that there is a high probability that future radial velocity campaigns will discover additional systems analogous to HAT-P-13b.</p><p>Although the current observations of HAT-P-13 provide an improved estimate of the innermost planet's orbital eccentricity, the uncertainty in this parameter is still the single largest contribution to the uncertainty in the Love number. We therefore conclude that this system could benefit from additional secondary eclipse measurements.</p><p>One of our model limitations is the lack of constraint on the metallicity of HAT-P-13b's envelope (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kramm et al. 2011</ref>). Therefore further atmospheric studies are critical to refine our understanding of HAT-P-13b's structure and composition. Atmospheric circulation models for tidally locked planets suggest that high metallicity atmospheres may have less efficient atmospheric circulation than their lower-metallicity counterparts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lewis et al. 2010</ref>), which does not appear to be the case for HAT-P-13b based on the atmospheric models we perform. Since HAT-P-13 is currently one of the most metal-rich stars known to host a hot Jupiter, it is intriguing that neither HAT-P-13b's core mass nor its atmosphere suggest significant heavy element enrichment. The HAT-P-13 system will likely provide invaluable leverage when exploring the relationship between host star and planetary metallicity. In addition, fullorbit phase curve observations with Spitzer would also allow us to break degeneracies between the planet's dayside albedo and the efficiency of its atmospheric circulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schwartz &amp; Cowan 2015)</ref>. The possibility of independently constraining both the core mass and the atmospheric properties of HAT-P-13b makes this planet an ideal target for future observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this study we present observations of two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b centered at 2455326.70818 ± 0.00406 and 2455355.87672 ± 0.00226 BJD UTC . This corresponds to an error-weighted mean eclipse time that is 17.6 ± 2.9 minutes minutes earlier (at orbital phase 0.49582 ± 0.00069) than the predicted time for a circular orbit, indicating that this planet has a non-zero orbital eccentricity. We fit the measured eclipse times simultaneously with the available radial velocity data in order to derive an eccentricity of e b = 0.00700 ± 0.00100 for this planet, under the assumption that the orbits of HAT-P-13b and HAT-P-13c are coplanar. Using this eccentricity, we calculate a corresponding constraint on the planet's Love number (k 2 ). We then use this k 2 and the measured radius of HAT-P-13b as constraints on interior structure models, which allow us to directly estimate the mass of the planet's core. Moderate mutual inclinations (up to ∼ 10 • between the orbits of HAT-P-13b and HAT-P-13c) do not significantly alter the constraint from e b on the determination of the core mass.</p><p>We calculate that the core mass of HAT-P-13b is less than 25 M ⊕ (9% of the planet's mass; 68% confidence interval), with a most likely core mass of 11 M ⊕ (4% of the planet's mass). We also use the secondary eclipse depths to find that the dayside temperature is 1906 ± 93 K. Comparing these depths and the dayside temperature to models, we find that it is likely that HAT-P-13b has a strong atmospheric absorber and efficient dayside energy redistribution.</p><p>Obtaining the Love number of HAT-P-13b is crucial to determining its core mass because the presence of a modest core in a Jupiter-mass planet is typically masked by its overlying envelope. The unique opportunity to independently constrain the core mass and atmospheric properties of this hot Jupiter with a modestly sized core makes the HAT-P-13 system an important case study for dynamical constraints on the core masses of gas giant planets.</p><p>We thank Henry Ngo and Joseph Harrington for insightful discussions.
