				<p>Context. Clouds have been shown to be present in many exoplanetary atmospheres. Cloud formation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover, consistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves cannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud optical properties. Aims. We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud cover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric primary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits produce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model. Furthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit light curve. Methods. We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b, Kepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly uninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method since it allows for a very high time resolution. Results. We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the considered planets. For HAT-P-7b, a tentative detection of an asymmetric cloud cover is found, consistent with analysis of the optical phase curve. Based on Bayesian probability arguments, a symmetric model with an offset in the transit ephemeris remains, however, the most viable model. Still, this work demonstrates that for suitable targets, namely low-gravity planets around bright stars, the method can be used to constrain cloud cover characteristics and is thus a helpful additional tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many observations reported in recent years are compatible with the presence of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. Transmission spectra measure the transit depth during primary transit as a function of wavelength. If the atmosphere is opaque at a given wavelength, the planet will appear larger at that wavelength. However, visible, near-IR and IR transmission spectra of planets such as GJ1214b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bean et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>), GJ436b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>), CoRoT-1b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schlawin et al. 2014</ref>), WASP-31b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sing et al. 2015</ref>) or HAT-P-32b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gibson et al. 2013</ref>), show very little variation with wavelength. They can be approximated by flat lines to within measurement uncertainties. This has been interpreted as being due to optically thick cloud layers high up in the atmosphere, which mask the expected molecular and atomic absorption. During secondary eclipse, the apparent dayside brightness temperature can be measured at IR wavelengths. Again, as different wavelengths probe different atmospheric pressure due to wavelength-dependent opacity, brightness temperatures are expected to vary. As was observed for transmission spectra, IR emission spectra of many exoplanets are consistent with being featureless (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>). A single blackbody brightness temperature can be assigned to the photosphere, independent of wavelength. Again, this is consistent with uniform cloud coverage that blocks the access to deeper atmospheric layers. UV-visible secondary eclipse spectra have been used to determine the wavelength-dependent albedo of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Evans et al. 2013</ref>). It is found that the slope in the albedo spectrum is consistent with clouds obscuring deeper atmosphere levels where molecular and atomic absorption could influence the observations. The CoRoT and Kepler space missions have provided a wealth of high-precision, broadband optical photometry of thousands of exoplanets and candidates. About 20 of these exoplanets show detectable phase curves (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Snellen et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Mazeh &amp; Faigler 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Barclay et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Quintana et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Es- teves et al. 2013</ref>, i.e. variations with orbital phase as the planetary dayside (which reflects/re-emits starlight back to the observer) rotates in and out of view. A few Kepler phase curves show asymmetries with respect to secondary eclipse. Post-eclipse maxima of the phase curves have been found for at least four exoplanets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Demory et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Esteves et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Webber et al. 2015</ref>). These are conceptually interpreted to be a consequence of inhomogeneous cloud cover on the planet dayside. Simply put, clouds form on the nightside and evaporate as they are transported from the cooler "morning" side across the substellar meridian to the hotter "evening" side <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . In recent years, detailed theoretical cloud modeling has been performed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sudarsky et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Parmentier et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Wake- ford &amp; Sing 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Webber et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Lee et al. 2015</ref>). These studies used temperature structures calculated by 1D and 3D atmospheric models to predict cloud condensate composition (e.g., A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. simple_transit_1streply silicate and iron clouds have been proposed) and cloud altitude (usually around 1-100 mbar of pressure). Together with 3D circulation patterns, sophisticated cloud formation schemes simulate sedimentation and cloud particle growth to calculate cloud particle size distributions, cloud particle densities and cloud location. These studies generally confirm the heterogeneous cloud cover inferred from optical phase curves. However, given current data quality, degeneracies exist between cloud parameters that are not easily remedied with optical phase curves alone. For instance, even homogeneous cloud cover (or clouds clustered towards the substellar point) could produce asymmetric phase curves if the scattering asymmetry factor of the cloud particles is adapted accordingly.</p><p>Therefore, apart from intensive numerical modeling efforts, additional diagnostics for cloud properties are needed to help resolve the degeneracies and better constrain cloud characteristics. In this work, we propose a simple concept to probe cloud locations, i.e., asymmetric primary transits 2 . The concept is based on the premise that, in the case of heterogeneous cloud cover, the western limb of the planet (the leading limb in primary transit) is cloudy, whereas the eastern limb (trailing limb) is cloud-free, as proposed based on phase curve observations. Thus, the planet is composed of two hemispheres with different apparent radii, which produces different transit signatures during ingress and egress.</p><p>Transit observations, especially from space-based surveys, are particular useful for this method for several reasons. Mainly, the quasi-continuous coverage allows for the analysis of hundreds of near-consecutive transits, hence an excellent time resolution of the order of seconds or less in the phase-folded light curves. Furthermore, compared to spectroscopic observations, broadband photometry produces much higher signal-to-noise ratios and, thus enables stronger constraints on cloud parameters.</p><p>We apply the new technique to two planets in the Kepler field with well-characterized asymmetric phase curves, namely Kepler-7b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Latham et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Demory et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Esteves et al. 2015</ref>) and HAT-P-7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pál et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Borucki et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Welsh et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Esteves et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, von Paris et al. 2016</ref>). Furthermore, we analyze transit light curves of HD209458b taken from Brown et al. (2001) (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>) obtained from four transits observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. HD209458 is one of the brightest stars around which a transiting planet has been found, and the transmission spectrum of HD209458b shows some evidence of possible cloud and/or haze cover (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Deming et al. 2013</ref>). Therefore, we include it here for illustration purposes.</p><p>Although the results are not conclusive with respect to the presence of clouds, we will establish the applicability of the technique for future photometric surveys.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data reduction process adapted for this work, and Sect. 3 presents the numerical model used in the transit modeling. Section 4 introduces the cloud diagnostics for the primary transit light curve. The inverse model used to fit the forward models to the data is described in Sect. 5. Results are presented in Sect. 6 and discussed in Sect. 7. We conclude with Sect. 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data reduction</head><p>For target planets observed by Kepler (i.e., Kepler-7b and HAT-P-7b), we use the short-cadence (SC) single-aperture photometry (SAP), which is publicly available from the MAST archive <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. First, data points, that are flagged by the Kepler pipeline as NaNs and obviously flawed data, are removed manually to produce a raw light curve R qk for each quarter k. To obtain phase-folded transit light curves L qk , we then proceed in three steps:</p><p>1. Outlier removal: We calculate a running median M 2.4 for each point j of the light curve, using a 2.4-hour window.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M 2.4 ( j) = median R(i), |t(i) − t(j)| 1.2hrs ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where t denotes the time stamps of the data point. From there, we calculate the median absolute deviation (MAD) as follows: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates this procedure, for the 9th transit of Kepler-7b in Q3 (green lines). 2. Normalization: After outlier removal, we calculate a running median M 48 for each point j, using a roughly 2-day window (red line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">MAD = median (|R − M 2.4 |) . (2) A point j is rejected if |R( j) − M 2.4 ( j)| 4 × MAD. (3)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">M 48 ( j) = median R(i), |t(i) − t(j)| 24hrs .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The normalized light curve N is obtained by dividing the raw light curve by the median-filtered light curve.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N = R M 48 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In this way, slow variations (due to, e.g., planetary phase curve, stellar activity, etc.) are mostly removed from the final light curve. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the normalized light curve for Kepler-7 in quarter 3.  3. Phase folding: The normalized light curve N is then phasefolded to obtain the final light curve L as a function of orbital phase Φ. For this, Φ is defined such that Φ=0 at primary transit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Φ( j) = t( j) − T 0 P − − t( j) − T 0 P ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where T 0 is the mid-transit time of the first transit, P the orbital period and x represents the floor function, i.e., the greatest integer less than or equal to x. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the final light curve of Kepler-7b, using all quarters with SC data.</p><p>The values for T 0 and P are taken from the latest data release (DR24) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the Q0-Q17 light curve of HAT-P-7b. Since HAT-P-7 is about 2.5 magnitudes brighter than Kepler-7 in the Kepler bandpass, the resulting light curve is much cleaner.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Forward model</head><p>In this model, the planet is assumed to be composed of two hemispheres with radius R trail and R lead for the trailing and leading hemisphere, respectively. These two radii are parameterized as follows:</p><p>Article number, page 3 of 17</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. simple_transit_1streply </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R trail = R p (7) R lead = R p + h cloud (8)</formula><p>where R p is the planetary radius and h cloud is the cloud altitude.</p><p>Note that h cloud &lt;0 is permitted, which then implies a larger trailing hemisphere. The concept of the model is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig.  7</ref>. To calculate the stellar total luminosity and estimate the area obscured by the planet, we use a N * × N * grid to resolve the stellar disk, with its center corresponding to the stellar center (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>). N * is chosen such that a stellar pixel corresponds to roughly half a scale height of the planet in question (N * =4,000 for Kepler-7b, N * =10,000 for HAT-P-7b, for example).</p><p>As is general practice in exoplanet transit modeling, the asymmetric model adopts a quadratic limb-darkening law with u 1 and u 2 as the linear and the quadratic limb-darkening coefficients for the intensity distribution I across the stellar disk:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I(µ) = 1 − u 1 · (1 − µ) − u 2 · (1 − µ) 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>with µ = cos(φ) and φ is the angle between the local surface normal and the observer direction.</p><p>Planetary orbits are assumed to be circular, which is a good approximation for the targets considered (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Winn et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Demory et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Esteves et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>Further parameters needed to describe the passage of the planet in front of the star are the impact parameter b and a S , the projected semi-major axis a S in units of the stellar radius:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">a S = a R * ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where a is the semi-major axis and R * is the stellar radius (fixed in this work due to strong asteroseismology constraints, e.g. De-</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">mory et al. 2011, Van Eylen et al. 2012).</formula><p>The impact parameter is defined as the projected distance (in units of stellar radii) of the planets' center to the stellar center at mid-transit. It is related to the orbital inclination i via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">b = cos (i) · a S .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In addition, we introduce a seventh parameter which is the phase offset φ 0 of the passage of the planetary meridian over the stellar meridian (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>) compared to the minimum of the primary transit. In general, we assume φ 0 =0, however due to, e.g., eccentric orbits, φ 0 can be different from zero. The passage of the planet in front of the star is discretized such that the planet advances less than one stellar pixel per time step.</p><p>We have compared the new model with the widely used, analytical <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> model. Usually, the deviations between both models are of the order of 1 ppm or less, hence much smaller than the signals we look for (see next section, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>).</p><p>We deem such a deviation acceptable. With increasing numerical resolution in our model, the deviations will also decrease, however at a much increased computational cost. In total, the asymmetric model contains up to seven free parameters, namely R p , h cloud to describe the form of the planet, a S , b, φ 0 to describe the orbit of the planet, and u 1 , u 2 to describe the stellar intensity distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Cloud diagnostics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Bisector span</head><p>The bisector span is the first potential diagnostic of an asymmetric transit, that could indicate the presence of clouds. The bisector B as a function of transit depth d is a geometrical line. It is defined as the center of a horizontal line that intersects the transit light curve at a given d (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> for an illustration). For a symmetric transit of a uniform planet, the bisector is a straight, vertical line, centered at zero. However, for asymmetric planets, two phenomena are observed. Firstly, the bisector is non-zero, shifted by a few minutes compared to the cloud-free case. Secondly, it is no longer a straight line, rather, with transit depth, a triangular-like shape can be seen. This shape is caused by the varying slope of the light curve as cloudy and cloud-free hemispheres, respectively, begin/end their passage in front of the star.  transit light curve is very flat (d 0.008 for the blue line). These features are due to the finite numerical resolution in the model. The bisector is strongly affected by the observational noise at high transit depths, where the light curve is flat. Hence small variations due to noise will drastically change the bisector span. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> (upper panel) shows the same bisector spans, but with a synthetic noise of 34 ppm added to the light curve. This is the expected noise for stars of magnitude 8 with PlaTO 2.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>). The bisector variations with transit depth are still clearly visible. When adding a more realistic noise with an amplitude of 500 ppm, comparable to Kepler magnitude 11-12 stars, the shape of the bisector is hard to analyze. It may be possible to exclude high cloud altitudes of the order of 20,000 km, but note, however, that such an altitude would correspond to about 13 scale heights in the case of Kepler-7b. Two main characteristics are proposed to analyze the bisector, as a function of cloud altitude. These are, firstly, the minimum bisector at half ingress (when the entire leading hemisphere already covers the star and the trailing hemisphere begins cover- ing the star), B min . Since an offset in Φ 0 of a symmetric transit also leads to a non-zero B min , the second criterion evaluates the shape of the bisector. It uses the difference ∆B between the bisector at the beginning of the ingress and at half ingress. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  11</ref> shows these two diagnostics as a function of cloud altitude for a Kepler-7 setup. It is clearly seen that there is an almost linear relationship between the diagnostics and cloud altitude. The slope of the relationship depends on stellar characteristics (limb darkening) and the planetary orbit (especially a S ). To develop a detection criterion, the rms of the bisector σ B is calculated as the standard deviation over ingress and egress. This excludes the full-transit phase where the planet covers the star completely and the bisector is most sensitive to observational noise. Then, the median B med over the same range is calculated to establish a non-zero bisector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">σ 0 = B med σ B .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Once a non-zero bisector has been established, the shape is analyzed with the following criterion on a smoothed bisector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">σ shape = ∆B σ B .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Article number, page 5 of 17</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. simple_transit_1streply For the 34 ppm cases in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>, we thus find significant detections (σ 0 between 2 and 6, and subsequently, σ shape between 3 and 5). However, in the 500 ppm cases, all but the 20,000 km bisector span are compatible with zero. Even the most favorable case only shows a σ 0 of the order of 1.5, and when smoothing the bisector, one finds a σ shape around 4. This would imply a somewhat significant detection, but as mentioned above, corresponding to much more than 10 scale heights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Residuals</head><p>The second cloud diagnostics are the residuals of the data with respect to a symmetric transit model, such as the model of <ref type="bibr">Man- del &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. An asymmetric transit will imprint a clear structure on the residuals during ingress and egress when compared to a symmetric model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the residuals between symmetric and asymmetric models, again, as above, for Kepler-7 system parameters. We compare asymmetric models with R P =18 R ⊕ and varying cloud altitudes to symmetric models with a planetary radius R eq such that the asymmetric planet and the symmetric planet cover the same surface area:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R 2 eq = 1 2 R 2 P + (R P + h cloud ) 2 .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>It is clearly seen that in the short ingress and egress phases of the light curve, the residuals show distinct structures. As above for the bisector span, these residuals are somewhat sensitive to the observational noise. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>, for a synthetic Gaussian noise of 34 ppm, the residuals still clearly show a structure. Upon increasing the noise, however, even at the adopted cloud altitude of 10,000 km, the residuals do not show a sign of clouds anymore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Degeneracies</head><p>Equation 14 shows the principal correlation between the parameters of the asymmetric model: in the absence of limb darkening, asymmetric and symmetric models will be identical during transit, if eq. 14 is satisfied. If limb darkening is present, small differences between various parameter combinations allows for resolving these degeneracies. However, observational noise will  tend to counteract this effect. Therefore, in the presence of significant noise, strong correlation between parameters is expected. Combinations of planetary radius and cloud altitude that satisfy eq. 14, however, will show slight timing variations as to the start and end of the transit ingress and egress phases. These different starting/ending times of the planetary transit can be compensated for by choice of Φ 0 , thus leading to the second possible correlation between model parameters if the light curve is significantly affected by noise.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>, several residuals are shown with respect to a symmetric model. Note in particular the smaller vertical scale compared to Figs. 12 and 13. Adding synthetic white noise to the model light curves used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>, we were able to determine the maximum noise level, up to which a clear distinction between models, hence decorrelating the parameters, would still be possible. In general, a noise level of lower than about 50-100 ppm allows to clearly retrieve the original model.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">MCMC algorithm</head><p>To sample the full parameter space, we adopt a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We use the emcee python package developed by Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mackey et al. (2013)</ref>, which implements an algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodman &amp; Weare (2010)</ref>. emcee uses multiple chains (in this work, typically around 500) to sample the parameter space. In each step, for each chain, the algorithm proposes a new positions based on the position of the entire ensemble of chains. Compared to more traditional MCMC approaches such as Metropolis-Hastings, emcee converges much quicker and is less dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, emcee does not need a tuning of the parameter of the proposal function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Fitting procedure</head><p>We proceeded in two different steps for the MCMC simulations. In a first step, a low numerical resolution in the forward model was used, that is however sufficient to constrain stellar and orbital characteristics (i.e., a S , b, u 1 , u 2 ) to a high degree of confidence. To ensure good convergence and avoid any contamination by initial conditions, the chains were run for 500 steps (&gt;5 auto-correlation lengths for each parameter). The first 1-2 auto-correlation lengths were considered as burn-in and discarded for the calculation of parameter uncertainties. Convergence was checked by inspecting visually the evolution of the mean of the entire ensemble. Initial positions were obtained with a random sample within the assumed prior to allow the sampler to start by exploring the entire parameter space. Uncertainty ranges are calculated by marginalizing over the posterior distribution, thinned by the auto-correlation length of the particular parameter in question. We then determine 68 % and 95 % credibility regions as the <ref type="bibr">[0.16,0.84]</ref> and [0.03,0.98] median-centered percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative probability distributions (CDF). If the parameter distribution were to be Gaussian, these credibility regions would correspond to the 1 and 2 σ uncertainties, respectively. Then, in a second step, the 95 % credibility regions obtained in the first step were used to initialize a high-resolution forward model. The resolution is increased such that the stellar disk is resolved better than a planetary scale height, and thus, the model becomes sensitive to the effect of clouds on the transit shape. However, this increases the computational cost by about a factor of 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Scenarios</head><p>For each planet, we considered three scenarios. The first scenario (five parameters) is a symmetric scenario (no clouds) with Φ 0 fixed at 0. The second scenario relaxes this constraint and fits additionally for Φ 0 , but retains the assumption of no clouds, hence symmetric transits. The third scenario is fully asymmetric, fitting for all seven parameters in the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Bisector spans</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 15-17</ref>, the bisector spans of the three target planets are shown. As expected from the data quality in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, the bisector spans are much better constrained for HAT-P-7b and HD209458b.</p><p>We define the scale height time, T H , as the characteristic time scale on which cloud phenomena will impact the transit light curve. Essentially, it describes the time needed for the planet to advance by one scale height while transiting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">T H = H v orb ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with H the scale height and v orb the orbital velocity. For Kepler7b, we find T H =10.7 s, whereas for the relatively high-gravity planets HAT-P-7b and HD209458b, T H =2.7 s and T H =4.5 s, respectively. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 15-17</ref>, we show the scale height times T H for the different planets (green lines: ±T H , blue lines ±5T H ) to illustrate the potential constraints that could be inferred from the bisector spans. It is clear that neither Kepler-7b nor HAT-P-7b show a definitive sign of asymmetry in the bisector span. Following the detection criteria developed in eqs. 12 and 13, we find σ 0 of far less than unity for both Kepler-7b and HAT-P-7b. This is because for Kepler-7b the photometric noise is too high and for HAT-P-7b, T H simply is too small. It should be noted, though, that for a Kepler-7b-like planet orbiting around a star similar to HAT-P-7 or HD209458, the bisector span could at least have been used to constrain clouds to within a few scale heights, since Kepler-7b has a very favorable scale height.</p><p>In the case of HD209458b, the bisector span is very well constrained to within a few scale heights. However, due to the low time sampling of the transit light curve of HD209458b (only four transits, covered by a few hundred points, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. 2001</ref>), the Article number, page 7 of 17 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. simple_transit_1streply  bisector span of HD209458b is not conclusive to infer reliably the presence of any asymmetry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Residuals</head><p>In Appendix A, the parameter space projections of the symmetric MCMC simulations are shown (Figs. A.1, A.2, A.4 and A.5). All stellar, orbital and planetary parameters are well constrained for both planets. In the case of Kepler-7b, the symmetric models show that the observations are consistent with Φ 0 =0, whereas for HAT-P-7b, a statistically significant deviation of the order of 2 sec is found by the MCMC model. This is slightly larger than the 1 σ uncertainty associated with T 0 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The best-fitting models have a χ 2 red value of 1 and 0.99 for Kepler-7b and HAT-P-7b, respectively. Hence the quality of the fit is satisfactory. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 18 and 19</ref>, the residuals of the symmetric fits to the data are shown. As before with the bisector spans, the residuals do not show any hint of asymmetry or clouds comparable to the ones discussed above in Sect. 4. Again, when comparing the results for both planets, it is apparent that a Kepler-7b-like planet around a relatively bright star such as HAT-P-7 would be much more favorable for such an analysis and could be amenable to cloud altitude constraints with this technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Asymmetric transit models</head><p>The parameter space projections of the asymmetric MCMC simulations are shown in Figs. A.3 and A.6). It is evident that in the case of Kepler-7b, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the analysis, since planetary radius R p , cloud altitude h cloud and phase offset φ 0 are strongly correlated parameters, as expected from the high noise level (see discussion above). Hence, for Kepler-7b, the analysis is compatible with h cloud =0. Note, however, that in the case of HAT-P-7b, where the standard rms of the final light curve is 150 ppm instead of the roughly  600 ppm for Kepler-7b, the degeneracy is somewhat weaker, and some constraints appear to be feasible. From the marginalized posterior distributions, it seems that a slight asymmetry is preferred, with h cloud &lt;0 at 68 % confidence (although h cloud =0 is within the 95 % credibility region). This would suggest that the trailing limb appears slightly larger (of the order of a couple of scale heights). Such a result is actually consistent with the analysis of von <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Paris et al. (2016)</ref> who found that the asymmetric phase curve of HAT-P-7b is more likely due to an asymmetry in scattering properties than due to a thermal offset, contrary to previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Esteves et al. 2015</ref>). However, given that the constraints are very weak, such a conclusion appears to be only tentative. Note, in addition, that the asymmetric model contains more parameters than the symmetric models. Therefore, we apply the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to choose between models. The HAT-P-7b asymmetric model is preferred by a factor of about 400 over the purely symmetric model. However, the χ 2 of both the asymmetric model and the free-Φ 0 model are virtually identical, so this model in turn is preferred by about a factor of 400 over the asymmetric model (∆BIC of about 12, respectively). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the fit results for the two planets and shows the planetary parameters (orbital and stellar parameters are virtually identical for all fit scenarios).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Suitable targets</head><p>Although it affects the entire transit light curve via limb darkening, most of the effect of the phenomenon that is looked for occurs on extremely short timescales, of the order of a few to a few tens of seconds. Therefore, the light curve must be obtained at a very high cadence. This can be done with short exposure times or with a long time series covering dozens, or even hundreds, of orbits. Furthermore, bright targets are needed to obtain the required photometric precision of the order of a few tens of ppm. In addition to the requirements for the star, the planets must also be suitable for this technique to be effective. Orbital speeds for close-in planets are of the order of 100-200 kms −1 , hence the scale height of the considered planet should be of the order of 1,000-2,000 km. Low-gravity planets in short orbits have very large scale heights (H ∼ T eq g , g gravity, T eq equilibrium temperature). For scale heights of the order of 10 3 -10 4 km, the signature of clouds during primary transit will be visible for bright targets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref> shows a compilation of transiting planets discovered so far. The host star V magnitude is used as a color coding, and we also show transit depth (x-axis) and surface gravity (y-axis). As is clear, suitable targets (in terms of the diagram, blue dots in the lower quarter of the diagram) are missing. For instance, as already noted above, HAT-P-7 is a reasonably bright target, but the surface gravity is much too large. Inversely, Kepler-7b has a very suitable surface gravity (only slightly larger than Mars), but orbits a too faint host star for this technique to work. Many transiting planets have been discovered to date with very low surface gravities, down to ∼1 ms −2 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hartman et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Lissauer et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bonfils et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Jontof-Hutter et al. 2014</ref>). However, as for Kepler-7b, their host stars are too faint for cloud detection with primary transits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 20</ref>. Exoplanet statistics: Transit depth (x-axis) and surface gravity (log g, in cm s −2 , y-axis). Color coding for the host star V magnitude. Planets used in this work are indicated. Data and plot taken from exoplanets.org (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wright et al. 2011 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Han et al. 2014</ref> for detailed description of the database).</p><p>Upcoming space missions such as ChEOPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Broeg et al. 2013</ref>), TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ricker et al. 2014</ref>) and PlaTO 2.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>) are expected to deliver many more transiting planets and candidates as well as high-precision photometry of radial-velocity planets, but, in contrast to CoRoT and Kepler, around much brighter host stars (down to magnitude 8). Therefore, the detection of cloud signatures via primary transit asymmetries should be feasible for at least a few candidates from these surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Forward scattering clouds</head><p>Optically thick clouds are responsible for the reflected light contribution to the observed phase curves and are the aim of this work. However, optically thin clouds can also play a large role in shaping the transmission across the planetary limbs. Depending on cloud particle characteristics, a strong forward scattering peak can appear (e.g., , which then scatters stellar light into the line-of-sight. Therefore, the presence of high-altitude, optically thin clouds can lead to a decreased contrast between cloud-free and cloud-covered limbs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Other sources of asymmetric transits</head><p>Uniquely attributing asymmetric transit light curves to inhomogeneous cloud cover is not possible. Over the last decade, several other astrophysical sources of asymmetric transit light curves have been presented. For instance, 3D atmospheric modeling of hot Jupiters generally predicts strong eastwards circulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Showman &amp; Guillot 2002)</ref>, and thus, a hotter trailing limb than the morning limb (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agúndez et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Parmentier et al. 2013</ref>). It follows that the atmosphere extends further, hence the transit depth is larger. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agúndez et al. (2014)</ref> note that this thermal effect dominates over the effect of chemistry in transmission spectra. In the science case considered in this work, the hotter evening side somewhat diminishes the effect of the inhomogeneous cloud cover, since the "missing" planetary radius is compensated for by the extended atmosphere on the trailing limb. On the other hand, for otherwise homogenous planets (for instance, with global cloud cover), the purely thermal effect could produce slightly asymmetric transits.</p><p>In an order-of-magnitude estimate, when calculating the extent of the atmosphere from the homogenized high-pressure layer at p H to the cloud layer at p C , one finds that the evening atmosphere is extended (compared to the morning atmosphere) by an amount h E :</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">h E = ln p H p C ∆T T M · H,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where H is the scale height, ∆T is the temperature difference between morning temperature T M and evening temperature T E . For many planets, 3D circulation models find relatively moderate values of about ∆T T M ≈10-20 %. Using p H =1 bar and p C = 50mbar as representative values, one then finds h E ≈0.3-0.6 H. This is not negligible, however not expected to be the dominant photometric effect. Other possible physical causes of asymmetric transits are, e.g., the presence of exomoons around the planet in question (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Szabó et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Kipping 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Heller 2014</ref>) or gas and dust tails of strongly irradiated or disrupting planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brogi et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Rappaport et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015</ref>. A possible way to discriminate between such scenarios would be, for instance, that in the case of tailed exoplanets, the transit depth would vary quite remarkably. Previous studies of HAT-P-7b have revealed a slight variation of the transit depth with the observation quarter <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Van Eylen et al. 2013</ref>), which however is not attributed to physical reasons, but rather to instrumental effects. Detailed model comparisons between competing scenarios are however not the subject of this work, but rather for future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a new technique to identify cloud signatures in the transit light curves of exoplanets. Inhomogeneous cloud cover produces asymmetries in the transit light curve. Such asymmetries reveal themselves via the bisector span and characteristic residuals with respect to standard, symmetric models. We have applied this reasoning to search for hints for clouds in the transits of Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b and HD209458b. No clear sign of clouds have been found, although for HAT-P-7b, results seem to indicate a small, yet not statistically very significant, asymmetry consistent with previous phase curve analyses by von <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Paris et al. (2016)</ref>. This is due to several reasons. In the case of Kepler-7b, the photometric noise is too high. HAT-P-7b, despite its better photometric quality, has a scale height which is too small to allow constraints on the presence of clouds or the cloud altitude. In the case of HD209458b, the time sampling of the used transit light curve is too small, which again prevents a clear detection of clouds. However, we have shown that with future photometric surveys and suitable targets, asymmetric transits will be detectable. This will help to better constrain cloud properties on exoplanets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
