				<p>Exoplanet orbital eccentricities offer valuable clues about the history of planetary systems. Eccentric , Jupiter-sized planets are particularly interesting: they may link the &quot;cold&quot; Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in hot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date, eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial velocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes radial velocity follow-up of most. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian method of measuring an individual planet&apos;s eccentricity solely from its transit light curve using prior knowledge of its host star&apos;s density. We show that eccentric Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit durations-part of the &quot;photoeccentric&quot; light curve signature of a planet&apos;s eccentricity-even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and loosely-constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity of e = 0.71 +0.16 −0.09 , in good agreement with the discovery value e = 0.67 ± 0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional tests using actual Kepler data. In each case the technique proves to be a viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto hot Jupiters predicted by Socrates et al. (2012).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many exoplanets have highly eccentric orbits, a trend that has been interpreted as a signature of the dynamical processes that shape the architectures of planetary systems (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ford &amp; Rasio 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Nagasawa &amp; Ida 2011)</ref>. Giant planets on eccentric orbits are of particular interest because they may be relics of the same processes that created the enigmatic class of planets known as hot Jupiters: planets on very short period (P &lt; 10 days) orbits that, unlike smaller planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hansen &amp; Murray 2012)</ref>, could not have formed in situ. Hot Jupiters may have smoothly migrated inward through the disk from which they formed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ward 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alibert et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ida &amp; Lin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bromley &amp; Kenyon 2011</ref>). Alternatively, the typical hot Jupiter may have been perturbed by another body onto an eccentric orbit (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Naoz et al. 2012</ref>), with a star-skirting periapse that became the parking spot for the planet as its orbit circularized through tidal dissipation, initiated by one of several perturbation mechanisms (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wu &amp; Murray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ford &amp; Rasio 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2011</ref>).</p><p>1 rdawson@cfa.harvard.edu <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Socrates et al. (2012)</ref> (hereafter S12) refer to this process as "high eccentricity migration" (HEM). If HEM were responsible for hot Jupiters, at any given time we would observe hot Jupiters that have undergone full tidal circularization, failed hot Jupiters that have tidal timescales too long to circularize over the star's lifetime, and proto hot Jupiters that are caught in the process of tidal circularization. S12 predicted that the Kepler Mission should detect several "super-eccentric" proto hot Jupiters with eccentricities in excess of 0.9. This prediction was tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dong et al. (2012)</ref> on a sample of eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field: in an incomplete search, they found 14 long-period, highly eccentric binaries and expect to eventually find a total of 100.</p><p>As a test of planetary architecture theories, we are devoting a series papers to measuring the individual eccentricities of the Kepler Jupiters to either identify or rule out the super-eccentric proto hot Jupiters predicted by S12. In this first paper, we describe and demonstrate our technique for measuring individual eccentricities from transit light curves. Measuring the eccentricity of a Jupiter-sized planet is also key to understanding its tidal history (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Jackson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hansen 2010</ref>) and tidal heating (e.g Mardling 2007; <ref type="bibr">Jackson et al. 2008</ref>), climate variations (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kataria et al. 2011</ref>), and the ef-fect of the variation in insolation on the habitability (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Spiegel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dressing et al. 2010</ref>) of possible orbiting rocky exomoons detectable by Kepler (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kipping et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>To date, the measurements of eccentricities of individual transiting planets have been made through radial velocity follow-up, except when the planet exhibits transit timing variations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nesvorny et al. 2012</ref>). However, a transit light curve is significantly affected by a planet's eccentricity, particularly if the photometry is of high quality: we refer to the signature of a planet's eccentricity as the "photoeccentric" effect. One aspect is the asymmetry between ingress and egress shapes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burke et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kipping 2008)</ref>. The eccentricity also affects the timing, duration, and existence of secondary eclipses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kane &amp; von Braun 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dong et al. 2012</ref>). The most detectable aspect of the photoeccentric effect in Kepler photometry for long-period, planet-sized companions is the transit event's duration at a given orbital period P , which is the focus of this work.</p><p>Depending on the orientation of the planet's argument of periapse (ω), the planet moves faster or slower during its transit than if it were on a circular orbit with the same orbital period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Burke 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Ford, Quinn, and Veras 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moorhead et al. 2011</ref>). If the transit ingress and egress durations can be constrained, the duration aspect of the photoeccentric effect can be distinguished from the effect of the planet's impact parameter (b), because although b &gt; 0 shortens the full transit duration (T 23 , during which the full disk of the planet is inside the disk of the star, i.e. from second to third contact), it lengthens the ingress/egress duration. Therefore, with prior knowledge or assumptions of the stellar parameters, combined with measurements from the light curve of the planet's period and size (R P /R ⋆ ), one can identify highly eccentric planets as those moving at speeds inconsistent with a circular orbit as they pass in front of their stars (see also §3 of <ref type="bibr">Barnes 2007, §3.1 of FQV08)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes (2007)</ref> presented the first comprehensive description of the effects of orbital eccentricity on a transit light curve, including that a short transit duration corresponds to a minimum eccentricity, contingent on the measurement of b and of the host star's density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burke (2008)</ref> discussed the effect of orbital eccentricity on transit detection and on the inferred distribution of planetary eccentricities. FQV08 laid out the framework for using photometry to measure both the distribution of exoplanet eccentricities and, for high signal-to-noise transits of stars with known parameters, the eccentricities of individual planets. They derived expressions linking the orbital eccentricity to the transit duration and presented predicted posterior distributions of eccentricity and ω for a given ratio of: 1) the measured total transit duration (i.e. from first to fourth contact, including ingress and egress) T 14 to 2) the T 14 expected for a planet on a circular orbit with the same b, stellar density ρ ⋆ , and P . Then they showed how the distribution of planetary transit durations reveals the underlying eccentricity distribution. FQV08 focused on the possibility of measuring the eccentricity distribution of terrestrial planets, which has implications for habitability. Here we will show that the technique they describe for measuring individual planet eccentricities is particularly well-suited for Jupiter-sized planets.</p><p>The work of FQV08 was the basis for several recent analyses of high-precision light curves from the Kepler mission that have revealed information about the eccentricity distribution of extra-solar planets and the eccentricities of planets in multi-transiting systems. By comparing the distribution of observed transit durations to the distribution derived from model populations of eccentric planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moorhead et al. (2011)</ref> ruled out extreme eccentricity distributions. They also identified individual planets with transit durations too long to be consistent with a circular orbit; these planets are either on eccentric orbits (transiting near apoapse) or orbit host stars whose stellar radii are significantly underestimated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kane et al. (2012)</ref> used the distribution of transit durations to determine that the eccentricity distribution of Kepler planets matches that of planets detected by the RV method and to discover a trend that small planets have less eccentric orbits. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Plavchan et al. (2012)</ref> found that the distribution of eccentricities inferred from the transit durations is not in agreement with the eccentricity distribution of the RV sample; they suggested that the difference may be due to errors in the stellar parameters. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kipping et al. (2012)</ref> presented a method that they refer to as Multibody Asterodensity Profiling to constrain eccentricities of planets in systems in which multiple planets transit. They noted that one can also apply the technique to single transiting planets, but discouraged doing so, except for planets whose host star densities have been tightly constrained (e.g. by asteroseismology). FQV08 recommend measuring eccentricities photometrically only for planets with "well-measured stellar properties" but also point out the weak dependence of eccentricity on stellar density.</p><p>In this work we apply the idea first proposed by FQV08 to real data and demonstrate that we can measure the eccentricity of an individual transiting planet from its transit light curve. We show that this technique is particularly well-suited for our goal of identifying highly eccentric, giant planets. In §2, we show that even a loose prior on the stellar density allows for a strong constraint on the planet's orbital eccentricity. In §3, we argue that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration of the parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and automatically accounts for the transit probability. We include both a mathematical and practical framework for transforming the data and prior information into an eccentricity posterior. In §4, we measure the eccentricity of HD 17156 b from ground-based transit light curves alone, finding good agreement with the nominal value from RV measurements. We also measure the eccentricity of a transit signal injected into both short and long cadence Kepler data and of Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 686.01 from long-cadence, publicly-available Kepler data, finding an eccentricity of e = 0.62 +0.18 −0.14 . In §5, we present our program of "distilling" highly eccentric Jupiters from the KOI sample and we conclude ( §6) with prospects for further applications of the photoeccentric effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONSTRAINTS ON STELLAR DENSITY</head><p>To first order, a transiting planet's eccentricity and its host star's density depend degenerately on transit light curve observables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kipping et al. (2012)</ref> harnessed the power of multiple planets transiting the same host star to break this degeneracy (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ragozzine &amp; Holman 2010</ref>). Yet, as FQV08 first pointed out, although the transit observables depend on the stellar density, this dependence is weak (the ratio of the planet's semi-major axis to the stellar radius a/R ⋆ ∝ ρ 1/3 ⋆ ). Thus a loose prior on the stellar density should allow for a strong constraint on the eccentricity.</p><p>In the limit of a constant star-planet distance during transit and a non-grazing transit (such that the transit is approximately centered at conjunction), Kipping (2010a) derived the following expression (Kipping 2010a Equations 30 and 31) for T 14 , the duration from first to fourth contact (i.e. the total transit duration including ingress and egress), and for T 23 , the duration from first to third contact (i.e. the full transit duration during which the full disk of the planet is inside the disk of the star):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T 14/23 = P π (1 − e 2 ) 3/2 (1 + e sin ω) 2 arcsin   (1 + / − δ 1/2 ) 2 − (a/R ⋆ ) 2 ( 1−e 2 1+e sin ω ) 2 cos 2 i (a/R ⋆ ) 1−e 2 1+e sin ω sin i   (1)</formula><p>where P is the orbital period; e is the eccentricity; ω is the argument of periapse; R ⋆ is the stellar radius; δ = (R p /R ⋆ ) 2 is the fractional transit depth with R p the planetary radius; a is the semi-major axis; and i is the inclination.

(2012)</ref>'s variable Ψ, for which Ψ = g 3 . Dynamically, g is the ratio of the planet's velocity during transit (approximated as being constant throughout the transit) to the speed expected of a planet with the same period but e = 0. Note that ω is the angle of the periapse from the sky plane, such that ω = 90 • corresponds to a transit at periapse and ω = −90 • to a transit at apoapse. For a given P and δ, T 14 and T 23 are shortest (longest) and g largest (smallest) when the planet transits at periapse (apoapse). Moreover, if we approximate sin i = 1, we can rewrite Equation (3) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a R ⋆ g(e, ω) = 2δ 1/4 P π T 2 14 − T 2 23 (5)</formula><p>Finally, using Kepler's third law and assuming that the planet mass is much less than the stellar mass (M p ≪ M ⋆ ), the transit observables can be expressed in terms of the stellar density ρ ⋆ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ ⋆ (e, ω) = g(e, ω) −3 ρ circ<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ρ circ = ρ ⋆ (e = 0) = 2δ 1/4 T 2 14 − T 2 23 3 3P Gπ 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Although Equation 6 was derived under several stated approximations, the relationships among ρ ⋆ , e, and ω are key to understanding how and to what extent we can constrain a transiting planet's eccentricity using a full light curve model. Because g(e, ω) is raised to such a large power, a small range of g(e, ω) corresponds to a large range in the ratio ρ ⋆ /ρ circ , i.e. the ratio of the true stellar density to the density measured from fitting a circular transit light curve model. For instance, the assumed value of ρ ⋆ would need to be in error by two orders of magnitude to produce the same effect as a planet with e = 0.9 and ω = 90 • . Thus the ρ circ derived from the transit light curve strongly constrains g, even with a weak prior on ρ ⋆ , because g ∝ ρ 1/3 ⋆ .</p><p>2.1. Constraints on ρ circ from the light curve: common concerns One might worry that long-cadence data, such as the 30-minute binning of most Kepler light curves, cannot resolve the ingress and egress times sufficiently to constrain a/R ⋆ , or equivalently ρ circ . In other words, one might worry that a/R ⋆ is completely degenerate with b, and hence that the denominator of Equation <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> is unconstrained. This is often the case for small planets. However, Jupiter-sized planets have high signal-to-noise transits and longer ingress and egress durations (due to the large size of the planet). See §2.1 of FQV08 for an analysis of how the precision of Kepler data affects constraints on the total, ingress, and egress durations.</p><p>Furthermore, even if the ingress is unresolved or poorly resolved, it is often impossible for the impact parameter b to account for the short duration of a highly eccentric, Jupiter-sized planet's non-grazing transit. The maximum non-grazing impact parameter is 1 − R P /R ⋆ 0.9 for a Jupiter around a Sun-like star. Imagine that an eccentric planet transits at zero impact parameter (i.e. travels across 2R p + 2R ⋆ ) at speed g. If we instead assume that planet is transiting at its circular speed g = 1 across the short chord of length</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(2 (R ⋆ + R p ) 2 − (b large enough R ⋆ ) 2 )</formula><p>, the required impact parameter would be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">b large enough ≈ (1 + δ 1/2 ) 1 − 1/g 2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>For g = 2.38 (corresponding to e = 0.7, ω = 90 • ) and δ 1/2 = R p /R ⋆ = 0.1, b would need to be ≈ 0.998, which would be inconsistent with a non-grazing transit. In contrast, a planet with R p /R ⋆ = 0.01 would have b large enough ≈ 0.917, consistent with the b &lt; 0.99 necessary for a non-grazing transit. We note this effect simply to highlight a constraint that arises naturally when fitting a <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> transit model to a light curve. Additionally, with a properly binned model (as discussed in Kipping 2010b, who advocates resampling the data times, computing a model light curve, and then smoothing to match the data cadence), multiple transits allow for constraints on the ingress and egress, even if they are poorly resolved in a single transit. We demonstrate eccentricity measurements using longcadence data in §4.2.</p><p>Another concern regards the degeneracy of a/R ⋆ and b with the limb-darkening parameters. Limb darkening causes the shape of the transit to be rounded instead of flat, potentially causing confusion between the full transit and the ingress/egress. However, in practice we find that it makes little difference whether we freely vary the limb darkening parameters or impose a normal prior based on the stellar parameters (e.g. the coefficients computed for the Kepler bandpass by Sing 2010). FQV08 also find that limb darkening does not have a significant effect on the other parameters, as demonstrated through tests on simulated light curves (see FQV08 §2.1 and FQV08 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>Finally, one might worry about dilution by light from a nearby or background star blended with the target star (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Johnson et al. 2011</ref> for a Kepler example). Dilution would cause R p /R ⋆ to appear too small. Consider the impact that dilution would have on the derived parameters of an eccentric planet transiting near periapse. The ingress and egress durations would be longer than expected, and the inferred maximum impact parameter to avoid a grazing orbit (i.e. 1 − R p /R ⋆ ) would be too large. Both of these effects would caused the planet's orbit to appear less eccentric (or, equivalently, for ρ circ to appear smaller; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kipping &amp; Tinetti 2010</ref> for a formal derivation of the effect of blending on the measurement of a/R ⋆ ). Therefore, dilution would not cause us to overestimate a planet's eccentricity, if the transit duration is shorter that circular. Moreover, because ρ circ depends only weakly on the transit depth (Equation 7), the effect of blending on the eccentricity measurement is small. We quantify this effect through an example in the next subsection.</p><p>Furthermore, if we were to mistakenly attribute an apparently overly-long transit caused by blending to a planet transiting near apoapse, the resulting false eccentricity would be quite small. Imagine that the planet is on a circular orbit, but that the blend causes us to mea-</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">sure ρ circ = (1 − f )ρ ⋆ , where 0 &lt; f ≪ 1. The inferred g would be g = [ρ circ /ρ ⋆ ] 1/3 ≈ 1 − f /3</formula><p>, very close to the true g = 1 of the circular orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Constraints on eccentricity</head><p>From Equation 6, it might appear that e and ω are inextricably degenerate for a single transiting planet. Certainly, if ρ circ is consistent with ρ ⋆ , any eccentricity is consistent with the transit observables. However, a nominal value of ρ ⋆ smaller than ρ circ translates to a minimum eccentricity e min , the value obtained by assuming the planet transits at periapse (ω = 90 • ; see also <ref type="bibr">Barnes 2007, §3;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kane et al. 2012, §4)</ref>. Conversely, a value of ρ ⋆ larger than ρ circ corresponds to an e min obtained by assuming the planet transits at apoapse (ω = −90 • ). Therefore, we can easily identify planets with large eccentricities. A full MCMC exploration provides a confidence interval that shrinks as e → 1, as we discuss in detail in §3. For example, consider a planet with an eccentricity of 0.9 that transits at semilatus rectum (ω = 0). Based on the transit light curve observables, we would deduce that it has an eccentricity of at least e min = 0.68. A planet transiting at semilatus rectum with e = 0.98 would have a deduced e min = 0.92. Above the sharp lower limit e min , the eccentricity posterior probability falls off gradually, as we discuss in §3. Note that the e min we have defined here, which assumes we can distinguish between b and ρ circ (i.e. via some constraint on ingress/egress time), is a stronger limit than the minimum eccentricity from the constraint that the transit be non-grazing (which we discussed in §2.1).</p><p>Returning to the issue of contamination by blending (discussed in §2.1), consider a transit with g = 2.5 and thus e min = 0.724. If the transit depth were diluted by a factor 2 of 0.9 by an undetected second star in the photometric aperture, we would measure g = 0.9 1/4 2.5 = 2.435 and infer nearly the same minimum eccentricity of e min = 0.711. Finally, imagine that some of the constraint on g measured from the light curve came from the non-grazing shape of the transit, implying an impact parameter greater than 1 − R p /R ⋆ . If the R p /R ⋆ measured from the diluted transit curve were 0.1, the inferred maximum impact parameter would be 0.9. If the true R p /R ⋆ is 5% larger, then the maximum impact parameter should be 0.895. This translates into a negligible effect on the constraint on g.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we plot ρ circ as a function of ω. Centered at ω = 90 • is a broad range of ω for which ρ circ would be quite high. For example, for e = 0.9, ρ circ would be erroneously high by a factor of 10-100 for −3 • &lt; ω &lt; 183 • , over half the possible orientations. Moreover, although the periapses of eccentric planets are intrinsically randomly oriented throughout the galaxy, based on geometry eccentric planets with ω ≈ 90 • are more likely to transit. For example, from a population of planets with e = 0.9 (0.95, 0.99) and a given orbital separation, we would be able to observe <ref type="bibr">19 (39, 199)</ref> times as many transiting at periapse as at apoapse.</p><p>Another happy coincidence is that the true stellar density is unlikely to be higher than the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batalha et al. 2010</ref>) value by a factor of 10. The opposite situation is common; a star identified as being on the main sequence may actually be a low-density subgiant or giant (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mann et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, Dressing et al. 2012</ref>. Conversely, there are not many stars with the density of lead. Even when precise measurements of the stellar density are unavailable, our basic knowledge of stellar structure and evolution often allows for constraints on the eccentricity. If there exists a population of highly-eccentric Jupiter-sized planets, many of them will be identifiable from the light curve alone, i.e. we would deduce a large e min . For a large range of periapse angles, one would infer a density much larger than the nominal value if one modeled the eccentric planet's orbit as circular.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION</head><p>Through an MCMC exploration-in our case implemented in the Transit Analysis Package software (TAP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gazak et al. 2011</ref>)-we can not only determine e min but impose even tighter constraints on a planet's eccentricity. For example, in §2 we stated that a candidate whose circular density is consistent with the nominal value could have any eccentricity (i.e. for any value of eccentricity, there is an ω that satisfies g(e, ω) = 1). However, for g ∼ 1, the eccentricity posterior marginalized over ω will be dominated by low eccentricity values, even with a flat prior on the eccentricity. For example, if e = 0, any value of ω will satisfy g = 1, whereas only a small range of ω allow for g = 1 and e &gt; 0.9. Thus, because we expect planetary periapses to be distributed isotropically in the galaxy, a deduced g = 1 is most likely to truly correspond to a planet with a low eccentricity. By the same argument, the eccentricity posterior corresponding to a measured g = 1 will peak just above e min .</p><p>Of course, the transit probability also affects the eccentricity posterior distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burke 2008)</ref>: an eccentric orbit with a periapse pointed towards us (ω = 90 • ) is geometrically more likely to transit than a circular orbit or an eccentric orbit whose apoapse is pointed towards us. We will discuss how an MCMC exploration automatically accounts for the transit probability later in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Monte Carlo simulation of expected eccentricity</head><p>and ω posteriors To calibrate our expectations for the output of a more sophisticated MCMC parameter exploration, we first perform a Monte Carlo simulation to generate predicted posterior distributions of e vs. ω via the following steps:</p><p>1. We begin by generating a uniform grid of e and ω, equivalent to assuming a uniform prior on each of these parameters.</p><p>2. Then we calculate g(e, ω) (Equation 4) for each point (e, ω) on the grid.</p><p>3.

We generate a uniform random number between 0 and 1 and discard the point if the random number is greater than the transit probability.</p><p>4. We calculate the periapse distance a R⋆ (1 − e) for each grid point and drop the point if the planet's periapse would be inside the star (effectively imposing a physically-motivated maximum eccentricity, which is most constraining for small a/R ⋆ ).</p><p>5. We downsample to a subset of grid points that follows a normal distribution centered on g, with a width of σ g /g = 0.1, corresponding to a 30% uncertainty in the stellar density. To do this, we calculate the probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">prob g = 1 σ g √ 2π exp − [g(e, ω) − g] 2 2σ 2 g<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and discard the point (e, ω) if a uniform random number is greater than prob g .</p><p>We plot the resulting posterior e vs. ω distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> for two a/R ⋆ , one large and one small, and R p = 0.1. The banana shape of the posterior results from the correlation between e and ω (i.e. Equation 4).</p><p>The posteriors reveal that, rather than being inextricably entwined with ω, the eccentricities deduced from g are well constrained. A ρ circ consistent with the nominal value (g = 1 with ρ ⋆ constrained to within 30%) is more likely to correspond to a small e (e.g. the probability that e &lt; 0.32 is 68.3% for a/R ⋆ = 10 and that e &lt; 0.35 is 68.3% for a/R ⋆ = 300), while circular densities inconsistent with the normal values (g significantly different from unity) have a well-defined minimum e, above which the eccentricity posterior falls off gently. For example, for g = 2.5 and a/R ⋆ = 300, the probability that e &gt; 0.69 is 99%. Furthermore, the eccentricity is likely to be close to this minimum eccentricity because the range of possible ω narrows as e → 1. For g = 2.5 and a/R ⋆ = 300, the probability that 0.69 &lt; e &lt; 0.89 is 95%.</p><p>Next we explore how the uncertainty in ρ ⋆ affects the eccentricity posterior, quantifying how "loose" this prior constraint can be. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we plot eccentricity contours using a/R* = 30 for g = 1 (i.e. consistent with circular; bottom) and g = 2.5 (top) for five values of σ ρ⋆ /ρ ⋆ assuming a normal distribution and that σ g /g = 1 3 σ ρ⋆ /ρ ⋆ . For g = 2.5, the measured eccentricity is always e = 0.79; it has an uncertainty of +0. for σ ρ⋆ /ρ ⋆ = 0.5. Thus for full, ingress, and egress durations consistent with circular, a tighter constraint on the stellar density allows for a stronger upper limit on the eccentricity. However, even for a very poorly constrained ρ ⋆ , the posterior reveals that the eccentricity is most likely to be small.</p></div>

The first term under the integral is the likelihood of the data given e, ω, ρ ⋆ and X. Thus a uniform prior on both these quantities naturally accounts for the transit probability because prob(D|e, ω, ρ ⋆ , X) is the transit probability; for certain values of e and ω, the observed transit D is more likely to occur. Combinations of parameters that produce no transits are poor models, resulting in a low likelihood of the data. Evaluation of the likelihood prob(D|e, ω, ρ ⋆ , X) is part of how we obtain the parameter posteriors through an MCMC exploration, the details of which we describe in the next subsection.</p><p>Finally, we can marginalize over ω to obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">prob(e|D) ∝ prob(D|e, ω, ρ ⋆ , X)prob(ρ ⋆ )dXdρ ⋆ dω<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Thus, although stellar density, eccentricity, and ω depend degenerately on light curve properties (Equation 6), a Bayesian approach to parameter space exploration translates a loose prior on the stellar density, prob(ρ ⋆ ), and uniform priors on the intrinsic planetary values of eccentricity and ω, into a tight constraint on the planet's eccentricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Obtaining the eccentricity posterior through an</head><p>MCMC sampling method When performing light curve fits with eccentric orbital models, it is essential to use an MCMC sampling method, or some other algorithm for which the time spent in each region of parameter space is proportional to the probability. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bowler et al. (2010)</ref> ( §3) for a helpful description of the MCMC method. The MCMC method can be used to minimize the χ 2 (in the limit of uniform priors and Gaussian noise) or to maximize whatever likelihood function is most appropriate given one's prior knowledge. In our case, we impose a normal prior on ρ ⋆ and account for red noise using a wavelet-based model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carter &amp; Winn 2009</ref>. Obtaining the eccentricity posterior through an MCMC sampling method offers several advantages:</p><p>1. It naturally allows for marginalization over all values of ω. For example, in the case of a circular density near the nominal value (g ∼ 1), the chain will naturally spend more time at low eccentricities, for which a large range of ω provide a good fit, than at high eccentricities, for which only a narrow range of ω provide a good fit.</p><p>2.

The black (gray, light gray) contours represent the {68.3, 95, 99}% probability density levels (i.e. 68% of the posterior is contained within the black contour). Over-plotted as a black-and-white dotted line are histograms illustrating the eccentricity posterior probability distribution marginalized over ω.</p><p>of the distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> and 3 have banana shapes, which often cause conventional chisquared minimization algorithms to remain stuck in the region of parameter space where they began. In contrast, an MCMC exploration will eventually fully sample the posterior distribution. (See Chib &amp; Greenberg 1995, for a pedagogical proof of this theorem.) Because of the "banana-shaped" e vs. ω posterior for high eccentricities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2  and 3)</ref>, conventional MCMC algorithms, like TAP, require many iterations to converge and fully explore parameter space. In our case, we test for convergence by plotting e and ω each as a function of chain link and assess if the exploration appears random. We also check to ensure that the ω posterior is symmetric about ω = 90 • . Asymmetry indicates that the chains have not yet converged. We note that the variables e cos ω and e sin ω also have a banana-shaped posterior. When feasible, we recommend implementing an affine-invariant code such as emcee that more efficiently explores banana-shaped posteriors (e.g. Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mackey et al. 2012</ref>). In §3.3.1, we describe how to speed up the fit convergence by using g instead of e as a variable while maintaining a uniform prior in e and ω.</p><p>3. It allows us to easily impose priors on certain parameters, such as the stellar density. If desired, one can impose a prior on the eccentricity. In §4, we perform an additional fit for each dataset using a Jeffrey's 3 prior on the eccentricity, which is appro- <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We use a true Jeffrey's prior prob(e) ∝ 1/e, which we have not normalized because we only consider the ratio of probabilities when assessing a jump in an MCMC chain. For the fits in Section 4, for which e min is well above 0, this prior is sufficient. However, if e = 0 is a possibility (i.e. for g near 1), the reader may wish to use a modified Jeffrey's prior, prob(e) ∝ 1/(e + e 0 ), where e 0 is the noise level. We recommend estimating an upper limit on g priate if we wish to avoid assumptions about the magnitude of the eccentricity. Here we implement the prior through regularization (i.e. as an extra term in the jump probability).</p></div>

It provides uncertainties that are more reliable than the estimates based on a simple covariance matrix (as obtained from traditional least-squares minimization) because there is no assumption that the uncertainties are normally distributed.

Note that g(e, ω) can either be computed from the approximation in Equation (4) or by solving and integrating Kepler's equation to obtain the mean ratio of the transiting planet's velocity to its Keplerian velocity over the course of the transit. The second term is the prior on ρ ⋆ from the stellar parameters independently measured from spectroscopy (or asteroseismology).

The four sets of posteriors closely resemble one another. The computation times were about 1 day for the circular fit, about 1 day for the eccentric fit using g as a parameter, several days for the eccentric fit using e as a parameter, and thirty minutes for the likelihood maximization method of §3.4. Note that the final method requires the best-fitting parameters resulting from a circular fit to the light curve, including accurate parameter posteriors. We therefore caution against using the parameters listed in the Kepler public data releases for this purpose because those values are the result of a least-squares fit and make the assumption of normally distributed parameter uncertainties. However, if one has already precomputed circular fits using an MCMC algorithm that incorporates red noise and limb darkening-as we have done for all of the Jupiter-sized KOIs ( §5)-the final method ( §3.4) is advantageous because of the decreased computation time.  Based on the circular fit alone, we would infer g(e min , π/2) = 2.0, corresponding to a minimum eccentricity of e min = 0.61.

He demonstrated that by binning a finelysampled model to match the cadence of the data, as TAP has implemented, one can fit accurate (though less precise than from short cadence data) light curve parameters. Using short and long cadence Kepler data of a planet with known parameters (TrES-2-b), he validated this approach.</p><p>Here we explore, through a test scenario of an eccentric planet injected into short and long Kepler data, whether this approach holds (as one would expect) for fitting an eccentric orbit and what value short-cadence data adds to the constraint on eccentricity.

We considered the situation in which long cadence data is available for Q0-Q6 but short-cadence is available only for one quarter (or may be in the future). We retrieved Q0-Q6 data from the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (MAST) for Kepler target star KIC 2306756, selected because it has both long and short cadence data.

In both cases, we allowed the limb darkening to be a free parameter. We plot the resulting posterior distributions of eccentricity and ω in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. From the circular fits, the constraint on ρ circ is somewhat stronger from the short cadence data <ref type="bibr">(26.</ref> with a Jeffrey's prior. Therefore, the long cadence data is sufficient to obtain a precise eccentricity measurement. In this case, the 20% uncertainty in the stellar density dominated over the constraint from the transit light curve on ρ circ ; however, for very well-constrained stellar properties, we would expect the greater precision of the short cadence data to allow for a tighter constraint on the eccentricity (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>

To estimate the stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, we use the SpecMatch code, which searches through the CPS's vast library of stellar spectra for stars with Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Valenti &amp; Fischer 2005</ref>) parameters and finds the best matches. The final values are the weighted mean of the 10 best matches. We then interpolate these stellar parameters onto the Padova stellar evolution tracks to obtain a stellar mass and radius. We checked these values using the empirical relationships of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Torres et al. (2010)</ref>. We find ρ ⋆ = 1.02 +0.45 −0.29 ρ ⊙ (the other stellar parameters for this KOI and parameters for other KOI will be published as part of another work, <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. 2012, in prep)</ref>.</p><p>We then fit circular and eccentric orbits to the transit light curve, as described above, binning the model light curves to match the 30-minute cadence of the data. We impose a normal prior on the limb-darkening coefficients based on the values from Sing (2010). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows posterior distributions from a circular fit (top row) and an eccentric fit (bottom row) with a prior imposed on the stellar density. We measure the eccentricity to be e = 0.62 +0.18 −0.14 . We caution that this candidate has not yet been validated; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Morton &amp; Johnson (2011)</ref> estimate a falsepositive probability of 8%. If the candidate is a false positive, its orbit (and other properties, such as its radius) is likely to be different from that inferred. However, we note that if the candidate is a background binary or hierarchical triple and is actually larger than a planet, the inferred eccentricity would actually be higher (i.e. if the candidate is actually larger, it must be moving through its ingress and egress even faster), unless KOI 686 is not the primary and the primary has a higher density than KOI 686. Another possibility, if the candidate is false positive, is that the assumption of M p ≪ M ⋆ may no longer hold and ρ • (Equation 6) should be compared to ρ ⋆ + ρ companion rather than ρ s tar to obtain g. However, even if ρ companion ∼ ρ ⋆ , the error in g would be only ( 1 2 ) 3 = 12.5%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Santerne et al. (2012)</ref> recently found a false positive rate of 35% for Jupiter-sized candidates, comprised of brown dwarfs, undiluted eclipsing binaries, and diluted eclipsing binaries. In the case of diluted eclipsing binaries, the blend effects that we discussed in §2 could be larger than we considered. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Morton (2012)</ref> notes that most of the false positives that Santerne et al. (2012) discovered through radial-velocity follow-up already exhibited V-shapes or faint secondary eclipses in their light curves. In the search for highly eccentric Jupiters, we recommend a careful inspection of the transit light curve for false-positive signatures and, when possible, a single spectroscopic observation and adaptiveoptics imaging to rule out false-positive scenarios.</p><p>If the planetary nature of this object is confirmed, it will be one of a number of Jupiter-sized planets with orbital periods of 10-100 days and moderate eccentricities, but the first in the Kepler sample with a photometrically-measured eccentricity. Many previously known, moderately-eccentric planets have orbits inside the snow line; their eccentricities are thought to be signatures of the dynamical process(es) that displaced them from their region of formation. 0.7 0.8 0.9 e <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Posterior distributions of e and ω for an injected, artificial transit, with eccentricity fixed at 0 (panel 1) and free to vary (panel 2-3).

To identify planets that must be highly eccentric, we are refitting the Kepler light curves of all the Jupiter-sized candidates using the TAP. Initially, we fix the candidate's eccentricity at 0. We identify candidates whose posteriors for ρ circ are wildly different than the nominal value ρ ⋆ from the KIC. From this subset of objects, we obtain spectra of the host stars. We refine the stellar parameters using SpecMatch, interpolate them onto the Padova stellar evolution tracks to obtain a stellar mass and radius, and check the inferred M ⋆ and R ⋆ using the empirical relationships of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Torres et al. (2010)</ref>. We validate the candidate using the method outlined in Morton (2012). Finally, we refit the transit light curves with a prior imposed on the stellar density, this time allowing the eccentricity to vary. This process will allow to us easily identify the most unambiguous highly-eccentric hot Jupiters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Measuring a transiting planet's orbital eccentricity was once solely the province of radial-velocity observations. Short-period planets were discovered by transits and followed-up with RVs, which sometimes revealed a sizable eccentricity (e.g. HAT-P-2b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakos et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">CoRoT-10b, Bonomo et al. 2010</ref>). Long-period planets-which, based on the RV distribution, are more commonly eccentric-were discovered by radial-velocity measurements and, on lucky occasions, found to transit (e.g. HD 17156 b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fischer et al. 2007</ref>, the planet discussed in §4.1, as well as HD 806066 b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Naef et al. 2001)</ref>. But now, from its huge, relatively unbiased target sample size of 150,000 stars, Kepler has discovered a number of long-period, transiting candidates. Among these are likely to be a substantial number of eccentric planets (S12), which have enhanced transit probabilities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kane et al. 2012</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kipping et al. (2012)</ref> are employing MAP to measure the eccentricities of planets in systems in which multiple planets transits. Here we have demonstrated that it is also possible to constrain an individual planet's eccentricity from a set of high signal-to-noise transits using a Bayesian formalism that employs relatively loosely-constrained priors on the stellar density. The technique we have presented can be applied to any transit light curve, as we did in §4.1, for HD 17156 b using ground-based photometry. Comparing this technique to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kipping et al. (2012)</ref>'s MAP, MAP is more model independent -requiring no knowledge at all of the stellar density -but our technique is applicable to single transiting planets, as Jupiter-sized Kepler candidates tend to be (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Latham et al. 2011</ref>). We are the process of fitting the orbits of all Jupiter-sized Kepler candidates, which will lead to the following prospects:</p><p>1. For candidates with host stars too faint for RV follow-up (65% of candidates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. 2011</ref> are fainter than Kepler magnitude 14), our technique will provide an estimate of the planet's eccentricity. We may also be able to deduce the presence of companions from transit timing variations, thereby allowing us to search for "smoking gun" perturbers that may be responsible for the inner planet's orbital configuration. In a companion paper ( <ref type="bibr">Dawson et al. 2012</ref>, in prep), we present the validation and characterization of a KOI with a high, photometrically-measured eccentricity and transit timing variations.</p><p>2. For candidates bright enough for follow-up RV measurements, the eccentricity and ω posteriors from photometric fits allow us to make just a few optimally timed radial velocity measurements to pinpoint the planet's eccentricity, the mass and host-star density, instead of needing to devote precious telescope time to sampling the full orbital period. The tight constraints on eccentricity from photometry alone can be combined with radialvelocity measurements to constrain the candidate's orbit-either by fitting both datasets simultaneously or by using the posteriors from the photometry as priors for fitting a model to the RVs. To maximize the information gain, the prior on the stellar density should remain in place. This serves as an additional motivation for measuring the spectroscopic properties of candidate host stars in the Kepler field.</p><p>3. We can also measure the spin-orbit angles of the candidates orbiting the brightest stars with Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements. Then we can compare the distribution of spin-orbit angles of those planets we have identified as eccentric with the distribution of those we have constrained to be most likely circular. 4. S12 argue that HEM mechanisms for producing hot Jupiters should also produce a population of highly eccentric (e &gt; 0.9) proto hot Jupiters and predict that we should find 3-5 in the Kepler sample. Moreover, Kepler 's continuous coverage may offer the best prospect for detecting highly eccentric planets, against which RV surveys are biased ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jones et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">O'Toole et al. 2009</ref>). In §5, we described our process for distilling highly-eccentric Jupiters from the Kepler sample. The Kepler sample has already revealed a wealth of information about the dynamics and architectures of planetary systems (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>) but primarily for closely-packed systems of low mass, multiple-transiting planets. Measuring the eccentricities of individual, Jupiter-sized planets in the Kepler will allow us to investigate a different regime: planetary systems made up of massive planets that potentially underwent violent, mutual gravitational interactions followed by tidal interactions with the host star. presented in this paper were obtained from the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (MAST).
