				<p>Context. The high number of planet discoveries made in the last years provides a good sample for statistical analysis, leading to some clues on the distributions of planet parameters, like masses and periods, at least in close proximity to the host star. We likely need to wait for the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) to have an overall view of the extrasolar planetary systems. Those facilities will finally ensure an overlap of the discovery space of direct and indirect techniques, which is desirable to completely understand the nature of the discovered objects, obtaining both orbital parameters and physical characterization. Aims. In this context it would be useful to have a tool that can be used for the interpretation of the present results obtained with various observing techniques, and also to predict what the outcomes would be of the future instruments. Methods. For this reason we built MESS: a Monte Carlo simulation code which uses either the results of the statistical analysis of the properties of discovered planets, or the results of the planet formation theories, to build synthetic planet populations fully described in terms of frequency, orbital elements and physical properties. They can then be used to either test the consistency of their properties with the observed population of planets given different detection techniques (radial velocity, imaging and astrometry) or to actually predict the expected number of planets for future surveys, as well as to optimize the future multi-techniques observations for their characterization down to telluric masses. Results. In addition to the code description, we present here some of its applications to actually probe the physical and orbital properties of a putative companion within the circumstellar disk of a given star and to test constrain the orbital distribution properties of a potential planet population around the members of the TW Hydrae association. Finally, using in its predictive mode, the synergy of future space and ground-based telescopes instrumentation has been investigated to identify the mass-period parameter space that will be probed in future surveys for giant and rocky planets</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many statistical studies have been done using information coming from more than a decade of extensive searches for exoplanets, trying to answer questions either related to the properties of those objects, such as the mass, orbital period and eccentricity <ref type="bibr">(Lineweaver &amp; Grether 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>, or about the relevance of the host star characteristics (mass, metallicity and binarity) on the final frequency and distribution of planetary systems (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Johnson et al. 2007</ref>). Since the most successful techniques (radial velocity and transit) have focused on the inner (≤ 5 AU) environment of main sequence solar-type stars, most of the available information on the frequency of planets concern this class of stars.</p><p>Recent discoveries of young distant planetary mass objects with direct imaging (see e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Marois et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kalas et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lagrange et al. 2008</ref>) are giving us a first hint on the po-⋆ www.messthecode.com ⋆⋆ send offprint requests to bonavita@astro.utoronto.ca tential of the direct detections in the exploration of the outer region of the planetary systems, also raising many questions about how such objects could form (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Absil &amp; Mawet 2009)</ref>. This defines the niche of the next generation high contrast imaging instruments like the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI: <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Macintosh et al. 2007</ref>) and VLT/SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>). These instruments will likely allow us to extend such a systematic characterization to larger scales (≥ 10 AU). Due to practical limitations (inner working angle, best contrast achievable), these instrument will focus on warm giant planets on orbits far away from their stars, paving the path for the ELTs facilities. A wide range of planetary masses and separations, down to the rocky planets (and, in very favourable cases reaching the habitable zone), will be explored with 30-40 meter-class telescopes, finally allowing an overlap between the discovery spaces of direct and indirect techniques.</p><p>In this context it is useful and crucial to predict the performances of the forthcoming instruments, not only in terms of number of expected detections, but also trying to figure out what will be the explored parameter space and even the possible synergies between different discovery techniques.</p><p>Here we present our Monte Carlo simulation code MESS, whose aim is to provide a flexible and reliable tool for the statistical analysis and prediction of the results of planet searches.</p><p>It produces synthetic planet populations, deriving all the physical parameters of these planets together with the observables that can be compared with the predicted capabilities of existing or planned instruments. Such comparisons allow to derive subsets of fully characterized detectable planets, as well as a snapshot of what the evolution of the sample of detected planets would be in the next years.</p><p>A detailed description of the code, and of all the assumptions which constitute its basis, is given in Sect. 2, while in Sect. 3 we present the different operation modes of the code and their applications. Although the MESS has been built, and it has been so far applied, only to analyze and/or predict the results of direct imaging surveys, an extension of the code to different techniques is planned. The first attempt in this direction are presented in Sec. 3.3. Conclusions and suggestions for further work will be finally drawn in Sect. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MESS (Multi-purpose Exoplanet Simulation System)</head><p>Over the past years, several groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lafrenì ere et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chauvin et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nielsen &amp; Close 2010)</ref> initiated statistical analysis to constrain the physical and orbital properties (mass, period, eccentricity distributions) of the giant planet population at large separations. They developed statistical analysis tools appropriate to exploit the performances of deep imaging surveys. They also tested the consistency of various sets of parametric distributions of planet properties, using the specific case of a null detection. The first assumption of these tools is that planet mass and period distributions coming from the statistical results of RV studies at short period (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Lineweaver &amp; Grether 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>) can be extrapolated and normalized to obtain information on more distant planets. Despite the model-dependency on the mass predictions, the approach is attractive for exploiting the complete set of detection performances of the survey and characterizing the outer portions of exo-planetary systems. With all of this in mind, we tried to go a step further, creating a Multi-purpose Exo-planet Simulation System (hereafter MESS) to be applied also to other techniques than direct imaging, also using the information coming from the planetary formation theories.</p><p>The code is written in IDL and can be downloaded from www.messthecode.com</p><p>The basics operations performed by the code are the following:</p><p>1. it generates a synthetic population of planets, including all the orbital elements, either using the planet mass and period distributions coming from the statistical results of RV studies or the outcome of the planetary formation theories. 2. taking into account the characteristics of the host star and of the planetary orbit, it calculates all the observable quantities needed for the comparison with the instrument performances, such as radial velocity (RV) and astrometric signal, planet/star contrast, degree of polarization, etc. 3. given the detection capability relation of an instrument, either already available or planned, it selects a sub-sample of fully characterized detectable planets, which characteristics can then be analyzed.</p><p>The code then assumes a given star population, a planet population with associated physical and orbital properties based on a theoretical or semi-empirical approach, the corresponding observables for different observing techniques, finally generate a synthetic population of planets to be compared with the instrumental detection performances. Each step is described hereafter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Star population</head><p>The first input of the MESS is a sample of N Star stars, which have been targeted for planet searches or which are part of a sample for future observations. Various stellar parameters are assumed to be known, such as the apparent magnitude, the distance, the luminosity, the spectral type, the mass, the age, the metallicity, etc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows the characteristics of a sample of 600 nearby (d &lt; 20 pc) stars selected from the Hipparcos catalogue <ref type="bibr">(Perryman &amp; ESA 1997)</ref> and used to build the synthetic population showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Binarity module</head><p>MESS also gives the possibility of taking into account the presence of one (or more) additional stellar companions, in the analysis. If a star in the sample is flagged as binary, the code uses the information about the binary orbit (if available) to compute the critical semi-major axis for the dynamical stability of the system. This set the limiting value that the semi-major axis of a planet can attain and still maintain its orbital stability, as a function of the mass-ratio and orbital elements of the binary, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref>.</p><p>Both the case of circumstellar (or Satellite S-type) and circumbinary (or Planet P-type) orbit are considered, and the critical semi-major axis is computed using Eq. 1 and 2 respectively, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a c /a b = 0.464 − 0.38 µ − 0.361 e b + 0.586 µ e b + 0.150 µ 2 − 0.198 µ e 2 b (1) a c /a b = 1.60 + 4.12 µ + 5.10 e b − 4.27 µ e b + − 5.09 µ 2 − 2.22 e 2 b + 4.61e 2 b µ 2 (2)</formula><p>In both the equations, a c is critical semi-major axis , µ = M 1 /(M 1 + M 2 ), a b and e b are the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the binary, and M 1 and M 2 are the masses of the primary and secondary stars, respectively. If not available from literature, the eccentricity is assumed to be e b = 0.36, reported as mean value for the eccentricity of a binary system, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Duquennoy &amp; Mayor (1991)</ref>. In case the value of the semi-major axis is not available, then the code estimates it as a b = 1.31 ρ (arcsec) d (pc) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Duquennoy &amp; Mayor 1991)</ref> 1 .</p><p>Note that in the first case (S-type orbit), a c set the maximum value that the semi-major axis of a planet can assume, before compromising the stability, while it represents the minimum value of the semi-major axis of a stable planet, in the case of a P-type orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Planet population</head><p>The core of the code is the generation of the synthetic planets, that are fully characterized, both in terms of orbital parameter, and physical characteristics. Depending on the goal of the study one can choose between a Semi-empirical approach or a Theoretical Approach. These different approaches makes the code suitable to constraint the planet properties under different assumptions, but also to test model predictions. If the Theoretical Approach is chosen, masses and period values selected from a synthetic population provided by the output of the planetary formation models (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mordasini et al. 2009</ref>) are given as input. In this case all the orbital characteristics are also provided, together with the physical properties of each planet, so no random generation is needed, and the code only evaluates the observable and compares them to the provided detectability relations. Different populations of planets obtained assuming different stellar masses and metallicity values can be selected according with the characteristics of the real star in the sample, to take into account the effects of the stellar characteristics on the planet formation processes. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> .</p><p>The Semi-empirical Approach uses the power law distributions in Eq. 3 and 4 for the mass and semi-major axis of the planets as retrieved from the statistical analysis of the properties of the planets discovered so far to generate a seed population of N seed values of masses and periods (see Sec. 2.2.1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dN d M p ∝ M p α (3) dN dP ∝ P β<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The user can also set a pre-determined grid of massesperiods and feed it to the code, without any assumption on the distributions. This would be the case if, for example, boundaries on the mass/semi-major axis space where planets can form are to be set using the outcomes of a formation model(see e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mordasini et al. 2010)</ref>, excluding from the sample the planets not compatible with the theory.</p><p>If the Semi-empirical approach is used, mass, orbital parameters, as well as temperature and radius of the planets, are obtained based on the assumption described in the next sections</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Mass-period seed generation</head><p>If the semi-empirical approach is chosen, the power law distributions are fed to the Monte-Carlo core of the code, that randomly generates a fixed number of mass-period pairs. Both the planetary mass and period ranges can be given as inputs, together with the power-law exponents. In a typical setup, the power-law exponents are assumed to be α = −1.31 and β = −0.74 respectively, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref>. The planetary masses span the range between 0.6 M Earth and 15 M Jup , and the periods (P) are chosen between 2.5 days and 350 years (corresponding to 50 AU for 1 M ⊙ star).</p><p>A scaling of the planetary mass, and even of the period, with the stellar mass can be also introduced, according to recent results (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lovis &amp; Mayor 2007)</ref>. In addition, a dependence of the planet frequency on the stellar metallicity may also be considered (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Evaluation of the orbital parameters</head><p>For each mass-period pair in the seed generation, the code evaluates the semi-major axis computed using Kepler's third law, using the mass of each star in the input sample. Then, it generates N gen values of all the orbital parameters: eccentricity (e), inclination (i), longitude of periastron (ω), longitude of ascending node (Ω), and time of periastron passage (T 0 ). By default, all these parameters are randomly generated following an uniform distribution <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The eccentricity distribution is cut at e = 0.6 as suggested by the results of the RV surveys (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>. This also allows to control possible bias towards high eccentricity planets that could affect the results of Direct Imaging surveys. A full discussion of the impact of the eccentricity distribution on the simulations results is held in Sec. 3.4.</p><p>The date of observation is also required. If not available from the real data, an epoch of observation, t obs , is generated over a time-span chosen according with the considered instrument.</p><p>The code also offers the possibility to fix each orbital parameter to known or predicted values, for all the planets in the population.</p><p>The coordinates, x and y, of the projected orbit on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight, are finally computed using the ephemeris formulae of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heintz (1978)</ref>, reported in Eq. 5 to 7.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x = AX + FY (5) y = BX + GY X = cos E − e (6) Y = √ 1 − e 2 sin E ρ = x 2 + y 2 (7)</formula><p>where X and Y are the coordinates of the orbit (Eq. 6), ρ is the projected separation, and A, B, F, G are the Thiele-Innes elements, which can be obtained from the classical ones (the semimajor axis a, ω, Ω, and i) using Eq. 8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A = a (cos ω cos Ω − sin ω sin Ω cos i) B = a (cos ω sin Ω + sin ω cos Ω cos i) (8) F = a (− sin ω cos Ω − cos ω sin Ω cos i) G = a (− sin ω sin Ω + cos ω cos Ω cos i) .</formula><p>In these equations, E is the eccentric anomaly (obtained from the mean anomaly M ( Eq. 9) using Eq. 10) and ν the true anomaly (Eq. 11):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M = t obs − T 0 p 2π (9) E 0 = M + e sin M + e 2 2 sin 2M M 0 = E 0 − e sin E 0 E = E 0 + (M − M 0 )) / (1 − e cos E 0 ) (10) tan ν/2 = (1 + e) / (1 − e) tan E/2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The projected separation, ρ (in arcsec), can be obtained either using Eq. 7 or Eq. 12 (which gives also an estimate of the radius vector: r), then dividing for the star distance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ = r cos (ν + ω) sec (θ − Ω) (12) r = a 1 − e 2 / (1 + e cos ν)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Planet Temperature</head><p>Since we aim at consider both the thermal and reflected flux of the planets, we need two different estimates of the temperature. The first one is the internal temperature, T int , coming from the evolutionary models (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>). The second one is the equilibrium temperature, T eq , obtained through Eq. 13 (from <ref type="bibr">Sudarsky et al. 2003</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T eq = (1 − A B ) L * 16πσa 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where L * is the star luminosity. The Bond albedo A B is assumed to be 0.35 in the J band (Jupiter value, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hanel et al. 1981)</ref> and it is randomly generated between 0.3 and 0.52 in the visible (the latter being the Jupiter albedo in V band,see <ref type="bibr">Sudarsky et al. 2003</ref>) Our final assumed value for the effective temperature of the planet T eff is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T 4 eff = T 4 int + T 4 eq .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>2.2.4. Planet radius MESS uses the approach developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> to evaluate the planetary radius. Practically the radius is assumed to depend on the planet mass, with the following recipes:</p><p>1. For Jupiter-like planets (M ≥ 100M Earth ), an interpolation is performed within the published values given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>. Values of age and distance of each star are entered, yielding a value for R Gas . A core mass of 10M Earth is assumed. </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R = (0.0912 im f + 0.1603)(log M) 2 +(0.3330 im f + 0.7387) log M +(0.4639 im f + 1.1193)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>or:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R = (0.0592 rm f + 0.0975)(log M) 2 +(0.2337 rm f + 0.4938) log M +(0.3102 rm f + 0.7932)<label>(16)</label></formula><p>for ice/rock and rock/iron planets, respectively. In these equations, R is in R Earth and M is in M Earth , while im f is the ice mass fraction (1.0 for pure ice and 0.0 for pure rock) and rm f is the rock mass fraction (1.0 for pure rock and 0.0 for pure iron). In the typical MESS setup, the ice/rocky or rocky/iron fraction is set to 0.3 (50% of chance for a planet being mainly icy or rocky). 3. Finally, predictions are uncertain for the Neptune-like planets, where the transition between the two relations described above should occur. The most sensible approach seems to be to fit the mass-radius relation of the Solar System in the same mass-range (10 − 40M Earth ). This procedure provides a good agreement with the radii of Uranus and Neptune and of the few transiting Neptunes confirmed so far (as listed by The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia 4 see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>The resulting mass-radius relations are showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, with over-plotted the data corresponding to the planets discovered with the transit technique and the planets from our Solar System, for comparison.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Planet/Star contrast</head><p>MESS gives an estimate of both the intrinsic and reflected flux, in the selected band, for each planet. Throughout the paper we will refer to the planets which luminosity is dominated by the intrinsic contribution as self-luminous or warm planets, as opposed to the cold planets for which the reflected light provides most of the contribution to the planet/star contrast.</p><p>The intrinsic emission is estimated using the prediction of evolutionary models at the age of the star (assumed to be also the age of the system). To this purpose two classes of models can be considered, based on different assumptions on the initial conditions: Hot Start models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chabrier et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref>, which consider an initial spherical contracting state; and Core Accretion models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>), which couple planetary thermal evolution to the predicted core mass and thermal structure of a coreaccretion planet formation model.</p><p>In the following, we only consider the results obtained using the hot start models for the nearby sample. However, the problem of the initial condition and the uncertainties on the stellar ages are among the main limitations, in case of young stellar samples, not only for our code, but also for any kind of study that uses the same kind of approach (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chauvin et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonavita et al. 2010</ref>,for a detailed discussion). These limitations also apply to the theoretical approach, if the evolutionary models are used to evaluate the planet intrinsic luminosity and radii produced by the models, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mordasini et al.

Following the outcomes of Jupiter observations and theoretical models (See e.g. Burrows 2004), we decided to uniformly generate the values of the albedo between 0.2 and 0.7. The code anyways offers the option to fix the value of the albedo to a chosen value, for all the planets in the generation. A test of the impact of the choice of the albedo value on the redults of the simulations is presented in Sec. 3.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Planet population synthesis</head><p>Depending on the purpose of the analysis, the code can generate the planet population in two different ways:</p><p>a) Full population: the value of N seed sets the spacing of the mass-period grid, and for each point on it N gen planets are generated, ending with N seed × N gen planets per each star. The population for each star is saved in an independent file. This approach is useful for the statistical analysis of existing data, since in this case MESS provides the fraction of detectable planets per star, which can be used to derive the global probability of finding a planet over the whole target list. This can be then compared with the real results. b) Reduced population: only one orbit is generated for each point in the mass-period grid. N gen in this case sets the number of planet in a planetary system associated with each star 5 . The final population is then composed by N star × N seed planets, and all the planets are saved together in one file. Then the predicted detection performances of a given instrument can be used, to derive the population of objects that are expected to be detected around each star, if the whole input sample is observed.</p><p>As an example, we generated a reduced population (assuming 5 planets per star) of planets around the stars of the nearby sample described in Sec. 2.1. We choose the semi-empirical approach, and used the typical setup we discussed in Sec. 2.2.1 6 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> shows the position of the planets in the mass vs semimajor axis plane.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Instrument detection performances</head><p>The last step is the comparison of the observables of the generated synthetic planets with the detection limits of different observing techniques, with the possibility to actually combine them. It is important, especially in case of comparative studies,  and since the MESS does not produce the detection limits, to make sure that the detection performances that are fed as input to the code have been estimated by correctly taking into account each instrumental biases, specific to each technique, and the stellar characteristics. In the context of the MESS applications, the code has been extensively used considering two possible inputs for the detection performances: -The 1D mode, which selects the detectable planets using a threshold or a curve giving the lower detection limits (RV, astrometric precisions or contrast performances) as a function of the period, the semi-major axis, the angular separations etc., defined by the instrumental capabilities -The 2D mode, which is especially built for the analysis of the performances of the Deep Imaging instruments. This mode takes advantage from the knowledge of all the orbital elements of the planets, to place them on a two dimensional detection map. This mode allows using all the spatial information stored in the images. Using the whole 2D map not only allows to take into account possible peculiar characteristics of the circumstellar environment, such as the presence of disks, but also prevent to under/overestimate the contrast curve depending on the method chosen for the extraction itself (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonavita et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Applications</head><p>Once the synthetic population of planets has been created, the next step is to compare the characteristics of the generated planets with the detection limits appropriate for the instrument under consideration. MESS offers three different operation modes (OM), depending on which kind of analysis is needed.</p><p>1. The Hybrid Mode (MESS HM) which is the most flexible one, and an be used to probe the physical and orbital properties of a putative companion around one given system based on the combination of different techniques, a priori information on the possible orbit given the presence of other planets or circumstellar disk. 2. The Statistical Analysis Mode (MESS SAM), which is built for the analysis of real data and uses the full population defined in Sect. 2.4. It enables to test different set of planet populations or constrain the maximum occurrence of planets for a given population that would be consistent with the results of detection and/or null-detection of a complete survey of a large target sample. 3. The Predictive Mode (MESS PM), which starts from the reduced population (see Sect. 2.4), and given the predicted performances of a planned instruments, can be used to select the most suitable targets given the science goals of the instrument itself, to test the results of different observing strategies and finally to foresee possible synergies with other instruments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Single object characterization</head><p>The first and more versatile MESS mode is the so-called Hybrid mode. This mode can be used for the study of particularly interesting targets, or to test specific hypothesis. It allows for example to take into account all available informations about the orbit of a planet already discovered around the target, in order to put constraints on the planet generation. A preliminary version of this mode has been used to put constraint on the presence of a planetary companion embedded in the disk surrounding the T-Tauri star LkCa15 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonavita et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>We present here an analogous analysis made for TWA 11. This star has been found to be surrounded by a debris disk by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. Using STIS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> provided a full characterization of the disk geometry, and suggested a possible unseen companion responsible for some of the observed properties. We then decided to use MESS HM to verify which kind of constraints can be put using the VLT-NACO observations of this star.</p><p>A pixel-to-pixel 2D noise map was estimated from the reduced NACO images, using a sliding box of 5 × 5 pixels over the whole FoV. We then considered a 6 σ threshold to build the final detection limit maps to be used for the statistical analysis. These maps were also converted in terms of minimum mass map using the evolutionary model predictions at the age of the system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref> shows an example of the resulting sensitivity map <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . We considered only circular orbits coplanar with the disk, with an inclination and a longitude of the ascending node fixed by the disk properties reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schneider et al.

TWA11 is also known to have a stellar companion at ρ = 7.7 ′′ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jura et al. 1995</ref>). As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>, the value of the outer boundary of the disk is consistent with the presence of the companion. Using Eq. 1 we in fact obtained a value for the critical semi-major axis for the planet stability (a crit ) of about 165 AU. Taking into account these constraints, we set the range of explored semi-major axes to 35-160 AU. The results of our simulations, in terms of non detection probability maps as a function of the companion mass and semi-major axes, are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8</ref>. The disk boundaries are also shown, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schneider et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Estimate of the frequency of giant planets</head><p>A second more general use is to constrain the exoplanet fraction f within the physical separation and mass probed by a survey, in the case of null or positive detections. Contrary to what was assumed before, f becomes an output of the simulation, which actually depends on the assumed (mass, period, eccentricity) distributions of the giant planet population. This statistical analysis aims at determining f , within a confidence range, as a function of mass and semi-major axis, given a set of individual detection probabilities p j directly linked to the detection limits of each star observed during the survey and to the considered giant planet distributions. The probability of planet detection for a survey of N stars can in fact be described by a binomial distribution, given a success probability f p j , with f being the fraction of stars with planets, and p j the individual detection probabilities of detecting a planet if present around the star j. Each individual p j can be replaced by p j , the mean survey detection probability of detecting a planet if present. Finally, assuming that the number of expected detected planets is small compared to the number of stars observed ( f p j &lt;&lt; 1), the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution to derive a simple analytical solution for the exoplanet fraction upper limit f max for a given level of confidence CL: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> shows the results obtained applying this module at the sample of stars listed in Tab. 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f max = − ln (1 − CL) Np j<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Although the significance of our results is not really high, given the small size of the sample, they are still in agreement with the results of the whole analysis presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chauvin et al.

An extensive use of this OM has been made to analyze a sample of massive stars (B-type and early A-type) observed with NIRI, to test the applicability of planet formation by disk instability in those systems. Starting from a uniform mass versus semi-major axis grid with a sampling of 5 AU in semi-major axis and 1 M jup in mass, 10 4 orbits were generated for each grid point. Models of disc instability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bell et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2011,and Klahr et al., in prep.)</ref> were then used to provide boundaries in the mass versus semi-major axis space, within which sub-stellar companions can form by this mechanism. These boundaries were dependent on the stellar properties, and so appropriate values should be used for each target in the sample. The planets falling within the allowed range were subsequently evaluated against the 1D detection limits from the high-contrast images of the survey. In this way, by testing a range of planet distributions within the set boundaries, meaningful limits could be placed on the frequency of planet and brown dwarf formation by disk instability in mas- sive disks. The full analysis is presented in detail in the survey paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Janson et al. 2011</ref>).

In particular we focused on the eccentricity distribution and on the value of the planetary albedo. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eccentricity distribution</head><p>Direct Imaging surveys are, by definition, mostly sensitive to planets in wide orbits. Also, planets on highly eccentric orbits could also be preferred targets, since they are more likely to be found farther out with respect to planets on a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis. This could led to a bias towards high eccentricity planets in our results. As mentioned in Sec. 2.2, the eccentricity distribution of the planets generated by MESS is uniform, and cut at e = 0.6.</p><p>As a further check of the impact of the eccentricity on the DI results, we repeated the analysis of the TWA sample done in Sec. 3.2, by fixing the eccentricity for all the generated planets to a given value. The results are showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref>. The black solid line shows the results of the standard setup, thus with the uniform eccentricity distribution cut at e = 0.6. The red, green, blue, purple and light blue lines show the outcomes of the simulations done by fixing e = 0, e = 0.2, e = 0.4, e = 0.6 and e = 0.8, respectively. As expected, the higher eccentricity values can lead to an higher fraction of detected planets, for a given semi-major axis value.</p><p>This simple exercise shows not only that the standard setup of the MESS does not introduce any systematic bias towards high eccentricity, but also that the code allows us to easily take this kind of biases into account, if they are proven to be real, by changing the simulation parameters.</p><p>As a final remark, it has to be said that the effect of the eccentricity is important only in the case of warm planets, as the ones that could be found around our TWA targets. As the age of the stars increases, the reflected light contribution to the planet contrast becomes more and more important, thus counterbalancing the effect of the eccentricity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Albedo distribution</head><p>As mentioned in Sec. 2.3, the Albedo of the planets in the synthetic population is randomly generated between 0.2 and 0.7. Especially for the cold planets, the value of the albedo can be a critical parameter for the planet detection. We then decided to perform a check to see how big is the impact on the simulation results. With an approach similar to the one used to test the eccentricity effect (see Sec. 3.3.3), we performed different sets of simulation, A λ being the only free parameter. We used an hypothetical G2V star (J =, age = 4.5 Gyrs) at 20 parsecs as target, and the detection limits of EPICS (see Tab. 2).   see Sec. 2.3.1), 0.5 and 0.7 (red, green, blue and purple line, respectively).</p><p>As expected, the fraction of detectable planets is higher for higher albedo, all the other parameters being the same.</p><p>This test confirms that the use of an uniform distribution allow us not to favour planets with high albedo, the results being similar to the one obtained by using the Jupiter value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Summary and conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented MESS (Multi-purpose Exoplanet Simulation System), a Monte Carlo tool for the statistical analysis and prediction of survey results for exoplanets.</p><p>Our aim was to build an extremely versatile code, that could be used to test the outcomes of any instrument/technique for the detection of planets. We consider several assumptions on: -The star population, and how to take into account the properties of each star and their effect on either the characteristics of the planets or the instrument capabilities. The binarity aspects is also included to take into account the possible effects of a stellar companion to the planet formation. -The planet population, providing the complete set of orbital elements and a large number of physical parameters of the planets (radius, temperature, luminosity, etc.), either generated using the information coming from the analysis of the planets confirmed up to now (semi-empirical approach) or using the results of the planet formation theories (theoretical approach). -The predicted observables (luminosity and polarimetric contrast, RV semi-amplitude, astrometric signal) -The synthesis of a planet population, that can be easily adapted to the purpose of the investigation -The final comparison with the detection limits, with the possibility to combine the informations coming from different observing techniques, to select a sub-sample of detectable planets whose characteristics can then be investigated.</p><p>The code is such that each and every one of these assumptions can be released and/or changed. This not only provides a tool which is independent from the models (e.g. the planet formation theory chosen if the theoretical approach is used, or the evolutionary models used to estimate the planet luminosity and radius) but also makes it relevant to test model prediction, as well as to constraint the properties of the known planets under different initial conditions. So far only the Direct Imaging module of the code has been extensively used, but the combination of various techniques is under test and will offer rich perspective for future combined studies of exoplanets.</p><p>Three main applications of the MESS code have been shown:</p><p>1. The Hybrid mode, built for the analysis of single objects, is presented in Sec.3.1. It can be used to probe the physical and orbital properties of a putative companion around a given system based on the combination of different techniques, and possibly a priori information on the orbit given the presence of other planets or of a circumstellar disk.</p><p>2. The SAM mode (Sec.3.2), optimized for the analysis of a large sample of stars, shows its full potential in Sec. 3.2, by providing a detailed statistical analysis of a sample of stars observed with direct imaging. Both the agreement of the observations with the observed parameter distributions (Sec. 3.2.1) and the planet formation theories (Sec. 3.2.3) are tested, using the semi-empirical and theoretical approach, respectively. 3. The PM mode finally aims at the prediction of the outcomes of future searches, and can be used to tune not only the main instrument parameters, but even the observing strategy.</p><p>However, an extensive use of the code requires a complete knowledge of the instrument under test, of all the error sources and of the detection capabilities. Then, to really extend the use of MESS to other facilities one should first properly set all the needed parameters. As already mentioned before, both the RV and the astrometric part are currently included in a very simplistic way. A better treatment of the dependence of the detectability with astrometry from the orbital parameters should be included. A rigorous treatment of the stellar jitter evaluation must be implemented to allow a better comparison between the imaging and radial velocity capabilities. Especially in the case of E-ELT instruments, this would allow to better define the synergies between the various channels, for a more focused observing strategy. Moreover, a precise measure of the stellar characteristics is also needed, in order to minimize the effects that errors on these parameters, such as the age of the system or the presence of stellar companions, can have on the analysis.</p><p>Finally, the inclusion of an analysis of the planet stability in case of multiple objects is planned, together with an extensive use of the theoretical approach, using the outcomes of the most recent Bern models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mordasini et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Each technique performances vary with the star properties (age, mass, distance...), have different observables (luminosity, minimum mass, radius...), different observing strategies. It is therefore extremely important to take this into account to ring the maximum constrains, first on the properties of giant planets (physical, orbital parameter space) that will actually entirely shape the planetary system architecture, then possibly on the telluric planets. A better characterization of the giant and telluric planet orbital and physical properties, including their dependency with the host properties, is critical for a better understanding of their formation processes as various mechanisms may be at play <ref type="bibr">(Boley 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stamatellos &amp; Whitworth 2009)</ref>, but also of their architecture and dynamical evolution. At the end, one additional and important issue is to understand the required physical conditions that will lead to the formation of telluric planets in habitable zone within planetary systems shaped by giant planets, and that will possibly lead to the formation of Life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

(2010). The characteristics of the stars in the sample are listed in Tab.1. We present a new analysis of these target, done with the 2D module of MESS SAM. 2D minimum mass maps were obtained with the same method used for the analysis of TWA 11 (see Sec. 3.1) for all the stars in the sample. We then used MESS SAM to calculate the detection probability (P D ) of companions of various masses and orbital parameters (semi-major axis a, eccentricities e, inclination i, longitude of the ascending node Ω, longitude of periastron ω and time of periastron passage T p ). We used the empirical approach, generating a full population of 10.000 planets for each target, with a mass range spanning between 0.3 and 30 M Jup and a cut-off in semi-major axis of 100 AU. Each simulated companion was placed on the 2D minimum mass map according to its position on the projected orbit to test its detectability, comparing its mass with the minimum value achievable at the same position in the FoV. Only circumbinary planets were considered around TWA 22, adopting the total mass of the system as M S tar . In fact the binary being so close (ρ = 0.1 ′′ see Bonnefoy et al. 2009) leads to a value of the critical semi-major axis for circumstellar planets a CS of only 0.456 AU and of 8.395 AU for the circumbinary ones.
