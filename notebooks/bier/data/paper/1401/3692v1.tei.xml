				<p>Context. Of the several extrasolar planets discovered to date, only a few of them have orbital periods of less than a day. Such planets are interesting candidates to study tidal effects and, in the case of short period Hot Jupiters, they offer an excellent opportunity to detect and study their atmosphere due to their generally large atmospheric scale heights. Aims. In this work, we use long-slit spectroscopy observations of a transit event of the close-in orbiting planet WASP-43b (M p = 2.034 M Jup , R p = 1.036 R Jup) in an effort to detect its atmosphere. Methods. We used Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) instrument OSIRIS to obtain long-slit spectra in the optical range (520-1040 nm) of the planetary host star WASP-43 (and a reference star) during a full primary transit event and four partial transit observations. We integrated the stellar flux of both stars in different wavelength regions producing several light curves. We fitted transit models to these curves to measure the star-to-planet radius ratio, R p /R s , across wavelength among other physical parameters. Results. We measure a mean planet-to-star radius ratio in the white light curve of 0.15988 +0.00133 −0.00145. Using broad band filters, we detect the color signature of WASP-43. We present a tentative detection of an excess in the planet-to-star radius ratio around the Na i doublet (λ 588.9, 589.5 nm) when compared to the nearby continuum at the 2.9-σ level. We find no significant excess of the measured planet-to-star radius ratio around the K i doublet (λ 766.5 nm, 769.9 nm) when compared to the nearby continuum. Combining our observations with previous published epochs, we refine the estimation of the orbital period. Using a linear ephemeris, we obtained a period of P = 0.81347385 ± 1.5 × 10 −7 days. Using a quadratic ephemeris, we obtained an orbital period of 0.81347688 ± 8.6 × 10 −7 days, and a change in this parameter of ˙ P = −0.15 ± 0.06 sec/year. As previous results, this hints to the orbital decay of this planet although a timing analysis over several years needs to be made in order to confirm this.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Among the increasing family of extra-solar planets discovered so far, only a handful of them possess orbital periods of less than a day. Some examples of close-in exoplanets includes possible disintegrating planets (e.g. KIC 12557548b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>), super-Earths (e.g. Corot-7b, <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2009</ref>; 55 Cnc e <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McArthur et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Dawson &amp; Fabrycky 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Winn et al. 2011</ref>), and hot Jupiters (e.g. WASP-18b <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hellier et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">WASP-19b Hebb et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">and WASP-43b Hellier et al. (2011)</ref>). The study of such close-in orbiting planets can shed some light in the dynamic interactions that produce planetary migrations, tidal interactions between the star and the planet, and in the case of transiting hot Jupiters, they offer a good opportunity to study the atmospheric composition of extra-solar planets under extreme stellar irradiation.</p><p>WASP-43b was discovered by the Wide Angle Search of Planets team in 2011 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hellier et al. 2011</ref>). It orbits a K7V star with an estimated mass of 0.717 ± 0.025M and a stellar radius of 0.667 ± 0.011R ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref> presented a study of several transits observed with TRAPPIST, VLT near-IR photometry, and CORALIE radial velocities. They improved the parameters of the system finding an eccentricity consistent with a circular orbit (e = 0), a semi-major axis over stellar radius of a/R s = 4.918 +0.053 −0.051 , and an estimated planetary mass and radius of 2.034 ± 0.052M Jup and 1.036 ± 0.019R Jup , respectively. By using secondary eclipse observations, the thermal emission of the planet at 1.16 µm and 2.09 µm was detected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. (2013)</ref> measured the secondary eclipse of WASP-43b in the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm bands using Spitzer, deducing a planetary brightness temperature of 1684 ± 24 K and 1485 ± 24 K respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> also detected the secondary eclipse in H and K s bands from the ground using the Wide-field Infrared Array Camera (WIRCam) mounted at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT); their data are consistent with a blackbody with a temperature of 1850 K, higher than the expected equilibrium temperature of the planet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. (2013)</ref> also improved the estimation of the orbital period by a factor of three compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref>, finding a period of P = 0.81347459 ± 2.1 × 10 −7 days. With such a short period of less than a day, WASP-43b is expected to move towards smaller orbits over time, and eventually fall into the star in a time scale between 8-800 Myr depending on the efficiency of orbital energy dissipation from the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hellier et al. 2011</ref>). Due to its close orbit around its host star and its considerable size when compared to the stellar radius, WASP-43b offers a good opportunity to study this planet's atmosphere using current ground based instrumentation.</p><p>One of the most successful techniques to infer the atmospheric composition of extra-solar planets is transmission spectroscopy. When a planet transits its host star, part of the starlight will be absorbed by the atoms and molecules present in the planetary atmosphere. Since atoms and molecules absorb radiation at specific energies, they will produce variations in the flux transmitted through the atmosphere. A direct consequence of such flux variations will be the change in the measured depth of the transit at specific wavelengths. Hot jupiters are excellent targets for transmission spectroscopy studies, mainly because given their relative big sizes compared to their host star they produce a deep transit and, since they are gaseous planets, they possess big atmospheres with considerable scales heights. Some successful examples of transmission spectroscopy has been the detection of Sodium from space and ground in the systems HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charbonneau et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Snellen et al. 2008</ref>) and HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Redfield et al. 2008)</ref>; the study of short period hot jupiters in the near-IR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bean et al. (2013)</ref>), and the study of super-earths (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bean et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Bean et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Here, we probe the atmosphere of WASP-43b by means of transmission spectroscopy of one full and four partial planetary transit events. In §2 we describe the observation setup; in §3 we describe the data reduction process to produce the final light curves, and the light curve fitting methodology; in §4 we present the results of the data analysis; and in §5 the conclusions of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>The Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) is a 10.4 m telescope located at Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma. GTC instrument OSIRIS (Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cepa et al. 2000)</ref> consists of two CCD detectors with a field of view (FOV) of 7.8 × 7.8 arcmin and plate scale of 0.127 arcsec/pix. GTC/OSIRIS has already been used successfully for planetary science in the past, using broad band photometry (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tingley et al. 2011</ref>), tunable filters observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sing et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Colón et al. 2012b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Murgas et al. 2012</ref>, and long-slit transmission spectroscopy (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sing et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>For our observations, we chose the 2 × 2 binning mode, a readout speed of 200 kHz with a gain of 0.95 e-/ADU and a readout noise of 4.5 e-. We used OSIRIS in its long-slit spectroscopic mode, selecting the grism R1000R which covers the spectral range of 520-1040 nm, and a custom built slit of 12 arcsec of width. With such a wide slit, the spectral resolution is dominated by the seeing during the observations, which varied between 0.8 and 1.8 arcsec. This translates in an effective spectral resolution of R = 374-841 at 751 nm. The use of a wider slit has the advantage of reducing the possible systematic effects that can be introduced by light losses due to changes in seeing, airmass, and/or losses caused by differential telescope guiding between the two stars.</p><p>Data for WASP-43b were taken in visiting mode on January 8, 2013. As reference we chose 2MASS J10200126-0948099 (J = 10.16 mag, K S = 9.62 mag), a star with a similar R band magnitude and located at a distance of 5.74 arcmin from the target. Due to the FOV of OSIRIS, the target and reference star had to be located in separate CCDs. The position angle of the reference star with respect to the target (measured east of north) was PA = 2.39 • . Observations began at 02:28 UT (one hour before ingress) and ended at 05:30 UT (one hour after egress).</p><p>The exposure time was set to 15 seconds and the readout time of the instrument was close to 21 seconds, meaning we collected approximately one spectrum every 36 seconds. Spectra of both target and reference star were not collected at parallactic angle. However, given the large size of the slit width, the red wavelengths covered by our instrumental setup, and the airmasses of the observations (sec z = 1.45-1.35 with a minimum at 1.28 near mid-transit), no significant flux losses due to the Earth's atmospheric refraction are expected. Nevertheless, because the seeing varied during the observations, we applied a correction as explained in section 3.</p><p>Besides the data taken in January 2013 (set 5 from now on), we have four more transit observations taken with GTC/OSIRIS in December 22 2011 (set 1), February 8 2012 (set 2), February 21 2012 (set 3) and April 18 2012 (set 4). These observations were made using a different electronic configuration: the readout speed was set to 500 kHz with a gain of 1.46 e-/ADU and a readout noise of 8.0 e-. We decided to use this readout configuration to obtain a higher time cadence. Unfortunately, none of these observations were of the expected quality due to several issues. In particular, during the observations of set 1, 3, and 4 part of the flux was lost or the observations were interrupted due to technical problems with the telescope, while set 2 was observed under bad weather conditions. These old data sets were not adequate to perform a transmission spectroscopy study, but they can be used to search for the color signature variation from transit to transit, and to fit a transit model to the white light curves in order to obtain the central time of the eclipse. For posterior observations we changed to the 200 kHz readout speed to minimize the electronic noise associated with a faster read while not sacrificing too much the cadence of the data acquisition. This read mode has become the standard for GTC long-slit spectroscopy observations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data reduction</head><p>The raw data reduction was made using standard procedures. We combined bias and flat images using the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF 1 ) in order to produce the basic calibration frames, and used these calibration images to correct the science frames before the extraction of the spectra.</p><p>The extraction and wavelength calibration was made using a PyRAF 2 script written for GTC/OSIRIS long-slit data. This script automatized some of the steps to produced the spectra such as: extraction of each spectrum, extraction of the corresponding calibration arc, wavelength calibration (using the HgAr, Xe, Ne lamps provided for the observations) and Doppler shift to take into account the possible shifts in wavelength due to the different radial velocities of the target and the chosen reference star. Given the low spectral resolution of our data, small to moderate errors in wavelength calibration does not introduce large uncertainties in the results presented here.</p><p>Several apertures for the spectra optimal extraction were tested during the reduction process, the one that delivered the best results in terms of low scatter measured using the root mean square (RMS) of the points outside of transit (after normalization) for the white light curve was selected. The results presented here for data set 5 were obtained using an aperture of 50 pixels of width, which corresponds to 12.7 arcsec on the detector. This is 7 to 14 times the raw seeing during the observations.</p><p>The UT time of data acquisition was obtained using the recorded headers of the spectra indicating the opening and closing time of the shutter in order to compute the time of mid exposure. Then, we used the code written by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eastman et al. (2010)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> to compute the Barycentric Julian Date in Barycentric Dynamical Time (BJD) using the mid exposure time for each of the spectra to produce the light curves analyzed here. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents an example of an extracted spectrum of WASP-43 and the reference star used in the time series. Both spectra are neither corrected for instrumental response nor flux calibrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Filter definition</head><p>The light curves were obtained using the numerical method known as Simpson's rule ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Press et al. 2002)</ref> to integrate the fluxes of each spectrum of the time series and take the ratio between the integrated flux of the target and the reference star. To explore the presence of atmospheric features in WASP-43b, we created several filters of different width in wavelength domain.</p><p>In the case of the white light curve, the flux was integrated between 530 and 900 nm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> presents the white light curve for the data set 5 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 3</ref> shows the white light curves for the previous GTC/OSIRIS sets.</p><p>In order to get the transmission spectrum of WASP-43b, the observed spectra of WASP-43 and its reference star were integrated using filters of 25 nm of width in a wavelength range between 530 nm and 900 nm, resulting in 16 light curves to be fitted (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). To test the robustness of the results found with the filters of 25 nm of width, we produced 34 light curves using filters of 10 nm of width with a wavelength range of 549.5-882 nm. The 10 nm bin centered at 589.6 nm has a width big enough to cover the Na i 588.9 and 589.5 nm doublet. Besides these 25 and 10 nm bins, we produced 9 curves using fitlers of  18 nm width to cover the region near the K i 766.5 and 769.9 nm doublet (wavelength range 702.0-855.5 nm).</p><p>To study the color signature of WASP-43, we defined two broad filters one in the blue (530-680 nm) and in the red end of the observed spectra (800-950 nm). The filter coverage for the color signature is illustrated in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Light curves obtained using the filters of 25 nm of width for GTC set 5. The red line shows the best fit found by the MCMC analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Light curve fitting</head><p>In order to get the transit parameters from the light curves (such as planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s ) of set 5, we followed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian approach to get the distribution of probabilities of the fitted parameters and adopted the median of the distribution as the best fitted value (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berta et al. 2012</ref> and Appendix for details).</p><p>To fit the white light curve, we assumed a circular orbit (eccentricity e = 0), fixed the orbital period to P = 0.81347459 days (taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. 2013</ref>) and set as free parameters the planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s ; the quadratic limb darkening coefficients u 1 , u 2 ; the central time of the transit T c ; the orbital semi-major axis over stellar radius a/R s ; and the orbital inclination i.</p><p>In order to take into account the systematic effects induced by atmospheric extinction (and other effects observed in the curves obtained when we integrated the spectrum in wavelength), a third-degree polynomial with a time dependency was fitted to the data. Also, a first-degree polynomial with a dependency on the measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) across the spatial direction of each spectrum was fitted to take into account the flux variability produced by changes in seeing during the observations. Although this last effect is not so evident in the white light curve of set 5, it affected more strongly the light curves obtained using narrower filters. To be self consistent with the analysis of curves presented here, we fitted this seeing dependency to all the obtained light curves.</p><p>Thus, the observed flux ratio was modeled by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F transit = T model (V T )P(t)Q(s) (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T model (V T )</formula><p>is a synthetic transit model dependent on the transit parameters V T , P(t) = a 0 + a 1 t + a 2 t 2 + a 3 t 3 polynomial dependent on time (t), and Q(s) = 1 + c 0 s a polynomial with a seeing (s) dependency (measured in FWHM units).</p><p>As a test, we computed the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, see Eq. 5) for the white light curve to compare the use of a second and a third-degree time dependent polynomial (plus a linear function with a seeing dependency) to fit the systematic effects present in set 5. The BIC value for the third-degree polynomial was 74 while for the second-degree polynomial it was 70, meaning that the simpler model is slightly preferred, although the fit for the curve was better using the third-degree polynomial. As a final test, we fitted the 16 light curves produced using filters of 25 nm of width using both parametrizations, the results were the same within the 1-σ level of confidence. Since the use of a second or third-degree time dependent polynomial did not affect our results, we decided to use the later parametrization to fit all Article number, page 4 of 14</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F. Murgas et al.:</formula><p>The GTC exoplanet transit spectroscopy survey I the light curves because it delivered a better fit to the systematic effects based on the RMS of the residuals.</p><p>The procedure to fit the light curve was split in a two step process. Since out of the transit we have T model (V T ) = 1, we first performed an MCMC simulation to obtain the coefficients of the third-degree time-dependent polynomial and the first degree seeing-dependent polynomial (and their corresponding 1-σ error) using only the out-of-transit points. We used these values as a prior information to penalize the likelihood in order to fit the transit light curve model and the polynomials simultaneously in the next step of the fitting process.</p><p>The second step in order to fit the white light curve and the functions to take into account the systematic effects, started with a χ 2 minimization. To generate the transit models we used a fast Python implementation of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Giménez (2006)</ref> code written by Hannu Parviainen <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , which has been used in previous planetary studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murgas et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Parviainen et al. 2013</ref>). As a starting point of the minimization we used the transit parameters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref>, the polynomial coefficients found in the first step, and for the limb darkening, the bolometric quadratic limb darkening coefficients of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Claret (2000)</ref>. For the limb darkening coefficients we used as a starting point of the fit the values of Claret <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2000)</ref> computed for a star with a turbulent velocity of VT = 0 km/s, log g = 4.5 cm/s 2 , T e f f = 4500 K and log(M/H) = 0.0 dex; close to the values reported for WASP-43 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hellier et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref>. We adopted the standard deviation of normalized residuals (SDNR), which is the RMS of the points outside the transit after normalizing this baseline to unity, as the photometric error in the light curve. In the case of the white light curve of set 5, the SDNR of the points outside the transit were 543.7 ppm.</p><p>Once we had the best set of parameters that minimized the χ 2 function, we used them as a starting point of the MCMC chains that computed the posterior probability distribution of the fitted the parameters. The total number of fitted parameters were twelve: six transit parameters, five polynomial coefficients and one scalar multiplying the RMS of the out-of-transit points to find out the best error of the light curve (see Appendix). All twelve parameters were fitted simultaneously.</p><p>To run the MCMC chains, we chose the Python code emcee (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). This code provides a relatively fast, robust way of producing several independent chains. The different chains are created by slightly changing the solution that minimize the χ 2 function; these different solutions will act as seeds to start the chains, that way we obtain a more robust result if all the chains (with different starting points) converge to the same probability distribution.</p><p>We used 300 independent chains (each one with twelve free parameters) and computed 3200 iterations per chain. In terms of iterations, this equals to computing one chain 9.6×10 5 times. To obtain the probability distribution from the chains, we left out the first 500 iterations as burn-in period (the stage were the chains are still converging) and computed the cross-correlation length for each of the parameters. This way we only use independent samples from the chains to obtain the distributions. Then, each of the 300 chains with the selected independent samples, were merged into one in order to get the probability distribution of the fitted parameters. The final values and errors for the parameters were obtained by computing the percentiles of the distributions to get the median and standard deviation for each parameter.</p><p>For the filters of several widths used to produce different light curves, the fitting process was similar to the one used to fit the white light curve, with the difference that we fixed two of the geometric transit parameters (a/Rs, i) using the results of the white light curve fit. For the broad band filters, we used the Claret (2000) broad band quadratic limb darkening coefficients for the corresponding filters as a starting point for the minimization. For the smaller filters (10, 18 and 25 nm of width), we also used the Claret (2000) broad band quadratic limb darkening coefficients as a starting point to fit the light curve, changing the theoretical coefficient values with the corresponding wavelength of the center of the filters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> presents three curves with the transit removed from set 5 made with filters of 25 nm of width and centered at 542.5, 767.5 and 867.5 nm respectively. The red line shows the best fit for the time and seeing dependent polynomial found by the MCMC analysis. The seeing variations affected more the curves produced using the blue and red wavelength regions (see Appendix). The strong improvement in the model fits when introducing the seeing dependence is indicative that even with a 12 arcsec slit width slit losses can still occur.</p></div>

To test for red noise in our data, we followed the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Winn et al. (2008)</ref> which compares the predicted RMS of the residuals of the fitted light curve versus the measured RMS of the residuals of the curve binned in time. If the curve does not present red noise, the measured RMS of the residuals when binning the light curve in time should follow the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">σ N = σ 1 √ N M M − 1<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where σ 1 is the RMS of the residuals of the unbinned light curve, σ N is the RMS of the residuals of the curve binned in time, N is the number of points in the binned light curve and M is the number of bins.

For each of the light curves we computed β = σ measured /σ N and adopted the median β value for the bins in a time scale under 20 minutes as a multiplying factor to the errors found by the MCMC. In the cases where β &lt; 1, we set β ≡ 1 meaning that the error in those light curves was set by the MCMC procedure. For the white light curve we derived a β WL = 1.5. A test performed to the residuals of the fitted light curves showed that we were able to adjust the main sources of noise present in the data (see Appendix). Hence, the use of this β factor to increase our uncertainties should be enough to compensate the possible underestimation of errors caused by red noise.</p></div>

This can be explained by the cumulative error in the ephemeris equation, specially in the value of the orbital period. To correct this, we fit a linear and a quadratic regression to the time residuals. Both linear and quadratic fits are weighted by the uncertainties in the central times of the transits.</p><p>After correcting for the linear trend, the updated linear ephemeris equation is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T c = T 0 + NP<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where T 0 = 2455528.8686144 ± 1.1 × 10 −4 days and the resulting orbital period is P = 0.81347385 ± 1.5 × 10 −7 days. The corrected O-C diagram is presented in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.  6</ref>.

The period and orbital decay reported in Blecic et al. is a result based on the T c from <ref type="bibr">Gillon</ref>   attribute the difference with our results to the different treatment of uncertainties in the reported central times due to the method used to estimate the red noise and our longer baseline of timing observations. While Gillon et al. and Blecic et al. used time averaging methods, we have used the wavelet method which in principle delivers more conservative estimations of uncertainties (see Carter &amp; Winn 2009, section 4). We tested this difference by fitting simultaneously three complete transits of WASP-43b reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref> using TAP. We found that the uncertainties we obtain are 1.5-2.0 times larger compared with the values originally reported. Similar results have been obtained when comparing the wavelet with time averaging methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoyer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoyer et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The confirmation of orbital decay could help to constrain the stellar dissipation factor Q (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rasio et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Matsumura et al. 2010</ref>) and establish the survival time of the planet.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Color signature</head><p>Simultaneous multicolor photometry of planetary transits has some very interesting applications such as the identification of false positives in searches for exoplanets and limb darkening studies of the host star (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tingley 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Tingley et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Colón et al. 2012a</ref>, and references therein).</p><p>As a planet transits the stellar disk it occults part of the stellar light and, due to the limb darkening effect, it will block more red light during the ingress and egress than during the middle of the transit. With simultaneous photometry in a blue and a red band it is possible to measure this effect by using the color Blue -Red measured during the transit. As can be seen from in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>, the effect of the color measurement (Blue-Red) of the transit creates horn-like structures in the ingress and egress of the transit. This effect is small, in this specific case with a peak near 1800 ppm. We also produced the Blue and Red light curves using the same broad band filters for the data sets 1 to 4, however since those observations were not complete we did not fit a transit model. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>, we detect the same horn-like signature in several of the old GTC data sets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Transmission spectroscopy</head><p>The first four bins present a maximum peak in the filter centered at 567.5 nm. Between 600 nm and 870 nm, the transmission spectrum presents a trend of an increase in the measured  ratio R p /R s towards the red part of the spectrum (between 600 nm and near 720 nm) and then the depth of the transit decreases until 880 nm. These trends observed with the filters of 25 nm of width were also found in a test made with wider filters of 75 nm of width. We speculate that the increase in R p /R s between 620 and 720 nm and posterior decrease redward of 720 nm may be consistent with a planet temperature in the range 1500-2000 K and the presence of molecular absorption due to VO and TiO, as shown by the isothermal model computations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2010)</ref>, which assumed chemical equilibrium. This temperature range agrees with the derived values by Blecic et al. Notes. The uncertainties are multiplyied by the factor β presented here.</p><p>(2013) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wang et al. (2013)</ref>. According to the model spectra of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2010)</ref>, the presence of oxides make it harder to isolate K i doublet with data of low spectral resolution; this is consistent with our finding. Detection of TiO and ViO at optical wavelengths has also been claimed for HD 209458b <ref type="bibr">(Désert et al. 2008</ref>), which has a warm day side brightness temperature of 1320 ± 80 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crossfield et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The last two bins in the redder part of the spectrum centered at 892.5 and 917.5 nm, present a higher R p /R s when compared to the adjacent filters; these bins could be more affected than the rest of the spectrum by fringing, although fringing patterns are not visible in our data. According to GTC staff 5 , fringing affects only at a 5% level for wavelengths λ &gt; 930 nm and less than 1% for wavelengths λ &lt; 900 nm, but given the high precisions that transmission spectroscopy requires, it could be an important source of noise for red wavelengths when using the GTC R1000R grism.</p><p>To test the results obtained with filters of 25 nm of width and to search for possible atmospheric features that the use of broad filter may have overlooked, we proceeded to create light curves using narrower filters in the regions near the Na i doublet, the K i doublet and the region between these two features were some telluric signals are located. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, top panel, presents the comparison between the results using the light curves obtained with the 25 nm and 10 nm width filters for the region near the Na i doublet (see Table 4). We can see that the 10 nm width filter that possess the same center as the Nai doublet hints to an excess in the measured R p /R s when compared to the adjacent redder filters, however the filters in the blue region next to the same line present a similar level of planetary radius than the one found in the Na feature. Using only the filter centered at 599.5 nm next to the Nai doublet, the difference between these two filters is ∆(R p /R s ) Na−599.5 = (2.75 ± 0.84) × 10 −3 ; if we use the filter centered at 579.5 nm we find a less significant excess of ∆(R p /R s ) Na−579.5 = (1.53 ± 0.90) × 10 −3 . If we compute the weighted average (R p /R s ) using the bins centered at 579.5 and 599.5 nm, we have (R p /R s ) Avg = 0.16022 ± 4.51 × 10 −4 . Us-  ing this average value, ∆(R p /R s ) Na−Avg = (2.18 ± 0.74) × 10 −3 , a 2.9-σ of significance excess. Assuming a stellar radius of R s = 0.667R ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. 2012</ref>), this excess in Na could be traced back to an atmospheric height of ∆(R p ) Na−Avg = 1012 ± 344 Km. All these tests points to an excess in the measured planet-to-star radius ratio that could be produced by the atmosphere of WASP43b, but our 2.9-σ precision is not enough to claim an unambiguous detection. This tentative detection could be improved with new observations using, for example, GTC/OSIRIS R1000B grism which covers a bluer part of the spectrum. Sodium has been detected in other exoplanets with slightly colder temperatures than WASP-43b like HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charbonneau et al. 2002)</ref>, XO-2b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sing et al. 2012</ref>) with a temperature of 1500 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Machalek et al. 2009</ref>), and HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Redfield et al. 2008</ref>) with an atmospheric temperature of 1340 ± 150 K (Lecavelier Des ). The central panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> shows an intermediate region between the Na i and K i doublet where we produced light curves using filters of 10 nm of width. The planet-to-star radius ratio of the small filters are in agreement with the results found using filters of 25 nm of width and present hints of an excess in R p /R s at the filters centered at 658 nm (near H α ) and 708 nm, but due to the errors in R p /R s we can not claim a detection of the planet atmosphere in this region.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> presents the wavelength region near K i doublet. The telluric absorption feature caused by O 2 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) is blended with the 766.5 and 769.9 nm Potassium doublet at the resolution of our spectrum. One needs to be very careful not to confuse telluric variability from possible planetary signature (see Appendix). Thus, for this wavelength region, we chose a wider than the usual 10 nm filter used in the regions with shorter wavelengths in order to cover the entire oxygen and potassium lines. Taking the weighted average of the planet-tostar radius ratio of the two 18 nm of width filters adjacent to the K i doublet (747.0 nm and 783.0 nm) and using those bins as a pseudo-continuum, we found a difference between the line and the continuum of   Notes.

The observed wavelength range was 510-1040 nm and, in the case of the January 8 2013 set, with a resolution of 374-841 at 751 nm.</p><p>Integrating the full range of wavelength available in the observed spectrum of the target and its reference star, we produced a white light photometric curve. We fitted a transit model to the data set 5 (full transit observations) and, using an MCMC analysis, we obtained transit parameters with their corresponding uncertainties that take into account the level of white and red noise in the photometric curve.</p><p>For each of the five GTC/OSIRIS WASP-43b data sets we fit the central time of the observed individual transits. Combining these results with previous observations made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref>, we see a decrease in time in the O-C versus epoch diagram. We attributed this trend to a cumulative error in the period determination ephemeris and proceeded to fit a linear and quadratic function to determine a new period. Using a linear fit, we find a new orbital period of P = 0.81347385±1.5×10 −7 days. As reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. (2013)</ref>, the O-C data are better fitted using a quadratic function, with this parametrization we find an orbital period of P = 0.81347688 ± 8.6 × 10 −7 days and a change in the period of ˙ P = −0.15 ± 0.06 sec/year. The ˙ P that we reported here is smaller than the one found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. (2013)</ref>. Based on this discrepancy, a dedicated study of the transit timing of this system made over several years needs to be carried out in order to confirm the orbital decay of this particular planet.</p><p>Using Blue and Red light curves, we detected the classical horn-like structures representative of the color signature of WASP-43. We confirmed the color signature detection using the old GTC data sets. This shows the potential of performing multicolor studies using long slit spectroscopy and transiting planets.</p><p>We also present here the transmission spectrum of WASP43b using filters of 25, 18, and 10 nm of width. With the wider filters, we observed a possible excess in R p /R s near the position of the Na i doublet, a trend of increasing planet-to-star radius ratio from blue to red wavelengths between 600 and 720 nm, and a decreasing R p /R s between 720 and 880 nm. The increase Article number, page 10 of 14 F. Murgas et al.: The GTC exoplanet transit spectroscopy survey I in R p /R s values between 620 and 720 nm and the decrease in R p /R s redward of 720 nm may be consistent with the temperature of WASP-43b and the presence of VO and TiO predicted by atmospheric models.</p><p>For the region near Na i 588.9 and 589.5 nm doublet, we found an excess in R p /R s using filters of 10 nm of width. Taking the average of the R p /R s of the two adjacent filters as a continuum, we obtained a difference of ∆(R p /R s ) Na−Avg = (2.18 ± 0.74) × 10 −3 ; meaning that the excess is detected with 2.9-σ of confidence. The regions in the blue part of the Na i doublet were more affected by flux losses due to seeing variations. In the region between 640 and 760 nm, we observed an increase in the measured planet-to-star radius ratio until the spectrum reach the Potassium doublet.</p><p>We probed the wavelength region near the K i doublet (766.5 nm, 769.9 nm) using filters of 18 nm of width. We do not detect a significant excess in the planet-to-star radius ratio at the position of the Potassium doublet. After the K i doublet and until 855 nm, the bins follow a trend of a decreasing planet-to-star radius ratio.</p><p>According to the models of Fortney et al. (2010) Sodium and Potassium features are strong at planetary temperatures between 1000 and 1500 K, close to the brightness temperature found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. (2013)</ref> of T = 1684 ± 24 K and T = 1485 ± 24 K for the 3.6 and 4.5 µm Spitzer bands. Our data points to an excess in the measured planet-to-star radius in the Na i doublet and no detection of an excess in the K i doublet, which would make WASP-43b a planet with atmospheric characteristics similar to HD 209458b.</p><p>During the data analysis of this work we found that the R p /R s measured in the filters centered at the Potassium doublet were sensitive to the removal of bad pixels and/or cosmic rays. The IRAF routine used to extract the spectrum, APALL, presents the option to remove and replace deviant pixels. The user can choose the threshold level to replace the pixels that present a lower sensitivity (bad pixels) or high values caused by cosmic rays. Since the O 2 telluric feature is fairly deep, a lower threshold limit wrongfully identified the pixel that was near the minimum flux of the absorption line as a deviant pixel and replaced that pixel value. This occurred more or less randomly for both target and reference star in the time series due to the changes in the depth of the telluric line caused by atmospheric variability. This effect produced extra noise in the light curve computed using a wavelength width of 25 and 18 nm around the K doublet.</p><p>The extra noise produced by the cleaning algorithm created a deeper and noisier transit in that filter and, with our MCMC, a spurious detection of Potassium in WASP-43b. This problem was fixed by reducing the data several times fine tuning the threshold level of rejection in order to detect and remove bad pixels and cosmic rays but not replacing the values of the deepest points in the O 2 absorption line. This delivered a higher quality light curve centered near the Oxygen telluric line that presented a similar noise levels seen in the curves of the adjacent wavelength regions.</p><p>It is also important to correctly parametrize the model to correct any flux variation that is correlated with some of the observational parameters like the seeing. In our first attempt to fit the data we did not consider seeing as a source of noise in the measured flux ratio between the target and reference star; that caused that the MCMC computed very large error bars in the measured R p /R s in the filters computed in the blue part of the spectrum and a flat transmission spectrum between 750 and 870 nm.</p><p>Figure A.1 shows a comparison of the results obtained using two different threshold levels to remove bad pixels and cosmic rays: a 6.5σ shown in red and the final 10σ rejection limit in blue. Both results were obtained without correcting for seeing variations and present a flat transmission spectrum in the red region next to the K doublet, as opposed of the results presented here in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A.2: Data analysis</head><p>As we explained in §3.3, we fitted a transit model adding two polynomials to take into account the time and seeing dependent systematic effects present in the data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F transit = T model (V T )P(t)Q(s) (A.1)</formula><p>where T model (V T ) is a synthetic transit model dependent on the transit parameters V T . For the white light curve V T = (R p /R s , u 1 , u 2 , T c , a/Rs, i) with R p /R s the planet-to-star radius ratio, (u 1 , u 2 ) the quadratic limb darkening coefficients, T c the central time of the transit, a/R s the semi-major axis over stellar radius, and i the orbital inclination. P(t) is a time dependent polynomial, and Q(s) a seeing dependent polynomial: P(t) = a 0 + a 1 t + a 2 t 2 + a 3 t 3 (A.2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q(s) = 1 + c 0 s (A.3)</formula><p>For the MCMC fitting procedure we followed a similar approach as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berta et al. (2012)</ref> and used as likelihood L</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ln L = −N ln(p) − χ 2 2p 2 (A.4)</formula><p>where N is the number of points in the curve, p a coefficient to normalize the χ 2 . The function χ 2 compares the data points with the model :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">χ 2 = N i=1 d i − m i σ i 2 (A.5)</formula><p>where d i is the data point, m i the model point, and σ i the error in the measurement which in our case was assumed to be the SDNR of the points outside the transit.  The probability priors used for each parameter are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table A.</ref>1. The use of a normal prior for the polynomial parameters to take into account the systematic effects was adopted using the information of the MCMC analysis performed using the points outside the transit.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A.3: Red noise analysis</head><p>To compare our error estimation with TAP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gazak et al. 2012)</ref>, we performed an analysis of the residuals of the fitted light curves using our MCMC method. TAP is based in the paper of <ref type="bibr">Carter &amp; Winn (2009)</ref>  in the light curves. Their method is applied when the square of the Fourier transform of the residuals (S) follow a power law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">S = A f γ (A.6)</formula><p>with A a constant, f the Fourier frequency, and γ the exponent of the power law. If γ = 0 we are in the presence of white noise, γ = 1.0 pink noise, and γ = 2.0 red noise. We computed S for the white light curve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. A.4</ref>) and the curves produced using the filters of 75 and 25 nm of width. In all the cases the residuals followed a power law with γ 0.3, indicating that with our fitting procedure the residuals are dominated by white noise. We can also conclude that this γ 0.3 regime is far from the assumed noise level of TAP (with γ = 1.0), meaning that in this particular case TAP could be overestimating the uncertainties. Since our fitting procedure is close to the white noise regime, we think that our estimation is more accurate than using TAP for this specific data set.  <ref type="bibr">Carter &amp; Winn (2009)</ref> this means that the major noise source in this curve is white noise.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
