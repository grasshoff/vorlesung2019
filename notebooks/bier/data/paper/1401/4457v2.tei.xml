				<p>Many exoplanets in close-in orbits are observed to have relatively high eccentricities andfangu large stellar obliquities. We explore the possibility that these result from planet-planet scattering by studying the dynamical outcomes from a large number of orbit integrations in systems with two and three gas-giant planets in close-in orbits (0.05 AU&lt; a &lt;0.15 AU). We find that at these orbital separations, unstable systems starting with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations (e 0.1, i 0.1) generally lead to planet-planet collisions in which the collision product is a planet on a low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbit. This result is inconsistent with the observations. We conclude that eccentricity and inclination excitation from planet-planet scattering must precede migration of planets into short-period orbits. This result constrains theories of planet migration: the semi-major axis must shrink by 1-2 orders of magnitude without damping the eccentricity and inclination.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Measurements of the orbital eccentricity and the projected misalignment between the spin of the host star and the orbit of extrasolar planets (i.e., the projected stellar obliquity ψ) have revealed that planetary architectures commonly differ from that of our own Solar System. The eccentricity distribution is broad, with e &gt; 0.3 in ∼ 30% of the planets, while the obliquity distribution (mostly from measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect from giant planets in close-in orbits) shows that ∼ 25% of the planets have ψ &gt; 30 •3 . Similarly, the existence of massive short-period planets-the so-called Hot Jupiters-points towards a dynamical history of known extrasolar planets that is quite different from that of the Solar System. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for the large eccentricities of giant planets: interaction with the natal protoplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ogilvie &amp; Lubow 2003)</ref>, secular perturbations due to distant stellar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wu &amp; Murray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref> or planetary companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Naoz et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2011</ref>), dynamical instabilities due to planet-planet gravitational interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lin &amp; Ida 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Weidenschilling &amp; Marzari 1996)</ref>, and others.</p><p>The mechanisms described above to excite the eccentricities that involve gravitational interactions with planetary or stellar companions can also potentially account for the observed high stellar obliquities and the presence of close-in planets, through tidal circularization of high-eccentricity, high-inclination orbits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nagasawa et al. 2008</ref>).

This situation could arise, for example, by means of disk migration without eccentricity and inclination excitation (or with eccentricity and inclination excitation which are subsequently damped) followed by disk dispersal, or through in-situ formation from a close-in disk resulting from a binary merger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martin et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>We recognize that our separation into two phases, "migration in the presence of gas", and "planet-planet gravitational interactions without gas" is artificial and the planets might enter the gas-free phase in orbital configurations that differ from our assumed (nearly circular and coplanar) initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Libert &amp; Tsiganis 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lega et al. 2013</ref>). However, unless we make this separation it is hard to isolate the purely dynamical effects that take place after disk dispersal.</p><p>Two types of instability condition exist for systems containing a star and two or more orbiting planets. Hill stability requires that the planets preserve the ordering of the distances to the star, i.e., there are no orbitcrossing events. Lagrange stability requires both that the planets are Hill stable and that the outermost planet remains bound to the star (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes &amp; Greenberg 2006</ref>). For two-planet systems, the former stability criterion has a well-defined boundary for the minimum separations of the planets with small eccentricities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gladman 1993)</ref>, while the latter is less well-understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Veras &amp; Mustill 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deck et al. 2013</ref>). Note that systems with more than two planets are not provably Hill stable for any initial separation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chatterjee et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al. (2001)</ref> showed that the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions between planets ("planet-planet scattering") is largely determined by the branching ratios into different dynamical outcomes such as planetary ejections, collisions with the star or planet-planet collisions. In particular, these authors show that simulations with two Jupiter-like planets placed initially in Hill unstable orbits result mostly in planet-planet collisions for the range of semi-major axes 0.5 − 2 AU, and that the daughter planets produced in collisions have small eccentricities (e &lt; 0.05). In contrast, planetary ejections leave the surviving planet with significant eccentricity: for two equal-mass-planet simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al. (2001)</ref> find e ∼ 0.4 − 0.8 for the survivor. Similar experiments by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ford et al. (2003)</ref> and  show that when the planet masses are unequal the fraction of planet collisions relative to ejections is reduced and the eccentricities of the planets surviving after ejections are lower, resulting in a better match to the observed eccentricity distribution.</p><p>The latter experiments also show that the ratio of ejections to planet-planet collisions increases monotonically with a/R p in the range (0.5 − 2) (AU/R J ), where a is the semi-major axis, R p is radius of the planet, and R J is the radius of Jupiter. This behavior is related to the ratio θ of the escape velocity at the surface of the planet to the circular velocity of the planet:</p><p>With these initial conditions, the planets have small relative velocities (compared to their circular velocities) during the first close approaches, so gravitational focusing can significantly enhance the rate of collisions. Additionally, the simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Veras &amp; Mustill (2013)</ref> show that two-planet systems in Hill stable configurations can still be Lagrange unstable over sufficiently long timescales (at least ∼ 10 5 orbits of the inner planet for two Jupiter-mass planets). Such systems contribute as an extra source of ejections and collisions with the star, while avoiding planet-planet collisions.</p><p>Simulations with more than two planets can become Hill unstable for larger initial separations between planets than in the two-planet case (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lin &amp; Ida 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Levison et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002)</ref>. This has the immediate consequence that close encounters for these larger separations happen after the planets have attained significant eccentricities, allowing close encounters to occur typically at higher relative velocities compared to the two-planet simulations, reducing the overproduction of collisions due to gravitational focusing.</p><p>These simulations show that the timescale for instability (time to the first orbit crossing) grows exponentially with the initial separation in units of the mutual Hill radii defined in Equation (3) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith &amp; Lissauer 2009)</ref>. Once the eccentricities have grown, the number of planets gradually shrinks due to collisions between planets, planetary ejections, and collisions with the star, relaxing to a state in which three or fewer planets persist in eccentric orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We extend previous studies by focusing on the dynamical evolution of systems of close-in planets (0.05 AU&lt; a &lt; 0.15 AU). We survey the parameter space of simulations with two and three planets to address whether planet-planet scattering can produce eccentricities and inclinations that are as large as those of the observed exoplanets. Recall that our goal is to test the scenario in which scattering takes place after the planets have migrated to (or formed at) small separations with small eccentricities and inclinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SIMULATIONS</head><p>We run N -body simulations of the evolution of the orbits of giant planets orbiting a solar-type star. In most simulations, the planets are assumed to have a Jupiter mass and radius. Planet-star and planet-planet collisions are assumed to result in momentum-conserving mergers with no fragmentation. Collisions are assumed to happen when the distance between two planets (or planet and star) becomes less than the sum of their physical radii. Since we consider planet-planet collisions, the problem at hand is not scale free, i.e., the results depend on the ratio a/R p .</p><p>We start by studying simulations with two planets (N pl = 2) because these have been the subject of extensive previous work and because understanding this simple case facilitates the analysis of simulations with more planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al. 2001;</ref>. However, two-planet systems have certain special features that are not found in systems with more than two planets. In particular, collisions can only happen if the planets initially lie inside the well-defined and narrow Hill unstable region (see discussion in §1). We also perform simulations with N pl = 3, which are not subject to the latter restriction because systems can become Hill unstable for arbitrarily large initial separations between planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002)</ref>. is kept constant and equal to 0.01 in all two-planet simulations. Note: 2 pl. (3 pl.) means that two (three) planets remain in stable orbits for a time tmax. C, E, and S stand for planet-planet collisions, planet ejections (a &gt; 10 3 AU), and planet collisions with the star, respectively. 2C means that two planet collisions occur, while C+E means one collision and one ejection (not necessarily in that order), and so on. The stellar mass is Solar and the planet masses are that of Jupiter, except for 2pl-mass where we use β = 1/3 and M 1 + M 2 = 2M J . All the planets in the simulations have radius R i = R J .</p><p>We do not consider simulations with N pl &gt; 3. However, the simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref> with N pl &gt; 3 almost always end up with 2−3 surviving planets after ejections and collisions of other planets in the system. Then, as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chatterjee et al. (2008)</ref>, given the chaotic behavior of these systems, little memory of the initial number of planets or initial conditions will remain in the surviving planets. Therefore, it is plausible that the final state of systems initially with N pl &gt; 3 will be similar to that of systems with N pl = 3.</p><p>Even though tidal dissipation can be important for planets that approach the host star within a few stellar radii, we ignore its effect. We justify this choice because we are interested in studying the maximum efficiency with which planet-planet scattering can produce high eccentricities and inclinations, and tides will only decrease this efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The code</head><p>We use the publicly available integration packages of MERCURY6.2 (Chambers 1999). In most simulations, we use MERCURY's Bulirsch-Stoer (BS) integration algorithm; we justify this choice because we are mostly interested on the evolution of dynamically active systems, where planets experience close encounters, and the BS algorithm handles close encounters better than the other integration algorithms in MERCURY. We carry out integrations for up to ∼ 10 8 orbits of the inner planet with an accuracy parameter ǫ = 10 −12 . In one set of simulations (3pl-K), we integrate up to ∼ 10 9 orbits of the inner planet using MERCURY's Hybrid integrator package, which integrates orbits symplectically, switching to the BS scheme when two planets have a close approach (defined to be closer than three Hill radii, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Duncan et al. 1998</ref>). In 3pl-K we set the initial time step to be 0.5 days.</p></div>

Our choice of K in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> is empirically guided by the fact that we would like to avoid very closely-packed systems that evolve on very short timescales, but still have a significant fraction of systems that become unstable after 10 8 orbits of the innermost planet.</p><p>In most two-planet simulations we use K = 2.

We have two fiducial simulations, 2pl-fiducial and 3pl-fiducial, corresponding to two-and three-planet systems. For these simulations we set the semi-major axis range to 0.05 − 0.15 AU, σ x = 0.01, and the maximum integration time to t max = 10 6 years (or ∼ 10 8 orbits for a planet at a = 0.05 AU). As discussed in §2.2, in 2pl-fiducial we set K = 2, while in 3pl-fiducial we use K = 3. In the rest of the simulations, we vary the parameters as indicated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We define the mass ratio for the two-planet simulations as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β ≡ min(M 1 , M 2 )/ max(M 1 , M 2 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and fix M 1 + M 2 = 2M J . All the planets in the threeplanet simulations have Jupiter masses, while all planets in the two-and three-planet simulations have Jupiter radii. We refer to active (inactive) systems as those in which the number of planets at the end of the simulation is less than (equal to) the number at the start. The number of planets is reduced by three different dynamical events: planet-planet collisions (C), planetary ejections (E), and planet collisions with the host star (S).</p></div>

The colors label the different final outcomes. Each system was followed for 10 6 years. The log of the initial semi-major axis is drawn uniformly distributed in a = 0.05−0.15 AU with initial spacing given by K = 2 in Equation (3). The initial eccentricities and inclinations follow a Rayleigh distribution with σx = 0.01 (Eq. 2). Note that there are two red circles for each system in which both planets survive, so such systems might appear more common in these scatter plots than they actually are. Six additional systems are not plotted because one planet escaped and the second collided with the star, leaving none behind.</p><p>From <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the most common outcome is two planets in almost circular and coplanar orbits (≈ 79% of the systems). The initial separation of these systems is larger than ≈ 3.2R H,1,2 , which corresponds to the Hill stability boundary for two Jupiter-mass planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gladman 1993)</ref>. In these systems the final eccentricities are small (see second panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>): the mean (median) eccentricity is 0.014 (0.02) and and the eccentricity reaches a maximum of ≈ 0.14 for a small fraction of orbits with initial spacing of ≈ 5R H,1,2 corresponding to the 2 : 1 first-order mean-motion resonance. The feature seen around the resonance agrees with the prediction of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Petrovich et al. (2013)</ref> for the time-averaged eccentricity distribution near this resonance.</p><p>The second most common outcome is planet-planet collisions (≈ 18%). The initial separations of these systems are confined to ∆a 1,2 3R H,1,2 and the collision product has a low-eccentricity orbit: the mean (median) eccentricity is only 0.014 (0.011). The small eccentrici-ties of collision products is consistent with the results of similar simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al. (2001)</ref>, which have a median eccentricity of ≈ 0.015.</p><p>The least common outcome is planet ejections and collisions with the host star, each of which happens only ≈ 1% of the time. The mean (median) eccentricity of the planets left after ejections and collision with host star is 0.54 (0.51) and 0.68 (0.74), respectively. Note that most of the ejections and collisions with the star (≈ 89%) happen for initial separations ∆a 1,2 3R H,1,2 that are Hill stable, but become Lagrange unstable after ∼ 10 5 orbits of the inner planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Veras &amp; Mustill 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We observe that planet-planet collisions happen ≈ 11 and ≈ 14 times more frequently than ejections and collisions with the star, respectively. Given that planets in moderate to high eccentricities are only produced by planet ejections and collisions with the star, we conclude from these simulations that excitation of high eccentricities is very inefficient.</p><p>The inclinations are always small (&lt; 10 • ) in our simulations and the higher values ( 3 • ) are reached in systems where one planet is ejected. The extremely small inclinations (mean of ≃ 0.017 • ) in systems with collisions are easily understood as a result of angular momentum conservation during the collision of two planets.</p><p>We conclude from these experiments that planetplanet scattering in two-planet systems at a ∼ 0.1 AU is almost never able to generate high eccentricities and inclinations. This is because the circular orbital velocity at these separations is bigger than the escape velocity of the planets (θ 2 = 0.2-0.6 from Eq. 1) and, therefore, planet-planet collisions must happen more frequently than planet ejections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Outcomes from three-planet systems</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we show the outcomes from our fiducial three-planet simulation 3pl-fiducial. The different outcomes are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and 2.</ref> We note from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> that most systems (≈ 69%) had one planet-planet collision, resulting in a final system having two planets. The second most common outcome (≈ 25%) is a stable system in which all three planets survive for 10 6 years. The third most common channel (≈ 3%) is a system having one collision with either one ejection (≈ 2%) or one collision with the star (≈ 1%), resulting in a final system with one planet. Then, we have one planet collision with a subsequent ejection and collision with the star (≈ 1%), which leaves no planet in the system.

In contrast, in three-planet systems the different outcomes in active systems are not confined to any particular range of initial spacing (middle panel of <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>). From <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> the mean (median) eccentricity for systems that had one planet-planet collision and no other events (category C; blue circles in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) is 0.12 (0.094). These values are larger than the mean eccentricity of 0.014 that results from collisions in the two-planet simulations. The category C systems have a characteristic fork-like eccentricity distribution. This distribution roughly agrees with the condition that the collision product has to pass through a region that was initially populated by planets: the interval between a(1−e) and a(1+e) must intersect [0.05, 0.15] AU, as indicated with dashed lines in the upper panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>High eccentricities (e &gt; 0.4) are mainly reached in systems that had either ejections or collisions with the star, but the fraction of these systems is too small ( 4%) to make an important contribution to the eccentricity distribution.

These systems, however, have even smaller eccentricities and inclinations and, therefore, make even stronger our conclusion that the production of high eccentricities and inclinations is inefficient.</p><p>The fiducial two-planet simulation has a strong peak at e 0.06, which corresponds to the systems that had collisions, while the few systems that had either ejections or collisions with the star populate the distribution at e &gt; 0.35. For the fiducial three-planet simulation, the distribution is strongly peaked at e 0.1 due to the systems that had planet-planet collisions and is wider than in the two-planet case with collisions contributing to the distribution up to e ∼ 0.6. The handful of planets with e &gt; 0.6 are the result of ejections or collisions with the star.</p><p>In the two-planet simulations, collisions happen very early on in the simulation with ≈ 98% of these events taking place during the first 10 3 years. Before the collision planets experience an average of 1.5 close encounters (instances in which the relative distance between two planets is less than one Hill radius, not counting the last encounter in which planets merge). This suggests that collisions occur before repeated close encounters can excite the eccentricities. In this case planets would normally collide with low eccentricities, which would produce collision products in low eccentricity orbits 5 . Indeed, the typical eccentricity e 0.05 seen in the collision products is consistent with analytical estimates of the eccentricities of collision products based on the assumption of low eccentricities for the pre-collision orbits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, in the three-planet simulations the collisions are more uniformly distributed in time. For instance, ∼ 30% (∼ 20%) of the collisions happen after 10 3 years (10 4 years). The number of close encounters before a collision is also larger in the three-planet simulations (average of 6.7 compared to 1.5 for the two-planet simulations), suggesting that the eccentricities of the precollision orbits are higher and thus that the eccentricity of the collision product should be larger, as observed. Consistently, the number of close encounters is correlated with the eccentricity after collisions (the correlation coefficient is ≈ 0.49) and almost all (≈ 93%) of the planets with e &gt; 0.4 had more than 10 close encounters before the collision.</p></div>

This choice of K means that we exclude the initial spacings that give rise to most planet-planet collisions (see upper panel in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In order to have a significant number of unstable systems we increase the initial eccentricities by setting σ e = 0.1 in Equation (2), which would expand the Hill stability boundary by an approximate factor of ∼ (1 + 8/27(e 2 1 + e 2 2 )/0.01) 1/2 , where e 1 , e 2 0.1 are the initial eccentricities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gladman 1993)</ref>. This set-up has no direct theoretical motivation, but it might be regarded as the result of a previous dynamically active phase in the history of the system.</p><p>From <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the ratio of the number of collisions to the number of ejections and collisions with the star decreases from ≈ 6 in the fiducial two-planet simulation to ≈ 1.1.

From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, we see that the eccentricity distribution broadens and the median eccentricity grows from 0.012 in the fiducial simulation to 0.12. This behavior is the result of two effects: the higher number of ejections and collisions with the star relative to planet-planet collisions (systems with e &gt; 0.2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  3</ref>) and higher eccentricities after collisions (systems with e &lt; 0.2). The latter effect is expected from the higher initial eccentricities and the larger number of close encounters before collisions (the average increases from 1.5 in the fiducial simulation to 12), because both effects promote higher eccentricities and, therefore, collisions at higher relative velocities. Despite these differences, the main conclusion of this paper still holds: planet-planet scattering cannot efficiently excite eccentricities and inclinations at small semi-major axes. Although the mean and median eccentricities of 0.27 and 0.12 of the active systems in 2pl-K bracket the analogous quantities in the observed exoplanet sample (0.19 and 0.17), (i) the initial conditions of the simulation already had mean and median eccentricities of 0.125 and 0.117 so only part of the final eccentricity is due to excitation; (ii) realistic ensembles would contain many inactive systems, in which almost no eccentricity excitation occurs; (iii) in systems with K = 3 and zero initial eccentricity almost all of the systems are inactive.</p><p>The mean (median) inclination in active systems is only 0.83 • (0.04 • ).

We integrate 500 systems, using the Hybrid algorithm to speed up the integrations as described in §2.1. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the ratio of the number of collisions to the number of ejections and collisions with the star is ≈ 13, similar to that from the fiducial three-planet simulation of ≈ 10.

Initial semi-major axis: a From Equation (1), we observe that for a fixed planet to star mass ratio the physical parameter that governs the relative branching ratios for ejections (or collisions with the star) and collisions is a/R p .

These higher eccentricities in 3pl-a1 are, however, still smaller than the measured eccentricities <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>. Finally, the mean (median) inclination is 3.2 • (1.0 • ), slightly larger than the fiducial three-planet simulation <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>).</p><p>In conclusion, placing the planets in larger semi-major axis enhances the efficiency to produce ejections and collisions with the star and, therefore, the outcomes of active systems have higher eccentricity and inclination orbits. Our simulation 3pl-a2 shows that scattering at a = 2.5 − 7.5 AU produces eccentricities in the active systems that are larger than those measured from the observed exoplanets in this semi-major axis range, so the results could be consistent with the observations if a significant fraction of the observed systems are inactive. In contrast, the simulations with planets at a &lt; 0.45 AU (3pl-fiducial and 3pl-a1) predict eccentricities that are smaller than those seen in our exoplanet sample, even if we restrict ourselves to active systems, which is mainly due to the prevalence of planet collisions. We remark that the evolution of the different branching ratios as a function of a/R p has been previously studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al.

We do not see the reduction in the number of collisions observed in the simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ford et al. (2003)</ref>. This difference might be due to the fact that most of the ejections and collisions with the star happen in systems that are Hill stable, which are excluded in the simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ford et al.

Likewise, the final inclinations after ejections are also limited as one decreases β (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Timpe et al. 2013</ref>). In conclusion, the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations is inefficient even if the mass ratio departs from unity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The main result from our orbit integrations is simple: at small semi-major axes, gravitational interactions between planets in unstable systems mostly lead to collisions rather than to excitation of highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits.</p><p>Collisions are more common than ejections or collisions with the star because the orbital velocities at small separations are typically larger than the escape velocity of giant planets (see Eq. 1, for reference). A similar conclusion is reached in the numerical study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johansen et al. (2012)</ref>. Moreover, planet-planet collisions from loweccentricity, low-inclination orbits typically produce collision products that occupy orbits with even lower eccentricity and inclination. The low-inclination orbits are easily understood as a result of angular momentum conservation during the collision of two planets with nearly the same initial orbital planes.</p><p>Consequently, our simulations with two or three planets initially in low-eccentricity orbits at a = 0.05 − 0.15 AU (i.e., excluding 2pl-K and 3pl-σ) predict mean (median) final eccentricities for the active systems that are ≃ 1.3 − 8 (≃ 1.5 − 14) times smaller than those observed in the exoplanets in a similar semi-major axis range ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Ta- ble 3</ref>). Moreover, if we include planets from the inactive systems the mean and median eccentricities will be even smaller. For instance, the mean (median) eccentricities for all (active + inactive) planets in each simulation is ≃ 1.6 − 9 (≃ 2 − 12) times smaller than the observed values.</p><p>The previous result holds even for the simulations with three Jupiter-like planets initially at semi-major axes as large as a = 0.15 − 0.45 AU because the mean (median) eccentricities of planets in active systems is 1.5 (1.3) times smaller than those observed in the data. This result breaks down when placing the planets at a = 2.5−7.5 AU because these simulations predict mean and median eccentricities in active systems that are larger by a factor of ≃ 2 than those observed in the data. However, this simulation can be made consistent with the data by adding a significant fraction of inactive systems. The eccentricities in the simulations above are larger that those in the fiducial simulation because of the dramatic decrease in the relative number of planet collisions in active systems as we increase the semi-major axis (or θ 2 in Eq. 1).</p><p>In 2pl-K and 3pl-σ we initialized the orbits with a broad eccentricity distribution (mean of 0.125) that might result from a previous dynamically active phase when the gas disk is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Libert &amp; Tsiganis 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lega et al. 2013</ref>). As discussed in §4.1 and §4.4, these simulations starts close to the dispersion-dominated regime, in contrast to the rest of the simulations which are well in the shear-dominated regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hénon &amp; Petit 1986)</ref>. We observe, however, that even in these more extreme conditions planet-planet collisions dominate the branching ratios, limiting the eccentricity excitation. By considering that realistic ensembles would contain a mixture of active and in actives systems our conclusion that scattering at small semi-major axis is unable to explain the observations can still hold.</p><p>Our simulations suggest that in order to have final eccentricities that are as high as in the observations the initial eccentricities had to be previously excited to e 0.1. In principle, eccentricity excitation could be produced by effects that we have ignored in our simulations. For instance, a combination of tides with the host star, secular precession effects, and secular interactions with a relatively distant companion can lead to eccentricity excitation of a close-in planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wu &amp; Goldreich 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia et al. 2012</ref>). However, this mechanism requires a companion in particular orbital configurations and specific values of tidal dissipation that might not be present in the bulk of planetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that during the assembly of our initial systems, the planets had crossed high-order mean motion resonances (e.g., 3 : 1, 4 : 1, and so on) that could lead to eccentricity and inclination excitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Libert &amp; Tsiganis 2009)</ref>. This possibility is speculative and would require convergent migration of planets in which case planet-planet scattering is likely to have occurred before the planets reach semi-major axis that are as small as in our simulations. Also, the gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk could potentially excite eccentricities during the assembly of our initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tsang et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>We expect that simulations with more than three planets would present a similar behavior as our three-planet experiments. Our expectation is guided by the experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref> who find that regardless of the initial conditions and initial number of planets, the systems almost always reach a point in which there are three planets. There might be two shortcomings with this reasoning. First, having many planets in active systems can leave the three planets in orbits with significant eccentricities, which reduces the merger cross section. Second, after several merger events the planets can increase their masses and, therefore, their escape velocities. Both effect can reduce the rate of collisions.</p><p>Tidal dissipation with the host star should significantly affect the long-term dynamical evolution of close-in planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Matsumura et al. (2008)</ref> suggest that indeed some of the observed eccentric close-in planets are in the process of getting tidally circularized. We have, however, ignored the effect of tides in our calculations. We expect that the main effect would be to damp the eccentricities and given that we are mostly interested in determining the maximum efficiency of planet-planet scattering at producing high eccentricities, the effect of tides would only make our conclusion stronger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Planet-planet scattering and migration</head><p>From our main result, we can draw the following straightforward conclusion: if planet-planet scattering is responsible for the highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits seen in many exoplanets with small semimajor axes, then the scattering must have occurred at much larger orbital separations.</p><p>Interestingly, this conclusion links the migration mechanism or assembly process with the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations. For instance, we can rule out the scenario in which planets undergo disk-driven migration to small radii with no eccentricity and inclination excitation. We can also rule out the scenario in which planets are assembled in close-in nearly circular and planar orbits, for instance as a result of a binary merger, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martin et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our results would support a scenario in which planetplanet scattering excites the eccentricities and inclinations either before or early on in the migration process, so long as these are not damped during migration.</p><p>In this context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moorhead &amp; Adams (2005)</ref> did a parametric study of type II migration coupled with planetplanet scattering and found that in order to explain the observations disk migration requires that | ˙ e/e| 3 | ˙ a/a|, where ˙ e &lt; 0 ( ˙ a &lt; 0) is the time-derivative of the eccentricity (semi-major axis). For eccentricity damping more efficient than this limit, planets end-up with eccentricities that are too small by the time they reach a ∼ 0.1 AU. On the other hand, observational constraints from planet pairs thought to be trapped in orbital resonances during convergent migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lee &amp; Peale 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goldreich &amp; Schlichting 2013)</ref>, as well as hydrodynamic simulations 7 (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cresswell et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bitsch et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kley &amp; Nelson 2012)</ref> seem to indicate that | ˙ e/e| ≫ | ˙ a/a|. This would mean that eccentricity damping occurs much faster than migration, so even if scattering excites eccentricities early on during migration these eccentricities would be damped by the time the planet migrated to a ∼ 0.1 AU. This might pose a problem for diskdriven migration scenarios. Direct hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the gravitational interaction between planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moeckel et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Moeckel &amp; Armitage 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lega et al. 2013</ref>) or planet population models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ida et al. 2013</ref>) might shed light on this issue.</p><p>These difficulties with disk migration are not present (or, at least, replaced with different difficulties) in models of the formation of Hot Jupiters through higheccentricity migration. In these models, planets are scattered to high eccentricities and inclinations at large semi-major axes, and then migrate inwards through tidal dissipation by the host star. Numerical simulations have shown that this mechanism can produce closein planets in highly eccentric and inclined orbits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nagasawa et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beaugé &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY</head><p>We carried out a large number of orbit integrations of close-in two-and three-planet systems (0.05 AU&lt; a &lt; 0.15 AU) and studied whether planet-planet scattering can excite high-eccentricity and high-inclination orbits. We show that this mechanism is almost never able to excite eccentricities larger than ∼ 0.3 and inclinations larger than 10 • , and the most likely outcome is typically e 0.1 and i 5 0 .</p><p>This remarkably low efficiency of eccentricity and inclination excitation results from the prevalence of planetplanet collisions, which is an unavoidable outcome of unstable systems in regimes where the circular velocity exceeds the escape velocity from the planets.</p><p>We conclude that if planet-planet scattering is responsible for the highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits seen in many exoplanets with small semi-major axes, then the scattering must have occurred at much larger orbital separations. This result constrains theories of planet formation by disk migration: the eccentricities and inclinations observed in extrasolar planets must be excited before or early in the migration process, and migration must shrink the semi-major axis by ∼ 1−2 orders of magnitude without damping the eccentricity or inclination.</p><p>CP acknowledges support from the CONICYT Bicentennial Becas Chile fellowship.

Each system was followed for 10 6 yr. The colors label the different final outcomes. The log of the initial semi-major axis is drawn uniformly distributed in a = 0.05 − 0.15 AU with minimum initial spacing given by K = 3 in Equation (3). The initial eccentricities and inclinations follow a Rayleigh distribution with σx = 0.01 (Eq. 2). The dashed lines in the upper panel show the curves a(1 + e) = 0.05 AU and a(1 − e) = 0.15 AU. Note that there are three red circles for each system in which all three planets survive, so such systems might appear more common in these scatter plots than they actually are. Fifteen additional systems are not plotted because all three planets were lost.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We follow Chatterjee et al. (2008) in using the time to the first change in the semi-major axis of any planet by at least 10% as a measure of the dynamical instability growth timescale.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> For planets colliding with low eccentricities, one can show that the mass-weighted eccentricity vector is conserved during the collision: ec = (1 − ν)e 1 + νe 2 , where ν = M 2 /(M 1 + M 2 ) (e.g., Hénon &amp; Petit 1986).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> This mass-radius relation is also equivalent to fixing the planets&apos; escape velocity to that of Jupiter (i.e., M/R = M J /R J ) because it results in the same condition for collisions for this particular value of the mass ratio β: distance between planets &lt; 2R J .</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> Note, however, that hydrodynamic simulations show that for massive planets (M &gt; 5M J ) disk-planet interaction can lead to eccentricity excitation (e.g., Bitsch et al. 2013; Dunhill et al. 2013).</note>
