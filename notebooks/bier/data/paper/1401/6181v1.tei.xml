				<p>Determination of an exoplanet&apos;s mass is a key to understanding its basic properties , including its potential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are predominantly based on radial velocity (RV) measurements, which are not suited for planets with low masses, large semi-major axes, or those orbiting faint or active stars. Here, we present a method to extract an exoplanet&apos;s mass solely from its transmission spectrum. We find good agreement between the mass retrieved for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b from transmission spectroscopy with that from RV measurements. Our method will be able to retrieve the masses of Earth-sized and super-Earth planets using data from future space telescopes that were initially designed for atmospheric characterization .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With over 900 confirmed exoplanets (1) and over 2300 planetary candidates known (2), research priorities are moving from planet detection to planet characterization. In this context, a planet's mass is a fundamental parameter because it is connected to a planet's internal and atmospheric structure and it affects basic planetary processes such as the cooling of a planet, its plate tectonics (3), magnetic field generation, outgassing, and atmospheric escape. Measurement of a planetary mass can in many cases reveal the planet bulk composition, allowing to determine whether the planet is a gas giant or is rocky and suitable for life, as we know it.</p><p>Planetary mass is traditionally constrained with the radial velocity (RV) technique using single-purpose dedicated instruments. The RV technique measures the Doppler shift of the stellar spectrum to derive the planet-to-star (minimum) mass ratio as the star orbits the planet-star common center of mass. Although the radial velocity technique has a pioneering history of success laying the foundation of the field of exoplanet detection, it is mainly effective for massive planets around relatively bright and quiet stars. Most transiting planets have host stars that are too faint for precise radial velocity measurements. For sufficiently bright host stars, stellar perturbations may be larger than the planet's signal, preventing a determination of the planet mass with radial velocity measurements even for hot Jupiters (4). In the long term, the limitation due to the faintness of targets will be reduced with technological improvements. However, host star perturbations may be a fundamental limit that cannot be overcome, meaning that the masses of small planets orbiting quiet stars would remain out of reach. Current alternative mass measurements to RV are based on modulations of planetary-system light curves (5) or transittiming variations (6). The former works for massive planets on short period orbits and involves detection of both beaming and ellipsoidal modulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The latter relies on gravitational perturbations of a companion on the transiting planet's orbit. This method is most successful 2 for companions that are themselves transiting and in orbital resonance with the planet of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. For unseen companions the mass of the transiting planet is not constrained, but an upper limit on the mass of the unseen companion can be obtained to within 15 to 50% (10).</p><p>Transiting exoplanets are of special interest because the size of a transiting exoplanet can be derived from its transit light curve and combined with its mass, if known, to yield the planet's density, constraining its internal structure and potential habitability. Furthermore, the atmospheric properties of a transiting exoplanet can be retrieved from the host-star light passing through its atmosphere when it transits, but the quality of atmospheric retrieval is reduced if the planet's mass is inadequately constrained (11).</p><p>Here, we introduce MassSpec, a method for constraining the mass of transiting exoplanets based solely on transit observations. MassSpec extracts a planet's mass through its influence on the atmospheric scale height. It simultaneously and self-consistently constrains the mass and the atmosphere of an exoplanet, provides independent mass constraints for transiting planets accessible to RV, and allows us to determine the masses for transiting planets for which the radial velocity method fails.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MassSpec: Concept and Feasibility</head><p>The mass of a planet affects its transmission spectrum through the pressure profile of its atmosphere (i.e., p(z) where z is the altitude), and hence its atmospheric absorption profile. For an ideal gas atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure varies with the altitude as </p><p>where k is Boltzmann's constant and T , µ and g are the local (i.e., altitude dependent) temperature, mean molecular mass, and gravity. By expressing the local gravity in terms of the planet's 3 sizes (mass, M p , and radius, R p ), Eq. 1 can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M p = kT R 2 p µGH .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Thus, our method conceptually requires constraining the radius of the target as well as its atmospheric temperature, mean molecular mass, and scale height.</p><p>A planet transmission spectrum can be seen as a wavelength-dependent drop in the apparent brightness of the host star when the planet transits ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.1)</ref>. At a wavelength with high atmospheric absorption, λ 1 , the planet appears larger than at a wavelength with lower atmo-  The apparent radius of a planet relates directly to its atmospheric properties due to their effect on its opacity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">πR 2 p (λ) = π [R p,0 + h ef f (λ)] 2 = ∞ 0 2πr(1 − e −τ (r,λ) ) dr,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where R p,0 , h ef f (λ), and e −τ (r,λ) are respectively a planetary radius of reference-i.e., any radial distance at which the body is optically thick in limb-looking over all the spectral band of interest, the effective atmosphere height, and the planet's transmittance at radius r <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 2)</ref>. </p><p>where r = √ r 2 + x 2 and n i (r ) and σ i (T (r ), p(r ), λ) are the number density and the extinction cross section of the i th atmospheric component at the radial distance r (13). In other words, a planet's atmospheric properties [n i (z), T (z), and p(z)] are embedded in its transmission spectrum through τ (r, λ) (Eqs. 3 and 4). Transmittance as a function of the radius at wavelengths with high and low atmospheric absorption-λ 1 (solid lines) and λ 2 (dash-dotted lines), respectively. Due to higher atmospheric absorption at λ 1 , the planet will appear larger than it does at λ 2 , because of the more-extended opaque atmospheric annulus [h ef f (λ 1 )) &gt; h ef f (λ 2 )] that translates into an additional flux drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. 5</p><p>The integral in Eq. 3 can be split at the radius of reference (because the planet is opaque at all λ at smaller radii), and thus Eq. 3 becomes</p><p>[R p,0 + h ef f (λ)] 2 = R 2 p,0 + R p,0 c, </p><p>The embedded atmospheric information can be straightforwardly accessed for most optically active wavelength ranges using</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h ef f (λ) = R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where γ EM is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (14)-γ EM = lim n→+∞ n k=1 1 k −ln n ≈ 0.57722</p><p>(Supplementary Materials Text 1) (12). In the above equation, B is a multiple of the dimensionless scale height and A λ is an extended slant-path optical depth at reference radius. The exact formulation of B and A λ depends on the extinction processes affecting the transmission spectrum at λ <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S.</ref>1). For Rayleigh scattering,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B = H R p,0 and (8) A λ = 2πR p,0 Hn sc,0 σ sc (λ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where n sc,0 and σ sc (λ) are the number density at R p,0 and the cross-section of the scatterers.</p><p>Conceptually, Eq. 7 tells us the altitude where the atmosphere becomes transparent for a given slant-path optical depth at a radius of reference, A λ . For example, if A λ is 10 4 then the atmosphere becomes transparent at ≈ 9 scale heights above the reference radius.</p><p>Most importantly, Eq. 7 reveals the dependency of a transmission spectrum on its key parameters: in particular, A λ is dependent in unique ways on the scale height, the reference pressure, the temperature and the number densities of the main atmospheric absorbents (Supplementary Materials Text A.4), which lead to the mean molecular mass. The uniqueness of these dependencies enables the independent retrieval of each of these key parameters. Therefore, a planet's mass can be constrained uniquely by transmission spectroscopy (Eq. 2).</p><p>3 MassSpec: Applications</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gas giants</head><p>With available instruments, MassSpec is applicable only to hot Jupiters. Their mean molecular mass is known a priori (H/He-dominated atmosphere: µ ≈ 2.3) and their temperature is inferred from, e.g., emission spectroscopy. Hence, high SNR/resolution transmission spectra are not required to constrain their mean molecular mass and temperature independently. Therefore, the measurement of the Rayleigh-scattering slope in transmission is sufficient to yield the mass of a hot Jupiter because it relates directly to its atmospheric scale height. Because A λ depends solely on λ through σ sc (λ) for Rayleigh scattering (Eq. 9), by using the scaling law function for the Rayleigh-scattering cross section, σ sc (λ) = σ 0 (λ/λ 0 ) α , Eq. 7 leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">αH = dR p (λ) d ln λ ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>with α = -4 (15). Therefore, using Eqs. 2 and 10 the planet mass can be derived from</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">M p = − 4kT [R p (λ)] 2 µG dRp(λ) d ln λ .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Based on estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref> of T ≈ 1300 K, dR p (∼ 0.8 µm)/d ln λ ≈ -920 km, and R p (∼ 0.8 µm) ≈ 1.21R Jup derived from emission and transmission spectra, MassSpec's estimate of HD 189733b's mass is 1.15 M Jup . This is in excellent agreement with the mass derived from RV measurements [1.14±0.056M <ref type="bibr">Jup (18)</ref>] for this extensively observed Jovian exoplanet.</p><p>MassSpec's application to gas giants will be particularly important for gas giants whose star's activity prevents a mass measurement with RV [e.g., the hottest known planet, WASP-33b (4)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Super-Earths &amp; Earth-sized Planets</head><p>The pool of planets accessible to MassSpec will extend down to super-Earths and Earth-sized planets thanks to the high SNR spectra expected from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST;</p><p>launch date 2018) and the Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (EChO; ESA M3 mission candidate). We estimate that with data from JWST, MassSpec could yield the mass of miniNeptunes, super-Earths, and Earth-sized planets up to distances of 500 pc, 100 pc, and 50 pc, respectively, for M9V stars and 200 pc, 40 pc and 20 pc for M1V stars or stars with earlier spectral types ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref>; Supplementary Text B.4). For EChO the numbers would be 250 pc, 50 pc and 13 pc, and 100 pc, 20 pc and 6 pc, respectively.</p><p>In particular, if MassSpec would be applied to 200 hrs of in-transit observations of superEarths transiting an M1V star at 15 pc with JWST, it would yield mass measurements with a relative uncertainty of ∼ 2%(∼ 10%)[∼ 15%] for hydrogen(water) <ref type="bibr">[nitrogen]</ref>-dominated atmospheres (Figs. S.9, 4, and S.10). The larger significance of the mass measurements obtained for hydrogen-dominated super-Earths results from higher SNR of their transmission spectra, which is due to the larger extent of the atmosphere because of the smaller mean molecular mass of H/He. For the same super-Earths with hydrogen(water)-dominated atmospheres, EChO's data should yield mass measurements with a relative uncertainty of ∼ 3%(∼ 25%) (Figs. S.11 and S.12), respectively; for a nitrogen world in the same configuration it will not be possible to constrain the mass <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.13</ref>).</p><p>In the future era of 20-meter space telescopes, sufficiently high quality transmission spectra Using JWST, MassSpec could yield the mass of super-Earth and Earth-sized planets up to the distance shown by the black dashed, and dotted lines, respectively. Similarly, the maximum distance to Earth for MassSpec's application based on EChO's observations of a mini-Neptune, a super-Earth, and an Earth-sized planets are shown by the blue solid, dashed, and dotted lines, respectively. The green dotted line refers to the case of an Earth-sized planet observed with a 20-meter space telescope. The grey area show the stars too bright for JWST/NIRSpec in the R=1000 mode (J-band magnitude 7).</p><p>of Earth-sized planets will be available <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. By using MassSpec, such facilities could yield the mass of Earth-sized planets transiting a M1V star (or stars with earlier spectral types) at 15 pc with a relative uncertainty of ∼ 5% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.17</ref>). For M9V stars, it would be possible to constrain the mass of Earth-sized planets up to 200 pc and for M1V stars or stars with earlier spectral types, up to 80 pc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 3</ref>).   The panels show the same quantities as on <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The atmospheric properties (number densities, scale height, and temperature) are retrieved with significance yielding to a mass measurement with a relative uncertainty of ∼ 8%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Habitable Earth-Sized Planets Around Late M dwarfs in the Next Decade</head><p>Late M dwarfs are favorable for any in-transit information such as transmission spectra because of their large ratio of radiance over projected area ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S.19</ref>). For that reason MassSpec can be applied to late M dwarfs more distant than other stars, for a given planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 3)</ref>. If they exist, Earth-sized planets may be detected around late M dwarfs before JWST's launch by SPECU-LOOS (Search for Habitable Planets Eclipsing Ultra-cool Stars), a European Research Council mission that will begin observing the coolest M dwarfs in 2016. Their mass will not be constrained by RV because of the faintness of their host stars. However, MassSpec's application to their JWST's spectra will yield both their masses and atmospheric properties <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 5)</ref>, hence the assessment of their potential habitability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">JWST-EChO Synergy</head><p>Time prioritization of JWST and EChO taking into account their synergy would increase the science delivery of both missions. Because the smaller aperture of EChO would enable it to observe brighter stars (i.e., early-type and close-by stars), EChO's and JWST's time could be respectively prioritized on super-Earths and Earth-sized planets for M9V stars closer than 25 pc and for M1V stars (or stars with earlier spectral type) closer than 10 pc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 3)</ref>. Similarly, EChO's and JWST's time could be respectively prioritized on gas giants and superEarths for M9V stars closer than 125 pc and for M1V stars (or stars with earlier spectral type) closer than 50 pc. EChO would be particularly useful to determine the mass-and atmospheric properties-of gas giants because its wide spectral coverage would allow to measure their Rayleigh-scattering slope at short wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Clouds Will Not Overshadow MassSpec</head><p>Clouds are known to be present in exoplanet atmospheres (20) and to affect transmission spectra by limiting the apparent extent of the molecular absorption bands because the atmospheric layers below the cloud deck are not probed by the observations (21). Therefore, the higher the cloud deck, the larger the error bars are with the MassSpec retrieval method due to the reduced amount of atmospheric information available. For example, the uncertainty on the mass estimate of a water-dominated super-Earth with a cloud deck at 1 mbar is twice the uncertainty obtained for the same planet with a cloud-free atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Supplementary Text B.4</ref>). However, clouds will not render MassSpec ineffectual because they are not expected for pressures below 1 mbar <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref>-which is at least three orders of magnitude (i.e., seven scale heights) deeper than the lowest pressure probed by transmission spectroscopy. In other words, there will always be atmospheric information available from transmission spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Complementarity of MassSpec and RV</head><p>Transmission spectroscopy is suited for low-density planets and atmospheres and bright or large</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">stars (signal ∝ ρ −1 p µ −1 T R 0.5</formula><p>), whereas radial velocity measurements are ideal for massive planets and low-mass stars (signal ∝ M p M −0.5</p><p>). Therefore, each mass-retrieval method is optimal in a specific region of the planet-star parameter space (Supplementary Text C), making both methods complementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Possible Insights Into Planetary Interiors</head><p>Mass and radius are not always sufficient to obtain insights into a planet's interior. MassSpec's simultaneous constraints on a planet's atmosphere and bulk density may help to break this degeneracy, in some cases. A precision on a planet mass of 3 to 15%, combined with the planetary radius can yield the planetary average density and hence bulk composition. Even with a relatively low precision of 10 to 15%, it is possible to infer whether or not a planet is predominantly rocky or predominantly composed of H/He <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. With a higher planet mass precision, large ranges of planetary compositions can be ruled out for high-and low-mass planets, possibly revealing classes of planets with intermediate density to terrestrial-like or ice or giant planets with no solar system counterpart (25). Typically the bulk density alone cannot break the planet interior composition degeneracy, especially for planets of intermediate density.</p><p>However, measurement of atmospheric species may add enough information to reduce some 13 of the planet interior composition degeneracies-e.g., the rejection of H/He as the dominant species yields constraint on the bulk composition, independently of the mass uncertainty.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> to <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(39)</ref> i</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Key parameters of and their effects on a transmission spectrum</head><p>Here, we derive analytically the dependencies of a transmission spectrum on its main parameters for different extinction processes. In particular, we show that the apparent height takes the form R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ) for extinction processes such as Rayleigh scattering, collision-induced absorption (CIA), and molecular absorption for most optically active wavelength ranges. R p,0 B is a multiple of the scale height and A λ is an extended slant-path optical depth at R p,0 . B and A λ summarize how a planet's atmospheric properties are embedded in its transmission spectrum. In particular, the formulation of B and A λ reveal the key parameters behind a planet's transmission spectrum. The formulation of B and A λ (i.e., the way the atmospheric properties are embedded by transmission spectroscopy) depends on the extinction processes. Therefore, we first approach in details the case of Rayleigh scattering-or any processes with an extinction cross-section independent of T and p. Then we extend our demonstration to other processes such as CIA and molecular absorption.</p><p>For the coming demonstrations, we will use the following assumptions: (a1) the extent of the optically active atmosphere is small compared to the planetary radius (z R p (λ)), (a2) the atmosphere can be assumed isothermal (d z T (R p (λ)) 0), and (a3) the atmosphere can be assumed isocompositional, d z X i (R p (λ)) 0 (where X i is the mixing ratio of the i th atmospheric constituent). For a later generalization, we specify for each case at which step these assumptions are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Dependency for Rayleigh scattering</head><p>For extinction processes like Rayleigh scattering, the cross section is independent of pressure and temperature [σ λ = f λ (T, p)] therefore, using the assumptions a1, a2, and a3, the slant-path ii optical depth (Eq. 4) can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">τ (z, λ) = i σ i (λ)n i,0 e −z/H 2π(R p,0 + z)H, (S.1)</formula><p>where the last term comes from the integral over dx <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref>, or as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">τ (y, λ) A λ e −y/B , where    y = z/R p,0 A λ = 2πR p,0 H i n i,0 σ i (λ) B = H/R p,0 , (S.2)</formula><p>i.e., y and B are the dimensionless altitude and atmospheric scale height, respectively, and A λ is the slant-path optical depth at the reference radius-we recall that the reference radius in any radial distance at which the body is optically thick in limb-looking over all the spectral band of interest.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 Summary and Discussion</head><p>Now that we have gone through all the different extinction processes, we can find out what formulation of the effective height is generally true and reveal the key parameters behind a planet's transmission spectrum. We demonstrate that the slant-path optical depth (Eq. 4) is of the form τ (y, λ) = A λ e −y/B , for most λ. As a result, the apparent atmospheric height can be expressed as h ef f = R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ). We show the appropriateness of our demonstration x Dependency A λ and B record the dependency of a planet's transmission spectrum on atmospheric properties in ways that vary based on the extinction process and the regime effectively recorded at λ (Table S.1). While B is solely affected by H, A λ is affected in independent ways by the following parameters:</p><p>• The scale height, H, affects A λ through √ H for all extinction processes-geometry factor from the light path.</p><p>• The number densities of the main atmospheric absorbents, n i , affects A λ proportionally for molecular absorption (recall Λ κ p 0 = n i,0 S i,j(λ) (T )A i,j(λ) (λ)) and for Rayleigh scattering, while their square affect A λ for CIA-resulting in stronger constraints on n i when assessed primarily from CIA signal.</p><p>• The reference pressure, p 0 , affects A λ for molecular absorption in the Voigt-to-Doppler</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">regime (A λ ∝ p 0.5 0 if p ∼ a κ and A λ ∝ p 1 0 if p a κ )</formula><p>, which is recorded by most of the spectral bins.</p><p>• The temperature, T , affects A λ in two ways: (i) through Λ κ due to the line-intensity dependence on T (as a third-order polynomial) and (ii) through the line-profile dependence on T (T w -dependency of the line broadening). In addition, processes like CIA are also dependent on T , in a way that is known a priori from quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</p><p>Although both the information on the temperature and the number densities are embedded in Λ κ , T and n i affect Λ κ in specific/unique way. Λ κ ∝ n i independently of λ, while it depends on T in a way that varies with λ through the line intensity and profile-dependency known a priori from quantum mechanics or lab measurements.</p><p>In summary, the key parameters of a transmission spectrum-the atmospheric scale height, the number densities of the main absorbents, the temperature, and the pressure-affect it indexi pendently. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to retrieve independently each of these parameters, although they are embedded in the spectrum. </p><note type="other">and B to the regimes recorded Extinction process-Recorded regime A λ B Rayleigh scattering 2πR p,0 H</note><formula xml:id="formula_43">i n i,0 σ i (λ) H R p,0 Collision Induced Absorption πR p,0 H i K i (T )n 2 i,0 H 2R p,0 Molecular absorption Doppler regime (p &lt; a κ ) 2πR p,0 H Λ κ aκ bκ p 0 H R p,0 Voigt-to-Doppler transition regime (p 2 &lt; b κ ) if p ∼ a κ 4 3 πR p,0 H Λ κ 2 √ aκ bκ p 1.5 0 H 1.5R p,0 if p a κ πR p,0 H Λ κ 1 bκ p 2 0 H 2R p,0 Voigt regime if p 2 ∼ b κ a 2 κ 2πR p,0 H Λ κ 2 √ bκ p 0 H R p,0</formula><p>Discussion The analytical derivations performed in this section required using the three following assumptions: (a1) the extent of the optically active atmosphere is small compared to the planetary radius (z R p ), (a2) the atmosphere can be assumed isothermal</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">[d z T (R p (λ)) 0],</formula><p>and (a3) the atmosphere can be assumed isocompositional</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">[d z X i (R p (λ)) 0]</formula><p>. We discuss below how Section A's conclusions are mostly unaffected by the relaxation of the assumptions a2 and a3-a1 being justified. In particular, we explain conceptually that the effect of each key parameter remains unique while relaxing these assumptions, meaning that MassSpec can be applied to any exoplanet atmosphere, theoretically.</p><p>The analytical derivations become more complex if assumptions a2 and a3 are relaxed, therefore we cannot extend the derivations for the general case. Yet, it is possible to describe conceptually how these relaxations affect the results of this section. The overall effect of a change in T cannot be compensated/mimicked by other atmospheric parameters because it is specific-and a priori known. For example, although a local decrease in temperature could be compensated at the zeroth order by an increase of the local number densities:</p><p>• The increase in number densities required to compensate the change in the line intensities will be inconsistent with the increase required to mitigate the change in local pressure.</p><p>While a molecule's local number density will have to scale as a third order polynomial to compensate line intensity changes, it should scale as 1/T to compensate the change in pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>xiii</head><p>• The compensation enabled by an increase in number densities is wavelength-independent while the effect of T on the absorption coefficient is strongly wavelength-dependent.</p><p>(ii) A non-isocompositional atmosphere translates into different number density scale height for each component. Alike in the case of temperature changes, changes in composition affect the slant-path in specific ways, preserving MassSpec's capability for obtaining independent constraints on the parameters of the mass equation (Eq. 2). A change in number density is species specific and, hence, cannot be compensated by a change in temperature, scale height or reference pressure.</p><p>In some case, molecules such as water may require the use of an individual scale height for</p><p>proper retrieval. The use of individual scale heights will be of primary importance for planets in habitable zone as a significantly smaller scale height for the water number density could indicate the presence of water surface reservoir (a key to assessing habitability). For such applications, comparisons with the scale height of other molecules will be required. Molecules that are expected to present constant mixing ratio throughout the atmosphere could then be considered as independent markers to extract the pressure scale height. The best marker candidate is carbon dioxide because (i) it is a molecule chemically stable that is thus well-mixed in a planet's atmosphere and (ii) it presents numerous strong absorption bands that enable CO 2 detection at low abundance (down to ∼ 0.1ppm). In the extreme cases where water and carbon dioxide are depleted from a planet's atmosphere due to condensation, nitrogen and/or hydrogen-which are known to be chemically stable at temperatures leading to CO 2 condensation-would be the dominant species and, hence, the primary marker for the pressure scale.</p><p>Modeling transmission spectra by solving h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ] As shown in Section A.1, the apparent height is of the form R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ) when τ eq ≈ 0.56. We show in <ref type="figure">Fig. S</ref>.5 that for 50% of the optically active bins, our formulation for h ef f is still adequate xiv for Earth, i.e., for a planet with atmospheric temperature and mixing ratios strongly dependent on the altitude. We emphasize in <ref type="figure">Fig. S.6</ref> that water is the main origin for the deviation of τ eq 's distribution from ∼ 0.56 shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. S</ref>.5. The removal of water from Earth's atmosphere leads to τ eq ≈ 0.56 for 80% of the active bins. The effect of water on τ eq 's distribution is due to the strong variation of the water mixing ratio with the altitude close to Earth's surface. The strong variation of the water mixing ratio with the altitude invalidates assumption a3 and therefore the demonstration in Section A.3, meaning that h ef f deviates from the formulation R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ). As we discussed above, it is not because h ef f deviates from R p,0 B(γ EM + ln A λ ) that the specificity of the dependency of a transmission spectrum to its parameters is invalid toowe are just unable to provide the general derivation in such a general atmosphere. Note that the significant effect of a specific species's scale height on a transmission spectrum is favorable for hability assessment (see previous paragraph).</p><p>We show in <ref type="figure">Fig. S</ref>.7 the error on h ef f (λ) when modeling Earth's transmission spectra using</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ].

In the present study we focus on the medium resolution mode because MassSpec requires a sufficient spectral resolution. Furthermore, its larger spectral dispersion enables the observation of brighter stars.

Furthermore, even for current facilities significantly affected by pixel-phase like the Spitzer Space Telescope, the observations are within 10 to 20% of the photon noise after systematic correction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.4 Results &amp; Discussion</head><p>We find that future space based facilities designed for exoplanet atmosphere characterization will also be capable of mass measurements for super-Earths and Earth-sized planets with a relative uncertainty as low as ∼ 2%-a precision that has not yet been reached using RV measurements, even for the most favorable cases of hot Jupiters.</p><p>Super-Earths with JWST and EChO See Main Text (Section MassSpec's Applications).</p><p>The effect of clouds on MassSpec's Clouds are known to be present in exoplanet atmospheres (20) and to affect transmission spectra by limiting the apparent extent of the molecular absorption bands as the atmospheric layers below the cloud deck are not probed (21). However,</p><p>MassSpec is not rendered ineffectual by clouds because clouds are deeper than the lowest presxxi sure probed by transmission spectroscopy. In other words, spectral features are still detectable in the presence of clouds but with a reduced significance (compare panels A of Figs. S.14-S.16):</p><p>the higher the cloud deck, the larger is the uncertainty on the mass estimate due to the reduced amount of atmospheric information available. We show the effect of cloud decks at 100, 10, and 1 mbar in Figs. S.14, S.15, and S.16, respectively. Cloud decks at 100 and 10 mbar affect marginally MassSpec's capabilities because a limited fraction of the spectral bins probe deeper than 10 mbar in transmission. However 1 mbar cloud deck affects significantly atmospheric retrieval results, increasing the uncertainty on the mass estimate by a factor of ∼ 2 over the one derived from the cloud free scenario. The increased uncertainty in the mass estimate results mainly from an increased uncertainty on the scale height and the mean molecular mass estimates. The reason is that (1) the significance of scale-height estimates are reduced because the signatures of atmospheric species are truncated and (2) additional atmospheric scenarios are now possible (e.g., hydrogen-dominated) because numerous combination of molecular signatures could be masked by a high-cloud deck.</p><p>Pushing down to Earth-sized planets within the next decade We show that MassSpec could yield the mass of Earth-sized planets transiting late M dwarfs within 15 pc of Earth with a relative uncertainty of ≤ 8% using JWST <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 5)</ref>. This reemphasizes the key role of late M dwarfs for transmission spectroscopy as the first Earth-sized planets to be thoroughly characterized will be transiting such stars <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.19</ref>). It is therefore possible that the first Earth-sized planet to be confirmed habitable would be one of these-potentially a hot desert world (36). That is why, SPECULOOS is of particular interest for the short-and medium-term future for aiming to detect Earth-sized planets around nearby late M dwarfs. Finally, for Earth-sized planets transiting M1V stars or stars with earlier spectral types within 15 pc of Earth, we find that a future-generation 20-meter space telescope will yield their masses with a relative precision xxii ≤ 5% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.17</ref>).</p><p>Gas Giants JWST's and EChO 's observation of planets larger than super-Earths will yield to high-significance mass measurements with a limited number of transits. We estimate that for gas giants half a dozen of transits can yield mass measurements with a relative uncertainty ≤ 5%, using the scaling law (Eq. S.35). EChO would be particularly useful to determine the massand atmospheric properties-of gas giants because its wide spectral coverage would allow to measure their Rayleigh-scattering slope at short wavelengths. Independent high-significance mass measurements of targets accessible by RV will be beneficial to compare the capabilities of both techniques and to assess their future complementarity.</p><p>MassSpec's application domain See Main Text (Section MassSpec's Applications).</p><p>JWST-EChO synergy See Main Text (Section Discussion).</p><p>No false molecular detections MassSpec's applications do not lead to false molecular detections. As emphasized previously, the application of MassSpec requires a planet's transmission spectrum of sufficient quality (i.e., SNR and spectral resolution) to identify the major molecular species. Once these criteria are met, the specificity of the species' signature in extinction (shown in panels A of Figs. S.9-S.17) prevents from the false positive detection of atmospheric species. As an example, we try to retrieve ozone that was not part of the synthetic atmospheres and it is detected in none of our retrieval.</p><p>On the use of species' mixing ratio in atmospheric retrieval method Species' mixing ratios are not adequate parameters for atmospheric retrieval method. The reason is that the uncertainty on mixing ratios encompasses the uncertainty on the number densities and the pressure. We xxiii demonstrate that pressure and number densities are the atmospheric parameters embedded in a planet's transmission spectrum. This implies that pressure and mixing ratios are correlated in the context of transmission spectroscopy <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.18</ref>.A). Hence, the posterior probability distribution of mixing ratios are the results of the convolution of the number densities' and pressure's PPDs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S.18</ref>.B), i.e., the uncertainty on the mixing ratios combine the uncertainty on the number densities and the pressure. Therefore, the significance of a molecular detection based on the mixing ratio will be less significant than if based on the number densities, in particular because number densities are more constraint than the pressure. xxiv C Dependency of transmission spectroscopy and radial velocity on system parameters</p><p>Here we introduce MassSpec's sensitivity to the planetary system parameters and show MassSpec's complementarity with the radial velocity method to yield planetary mass measurements. For that purpose, we derive scaling laws to reveal the main dependency of each method's signal on the properties of the observed planetary system, such as the planet's semi-major axis.</p></div>

Therefore, at frequencies low compared to ω n , H(jω) ≈ K, meaning that the response of a mass-spring-dashpot system to a lowfrequency input, i(t) = A exp(jωt), is the input, i.e. o(t) = i(t).

It confirms that τ eq ≈ 0.56 for a significant fraction of the active bins (∼99%). In addition, we note that a large fraction of the spectral range (∼70%) recorded a {∝ P 2 }-dependency of τ . This means that transmission spectroscopy preferably records transitions from the Voigt regime to the Doppler regime. The fact that transmission spectroscopy records preferably the Voigt-to-Doppler transition regime is important because this regime embeds independent information about the pressure. The main reason is that γ V is small, therefore the spectral bins are more likely to be on a line wing, rather than close to the line center. Modeling high-resolution spectra based on solving h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ] is adequate, but not correct for all λ. In particular, we show in Fig. S.4 that for an Earth-sized planet with a isothermal and isocompositional atmosphere-same abundances as at Earth's surface-the error on h ef f (λ) is below 3% (3σ) of the scale height. An error on h ef f (λ) be- low 3% corresponds to an error of the simulated apparent height below 250 meters-which is sufficient to advocate for the adequacy of modeling transmission spectra based on solving h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ], not its correctness.</figDesc></figure>

However, the temperature can still be self- consistently retrieved from a planet's transmission spectrum because it affects specifically the slant-path optical depth profile [τ (r, λ)] through the extinction cross section profile [σ i (T (r ), p(r ), λ)]. For molecular absorption, T affects σ i (T (r ), p(r ), λ) through the line intensities and profiles in ways that are known a priori from quantum mechanics and/or lab measurements. T af- fects mainly the line intensities through the total internal partition sum (TIPS) and the Boltz- mann populations for molecular absorption. The TIPS describes the overall population of the molecule's quantum states, and is solely dependent on the molecular structure (i.e., the species) and the local temperature. The effect of temperature on the TIPS can be appropriately approxi- mated by a third order polynomial. On the other hand, the temperature effect on the population of a molecule's individual state depends solely on the temperature and the energy of the state. Therefore, the extinction cross-section depends on the temperature in ways that vary with the wavelength, in opposition to the TIPS. Finally, the temperature affects the line broadening as ∝ T w , where w is the broadening exponent and ranges from 0.4 to 0.75 in the Lorentzian regime (classical value: 0.5), while it is -0.5 in the Doppler regime (13).</figDesc></figure>

Solving h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ] solely requires knowing the parameters Λ κ , a κ , and b κ (Eq. S.23)-i.e., the dependency of each species' extinction cross-section on the pressure and the temperature-from quantum physics and/or lab measurements (28).</figDesc></figure>

The zeros and poles of f (.) are the zeros of P (.) and the zeros of Q(.), respec- tively. Rational functions are used in various fields of science and engineering (signal process- ing, acoustics, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, electronic circuitry, control theory, etc.) as mathematical representation of the relation of the inputs (i(.)) and outputs (o(.)) of a system, called the transfer function of the system. The transfer function of a system (H(s)) is the linear mapping of the Laplace/Fourier transform of its inputs (I(s) = L(i(.))) to the Laplace/Fourier transform of its outputs (O(s) = L(o(.))), i.e., O(s) = H(s)I(s) where s is a spatial or tempo- ral frequency if i and o are functions of space or time, respectively. As an example, the trans- fer function of imaging devices is the Fourier transform of the point spread function (PSF)- because the theoretical input leading to the PSF is a spatial impulse (i.e., a Dirac function) in the field of view and the Fourier transform of an impulse is one, therefore L(P SF ) = H(s).</figDesc></figure>

Relative errors for the zeroth-order derivation [h ef f (λ) = z(τ (λ) = 1)] correspond to the dotted lines, and the ones for our derivation h ef f (λ) = [z : τ (z, λ) = e −γ EM ] are the thick lines.</figDesc></figure>

(A) Dependency of f ν on T and p, at fixed ν, that shows the four domains of different dependency regimes of f ν on p whose boundaries are T -dependent (gray dot-dash lines). The black dot-dash lines represents the position of the slices in the {T − p − f } space used to highlight that f ν behaves as a rational function of p, at {T, ν} fixed. Planels B and C present the slices at T = 1200K and T = 200K, respectively. These slices show that f ν behaves as a rational function of p with a zero and a pair of conjugated zeros (Fig. S.20). In particular, the absolute value of the zero is less than the poles', as underscored by the sequential transition from the following dependency regimes ∝ p 0 , ∝ p 1 , ∝ p ∼0 , and ∝ p −1 with increasing p-the dotted and the dashed lines represent a slope of 1 and 2, respectively. (D) Dependency of the absorption coefficient (α ν ) on p, at T = 200K. The exponent of the α ν dependency on p increases by one compared to f ν dependency on p. The exponent increase by one because of α ν 's additional zero at p = 0 that originates from the number density. xxxi</figDesc></figure>

The correlation shown between the pressure and a species mixing ratio translates the fact that the key parameter of a planet's transmission spectrum are the number densities, not the mixing ratios. Therefore, the uncertainty on mixing ratios combine the uncertainty on the pressure and the number densities.
