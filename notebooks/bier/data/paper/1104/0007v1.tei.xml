			<abstract>
				<p>There exists strong circumstantial evidence from their eccentric orbits that most of the known extra-solar planetary systems are the survivors of violent dynamical instabilities. Here we explore the effect of giant planet instabilities on the formation and survival of terrestrial planets. We numerically simulate the evolution of planetary systems around Sun-like stars that include three components: (i) an inner disk of planetesimals and planetary embryos, (ii) three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances, and (iii) an outer disk of planetesimals comparable to estimates of the primitive Kuiper belt. We calculate the dust production and spectral energy distribution of each system by assuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smaller bodies in collisional equilibrium. Our main result is a strong correlation between the evolution of the inner and outer parts of planetary systems, i.e. between the presence of terrestrial planets and debris disks. Strong giant planet instabilities-that produce very eccentric surviving planets-destroy all rocky material in the system, including fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late, and also destroy the icy planetesimal population. Stable or weakly unstable systems allow terrestrial planets to accrete in their inner regions and significant dust to be produced in their outer regions, detectable at mid-infrared wavelengths as debris disks. Stars older than ∼ 100 Myr with bright cold dust emission (in particular at λ ∼ 70µm) signpost dynamically calm environments that were conducive to efficient terrestrial accretion. Such emission is present around ∼16% of billion-year old Solar-type stars. Our simulations yield numerous secondary results: 1) The typical eccentricities of as-yet undetected terrestrial planets are ∼0.1 but there exists a novel class of terrestrial planet system whose single planet undergoes large amplitude oscillations in orbital eccentricity and inclination; 2) By scaling our systems to match the observed semimajor axis distribution of giant exoplanets, we predict that terrestrial exoplanets in the same systems should be a few times more abundant at ∼ 0.5 AU than giant or terrestrial exoplanets at 1 AU; 3) The Solar System appears to be unusual in terms of its combination of a rich terrestrial planet system and a low dust content. This may be explained by the weak, outward-directed instability that is thought to have caused the late heavy bombardment.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Circumstellar disks of gas and dust are expected to produce three broad classes of planets in radially-segregated zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Kokubo &amp; Ida 2002)</ref>. The inner disk forms terrestrial (rocky) planets because it contains too little solid mass to rapidly accrete giant planet cores, which are thought to form preferentially beyond the snow line where the surface density in solids is higher because of ice condensation and the isolation mass is larger <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Lissauer 1987)</ref>. Terrestrial planets form in 10-100 million years (Myr) via collisional agglomeration of Moon-to Mars-sized planetary embryos and a swarm of 1-10 3 km sized planetesimals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chambers 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Raymond et al. 2006a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Raymond et al. , 2009c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">O'Brien et al. 2006</ref>). From roughly a few to a few tens of AU, giant planet cores grow and accrete gaseous envelopes if the conditions are right ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. 2005</ref>). Despite their large masses, gas giants must form within the few million year lifetime of gaseous disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Haisch et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Pascucci et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2009</ref>) and be present during the late phases of terrestrial planet growth. Resonant interactions, arising not just from giant planets but also from the changing surface density of the gas disk itself ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Nagasawa et al. 2005</ref>), thus likely play a role in terrestrial planet formation. Finally, in the outer regions of planetary systems the growth time scale exceeds the lifetime of the gas disk, and the end point of accretion is a belt of Pluto-sized (and smaller) bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kenyon &amp; Luu 1998</ref>).</p><p>Our understanding of planetary formation in these different zones is constrained by a variety of observations. The initial conditions of inner disks can be probed by observations of hot dust. Such observations have shown evidence for grain growth in individual protoplanetary disks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bouwman et al. 2008</ref>), and larger samples have shown that hot dust disappears from these disks within a few Myr and that cooler dust takes longer to disappear <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Haisch et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Mamajek et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Meyer et al. 2008</ref>). Hundreds of close-in planets -the outcome of planet formation -have been detected by radial velocity and transit observations, with masses down to a few M ⊕ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Léger et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>). The frequency of planets on short-period orbits has been found to be a function of the planet mass; less massive planets are significantly more common than high-mass "hot Jupiters" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Mayor et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Howard et al. 2010</ref>). The frequency of 3-10 M ⊕ planets has been measured at 12%, and by extrapolation the frequency of 0.5-2 M ⊕ is 23% (for orbital periods less than 50 days; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Howard et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the existence of hot Jupiters around ∼ 1% of solartype stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Howard et al. 2010</ref>), the vast majority of giant planets is found beyond 1 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Udry &amp; Santos 2007)</ref>. The absolute frequency of giant planets is poorly constrained; estimates range from 10% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Cumming et al. 2008</ref>) to more than 50% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gould et al. 2010</ref>). These planets are characterized by their broad eccentricity distribution that includes several planets with e ≥ 0.9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. (2006)</ref>. This distribution is quantitatively reproduced if giant planets form in systems with multiple planets, and dynamical instabilities occurred in 70-100% of all observed systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chatterjee et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010)</ref>. The onset of instability may be caused by the changing planet-planet stability criterion as the gas disk dissipates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Iwasaki et al. 2001</ref>), resonant migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams &amp; Laughlin 2003)</ref>, or chaotic dynamics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chambers et al. 1996</ref>). Whatever the trigger, the instability leads to a phase of planet-planet scattering and in most cases to the eventual removal of one or more planets from the system by collision or hyperbolic ejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Weidenschilling &amp; Marzari 1996)</ref>. It is the surviving planets that match the observed distribution. The properties of the outer Solar System are consistent with the giant planets having formed in a similarly unstable configuration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Thommes et al. 1999</ref>), though the low eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn (e J ≈ e S ≈ 0.05), and the late timing of the Late Heavy Bombardment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Strom et al. 2005)</ref>, hint that the instability that occurred in our Solar System was weak and occurred too late to affect terrestrial accretion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Morbidelli et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Sub-millimeter observations of dust disks around young stars provide information on the initial conditions in outer planet-forming disks, and by extrapolation to entire disks. These observations suggest that the typical protoplanetary disk has a mass of 0.001-0.1 Solar masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Andrews &amp; Williams 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Eisner et al. 2008</ref>) and a radial surface density profile of roughly r −(0.5−1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Mundy et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Isella et al. 2010</ref>). There appears to be a roughly linear trend between the dust mass and the stellar mass such that the typical protoplanetary disk contains a few percent of the stellar mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Andrews &amp; Williams 2007a)</ref>, which has important implications for the planet frequency as a function of stellar mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ida &amp; Lin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Raymond et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Greaves 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Debris disks -warm or cold dust observed around older stars, typically at infrared wavelengths (λ ∼ 10−100µm) -probe outer disks after planet formation has completed. Debris disks provide evidence for the existence of leftover planetesimals because the lifetime of observed dust particles under the effects of collisions and radiation forces is far shorter than the typical stellar age, implying a replenishment via collisional grinding of larger bodies. Spitzer observations show that about 15% of solar-type stars younger than 300 Myr have significant dust excesses at 24µm but that this fraction decreases to about 3% for stars older than 1 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Meyer et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carpenter et al. 2009)</ref>. At 70µm the fraction of stars showing significant excesses is roughly constant in time (at ∼ 16%) but the upper envelope of the distribution decreases with the stellar age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trilling et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gáspár et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carpenter et al. 2009)</ref>. A stars have a significantly higher fraction of dust excesses at both 24 and 70µm and the excesses themselves are brighter than for FGK stars but the dust lifetime is shorter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Su et al. 2006</ref>). Very few debris disks are known around M dwarfs and the dust brightness is necessarily far lower than for higher-mass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gautier et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Here we perform a large ensemble of N-body simulations to model the interactions between the different radial components of planetary systems: formation and survival of terrestrial planets, dynamical evolution and scattering of giant planets, and dust production from collisional grinding. By matching the orbital distribution of the giant planets, we infer the characteristics of as-yet undetected terrestrial planets in those same systems. We post-process the simulations to compute the spectral energy distribution of dust by treating planetesimal particles as aggregates in collisional equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dohnanyi 1969)</ref> to calculate the incident and re-emitted flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Booth et al. 2009</ref>). We then correlate outcomes in the different radial zones and link to two key observational quantities: the orbital properties of giant planets and debris disks.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we explain our choice of initial conditions, the integration method, and our debris disk calculations. In section 3 we demonstrate the detailed evolution of a single simulation in terms of its dynamics, the formation of terrestrial planets, and the dust evolution. In section 4 we present results from our fiducial set of 152 simulations and explore the correlations between terrestrial planet formation efficiency, giant planet characteristics and debris disks. In Section 5 we discuss the implications of our results: we scale our simulations to the known eccentricity-semimajor axis distribution of giant planets, discuss the observed debris disks in known exoplanet systems, and evaluate the Solar System in the context of our results. We conclude in Section 6.</p><p>In a companion paper (Raymond et al 2011; referred to in the text as Paper 2) we test the effects of several system parameters on this process: the giant planet masses and mass distribution, the width of the outer planetesimal disk, the mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk, and the presence of disk gas at the time of giant planet instabilities. We also calibrate our results to the statistics of known debris disks to produce an estimate of the fraction of solar-type stars that host terrestrial planets (η Earth in the Drake equation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>We use numerical simulations to study the formation of terrestrial planets from massive embryos, the dynamical evolution of fully-formed gas and ice giants, and the long-term evolution of debris disks, starting from an assumed set of initial conditions that are specified at the epoch when the protoplanetary gas disk dissipates. The goal is to study how these processes, occurring in spatially distinct regions of the planetary system, are coupled, and to quantify the expected dispersion in the final out-come that arises from the chaotic nature of the evolution. In what follows, we describe in detail the specific initial conditions that we adopt, together with the numerical methods. It is worth emphasizing at the outset that our initial conditions are not unique. Observationally, little is known about the radial distribution of planetesimal formation within protoplanetary disks, and as a result the single most important initial condition for subsequent planet formation is not empirically well-constrained. Our fundamental assumption is that planetesimals form across a wide range of disk radii (extending out, in particular, to encompass a cold outer debris disk), with a smooth radial distribution. We further assume that cores are able to form quickly enough to yield planets at least as massive as ice giants in typical disks <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Given these assumptions, it is likely that the system-to-system variation in the masses of giant planets -arising ultimately from dispersion in the masses and radii of the protoplanetary disksexceeds that of the terrestrial planets or that of the debris disk, because small variations in the formation time scale of cores result in large changes to the final envelope mass.</p><p>Our models are an extension of what might be described as the "classical" scenario for planet formation. Substantially different scenarios are also possible. In particular, planetesimal formation is poorly understood (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Chiang &amp; Youdin 2010)</ref>, and may be coupled to the level of intrinsic turbulence within the gaseous disk, which probably varies with radius (Gammie 1996; Armitage 2011). If planetesimal formation efficiency varies dramatically with radius, the initial conditions for subsequent planet formation would be radically different from what we have assumed, leading to qualitatively different conclusions. For example, it could be true that the zones of terrestrial and giant planet formation are typically dynamically wellseparated, contrary to what is implied by our initial conditions. In such a model, the coupling between the giant and terrestrial planets would be much weaker than occurs given our assumptions, such that only exceptionally violent giant planet scattering -such as occurs when instabilities drive e → 1 -would affect the terrestrial zone. Similar caveats apply to the outer debris disk region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Initial conditions</head><p>The initial conditions for planet formation are expected to vary with stellar mass, due both to the relatively well-understood variation of the location of the snow line with stellar type <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref>, and as a result of any systematic variations in the star-to-disk mass ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alexander &amp; Armitage 2006</ref>). We consider Solar-mass stars, and start our simulations from highly idealized initial conditions that represent the predicted state of a planetary system at the time of the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk. There are three radial zones: an inner zone containing 9M ⊕ in planetary embryos and planetesimals from 0.5 to 4 AU, three giant planets on marginally stable orbits from Jupiter's orbital distance of 5.2 AU out to ∼10 AU (depending on the masses), and an outer 10 AU-wide disk of planetesimals containing 50 M ⊕ . In the majority of simulations the giant planets underwent a violent phase of scattering but in a significant fraction they did not. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example set of initial conditions. 1 Recent calculations of planet formation via core accretion support such an assumption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Movshovitz et al. 2010)</ref>, though it should be noted that these are subject to substantial uncertainties because the physics of Type I migration remains imperfectly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Lubow &amp; Ida 2010</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. An example of the initial conditions assumed to exist shortly after the epoch of gas disk dispersal. The terrestrial planet formation zone contains planetary embryos and lower mass planetesimals, while the outer planetesimal belt contains a population of relatively low-mass (compared to the giant planets) bodies that are represented numerically by N equal mass particles. The intermediate zone contains 3 fully-formed giant planets whose spacing is such that they are marginally unstable against dynamical instability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Terrestrial planet-forming region</head><p>The terrestrial planet forming region extends from 0.5 to 4 AU. As in the bulk of terrestrial planet formation simulations the inner boundary was chosen as a compromise between simulation run time and capturing the dynamics of the inner disk (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chambers 2001</ref>).

The eccentricity distibution is not strongly affected by selection effects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>, which do however dominate the radial distribution (which is essentially unknown beyond about 5 AU). There is no unique theoretical interpretation of this result, but the most common explanation is that the eccentricity represents the endpoint of a dynamical scattering phase. Models built upon this assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chatterjee et al. 2008</ref>) can reproduce quantitatively the observed f (e) for extrasolar planets.

This may not be true, but it represents the simplest extrapolation of current observational results. We model systems of three giant planets, with the innermost giant planet given an orbital semimajor axis of 5.2 AU, the same as Jupiter's. This is an arbitrary choice which allows for easy comparison with the Solar System (assuming that Jupiter formed at 5.2 AU). Two additional planets are spaced outward with randomly-chosen separations of (in the fiducial runs) 4 − 5R H,m . This separation was chosen to select for systems that will likely become unstable on a timescale of 100,000 years or longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chatterjee et al. 2008)</ref>.

Because damping within the disk tends to stabilize planetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Iwasaki et al. 2002)</ref>, we expect the natural instability timescale to be on the order of the gas dissipation timescale.</p><p>The outcome of scattering is dependent on both the initial mass distribution (which is related to the well-constrained observed mass distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. 2006</ref>), and on the distribution of mass ratios between planets in individual systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ford et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010)</ref>. For the results shown in the paper we focus on a fiducial set of runs (called mixed in paper 2), in which the planet masses are chosen to follow the observed distribution of extra-solar planets,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dN dM ∝ M −1.1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where masses are chosen between one Saturn mass and 3 Jupiter masses. This range is chosen so as to include the majority of well-observed exoplanet systems (more massive planets are relatively uncommon, while selection effects become stronger for very low mass giants), but there is nothing particularly special about our choice. Similar models, that fit the observed constraints equally well, could almost certainly be constructed assuming different mass ranges, although it might be necessary to adopt different numbers of planets or to assume correlations between their masses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010</ref>). In our runs, the masses of individual planets are chosen independently. The radii of giant planets affect their early dynamics, by altering the ratio of physical collisions to scattering events. We adopt a constant bulk density, ρ = 1.3 g cm −3 , independent of mass, that matches that of the (present-day) Jupiter. Since young giant planets will assuredly have larger radii, our assumption underestimates the true number of physical collisions. We do not, however, consider this to be a major source of error. Planets in our mass range, formed via core accretion, are only modestly inflated at ages as short as a Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Marley et al. 2007)</ref>, and collisions are suppressed at a &gt; 5 AU because of the relatively modest orbital velocities at these radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ford et al. 2001</ref>).</p><p>As noted above, the initial conditions that we adopt for the giant planets are motivated by strictly empirical conditions: the observed mass function of extrasolar planets, and the requirement (within the context of a scattering model) that most multiple planet systems are eventually dynamically unstable. However, they are also broadly consistent with first principles models of giant planet formation , which suggest that radial migration and dynamical instability ought to be common, even prior to the dispersal of the gas disk. The specific separation of planets that we have assumed matches that expected if multiple giant planets interact with the gas disk such that they end up trapped in mean-motion resonances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Snellgrove et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lee &amp; Peale 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kley et al. 2004</ref>), provided that the majority of these resonances are broken before or shortly after the dispersal of the gas disk.

Although the parameters in this simple model have a precise physical meaning for the model as it is presented below, in practice they represent "effective" parameters that determine the mass evolution and are calibrated to match observations. For example, although we adopt the classic single power law size distribution for a collisional cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dohnanyi 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Williams &amp; Wetherill 1994)</ref>, the true size distribution of a collisional population is certainly more complicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(O'Brien &amp; Greenberg 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Kobayashi &amp; Tanaka 2010)</ref>.

This distribution spans from the smallest assumed particles D bl = 2.2 µm up to the largest D c = 2000 km. Smaller particles than D bl are assumed to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure on short enough timescales to not contribute to the size distribution (see, e.g., Wyatt 2005). The largest bodies in the distribution were chosen to match the largest known objects in the Kuiper belt, assuming that the primitive Kuiper belt represents a proxy for the accretion that would have occurred in planetesimal disks of this mass. If D c were significantly smaller then the collisional timescales would be shorter and the collisional evolution would proceed more quickly.</p><p>The surface area of a population of bodies with a collisional size distribution can be easily calculated.

As discussed above, this assumption is not realistic in terms of the collisional dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Benz &amp; Asphaug 1999</ref>), but for our purposes Q ⋆ D represents an effective strength that determines the dust production and mass loss rate from the planetesimal belt, and using a constant value allows for a good fit to the statistics of debris disks around A stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Wyatt et al. 2007b</ref>). In addition, it may not be reasonable to assume the same Q ⋆ D for asteroidal and cometary planetesimals given that their compositions are likely to be different. However, the typical collisional timescales for the largest (2000 km) bodies are very short, just a few×10 4 years, for the asteroidal planetesimal population (compared with 1 − 3 × 10 8 years for the cometary planetesimal population). Thus, asteroidal dust is severely depleted within the first 0.1-1 Myr of each system's evolution and our choice of Q ⋆ D has virtually no effect on the results.</p><p>For a given simulation timestep, we calculate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the system dust as follows (again, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Booth et al. 2009</ref> with only small modifications): -Calculate t c for the largest bodies in both asteroidal and cometary planetesimal populations. We then artificially decrease the mass of the planetesimals in each population by a factor of [1 + t/tc(D c )] −1 to account for collisional mass loss. This represents a very slow decrease for the comets but a significant mass loss among the asteroids. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> . -Divide the radial domain into N bin radial bins spaced logarithmically between 0.2 and 100 AU, which are the inner and outer boundaries of our simulation. We tested a range of <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Our procedure of decreasing the particle mass according to the collisional timescale is not completely self-consistent as our planetesimal mass did not change during the simulation itself. Given the long collisional timescales in the outer disk, this assumption has little to no effect on the outer planetary systems. This assumption also has little effect on cases in which the giant planets were unstable quickly. However, for stable simulations or simulations with delayed instabilities, this means that, in the inner disk, our dynamics is not completely true to our calculated dust flux. In other words, the amount of damping provided to growing embryos by planetesimals (via viscous stirring and dynamical friction) should realistically have been lower if we had accounted for collisional evolution of planetesimals. However, given that we compare our simulations with observed debris disks that are generally far older than the 10-100 Myr timescale for terrestrial planet formation, this does not affect our results. For a careful treatment of dust production during terrestrial planet formation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kenyon &amp; Bromley (2004)</ref> N bin values and found good convergence with N bin ≥ 30 − 50 and so we use N bin = 100 to be conservative. -Calculate the total planetesimal mass in each radial bin for asteroids and comets by sampling the orbit of each planetesimal N samp times along its orbit at intervals that are equally spaced in time (i.e., in mean anomaly). We calculate N samp = 1 + e/e limit , where e limit represents the minimum statistical eccentricity needed to cross between radial bins: e limit ≈ 0.06 in our case but we use half of that value. Thus, we sample circular orbits sparsely but more eccentric orbits up to 30 times per orbit to allow the dust to be spread over a range of orbital distances. -For each radial bin and for asteroids and comets, calculate the blackbody temperature 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">T bb = 278.3 L ⋆ L ⊙ 1/4 R 1AU −1/2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where L ⋆ is the stellar luminosity, R is the radial distance, and T bb is in Kelvin.

We consider the wavelength range from 1 to 1000 µm.</p><p>Using this method, we calculate the SED of each simulation from the orbits of all planetesimal particles at each simulation timestep. To make the SED useful for comparison with observations, the most convenient quantity is the dust flux relative to the stellar flux.

Armed with the stellar flux as well as the dust flux, we can isolate the dust-to-stellar flux ratio at any wavelength of interest such as those observed with Spitzer or Herschel.</p><p>Our simulations ran for 100-200 Myr, but we want to compare fluxes with stars at a range of ages. Thus, we need to extrapolate the expected dust fluxes into the future. We do this by making the assumption that there is no more significant dynamical evolution of the system, i.e. that the orbital characteristics of the planetesimals are not going to change in the future. Clearly, this assumption does not account for punctual events like the late heavy bombardment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gomes et al. 2005</ref>) or very late dynamical instabilities. For a given time t after the end of the simulation, we decrease the planetesimal mass by a simple factor related to the collisional timescale at the end of the simulation, i.e., as (1 + t/t c ) −1 . In terms of the global analysis of our sample of simulations, we retain snapshots of each simulation at wavelengths of 1, 3, 5, 15, 20, 25, 50, 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, 500 and 850 µm at time intervals of 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 Myr.</p><p>Our dust flux calculations compare reasonably well with observations and other models. We perform this comparison using systems that are dynamically calm (referred to as "stable systems" later in the paper), in which the giant planets remain on stable orbits throughout the simulation such that the outer planetesimal disk remains largely intact. In these stable systems, our dust flux calculations yield typical values for the dust-to-stellar-flux ratio F/F star of 0.1-0.5 at 25µm and 10-35 at 70µm after 1 Gyr of simulated dynamical and calculated collisional evolution.

During this phase of quiescent accretion, the giant planets' orbits remained almost perfectly circular, with eccentricities of less than 0.05 for each planet (less than 0.03 for the innermost gas giant). Planetesimal scattering caused a slow drift in the giant planets' semimajor axes, of 0.06 AU for the innermost (and most massive) giant planet, and less than 0.01 AU for the other two giants. During this time, the outer planetesimal disk was slowly sculpted by the giant planets. The inner edge of the planetesimal disk was eroded, and strong resonances with the outermost giant planet (low-order mean motion resonances) were slowly cleared out. At the time of the instability, roughly three quarters of the initial outer planetesimal disk was intact.</p><p>The instability began with a rapid eccentricity increase in the eccentricity of the two outer giant planets and was followed by a close encounter between those two. That set off a series of close encounters between all three giant planets that lasted 84,000 years, involved 35 planet-planet scattering events, and culminated with the ejection of the outermost giant planet. The behavior of the simulation was characteristic in terms of dynamical instabilities in that the least massive giant planet was ejected and the surviving planets were segregated by mass, with the most massive one closest to the star (at 3.65 AU) and the less massive one farther out (at 36.6 AU, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chatterjee et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>During and immediately after the giant planet instability, the inner disk was almost entirely thrown into the star. This happened by a rapid increase in embryos' and planetesimals' eccentricities mainly by secular forcing from the scattered giant planets. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Among the 3.9 M ⊕ of terrestrial material that was destroyed were 13 embryos including a 0.95 M ⊕ at 0.6 AU, a 0.62 .

All but one of the embryos -the sole survivor -collided with the star within a few hundred thousand years of the start of the instability. The rocky planetesimals were all destroyed within 1 Myr. The outer planetesimal disk was completely destabilized by the instability, as the two lowermass giant planets scattered each other to tens of AU. All planetesimals were either ejected from the system (about 85%) or collided with the star (15%). The vast majority were destroyed within 1 Myr of the instability -all but three within 5 Myr -but the last planetesimal took almost 25 million years to be ejected.</p><p>Three planets -two gas giants and one terrestrial planetsurvived to the end of the simulation, all on excited, eccentric and inclined orbits. The long-term dynamics of the two surviving giant planets is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. The eccentricities of the surviving giant planets are considerable as are their orbital inclinations with respect to the starting plane. The two giant planets have a mutual orbital inclination of ∼ 36 • . Although this is less than the formal limit of 39.2 • required for the Kozai effect to take place <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Kozai 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Takeda &amp; Rasio 2005</ref>), out of phase, Kozai-like oscillations are evident in the planets' eccentricities and inclinations. The terrestrial planet's final mass is 0.72 M ⊕ and its semimajor axis of 0.935 AU places it in the circumstellar habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Selsis et al. 2007</ref>). However, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows that the planet's orbit is strongly perturbed. Its eccentricity oscillates between 0.4 and 0.7 and its inclination between almost zero and more than 60 • on a ∼10,000 year timescale (although there other longer secular frequencies in the oscillations). On Myr timescale the orbit has a minimum and maximum eccentricity of 0.39 and 0.73 and a minimum and maximum inclination of 0.03 • and 63.3 • . Given its large eccentricity, one would expect this planet's climate to be highly variable during the year <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Williams &amp; Pollard 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Dressing et al. 2010</ref>). In addition, the changes in both its eccentricity and inclinationequivalent to changes in obliquity for a fixed spin axis -would cause variations on the secular timescales ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Spiegel et al. 2010)</ref>. Given that the orbit-averaged stellar flux increases with the orbital eccentricity (as 1 − e 2 −1/2 ) and that the planet's closest approach to the star is only 0.25 AU, this planet may not be habitable during its high-eccentricity phases. However, more detailed modeling of such planets is beyond the scope of the paper and the reader is referred to recent climate modeling papers that include the effects of varying the eccentricity and obliquity <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Williams &amp; Pollard 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Spiegel et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Dressing et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>The evolution of the dust brightness follows from the dynamical and collisional evolution of the planetesimals in the system. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the resulting spectral energy distribution at dif-  <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.

The collisional timescale for the largest planetesimals (2000 km) in the terrestrial planet forming region is only t coll ∼ 10 4 years, so the planetesimals in the inner disk are ground into hot dust within just a few million years. Thus, the total dust brightness has dropped sharply at all wavelengths by the 20 million year snapshot, most dramatically at wavelengths shorter than roughly 50 µm. For the rest of the simulation, the primary source of dust is the outer planetesimal belt for which t coll 10 8 years because the inner disk planetesimals have been ground away. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> When the instability occurs, the spectral energy distribution changes dramatically and quickly <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Comets from the outer planetesimal disk are scattered onto highly eccentric orbits. Those that enter the inner Solar System can cause bombardments on the terrestrial planets akin to or often far more intense than the Solar System's late heavy bombardment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gomes et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Strom et al. 2005</ref>), although given the much earlier timing of most instabilities, these bombardments could act to seed the terrestrial planet-forming region rather than impact fullyformed planets. The decrease in the comets' perihelia introduces a large amount of warm dust into the system which lasts for the duration of the bombardment and leads to a spike in brightness at near-to mid-infrared wavelengths, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> for λ = 5, 10, 25, 70, 160 and 500µm (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Booth et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2010</ref>).

In contrast, the long wavelength flux combines the flux from a much larger range of dust temperatures and therefore includes a much larger number of particles. The spike in flux associated with the instability is strong for wavelengths shorter than ∼ 50µm, but at longer wavelengths the spike is weak or absent. As objects are dynamically removed from the system the system's brightness drops precipitously and out of the detectable range in the few million years following the instability. We note that a more realistic model of dust production by new comets suggests that the mid-infrared peak during the bombardment in our model may be underestimated by a factor of a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results for the ensemble of simulations</head><p>In this section we study the outcome of our ensemble of simulations (called mixed in paper 2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Giant Planet Instabilities</head><p>Of the 152 simulations that ran for at least 100 Myr and met our energy conservation cutoff (see Appendix A), the giant planets were unstable in 96 systems (63%). The instability times ranged from 247 years to 180 Myr after the start of the simulation with a median of 91,600 years. This is encouraging because it is close to the value expected based on our initial giant planet separations of 4 − 5R H,m <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chatterjee et al. 2008</ref>). This means that our assumption of no disk gas at the start of the instability is marginally acceptable, because the typical timescale for the gas dissipation is thought to be ∼ 10 5 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Wolk &amp; Walter 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ercolano et al. 2011</ref>). However, in many cases instabilities are likely to have occurred in the presence of a residual gas disk. To test this assumption, we ran an additional set of simulations that include a simple prescription for the effects of gas damping that are presented in paper 2 (and show no significant changes from the gas-free simulations). We note that later instabilities can certainly occur (e.g., the late heavy bombardment) but we expect the number of instabilities to decrease in time, and the required computing time made it impractical to search for instabilities beyond 100-200 Myr.</p><p>Although 75% of instabilities occur within 1 Myr, there is a tail that extends to longer timescales. One in six instabilities (16 out of 96) occurred after 10 Myr, one in ten (10/96) after 30 Myr, and one in fifty (2/96) after 100 Myr. Given that our simulations only lasted 100-200 Myr, we undersampled the fraction of unstable systems in the 100-200 Myr timespan and we expect that even later instabilities should certainly occur in a fraction of systems due to long-term chaotic diffusion. The timing of the in- stability is important in terms of the sizes of objects in the inner disk; instabilities later than the typical terrestrial planet formation time of 10-100 Myr may destroy fully-formed Earth-sized planets -sometimes with appreciable water contents -rather than embryos and planetesimals.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>, the surviving giants in the unstable simulations provide a quantitative match to the observed extrasolar giant planets (p = 0.49 from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, consistent with previous work with very similar initial conditions but much larger samples; <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Raymond et al. 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Raymond et al. , 2009b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. ,a, 2010</ref>). Thus, one might imagine that the unstable systems represent the appropriate subsample of simulations that we should use to represent the known exoplanet systems, and that our stable simulations are unrealistic in that they somehow lack a trigger to make them unstable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Malmberg et al. 2010</ref>). However, as we discuss in section 5.1, the observed exoplanets do appear to require a contribution from dynamically stable systems. We note that additional constraints exist in the exoplanet sample (e.g., the mass-eccentricity correlation). Combinations of different sets of simulations can match all of the observed characteristics of the exoplanet distribution, and we perform this exercise in paper 2 (see also section 5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>A prediction of the planet-planet scattering model is that most planetary systems should contain multiple giant planets, i.e., additional giant planets should exist exterior to most of the known ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002)</ref>. Likewise, the vast majority of unstable simulations in our sample (85/96 = 89%) contain multiple giant planets; the remaining 11% contain just a single surviving giant planet. The outer giant planet is typically 5-10 AU more distant than the inner giant planet (with a tail to &gt; 30 AU), so long-duration observations are needed to follow up the known giant exoplanets. The distribution of separations between planets in scattered systems may actually provide constraints on their initial mass distribution because the surviving planets tend to be more widely-separated if they are equal-mass than if their masses differ markedly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Raymond et al. 2009b</ref>).  <ref type="table">)</ref> stable systems unstable systems single planet systems <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Terrestrial Planet Formation</head><p>The number and spacing of terrestrial planets that form is governed by the eccentricities of the planetary embryos from which they form <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Levison &amp; Agnor 2003)</ref>. These eccentricities are a result of gravitational forcing both from nearby embryos and the giant planets. There are two differences in terrestrial planet formation between stable and unstable systems: 1) perturbations during the instability can play a major role in shaping the embryo distribution; and 2) the dynamical state of the giant planets after an instability is generally more excited than before the instability. In some unlucky cases the surviving giant planets provide an accretion-friendly environment that is empty because the instability has already removed all rocky bodies. Past simulations of terrestrial planet formation with giant planets on excited orbits have all neglected the planet-planet scattering phase during which the giant planets actually acquired their eccentricities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chambers &amp; Cassen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Levison &amp; Agnor 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Raymond et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Raymond 2006</ref>), which clearly plays a very important role in the dynamics.</p><p>Giant planet perturbations span a continuous range but the outcome is quantized into a discrete number of terrestrial planets during the accretion process. If perturbations are weak -if the giant planets collide rather than scattering (or are dynamically stable or low-mass) -then embryos' eccentricities remain small and feeding zones narrow and several terrestrial planets form. For stronger giant planet perturbations, feeding zones widen and fewer terrestrial planets form, although the total mass in planets tends to decrease because stronger perturbations imply that the giant planets were scattered closer to the terrestrial planet region so more embryos end up on unstable orbits. In systems where embryos' radial excursions are comparable to the radial extent of the surviving disk only one planet forms, usually on an excited orbit. In the simulation from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, the lone terrestrial planet did not accrete from a disk of excited embryos but rather was the only planet to survive the instability. Perturbations during, not after, the instability determined the outcome.</p><p>The strength of the giant planet perturbations is directly related to the smallest giant planet perihelion distance q GP,min . <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows that the efficiency of terrestrial planet formation is directly related to q GP,min . This is not surprising: planets with smaller q GP,min have higher eccentricities (since all giant planets start with the same range of semimajor axes) and have therefore undergone more violent scattering events. Every system with a giant planet scattered to q GP,min &lt; 1.3 AU destroyed all terrestrial material in the system, as did some simulations out to 3 AU. This is consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Veras &amp; Armitage (2006)</ref>, who found a similar scaling between q GP,min and the survival of test particles in the inner disk. As expected, systems that form a single terrestrial planet are those with giant planet perturbations that are almost strong enough to completely empty the terrestrial material from the system. In these cases the embryos' eccentricities are large and, as we will see below, the single planet that survives maintains an excited orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Characteristics of surviving terrestrial planets</head><p>All terrestrial material was destroyed in 41 out of 96 unstable simulations (43%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>). Likewise, 22 unstable systems (23%) formed a single terrestrial planet, 16 formed two terrestrial planets (17%), and and the remaining 17 systems (18%) formed three or more terrestrial planets. Among the 56 stable simulations, only 7 (12.5%) formed two planets, and the remaining 87.5% of simulations formed three or more planets. As a population, the surviving terrestrial planets have smaller eccentricities than the giant planets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7)</ref>; the median eccentricity is 0.10 for terrestrials and 0.21 for giants. The terrestrial planets that formed in systems with unstable giant planets have only slightly more eccentric and inclined orbits than the terrestrial planets that formed in stable systems. The median e and i were 0.10 and 5.1 • for the unstable systems and 0.08 and 2.5 • for the stable systems, respectively. The single-terrestrial planet systems were the most excited, with median e of 0.14 and i of 8.7 • . If we neglect the single-terrestrial planet systems, the eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets that formed in stable and unstable systems is very close. 6 <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We expect that numerical resolution should play a role here.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Correlations with observable quantities: giant planets and debris disks</head><p>Observations of massive exoplanets can only very roughly diagnose the outcome of terrestrial accretion. <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> shows a strong negative correlation between the efficiency of terrestrial planet formation and the eccentricity of the innermost giant planet e g . For stable systems e g tends to be very small (median e g = 0.008) while for the unstable systems e g spans a very wide range, from &lt;0.01 to 0.8 (median e g = 0.21). The correlation between the total terrestrial planet mass and e g is expected but the range in terrestrial planet mass for different systems with a similar e g shows the importance of the orbital history. The orbits of surviving giant planets retain a memory of the strength of the instability, or lack thereof. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> breaks down the giant planet eccentricity distribution by outcome in terms of the number of terrestrial planets that formed. Multiple terrestrial planets form preferentially in systems with low giant planet eccentricities, because these represent very weak instabilities. By the same argument, highly eccentric giant planets tend to destroy all terrestrial material in their systems. The intermediate regime is represented by the single-terrestrial planet systems; for these systems e g is typically in the range 0.1-0.3 (median of 0.17). These eccentricities are close to the median of the exoplanet distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. 2006</ref>; Udry &amp; Santos 2007) and there is considerable overlap from systems with zero or many terrestrial planets. It is therefore very difficult to diagnose a single-planet nations are somewhat overestimated in the stable systems, but since the instabilities remove most of the planetesimals, not in unstable systems. system from a measurement of just the eccentricity of a giant exoplanet. The outer disk's evolution is also governed by giant planet perturbations. Icy planetesimals -whose collisional erosion creates debris disks -survive in dynamically calm environments where the giant planets were either stable, low-mass, or underwent a relatively weak instability. Indeed, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows a strong anti-correlation between the 70µm dust flux and the giant planet eccentricity. This arises simply because eccentric giant planets have increased apocenter distances and impinge on the planetesimal disk, thereby dynamically removing planetesimals via ejection. In addition, if planetesimals survive on highly-eccentric orbits their collisional lifetimes may be shortened ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Wyatt et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Given that the efficiency of terrestrial planet formation anticorrelates with the giant planet eccentricity <ref type="figure">(Fig. 11)</ref> and the dust flux also anti-correlates with the giant planet eccentricity, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> shows that the efficiency of terrestrial planet for-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>.

As was the case for the giant planet eccentricities, single-terrestrial planet systems populate the intermediate area of the correlation and overlap with systems with no planets as well as those with several. The terrestrial planet -debris disk correlation is not perfect as there exist "false positives" with bright dust emission and no terrestrial planets, corresponding to systems with asymmetric, inward-directed giant planet instabilities. Conversely, "false negatives" with terrestrial planets but little to no dust are systems that underwent asymmetric but outward-directed instabilities.

The only hint of a correlation is a lower envelope of dust fluxes larger than F/F star 10 −20 for systems with more than ∼ 2 M ⊕ in terrestrial planets.

At longer wavelengths these outliers slowly disappear because the signal from small amounts of transient hot dust is overwhelmed by the large amount of cold dust produced in quiescent outer planetesimal disks. The debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation is evident for all wavelengths longer than ∼ 25µm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16</ref> (left panel) shows histograms that represent horizontal slices through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 15</ref>. For each wavelength we chose a "detection limit" and tabulated the fraction of systems that were deemed detectable as a function of the total terrestrial planet mass. These detection limits were chosen for illustrative purposes and are in many cases unrealistic. For example, the current detection threshold at 5µm is probably closer to ∼ 10 −3 , but none of our simulations would be detectable at that limit. The reader is referred to other work discussing current dust detection limits at short ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Absil et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Akeson et al. 2009</ref>) and long ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Smith et al. 2009</ref>) wavelengths (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Wyatt 2008)</ref>.

The detection limits at 25µm and 70µm, which correspond to the actual Spitzer limits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trilling et al. 2008)</ref>, are close to the extremes: at 25µm not a single terrestrial planet-free system is detectable while at 70µm more than 40% of all systems are detectable.</p><p>At each wavelength, the fraction of systems that is detectable increases with the terrestrial planet mass <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 16)</ref>. At all wavelengths the trend is relatively flat to a certain point where it increases significantly, by several standard deviations between adjacent bins. At all wavelengths this transition occurs between either the 1 − 2 M ⊕ and 2 − 3 M ⊕ bins or the 2 − 3 M ⊕ and the &gt; 3 M ⊕ bin. Even at 5µm, which showed no obvious debris disk- The fraction of systems that would be detectable after 1 Gyr as a function of the total mass in surviving terrestrial planets for six different wavelengths between 5 and 500µm. Each curve represents a horizontal slice through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig 15 at</ref> a different vertical height. The chosen "detection limits" in F/F star were: 10 −8 at 5µm, 10 −3 at 15µm, 0.054 at 25µm, 0.55 at 70µm, 10 at 160µm, and 100 at 500µm. The error bars are 1-σ and were calculated using binomial statistics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Burgasser et al. 2003)</ref>. Note that the different curves are offset by up to ±0.1 M ⊕ for clarity. The bins themselves are at: zero, 0 − 1 M ⊕ , 1 − 2 M ⊕ , 2 − 3 M ⊕ , and &gt; 3 M ⊕ . Right: The fraction of systems with 0.5 M ⊕ or more in terrestrial planets as a function of F/F star (70µm) <ref type="bibr">(1 Gyr)</ref>. Systems with F/F star &lt; 10 −2 are included in the bin at F/F star ≈ 10 −2 . The Spitzer detection limit is shown as the dashed line. This represents a vertical slice through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14</ref>. terrestrial planet correlation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 15</ref>, there is marked jump in the fraction of detectable objects in the last bin. This jump is also seen at 15µm, although these two shortest wavelengths are the only ones for which some systems with more than 3 M ⊕ in planets are not detectable. Although our chosen detection limits at certain wavelengths may be overly optimistic or pessimistic (e.g., F/F star (5µm) ≥ 10 −8 is likely to be difficult to achieve in the near term), this shows that the debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation is present for all of these wavelengths.</p><p>The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 16</ref> shows the fraction of systems with significant mass in terrestrial planets as a function of F/F star at 70µm. This plot represents a vertical slice through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14</ref>. At small dust fluxes, a minority of systems contain terrestrial planets -these are referred to in section 5 as "false negatives". The fraction of systems with terrestrial planets increases dramatically beyond the detection limit, and every single one of the 58 systems with F/F star &gt; 10 (including 7 unstable systems) contains at least 1.9 M ⊕ in terrestrial planets, with a median value of 3.5 M ⊕ . Of the 53 unstable systems above the detection threshold at 70µm, 35 (66% +5.8% −6.9% ) contain terrestrial planets. Thus, in our simulations debris disks appear to represent signposts for terrestrial planets with a confidence of at least 66% at 70µm.</p><p>The anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric giant planets in our simulations also holds across many wavelengths. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 17</ref> (left panel) shows the fraction of stars that is detectable as a function of the giant planet eccentricity for a range of different wavelengths, similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 16</ref>. Again, the trends are stronger for wavelengths of 25µm and longer, but are still clear at shorter wavelengths (although the detection thresholds at these wavelengths are certainly much smaller than in reality). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 17 (right  panel)</ref> shows that the fraction of systems containing an eccentric giant planet is anti-correlated with the dust emission at 70µm, simply because in our simulations the calmest giant planets destroy the fewest number of outer planetesimals and therefore produce the brightest debris disks.</p><p>The debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation is also a function of time. <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref> shows F/F star at 70µm vs. the final terrestrial planet mass for all simulations at eight snapshots between 1 Myr and 3 Gyr. At 1 Myr all systems are above the detection threshold, even those that have already undergone violent instabilities, as the timescale for clearing out planetesimals is generally closer to a few to 10 Myr from the time of the instability. In a given snapshot, systems that have not yet become unstable but that eventually will are those for which the flux remains as high as the cluster of stable systems but for which the total terrestrial planet mass is low, indicating a strong future depletion of rocky material. After an instability occurs the flux drops (though differently at different wavelengths; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6</ref>) but the total terrestrial planet mass, measured at the end of the simulation, does not change, such that a given system moves vertically between snapshots. In time, instabilities remove systems at low terrestrial planet mass and high F/F star ; the last two instabilities occurred at 168 Myr (in which one 2.4 M ⊕ terrestrial planet survived on a highly eccentric orbit) and 180 Myr (in which four fully-grown terrestrial planets were destroyed including a 1.3 M ⊕ planet in the habitable zone). Beyond the end of our simulations one can imagine that a fraction of stable systems could actually become unstable and quickly lose a large fraction of their flux (and perhaps their terrestrial planets as well).</p><p>Stable systems remain clustered at high fluxes at all times, but decreasing in time due to collisional grinding. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The same collisional grinding affects the planetesimals that survive in unstable systems. In some cases the outer planetesimal disk is only moderately perturbed by the instability, although in all cases it is somewhat disturbed as shown by the lack of unstable systems with fluxes as high as the stable systems. After an instability, the mass in planetesimals decreases, although the planetesimals' eccentricities and inclinations both tend to increase (not always in a simple correlated fashion). Mass loss causes the planetesimal population's collisional evolution to slow down and eventually stop, as is thought to have occurred in the Solar System's asteroid belt <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bottke et al. 2005</ref>). Thus, the dust flux decreases to a roughly asymptotic value. Once the collisional timescale for the small particles becomes longer than the timescale for Poynting-Robertson our calculation breaks down although this occurs at a low enough flux that it should not affect our results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Wyatt et al. 2007a</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref> shows that the debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation holds in time, especially after 10-100 Myr. However, if the figure were plotted including the total terrestrial mass at a given time the correlation would hold at even earlier times because individual systems would not be restricted to move between panels on vertical lines.</p></div>

However, in constructing a sample of simulations that represents the observed exoplanet systems we do not think that is realistic not to include any stable systems for several reasons. First, current attempts to de-bias the observed eccentricity distribution infer a substantial fraction of systems -up to ∼ 30% -with circular or near-circular orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Shen &amp; Turner 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Zakamska et al. 2010</ref>). Second, there exist individual systems that show no obvious signs of instability, for example with planets in resonance (e.g., GJ 876; <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Rivera et al. 2010</ref>) or with many relatively closely-packed giant planets (e.g., 55 Cancri; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Fischer et al. 2008)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 19</ref> (left panel) shows the effect of the contribution from stable systems on the goodness of fit to the exoplanet eccentricity distribution. The distribution is best matched when we do not include any stable systems in the sample, and drops below a nominal statistically acceptable limit of p = 0.01 for a contribution larger than 17%. We therefore construct our sample with a 10% contribution of stable systems, which we think is a reasonable compromise between matching the exoplanet eccentricity distribution and allowing for stable systems.</p><p>The giant planets in our simulations are generally at larger orbital distances than the observed giant planets. The observed sample of giant planets displays a rapid rise between 0.5-1 AU, a plateau to 2 AU, and then a decrease at larger orbital distances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Butler et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Udry &amp; Santos 2007)</ref>. The rise and plateau are real but the decrease beyond 2 AU is an observational bias due to the long orbital periods of these planets. The actual distribution of giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances is  <ref type="figure">Fig. 18</ref>. The dust-to-stellar flux ratio F/F star at 70µm as a function of the total mass in terrestrial planets for eight different times from 1 Myr to 3 Gyr.

The Spitzer observational limit is shown with the dashed line ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trilling et al. 2008</ref>). Grey circles represent stable simulations and black circles represent unstable simulations.</p><note type="other">Raymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation 1 Myr 0 1 2 3 4 5 Total Terrestrial Planet Mass (Earths</note><p>unknown, although observational constraints predict that at least 10%, and perhaps more than 50%, of stars have giant planets at these separations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Cumming et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gould et al. 2010</ref>). Our simulations can be scaled to match the combined semimajor axis-eccentricity distribution of giant planets beyond 0.5-1 AU. At a smaller orbital distance, a giant planet's scattering power decreases. This can be quantified by the quantity Θ 2 , the ratio of the escape speed from the planet's surface to the escape speed from the planetary system at that location (Safronov 1969; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Goldreich et al. 2004</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Θ 2 = M p M ⋆ R p a ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where M p and M ⋆ are the planetary and stellar mass, respectively, R p is the planetary radius and a is the orbital semimajor axis. As Θ 2 is inversely proportional to the a, close in giant planets scatter less strongly than at larger distances. When Θ 2 drops below 1, collisions become more important than scattering. For our simulations, only the lowest-mass giant planets would drop to Θ 2 &lt; 1 by scaling them to 0.5-1 AU. In addition, the planetplanet scattering mechanism has been proven at this range of distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>. Thus, we conclude that it is dynamically appropriate to scale the giant planets inward to 0.5-1 AU. We cannot, however, scale to closer distances because the dynamical regime is different and giant planet-planet collisions are more likely than scattering events. We assume that the underlying distribution that is being probed by current (mainly radial velocity) observations rises linearly from zero at 0.5 AU to 1 AU, where it flattens off and remains constant to 5 AU. We draw randomly from this distribution and scale the innermost giant planets from ten randomly chosen simulations -nine that were unstable and one that was stable according to relative contribution of stable vs. unstable systems in our sample -to match this value. We then re-scale the terrestrial planets in each system to the same size scale as the inner giant planet's orbit. Our sample was created by repeating this 100,000 times with different random numbers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref> shows the radial distribution of terrestrial and giant planets after this scaling. In essence, this figure shows the expected radial distribution of terrestrial planets in the known extra-solar giant planet systems. In these systems, our simula- tions predict a factor of a few higher abundance of terrestrial planets at a few tenths of an AU than at 1 AU because, given the typical giant-terrestrial planet spacing, the formation of planets at 1 AU requires distant giant planets that are hard to detect by current methods. Planets within ∼ 0.1 AU are sparsely populated because of the assumed inner edge of the embryo disk at 0.5 AU. The peak in the frequency of terrestrial planets at a few tenths of an AU is due to a combination of our inner disk edge and the giant planets' radial distribution.</p><p>As noted above, the scaling we performed is dynamically permissible: it does not change the regime of accretion of the terrestrial planets nor the scattering regime of the giant planets. However, our simulations each contained a constant mass in embryos and planetesimals in the inner disk. By scaling the giant and terrestrial planets, we are effectively re-scaling the initial disk masses such that the same amount of mass would initially have been placed into an annulus whose position and width can vary. In addition, if we had included initially closer-in material in our simulations, the peak in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 20 would</ref> have shifted inward. Despite these limitations, in the regime that we have considered we think that the shape of the curve is physical, and we predict that, at least within the known sample of extra-solar giant planets, terrestrial planets at ∼ 0.3 AU should be several times more abundant than at 1 AU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison between our simulations and observed debris disks</head><p>Observations (mainly with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope) have shown that roughly 15% of solar-type stars younger than 300 million years have measurable dust fluxes at 24µm ( <ref type="bibr">Gáspár et al. 2009</ref>) but that this fraction decreases in time and flattens off at ∼3% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carpenter et al. 2009</ref>). At 70µm, 16% of stars observable dust and there is no measured decrease in this fraction with age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trilling et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carpenter et al. 2009</ref>). Considering the current exoplanet/debris disk sample, 9% ± 3% of planet-hosting stars were detected at 24 or 70µm compared with 14%±3% for stars without planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bryden et al. 2009</ref>). An update of that study found debris disks around the same fraction, ∼ 15%, of stars with and without known giant planets ( <ref type="bibr">Kóspál et al. 2009</ref>). In addition, the strong correlation between stellar metallicity and the fraction of stars with planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gonzalez 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Santos et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005)</ref> does not hold for the current sample of debris disks, whose presence is metallicity-independent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beichman et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Greaves et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bryden et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kóspál et al. 2009</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows that, in our simulations, the dust flux is anticorrelated with the giant planet eccentricity. Almost all lowereccentricity (e &lt; 0.1 − 0.2) giant planets are in systems with debris disks, but at higher eccentricities the fraction of dusty systems decreases as does the dust brightness itself. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 17</ref> shows that the fraction of systems that are detectable at all wavelengths from 5µm to 500µm decreases with increasing eccentricity of the innermost surviving giant planet.

We arbitrarily divide the sample in two based on the eccentricity of the innermost giant planet in each system at a value of 0.2. Debris disks are detected in 8 of 76 systems (10.5% +4.7% −2.6% )in the low-eccentricity subsample and 5 of 70 systems (7.1% +4.4% −1.9% ) in the high eccentricity subsample. Although the detection rate is somewhat higher in the lowereccentricity subsample, the difference is not statistically significant and we must wait for better statistics from larger surveys.</p><p>Our simulations do produce some systems with higheccentricity giant planets and bright dust emission <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 13)</ref>, in agreement with the detected debris disks in known exoplanet systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Moro-Martín et al. 2010</ref>). In these cases the dynamical instability tends to be asymmetric and confined to the inner planetary system and these are therefore not generally good candidates for terrestrial planets, which also agrees with the observed systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Moro-Martín et al. 2010)</ref>. The outcome of a given sys-tem depends critically on the details of the instability, which is determined by the giant planet masses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Raymond et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Our approach is not unique; other approaches based on dust production by collisional cascades can also reproduce the debris disk observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Krivov et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Krivov et al. , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Wyatt et al. 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Wyatt 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Krivov 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt 2010)</ref>. In addition, there is a qualitative difference between models that consider planetesimal disks to be "self-stirred" (i.e., eccentricities are excited by accreting bodies within planetesimal disks; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt 2010)</ref> or those that consider external sources for planetesimal stirring (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Wyatt et al. 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Mustill &amp; Wyatt (2009)</ref> showed that self-stirred planetesimal disks tend to be fainter than disks stirred by giant planets.

However, our initial conditions are biased in that all systems that could potentially produce debris disks also contain giant planets, which is not consistent with the observation that the frequency of debris disk + giant exoplanet systems is about the same as debris disks with no detected giant exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bryden et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kóspál et al. 2009</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Our Solar System in context</head><p>Our results suggest that the Solar System is unusual at the ∼ 15 − 25% level. This corresponds to the fraction of simulations that form three or four terrestrial planets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref>; including a 10% contribution from stable systems. By the same weighting 38% of simulations destroy all their terrestrial material.).</p><p>The Solar System lies at the very edge of the debris disk correlations in Figs. 13 and 14 because of its combination of a rich terrestrial planet system, a low-eccentricity innermost giant planet, and a low dust flux. To a distant observer, the Solar System's faint debris disk would suggest a dust-clearing instability in the system's past. However, Jupiter's low-eccentricity orbit would imply that the instability was weak and that the system may in fact be suitable for terrestrial planets. 8 This naive argument is remarkably consistent with our current picture of the LHB instability as an asymmetric, outward-directed instability that included a scattering event between Jupiter and an ice giant but not between Jupiter and Saturn ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Morbidelli et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>The Earth provides an interesting test case. On long timescales Earth's eccentricity oscillates between 0.0002 and 0.058 and its inclination between zero and 4.3 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Quinn et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Laskar et al. 1993)</ref>. When compared with the stable simulations, the Earth's time-averaged eccentricity is significantly smaller than the median and its inclination is also smaller. However, Earth's oscillation amplitudes are more than 50% larger than the median values for the stable systems. This situation is the same for Venus' orbit. This presents a confusing situation; perhaps Earth and Venus' e and i are lower than these simulations because we are limited in the numerical resolution needed to adequately model dissipative processes. But if that were the case, we would expect Earth and Venus' oscillation amplitudes to also be smaller than the simulated planets'. One explanation for the Earth and Venus' orbits is that they formed in a dissipative environment but that were later dynamically perturbed during the instability that caused the late heavy bombardment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gomes et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brasser et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Morbidelli et al. 2010</ref>). The perturbation was not large enough to disrupt the system's stability but sufficient to increase the amplitude of orbital oscillations of Earth and Venus.</p><p>The instability that caused the LHB is not captured in our simulations nor in current exoplanet observations. The degree to which our simulations interpret that the Solar System is unusual depends on how well the simulations characterize the instabilities in extra-solar planetary systems. As our simulations reproduce the observed exoplanet eccentricity distribution with no free parameters, it appears that our simulations do in fact capture the essence of instabilities among the known exoplanets. However, an instability such as the one proposed by the Nice model leaves little to no trace because the giant planets' eccentricities remain very small (e J and e S are only ∼ 0.05). It is plausible that Nice model-type instabilities are common in outer planetary systems, although if they systematically destroy their outer planetesimal disks then debris disk statistics constrains the fraction of stars that undergo such instabilities more than about 10 Myr after stellar formation to be less than about 10% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Booth et al. 2009</ref>). In Paper 2 we present an additional set of simulations with larger mass ratios between the giant planets in which Nice model-type instabilities can occur. Such instabilities do not change our conclusions; Nice model instabilities can effectively be lumped in with the stable systems as their impact on inner planetary systems is small. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Limitations of our approach</head><p>As with any numerical study, our simulations are limited in several ways.</p><p>Our most important assumption is that the inner and outer regions of protoplanetary disks are connected such that observations of debris disks in the outer parts of planetary systems can tell us something about terrestrial planets in the inner parts of these systems. However, there exist substantial uncertainties. For example, several relevant processes -notably the formation of planetesimals as well as giant planets -are only modestlywell understood. In addition, it is unknown whether the efficiencies and timescales of these processes vary with distance from the star. If there exists a systematic bias to create an imbalance between the inner and outer disk mass, it could qualitatively affect our results. For example, if planetesimal formation is much more efficient in the outskirts of planetary systems then the typical system may contain an outer planetesimal belt but no inner planetesimals or embryos from which to form terrestrial planets. Alternately, one can imagine that outer planetesimal disks might be systematically destroyed in systems that do form terrestrial planets, as was the case for the Solar System. If one of these scenarios is true, then the initial conditions for inner and outer planetary systems may not be coupled as strongly as we have assumed, and their outcomes may not correlate as strongly as in our simulations.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties, we think that our approach, in particular the assumption that inner and outer disks are connected, is the simplest interpretation of current observa-tions and theory. The frequency of close-in planets is 12% in the 3-10 M ⊕ range and, by extrapolation, 23% in the 0.5-2 M ⊕ range ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Howard et al. 2010</ref>). The observed frequency of debris disks around FGK stars of 16% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trilling et al. 2008</ref>) represents a lower limit for the frequency of outer planetesimal disks. Preliminary results from the Herschel DUNES survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Eiroa et al. 2010)</ref> suggest that roughly 1/3 of stars have debris disks (C. Eiroa, personal communication), which means that that the frequency of inner planets and outer planetesimal belts are probably within a factor of a few or less. Although this certainly does not prove that our initial conditions are correct, it does provide circumstantial support for our basic assumption of a connection between the inner and outer disk although we note that there is as yet no observed correlation between the two.</p><p>Our initial conditions, though chosen to match models of earlier phases of planetary growth, are ad hoc. All planetary systems in our sample contain the same mass in terrestrial embryos and planetesimals (9 M ⊕ ), form their innermost giant planet at 5.2 AU, and contain the same mass in an outer disk of leftover icy planetesimals (50 M ⊕ ). In reality, there is a spread of several orders of magnitude in the disk mass (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007a</ref>) that affects both the types of planets that form and the amount of leftover planetesimals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Greaves et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Thommes et al. 2008</ref>). In addition, recent observations suggest that low-mass disks are more compact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Andrews et al. 2010</ref>) so there may be a correlation between the disk mass and the location of planet formation as well (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref>. The disks that we modeled are comparable in mass to the minimum-mass solar nebula model and are probably more massive than the typical disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Eisner &amp; Carpenter 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007a)</ref>.</p><p>Our simulations are confined to Solar-mass stars, which are a small minority of all stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bochanski et al. 2010</ref>). To expand on this work we should consider additional stellar types. Debris disks are currently very difficult to detect around lowmass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gautier et al. 2007</ref>) but are extremely interesting as planet hosts because they dominate the stellar population of the Galaxy and are very long-lived. In contrast, debris disks are much easier to detect around A stars, but these are relatively few in number and their lifetimes are much shorter. There may be interesting differences in the evolution of planetary systems around other stellar types.</p><p>There are several physical processes not included in our simulations. In particular, we did not include the effects of giant planet migration because population synthesis models are currently unable to reproduce the observed exoplanet mass and orbital distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Howard et al. 2010</ref>). Including migration would have the benefit of providing a natural trigger for giant planet instabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams &amp; Laughlin 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Moorhead &amp; Adams 2005)</ref>, although this depends on the details of the depletion of the gaseous disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Crida et al. 2008</ref>). However, given that the giant planet observations can be matched with little to no giant planet migration, we chose not to include it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Our main results are as follows:</p><p>-Giant planet instabilities are destructive to terrestrial planet formation. The survival of terrestrial embryos and planetesimals depends on the strength of the instability as measured by the minimum giant planet perihelion distance ( <ref type="bibr">Fig 8, see also Veras &amp; Armitage 2006</ref>). In about 40% of our unstable simulations all rocky material was removed from the system, in large part by being thrown into the host star. About 1/5 of our unstable simulations produced a system containing a single terrestrial planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 9</ref>). -Terrestrial exoplanets on excited orbits should be common. The median eccentricity of surviving terrestrial planets in our simulations was about 0.1, but the distribution extends above 0.5 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 7)</ref>. The most excited orbits belong to single-terrestrial planet systems. Compared with systems with many terrestrial planets, single-planet systems have only slightly higher eccentricities and inclinations but their oscillations in e and i are far larger <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 10)</ref>. -Debris disks are anti-correlated with strongly-scattered giant planets. Strong scattering events produce eccentric giant planets with large radial excursions that dynamically deplete the outer planetesimal disk by exciting their orbits until they cross a giant planet's at which point they are quickly ejected from the system. Thus, we expect continued observations to show an anti-correlation between the fraction of systems with debris disks and the giant planet eccentricity. -Debris disks correlate with a high efficiency of terrestrial planet formation. Strong scattering events yield large giant planet eccentricities, and these eccentric giant planets tend to disturb both the inner and outer planetary system. Thus, in a strongly perturbed system the giant planets tend to destroy both terrestrial planetary embryos -aborting the growth of terrestrial planets -and outer planetesimals -preventing the creation of debris disks by long-term collisional evolution. In contrast, in a calm system the giant planets will not strongly impede on the inner or outer planetary system, allowing for the formation of terrestrial planets and longlasting cold dust. The debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation holds for all wavelengths we tested but is clearer for λ 15µm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 15 and 16</ref>). The correlation also holds for all times later than about 10-30 Myr <ref type="figure">(Fig. 18)</ref> and probably even earlier. -Within the known sample of extra-solar giant planets, terrestrial planets at a few tenths of an AU should be several times more abundant than either terrestrial or giant planets at 1 AU. In section 5.1 we scaled the outcomes of our simulations to match the observed semimajor axis and eccentricity distributions of giant exoplanets. This scaling produced a radial distribution of terrestrial exoplanets that peaks at a few tenths of an AU and drops below the giant planet frequency at 1.3 AU <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 20)</ref>. However, we note that the distribution is incomplete in its inner regions due to our initial conditions, in particular the inner edge in our embryo distribution at 0.5 AU. -The Solar System lies at the outskirts of several correlations, probably because of the instability that caused the Late Heavy Bombardment. The Solar System has a rare combination of multiple terrestrial planets, low-eccentricity giant planets, and very low dust content (currently, F/F star ≈ 2×10 −2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Booth et al. 2009</ref>). In addition, Earth and Venus' orbits are more circular and coplanar than terrestrial planets in typical stable planetary systems but they have significantly larger-amplitude oscillations in those quantities. This can be explained if the Solar System's formation was quiescent but it underwent a later punctual event that was strong enough to remove most of the outer planetesimal disk and give the inner Solar System a small kick but did not destabilize the inner Solar System or impart a large eccentricity to Jupiter. This is in agreement with the current picture of the instability that caused the LHB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Morbidelli et al. 2010)</ref>. This type of instability is poorly constrained by observations, is much weaker than the instabilities inferred from the exoplanet eccentricity distribution, and is not captured in the simulations presented here.</p><p>One implication of our results is that exo-zodiacal dust clouds around stars with terrestrial planets may often be brighter than the Solar System's zodiacal cloud. A major obstacle to the direct imaging of terrestrial exoplanets is the amount of bright dust close to those planets, i.e., their exo-zodiacal dust clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cash 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Defrère et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Noecker &amp; Kuchner 2010)</ref>. The Solar System's zodiacal dust has been shown to derive almost entirely from Kuiper Belt comets that were scattered by the giant planets into the inner Solar System, where they partially sublimated to produce warm dust before eventually being ejected <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2010</ref>). Around other stars, cold debris disks should trace the same population of comets that produces exo-zodiacal dust: debris disks represent planetesimals on stable orbits in the outer system and exo-zodiacal dust is generated by the small fraction of bodies that has been destabilized and is in the process of being removed from the system. Our results suggest that systems with bright debris disks are excellent targets in the search for terrestrial exoplanets. These systems contain at least a few M ⊕ (and often more than 20M ⊕ ) in surviving cometary material, 1-2 orders of magnitude more than the current Kuiper Belt ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gladman et al. 2001)</ref>. If the comet flux scales with the number of outer planetesimals then systems with bright debris disks should also harbor bright exo-zodiacal clouds close to the terrestrial planet zone. However, the dynamics of the outer planetary systems -in particular the architecture and masses of the giant planets -are key in determining the fluxes of new comets in these systems as well as their residence lifetimes in the inner planetary systems. In addition, there is almost certainly a significant population of systems with terrestrial planets without bright debris disks, i.e. what we have called "false negatives". Those systems may be harder to find because they lack debris disks to signpost the presence of terrestrial planets, but they could prove easier to image because they may contain much fainter zodiacal clouds. We plan to test these ideas in future work.</p><p>In a companion paper (Raymond et al 2011; referred to in the text as paper 2) we explore the effect of several other parameters on the results obtained here. In particular, we present results of several other sets of simulations that vary the giant planets' mass distribution and total masses, the width of the outer planetesimal disk, the existence of icy embryos within the outer planetesimal disk, and the presence of disk gas at the time of giant planet instabilities. In that paper we confirm the large-scale results presented here but with several important clarifications and dependencies. We also carefully match our simulations to the observed statistics of giant exoplanets and debris disks to obtain an estimate for the fraction of stars that host terrestrial planets, η Earth in the famous Drake equation.</p><p>In a second companion paper (Raymond et al 2011b), we explore the fate of bodies -planetesimals, planetary embryos, and giant planets -that are ejected from unstable planetary systems and pollute the galaxy. By matching giant exoplanet and debris disk statistics we estimate the abundance of this population of free-floating bodies and the chances for their unambiguous detection either in interstellar space or entering the Solar System.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Appendix A: Numerical Tests</head><p>We performed simple numerical tests to choose an inner boundary appropriate for this timestep by placing a particle at 1 AU on Fractional error in the semimajor axis a of a Mars-mass particle with initial a = 1 AU as a function of perihelion distance q. The particle was initially placed on a circular, nearly polar orbit (initial inclination of 89.9 • ) in the presence of an outer giant planet. The Kozai effect forced the particle to fall into the star, and we tracked the integration error in time.</p><p>an orbit that was highly inclined with respect to a distant, Jupitermass planet <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . In this configuration, the Kozai effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Kozai 1962</ref>) drives a dramatic increase in the particle's eccentricity. By tracking the integrator error at ever-smaller perihelion distance, q = a(1 − e), we saw that the fractional error in the semimajor axis da/a increased to greater than 10 −4 inside roughly 0.2 AU, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 21</ref>. We therefore chose 0.2 AU as our inner particle boundary, inside which objects are removed from the simulation and assumed to have collided with the star. We chose 100 AU as our corresponding outer boundary, beyond which bodies are assumed to have been dynamically ejected from the system. With our choice of timestep and inner boundary, the majority of our simulations maintained excellent (dE/E &lt; 10 −4 ) energy and angular momentum conservation properties <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . However, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref>, a fraction of the simulations in which the minimum giant planet perihelion distance was small (q &lt; 2 AU) exhibited substantially worse conservation properties. Given this behavior, we adopted an empirical energy conservation threshold of dE/E &lt; 1 × 10 −2 , and discarded from the final sample any runs that failed to meet this limit.</p><p>Does our cutoff in energy at dE/E &lt; 1 × 10 −2 bias our results? The true outcome of our numerical experiment depends on the details of the giant planets' orbital evolution, and it is only relatively extreme cases with q ≤ 2 AU for which significant integration error occurs. It is for these close perihelion passages that all terrestrial material is destroyed, called mode 2 accretion in the main text. In the case of the five simulations with dE/E &gt; 1 × 10 −2 , two contained a single surviving terrestrial planet and three had destroyed all of their terrestrial planets. By removing these cases we are therefore slightly biasing our sample at the 5% level away from accretion modes 2 and 3, and so we include this small extra contribution in our estimates in the paper of the fraction of systems for which the different accretion modes occur.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 23</ref>. Eccentricity of the innermost giant planet (left panel) and dust-to-stellar flux ratio at 70µm after 1 Gyr of evolution (right panel) as a function of the fractional error in the system's energy budget dE/E. This plot is only for systems with minimum giant planet perihelia of less than 2 AU (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 22</ref>). Our energy error cutoff at 0.01 is shown with the dashed line. There is no evidence for contamination of our sample. We do not see any clear signature of other bias introduced in our analysis from our energy cutoff. To assess this possibility, we restrict ourselves to systems for which the minimum giant planet perihelion was less than 2 AU because this is where large errors occur. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 23</ref> shows the giant planet eccentricity and the dust-to-stellar flux ratio at 70µm after 1 Gyr as a function of dE/E for this subsample. Both panels are scatter plots, with no clear trend or any indication that the computed dE/E value changes the outcome in any way. We therefore conclude that our chosen cutoff in integrator energy, while less stringent than some other studies, has no measurable impact on our results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.

			<note place="foot">Raymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Small grains with sizes of 2.2µm do not actually radiate as blackbodies. Rather, the effective temperature of small grains is likely to be higher than the blackbody temperature. The consequence of this in the context of our model is discussed extensively in Bonsor &amp; Wyatt (2010) and Kains et al. (2011). To summarize, the actual flux may be slightly higher or lower than that predicted with our assumptions, since on the one hand the higher temperature means that we underestimate the dust flux for a given dust mass, however this is compensated to some extent by the fact that we also overestimate the evolutionary timescale (since the evolutionary timescale for a disk of observed temperature is set observationally).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> In the simulation, any body that came within 0.2 AU of the star is considered to have collided with it. It is conceivable that in some cases, star-grazing embryos could have their orbits shrunk and re-circularized by tidal effects, although the efficiency of this process is uncertain and probably quite small (Raymond et al. 2008b).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> Note that one stable system ejected all of its planetesimals. In that system the interactions between the giant planets excited eccentricities of ∼ 0.1, causing an eventual complete depletion in the outer planetesimal disk and a decreased terrestrial planet formation efficiency compared with other stable simulations. Although the planets were all roughly one Jupiter mass, the two inner planets were actually also</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Of course, it would take about a decade of precise observations for these aliens to pin down Jupiter&apos;s orbital eccentricity.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> Brasser et al. (2009) showed that some Nice model instabilities can destabilize the orbits of the terrestrial planets due to sweeping secular resonances and potentially cause collisions between the terrestrial planets. However, this process does not remove all the terrestrial planets and so, in the context of our results, nothing has changed.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> We thank Hal Levison for suggesting this numerical test. 11 We are aware that removing particles from the simulation, at any radius larger than the physical one (approximately the size of the star), can in principle result in unphysical behavior, even when energy and angular momentum are well-conserved. Unfortunately, it is currently infeasible to run long-duration terrestrial planet formation simulations with dramatically shorter timesteps and smaller inner boundary radii.</note>
