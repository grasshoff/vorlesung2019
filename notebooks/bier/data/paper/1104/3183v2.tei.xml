			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce a thermochemical kinetics and photochemical model. We use high-temperature bidi-rectional reaction rates for important H, C, O and N reactions (most importantly for CH 4 to CO interconversion), allowing us to attain thermochemical equilibrium, deep in an atmosphere, purely kinetically. This allows the chemical modeling of an entire atmosphere, from deep-atmosphere ther-mochemical equilibrium to the photochemically dominated regime. We use our model to explore the atmospheric chemistry of cooler (T ef f &lt; 10 3 K) extrasolar giant planets. In particular, we choose to model the nearby hot Neptune GJ436b, the only planet in this temperature regime for which spectro-scopic measurements and estimates of chemical abundances now exist. Recent Spitzer measurements with retrieval have shown that methane is driven strongly out of equilibrium and is deeply depleted on the dayside of GJ 436b, whereas quenched carbon monoxide is abundant. This is surprising because GJ 436b is cooler than many of the heavily irradiated hot Jovians and thermally favorable for CH 4 , and thus requires an efficient mechanism for destroying it. We include realistic estimates of ultraviolet flux from the parent dM star GJ 436, to bound the direct photolysis and photosensitized depletion of CH 4. While our models indicate fairly rich disequilibrium conditions are likely in cooler exoplanets over a range of planetary metallicities, we are unable to generate the conditions for substantial CH 4 destruction. One possibility is an anomalous source of abundant H atoms between 0.01-1 bars (which attack CH 4), but we cannot as yet identify an efficient means to produce these hot atoms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Currently, transiting extrasolar planets offer virtually exclusive 2 opportunities for observing physical and chemical states of exoplanetary atmospheres. Over the past four years, retrievals of atmospheric molecules from multicolor transit photometry (i.e. transit spectra) have compelled the development of progressively more sophisticated atmopheric models to interpret the observations and understand underlying chemical and dynamical processes. In particular, atmospheric-chemistry modeling is evolving from strictly thermo-equilibrium models with <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Correspondence to be directed to mrl@gps.caltech.edu or gv@s383.jpl.nasa.gov <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The exceptions to the exclusivity are the few young, selfluminous planets as in the HR8799 system stationary chemical species, to coupled models ( <ref type="bibr">Zahnle et al. 2009a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Line et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al 2011)</ref> incorporating thermo-kinetics, vertical transport, and photochemistry. Thus far, such efforts have been devoted to hot-Jupiter planets, especially HD 209458b and HD 189733b, due to their favorable transit depths and eclipse brightnesses and, therefore, far greater availability of observational data. However, with the recent retrieval of molecular abundances in the atmosphere of GJ 436b <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Stevenson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2011</ref>), exoplanetary science is venturing into a new territory: hot-Neptune atmospheric chemistry. GJ 436b is bound to serve as a prototypical planet anchoring the theoretical framework for understanding the hot-Neptune class of exoplanets, much as how HD 209458b and HD 189733b have for hot Jupiters. It is also the first planet with observable thermal emission that transits an M star. M stars are of particular interest since they constitute the majority of stars in the solar neighborhood, and they have close-in habitable zones, which enhances radialvelocity detectability and transit observability; therefore, M stars present the best opportunities to discover and characterize rocky, potentially habitable exoplanets in the near future. GJ 436b and GJ 1214b provide the only present test cases for atmospheric chemistry of planets orbiting M dwarfs. Therefore, an era of intensive investigations of this planet is commencing. This paper presents our application of a state-of-the-art model seamlessly integrating thermo-kinetics, vertical transport, and photochemistry to simulate the atmospheric chemistry of GJ 436b in a similar manner to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Visscher et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> , along with realisitic estimates of UV fluxes for this planet.</p><p>The first transiting hot Neptune discovered ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Gillon et al. 2007</ref>), GJ 436b, revolves around an M dwarf merely 10 pc away from Earth and has received much attention due to its interesting orbital dynamics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ribas et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Mardling 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Baty- gin et al. 2009</ref>), interior properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nettelmann et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Kramm et al. 2011</ref>), and atmospheric properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stevenson et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Lewis et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Madhusud- han &amp; Seager 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Shabram et al. 2011</ref>). The slightly eccentric orbit (eccentricity = 0.16) has a mean orbital radius of 0.0287 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Torres et al. 2008)</ref>, and the planet probably has a pseudo-synchronous rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deming et al. 2007</ref>). The planet's mass is 23 M ⊕ , and its density of 1.7 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> resembles that of the ice-giant Neptune (1.63 g/cm 3 ). Analyses of its mass-radius relationship and transit depth indicates a layer of H/He dominated atmosphere is clearly required ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Figueira et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Net- telmann et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rogers &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>. The host star has an effective temperature of ∼ 3400 K and an estimated age of 3 -9 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Torres et al. 2008</ref>). Assuming zero albedo and global thermal re-distribution, the planet's effective temperature is 650 K. Of the confirmed transiting exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wright et al. 2011</ref>), GJ 436b is one of the least irradiated and has one of the coolest atmospheres. Therefore, this planet represents a significant departure from hot Jupiters in terms of size, thermal environment, and UV flux.</p><p>Although GJ 436b was discovered in 2004 (Butler, by radial velocity), it was not until 2010 that a retrieval of explicit molecular abundances in its atmosphere was reported ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stevenson et al. 2010)</ref>, where six channels of secondary-eclipse photometry data ranging from 3.6 to 24 µm were analyzed by generating ∼ 10 6 simulated spectra using varying combinations of molecular compositions and temperature profiles to find the best fit to observations. A more recent paper <ref type="bibr">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2011</ref>) provides further details and updated results of a re-analysis of the same dataset using the same general retrieval method. In short, 10 6 combinations of ten physio-chemical free parameters, each spanning a large range of values, were used to generate synthetic dayside-emission spectra. In each of the 10 6 scenarios, six of the ten parameters were used to define the temperature-pressure (T-P) profile, whereas the other four parameters specified vertically uniform abundances of four molecules: H 2 O, CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 . Additionally, the 1-D atmospheric model restricted the ratio of emergent flux output to incident stellar flux input on the day side to within the range between zero and unity. Given six data points and ten free paramters, the retrieval problem was mathematically underdetermined. Nonetheless, sampling a million points in parameterphase space allowed the authors to examine the joint probability contours, as defined by the goodness-of-fit (chi-square) function, projected on multiple-parameter spaces. Furthermore, by placing physical-plausibility constraints (in consideration of believable departures from thermo-equilibrium chemistry) on the molecular abundances, the authors were able to confine the physical space to a fairly narrow, "best-fit," range for chi-square ≤ 3. Depending on the wavelength, the photospheric altitude varies from 9 bar to 0.2 bar levels. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) temperature inversion is ruled out (i.e. no stratosphere); 2) 6 ppm (parts per million) is the absolute upper limit for CH 4 abundance; 3) 300 ppm is the absolute upper limit for H 2 O abundance; 4) CO 2 and CO abundances are anti-correlated; 5) taking physical-plausibility into consideration, the best-fit spectrum represents X H2O = 100 ppm, X CH4 = 1 ppm, X CO = 7000 ppm, and X CO2 = 6 ppm, where X i is the number density of molecule i divided by that of H 2 . Also, note that even in the best-fit scenario, X CO2 can range anywhere from 1 -100 ppm. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stevenson et al. (2010)</ref> and the Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2011) efforts are the most comprehensive studies of atmospheric composition on GJ 436b thus far.</p><p>From a theoretical point of view, the preceding abundance limits and values pose a very interesting challenge due to their drastic departures from thermo-equilibrium predictions, which indicate the following rough-order-ofmagnitude values: X H2O = 1000 (3×10 4 ) ppm, X CH4 = 1000 (10 4 ) ppm, X CO = 60 (10 4 ) ppm, and X CO2 = 0.1 (1000) ppm for 1x (50x) solar metallicities at ∼ 1bar. In either metallicity scenario, water and methane remain abundant (≥ 1000 ppm), whereas the retrieval shows water being relatively depleted and methane being drastically depleted. Moreover, the thermo-equilibrium abundances of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are positively correlated (either both low in the 1× case or both high in the 50× case), in contrast with the retrieval's anti-correlation. In particular, the retrieved partioning of carbon overwhelmingly in oxidized species amidst a hydrogen-dominated (reducing), temperate atmosphere is very surprising. For instance, at 1-bar pressure and solar metallicity, CH 4 is the thermodynamically dominant carbon-bearing molecule for temperatures less than 1100 K <ref type="bibr">(Lodders &amp; Fegley 2002)</ref>. The common practices of simply adjusting metallicity and/or the C/O ratio cannot simultaneously reconcile these discrepancies. Therefore, one must investigate disequilibrium mechanisms.</p><p>Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2011) posited that high metallicity combined with vertical mixing can explain the disequilibrium abundance of carbon oxides. Basically, enhanced metallicity (∼ 10× solar) can provide the requisite abundance of CO 2 . Since equilibrium CO abundance drops sharply with respect to temperature <ref type="bibr">(Lodders &amp; Fegley 2002</ref>) the retrieved uniformly high abundance of CO requires eddy mixing to populate up-per, cooler, atmospheric layers. However, vertical eddy mixing alone cannot explain the large depletion of CH 4 due to its innately high thermochemical abundance in the deep atmosphere. Therefore, <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2011)</ref> invoked photochemistry as the potential culprit, based on Zahnle et al.'s (2009a,b) studies of photochemistry on hot Jupiters. In such a scheme, photosensitized sulfur chemistry produces atomic H, which then destroys CH 4 to form higher hydrocarbons. However, the <ref type="bibr">Zahnle et al. (2009a,b)</ref> model uses solar-type stellar irradiance and an isothermal atmsophere (i.e. constant temperature versus altitude). As such, neither the photochemical driver nor the thermal environment is tailored for our planet in question. More severely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> pointed out that a typo in a key rate coefficient in the <ref type="bibr">Zahnle et al. (2009a,b)</ref> model caused the apparent conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons at pressures larger than 1 mbar. Generally speaking, at pressures larger than 1 mbar in a hydrogen-abundant atmosphere, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and reaction intermediates efficiently recycle species back to methane, preventing its large-scale destruction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> also discussed the inadequacies of isothermal atmospheric models due to their suppression of transportinduced quenching. Hence, the observed CH 4 depletion still awaits adequate explanation. The low abundance of H 2 O also has not been addressed.</p><p>In addition to secondary eclipse observations, primary transit observations of GJ 436b exist as well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pont et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Ballard et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Beaulieu et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, Knutson et al 2011</ref>, and various groups have analyzed them to retrieve molecular abundances in the planet's terminator regions (Beaulieu et al 2011, <ref type="bibr">Knutson et al 2011)</ref>. In contrast to the secondary-eclipse retrieval, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beaulieu et al. (2011)</ref> were able to fit a compendium of their and Ballard et al.'s tansit observations between 0.5 and 9 µm with 500 ppm CH 4 in a H 2 atmosphere, and finding no clear evidence for CO or CO 2 . Moreover, Beaulieu et al. presented that a methane-rich atmosphere, with temperature inversion, can be consistent with the said secondaryeclipse data as well (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shabram et al. 2011</ref>). More recently, Knutson et al. acquired Spitzer transit photometry at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 µm during 11 visits. The multiple-visit data showed high transit-depth variability, which the authors attribute to potential stellar activity in the dM host. They did not find any compelling evidence for methane, and data excluding ones believed to be most affected by stellar activity appear to place an upper limit of 10 ppm for methane mixing ratio. The best-fit spectrum to this select data set assumes 1000 ppm H 2 O, 1000 ppm CO, 1 ppm CH 4 , with CO 2 abundance poorly constrained, roughly in agreement with Madhusudhan et al. Therefore, primary-transit data is currently inconclusive due to different interpretations by different groups.</p><p>Our primary goal is to advance the fundamental understanding of processes impacting the chemical state of GJ 436b by developing a 1-D atmospheric model that integrates all of the aforementioned equilibrium and disequilibrium processes. An important aspect of our model is the seamless integration of thermochemistry, kinetics, vertical mixing, and photochemistry in a manner that directly follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Visscher et al. (2010)</ref>, and contemporaneously with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref>, obviating the conventional quench-level estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Prinn &amp; Barshay 1977)</ref>.</p><p>The quench-level approach assumes that the deep atmosphere is in thermochemical equilibrium because high temperatures provide sufficient kinetic energy to overcome reaction barriers in either direction. However, as vertical tranport lifts a gas parcel to cooler, higher altitudes, chemistry becomes rate limited rather than thermodynamically determined. There comes a point in altitude where the kinetic conversion time scale becomes slower than the transport time scale, and the ratelimiting reaction for a molecule of interest is not allowed time to reach completion. At altitudes above this point, the molecule's concentration is frozen/quenched (therefore, the term "quench level"). In effect, the quenchlevel approach partitions the atmosphere into two parts: below the quench level, thermochemical equilibrium determines chemical abundances; above the quench level, molecular abundances are uniform versus altitude, with values equal to the equilibrium value at the appropriate quench level for each species. Although this approach has a long record of success (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Prinn &amp; Barshay 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Smith 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Griffith &amp; Yelle 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Saumon et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hubeny &amp; Burrows 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cooper &amp; Show- man 2006</ref>), it does have some limiting assumptions and caveats that require great judiciousness. Specifically, one needs to determine the appropriate rate-limiting, interconversion reaction for each set of coupled species of interest (e.g., interconversion between CH 4 &amp; CO). The correct reaction choice is not always readily apparent (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Visscher et al. 2010</ref>) and the appropriate length scale for deriving the mixing time scale from the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient (K zz ) is still under some debate. Furthermore, since a basic assumption is that temperature decreases with altitude, atmospheric temperature inversions can complicate matters.</p><p>Therefore, we implemented a fully reversible kinetic model in the following manner. Every measured forward reaction rate in our list is reversed using the equilibrium constant and the principle of microscopic reversibility. Given enough pathways, both forward and backwards, a given set of chemical species will reach thermochemical equilibrium, kinetically. This provides a seamless transition from the thermochemical equilibrium regime to the disequilibrium-dominated regimes. We can investigate the disequilibrium effects on atmospheric composition in a much more holistic, systematic manner, compared to heuristically identifying plausible disequilibrium processes.</p><p>In the remainder of this manuscript we describe the disequilibrium processes that may be occurring in GJ436b's atmosphere. In §2 we describe thermochemical and chemical kinetics models as well as our estimate for the stellar UV flux. In §3 we show the modeling results as well as a description of the important reaction schemes governing the abundances of various species. Finally in §4 we discuss the relevant implications and conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DESCRIPTION OF MODELS</head><p>We use joint thermochemistry and "1-D chemicalkinetics with photochemistry" models to study the atmosphere's departure from thermal equilibrium. External inputs to our models are the metals fraction (denoted further on by ζ), the pressure and temperature (T-P) profile, the eddy diffusion coefficient profile, and reaction list, along with the reverse pathways for CH 4 to CO oxidation. Photolysis absorption cross sections are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moses et al. (2005)</ref> and the thermodynamic data (i.e. the compilation of entropies and enthalpies) used to reverse the kinetic rate coefficients are from JANAF and CEA thermobuild databases; e.g., CEA uses data from <ref type="bibr">Chase et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Gurvich et al. (1989)</ref> (see <ref type="bibr">Zehe et al. 2002</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Model Parameters</head><p>We model a large pressure and altitude range, 10 3 to 10 −11 bars (∼5000 km or ∼0.2 R p from the 1 bar level), so as to capture the three major atmospheric regimes and the transitions between them. These three dominant portions of the atmosphere are -the thermal equilibrium regime in the deep hot atmosphere, the eddy transport dominated regime at intermediate pressures, and the photochemical regime at low pressures. A total of 190 pressure levels, uniform in logarithmic space, are used between the abovementioned levels, giving a resolution of about 14 levels per decade of pressure. Altitudes above the homopause remain relatively cool in our models, and we disregard the possibility of a hot thermosphere despite the models extend up to exophere levels at 10 −11 bars; this simplification has little or no bearing on the state of the atmosphere below the homopause (P ∼ 1µbar). We adopt the ζ = 1 T-P profile from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al. (2010)</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), noting its similarity to the T-P profile retrieved in <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Stevenson et al. (2010)</ref>. Whereas GJ 436 itself is slightly subsolar in abundances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bean et al. 2006</ref>), we allow for a span of planetary metallicities, covering the cases ζ = 0.1, 1, 50, and allowing for the possibility that the planet is either enriched or depleted; we used solar abundances from the standard text of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yung &amp; DeMore (1999)</ref> 2 . For non-solar atmospheres we tune the frac-tions of C, N, O, and S relative to H but not relative to each-other (e.g., C/O, N/O, S/O, are always fixed).</p><p>The eddy diffusion strength (parameterized by a coeffcient, K zz ) determines the pressure level at which a species is chemically quenched. At the quench level for chemical X, the timescale for vertical transport (τ trans ) equals the chemical loss timescale (τ chem,X ). Above that level, which includes the visible portion of the atmosphere, the mixing virtually "freezes" the concentration of that species. Below the quench level, τ chem,X τ trans , and thermochemical balance is achieved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Line et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> have used piecewise estimates of the eddy diffusion profiles, K zz (P ). The recipe has been to estimate K zz in the deep adiabatic troposphere (∼ 10 3 bars) using mixing length theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Flasar &amp; Gierasch 1977)</ref> and stitch this to global circulation model (GCM) derived profiles obtained by multiplying the (horizontally averaged) GCM vertical winds of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Showman et al. (2009)</ref> by the local scale height. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al. (2010)</ref> apply this procedure to their GJ 436b circulation model, and estimate that K zz increases from ∼ 10 8 at depth (100 bars) to 10 11 cm 2 s −1 at lower pressures (1 mbar).</p><p>Such procedures have gnawing uncertainties -for example, the appropriate eddy mixing length may only be a fraction of the scale height, or the vertical wind strengths could well be overestimated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Smith (1998)</ref> has demonstrated theoretically that using an eddy length scale equal to the scale height is inappropriate, and may lead to gross over-estimates of the length scale (L) and the timescale (τ trans = L 2 /K zz ). Herein, we simplify matters by choosing a constant K zz (P ) = 10 8 cm 2 s −1 profile; this value is similar to that for the deep atmosphere in the Lewis et al. GCM. This simplification has a couple of redeeming features. First, this gives quench levels similar to those that would be derived had we used a GCMinspired K zz profile. Second, whereas a low K zz may underestimate the mixing strength at higher altitudes, it has the effect more lethargic replenishment of methane and other photodissociated species from the lower atmosphere (it bolsters the photochemical timescale, relative to τ trans ).</p><p>2.2. The Ultraviolet Emission from GJ 436 dM stars such as GJ 436 show very little photospheric emission in the near to far ultraviolet (UV). Nevertheless, non-radiative energetic processes can transport energy to power a hot outer atmosphere, and this energy is partially dissipated in the form of cooling, chromospheric UV emission. Because the UV emission levels depend on many factors, ab initio estimates of it are difficult. We use GALEX and ROSAT derived estimates for GJ 436 and combine these with a T ef f 3400 K continuum from the stellar photosphere. This combined emission is used to drive photochemical reactions in GJ 436b.</p><p>In the planetary atmosphere both H 2 and He are weak absorbers relative to other molecular species, but are enormously more abundant. Helium ceases to absorb longwards of 500Å500Å, and H 2 longwards of 1000Å1000Å. Methane, a carbon reservoir and the molecule of particular interest herein, has a large absorption cross-section planet with ζ 0.16, 1.6, 80. This was brought to our attention by the anonymous referee.</p><p>shortwards of 1600Å1600Å. Whereas methane (and water) is largely shielded by H 2 and He from very shortwave radiation, it is photodissociated by radiation between 1000-1600Å1600Å, and is therefore susceptible to possible intense H I Ly α (λ = 1216Å1216Å) from the M star host. Longwards of λ = 1600Å1600Å, direct photolysis of methane dwindles due to a combination of the falling cross-section and weak stellar flux. Hydrogen sulfide photodissociates at much longer wavelengths, λ &lt; 2600Å2600Å, and if present in substantial quantities, is poorly shielded by other reservoir molecules H 2 , CH 4 , H 2 O, etc. H 2 S photolysis and the resultant hot atomic hydrogen may be influential if λ 2600Å2600Å photons can penetrate deep into the planetary atmosphere (more in §3.3.5).</p><p>GJ 436 is detected in a GALEX survey exposure in the near UV channel with flux f nuv = 21.0 ± 3.7 µJy H Ly α emission can be powerful in the upper chromospheres of cool stars. Because it is strongly absorbed in the interstellar medium, direct line strength estimates are difficult. We make an indirect determination based on empirical correlations with soft X-ray fluxes. Soft X-ray emission from GJ 436 has been observed in the Rosat All Sky Survey ( <ref type="bibr">Hünsch et al. 1999</ref>), with f x 5.4 × 10 −14 erg cm −2 s −1 (0.1-2.4 keV; Rosat PSPC), implying a fractional X-ray luminosity of L x /L bol ∼ 8 × 10 −6 ; this fraction is a factor ∼ 100 lower than that observed from the most active dM stars and is consistent with GJ436b's estimated advanced age, 6 ± 3 Gyr. More recent XMM-Newton EPIC measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sanz-Forcada et al. 2010)</ref> give a factor of 8 lower L x , which may well be due to X-ray activity. Herein, we adopt the ROSAT flux because larger X-ray fluxes imply proportionally larger Ly α fluxes.</p><p>To estimate the Ly α output, we use an an empirical correlation of the X-ray and Ly α emission of stars, derived from stellar samples that include several late type stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Landsman &amp; Simon 1993 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Woods et al. 2004</ref>; in these papers, measurements of Ly α lines were made from International Ultraviolet Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope spectra, after applying a model based correction of ISM absorption). Inverting the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Woods et al. (2004)</ref> empirical power law, log F x 2.2 log F Lyα − 7.76, we determine a photon flux of f Lyα ∼ 1.5 × 10 14 photons cm −2 s −1 at GJ 436b 3 . The Solar H Ly α flux at Earth is 10 12 photons cm −2 s −1 , a factor 100 lower. The reliability of X-ray derived Lyman α line flux may be assessed by comparing F Lyα with the GJ 436b's H α line flux. H α observed in GJ436 in absorption, with an equivalent width of 0.32Å32Å (Palomar-Michigan State Nearby Star Spectroscopic Survey; <ref type="bibr">Gizis, Reid &amp; Haw- ley 2002)</ref>, implies a line flux of F Hα 2 × 10 5 erg cm −2 s −1 , and a line strength ratio of H Ly α to H α of 2.2. For dM stars, where H Ly α is seen in emission and for which the intrinsic Ly α line strengths have been measured, this line strength ratio varies between 3-5, with some stars having ratios as low as 2 and others as high as 8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Doyle et al. 1997</ref>).</p></div>

Because GJ 436b is significantly cooler than HD 189733b and HD 209458b, CH 4 is the thermochemically favored carbon carrier; higher effective temperatures drive equilibrium towards CO in the two hot Jupiters.

At a given pressure P , K eq (T ) behaves in a manner that rising T drives the equilibrium towards CO. At a fixed T , increasing/decreasing pressures favor higher CH 4 /CO concentrations. These relationships are exemplified in the ζ = 1 equilibrium profiles shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (middle panel). As P and T decrease along the adiabat between 1000−100 bars, the equilibrium constant dominates over the adverse P 2 dependence, resulting in a drop in the CO fraction. In the isothermal region between 10 − 1 bars, decreasing pressure now favors the production of CO. Between 1 bar and ≈ 10 −2 bars, the CO fraction falls because of the rapid decrease in temperature with altitude.</p><p>At levels above the ∼ 10 −2 level the temperature structure is nearly isothermal, and the decreasing pressure favors higher CO fractions. Similarly, NH 3 is the favored N carrier deep in the atmosphere, but is less favored at lower atmospheric pressures. Sulfur can be predominant as H 2 S, HS, or S depending on pressure and temperature, but for conditions prevalent in GJ 436b, gas phase H 2 S is the dominant sulfur reservoir and its concentration is unaffected by the temperature structure. Heavier hydrocarbons, such as ethane (C 2 H 6 ), are relatively scarce  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-Thermochemical equilibrium vertical distributions for abundant H, C, O, N, and S species assuming the temperature profile in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.

Similarly, decreasing the metallicity of the atmosphere to ζ = 0.1 lowers the mixing ratios of the heavy gases, by a factor ∼ ζ for CH 4 and ζ 2 for CO etc. The shapes of vertical distributions are nonetheless preserved, and relatively insensitive to ζ.</p><p>For all three metallicity cases considered, the chemical equilibrium abundances of CH 4 and H 2 O stay relatively high -there is always enough hydrogen present to build these molecules. One can imagine an extreme situation where H is highly depleted, but such an atmosphere would be incompatible with the observed planetary radius. Conversely, the planet could be impoverished in metals to greatly subsolar levels ζ 0.1, although unreasonably low metallicities (≤ 1 × 10 −5 × solar) would be required to deplete CH 4 and other common molecules to levels below 1 ppm. These simple cases serve to show that, based solely on chemical thermodynamics, CH 4 has to be relatively abundant in GJ 436b and other T ef f = 500 − 1000 K H-rich planets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Photochemical Effects</head><p>Photochemistry can significantly alter atmospheric composition in the upper portions. The combination of the ultraviolet flux and molecular absorption cross sections gives the photolysis rates for all the species considered here. The altitude of peak production/loss (in units of cm −3 s −1 ), set by the balance between the exponential fall-off of atmospheric density and the inward stellar UV attenuation, occurs near 1 µbar (this is the well known Chapman function, see <ref type="bibr">Yung &amp; DeMore 1999 pg. 45)</ref>. Primarily, photolysis breaks apart stable molecules into radicals, which can then react to alter the composition of the upper atmosphere. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 5, 6</ref> and 7 for the photochemically derived mixing ratios. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares the column mixing ratios from our models to the observations over the 7 bar to 0.1 bar range probed by the observations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> illustrates how photochemistry alters the upper atmosphere.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Atomic H &amp; H2O</head><p>Arguably, the most important radical in these atmospheres is atomic hydrogen. Its relatively large abundance (∼75% above 1 µbar, <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>) drives the bulk of disequilibrium chemistry in the upper atmosphere. As is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 5-7</ref>, when the atomic H abundance increases with altitude, the concentration of disequilib- rium species increases with it. Hydrogen attacks the large stable reservoirs, NH <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and CH 4 , to build these desequilibrium species. In the cold Solar System giants, atomic hydrogen is primarily produced by the photosensitized dissociation of H 2 via heavier hydrocarbons, and the photodissociation of CH 4 and ethylene C 2 H 4 . In hotter giant planets, as in GJ 436b, the atomic hydrogen is made primarily by the photodissociation of water ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liang et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Line et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Moses et al., 2010</ref>. This is because, unlike in the Solar System's giants, water is not sequestered in clouds and is readily available for photolysis. Its large UV cross section combined with a large thermochemical abundance, makes water the most important source of atomic hydrogen in GJ436b. The  <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.-Photochemically derived mixing ratios for the disequilibrium species, the hydrocarbons and hydrogen cyanide, for ζ = 0.1 (top), ζ = 1 (middle), and ζ = 50 (bottom) H 2 photolysis. Because of these factors the net photosensitized destruction of H 2 by H 2 O proceeds 5 ordersof-magnitude faster than the direct photolysis of H 2 , and 3 orders-of-magnitude faster than the photosensitized destruction of H 2 via the hydrocarbons. The mixing ratio of water itself is largely unaltered below 1µbar levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">CH4 &amp; Hydrocarbons</head><p>Thermochemically, methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon. Overall it is the fourth most abundant species after H 2 O, H 2 and He, and it is the parent molecule for the synthesis of all other hydrocarbons. Methane mixing ratios are ≥ 10 −4 at altitudes below the 0.1 mbar level, even for the lowest metallicities. The models generally have methane mixing ratios at least 3 orders-ofmagnitude higher than concentrations retrieved from the observations <ref type="bibr">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2011)</ref>. Although photolysis seems not to significantly modify methane abundances, it does produce large concentrations of the methyl radical, CH 3 ; this radical is important in the synthesis of heavier hydrocarbons. CH 3 is formed by photosensitized dissociation of methane. The free atomic hydrogen from scheme III readily attacks methane to produce H 2 and CH 3 . The trigger and pathway for this is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">H 2 O + hν → OH + H R25 H 2 + OH → H 2 O + H R169 H + CH 4 → CH 3 + H 2 R60 Net : CH 4 → CH 3 + H. IV</formula><p>The methyl radical's mixing ratios can be as high as ∼ 10 −4 , as in the ζ = 1 case ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Due to the warmer upper atmosphere, relative to that in the solar system giants, the oxidation of methane (via R60) is more two orders-of-magnitude more efficient than direct photolysis. Because the forward reaction (R60) proceeds more sharply with rising temperature than the reverse (R61), hotter upper atmospheres (as in HD 189733b and HD 209448b) will have a tendency to destroy methane more readily, especially when there are large quantities of photochemically produced atomic hydrogen present. This photosensitized destruction of methane causes it to decline sharply above ∼10 µbars; this is well below the planetary homopause, but well above the infrared photosphere ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>). It also drives the production of heavier hydrocarbons. Little to no heavier hydrocarbon (C n H m , where n, m ≥ 2) is expected via vertical mixing alone, with mixing ratios remaining below ∼ 10 −10 at altitudes above 1 bar. Methane photosensitization (scheme IV) converts the carbon into ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), acetylene (C 2 H 2 ), and ethane (C 2 H 6 ) via</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H 2 O + hν → OH + H R25 H 2 + OH → H 2 O + H R169 2(H + CH 4 → CH 3 + H 2 ) R60 CH 3 + CH 3 + M → C 2 H 6 + M R613 H + C 2 H 6 → C 2 H 5 + H 2 R70 H + C 2 H 5 → C 2 H 4 + H 2 R68 H + C 2 H 4 → C 2 H 3 + H 2 R85 H + C 2 H 3 → C 2 H 2 + H 2 R64 Net : 2CH 4 + 4H → C 2 H 2 + 5H 2 V</formula><p>The net reaction ultimately produces C 2 H 2 , making it the most abundant heavy hydrocarbon. This scheme is different than the solar system gas giants where the most dominant pathway for producing acetylene involves the binary collision between two 3 CH 2 radicals. This difference can again, be owed to the overwhelming abundance of atomic H from water photolysis which can readily reduce the ethane produced R613 to acetylene. Over the range of metallicities considered (ζ = 0.1 to 50), the peak values of C 2 hydrocarbons occur between 10 and 1 µbars. These mixing ratios of C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 6 lie between 3×10 −7 -6×10 −6 , 5×10 −6 -4×10 −4 , and 5×10 −9 -6×10 −5 <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>; for integrated columns see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). For comparison, the peak values in Jupiter are, respectively, ∼ 2 × 10 −6 , 5 × 10 −6 , and 20 × 10 −6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moses et al. 2005</ref>). In the Solar System's giant planets, ethylene, acetylene, and ethane have strong mid-infrared stratospheric emission features at 10.5, 13.7 and 12.1 µm respectively. These C 2 species can lead to further synthesis of higher order hydrocarbons that can form hydrocarbon aerosols ( ). However, the vapor pressures for these species are high (many bars) at these temperatures, so it may be difficult to form such aerosols. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moses et al. 1992</ref> showed that supersaturation ratios of 10 to 1000s may be required in order to trigger condensation due to the lack of nucleation particulates in Jovian type atmospheres. detectability</p></div>

In the absence of incident stellar UV, a profile with a constant vertical mixing ratio up to the homopause is obtained. With incident UV radiation, there is a photochemical enhancement of CO near the 1 µbar level, of up to a factor of 10 2 for the ζ = 1 case ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6, 8)</ref>. This high altitude enhancement is a property of the cooler atmosphere of GJ 436b; in hot Jupiter atmospheres, as in HD 189733b and HD 209458b, such enhancements or deficits will tend to be driven back towards equilibrium values. The carbon in this extra CO is ultimately derived from the CH 4 reservoir, via the following reaction scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">H 2 O + hν → OH + H R25 H 2 + OH → H 2 O + H R169 H + CH 4 → CH 3 + H 2 R60 H 2 O + hν → O + 2H R26 O + CH 3 → H 2 CO + H 2 R98 H + H 2 CO → HCO + H 2 R233 H + HCO → CO + H 2 R213</formula><p>Net :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H 2 O + CH 4 → CO + 2H 2 + 2H V I</formula><p>Scheme VI is driven by the water photolysis driven dissociation of CH 4 to CH 3 via scheme IV.

The two radicals, O and CH 3 , form formaldehyde in R98, and followed thereafter by a two-step conversion to CO (R233 and R213). An enhancement of CO 2 largely traces the enhancement of CO via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H 2 O + hν → OH + H R25 OH + CO → CO 2 + H R187 Net : H 2 O + CO → CO 2 + 2H V II</formula><p>Photochemically enhanced CO 2 mixing ratios reach ∼ 10 −4 at 1 µbar for ζ = 1.

Increasing the metallicity to ζ = 50, increases the mixing ratios to ∼1×10 −2 and ∼5×10 −4 , suggesting that the observed CO and CO 2 columns are consistent with a metallicity enhanced to levels observed in Solar System's ice giant planets <ref type="table">(Table  1</ref>).</p></div>

The atomic H reacts efficiently with CH 4 in R60, producing an increased concentration of the radical CH 3 , which in turn drives hydrocarbon production (scheme V) near the 0.1 bar level. However, the free H in the middle atmosphere, does little to affect the CH 4 mixing ratios; this is because the S/C abundance ratio is low. Sulfur would need to be enriched by a substantial factor of ∼20, over the solar S/C value, in order for H 2 S to have an appreciable impact on atmospheric CH 4 . Although the few considered sulfur species (H 2 S, SH) do not much impact the overall chemistry, it is possible that another sulfur compound, such as SO, may act as a catalyst assisting in the conversion of reduced carbon into oxidized carbon. Previously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moses (1996)</ref> has modeled the SL9 Jupiter impact and shown the importance of S in many reaction schemes involving both C and N species, and so the role of S chemistry in the hot extrasolar giants should continue to be investigated in the future (see . bars and 0.1 bars, the pressure levels sampled by the observations, for 0.1×, 1×, and 50× solar elemental abundances. We have developed a 1D "thermochemical and photochemical kinetics with transport" model following <ref type="bibr">Viss- cher et al. (2010)</ref> and recently, Moses et al. (2011) for extrasolar planet atmospheres. We use a compilation of bidirectional reactions of the five most abundant elements to model both the equilibrium and disequilibrium portions of the atmosphere. Using detailed balance with both forward and reverse reactions, allows our model to reach thermochemical equilibrium kinetically, thereby obviating the need to choose ad hoc lower boundaries for multiple quenched species, and allowing a seamless transition between the transport dominated and the chemical equilibrium zones. A limitation is that we adopt a static temperature structure; a future improvement would allow the iterative adjustment and co-evolution of the temperature structure with the chemistry. Also, the eddy diffusivity profile K zz (z) is poorly constrained, and is essentially a free parameter in any of these models.</p><p>We have applied our models to study the atmosphere of the transiting Neptune-like planet GJ 436b. The elemental abundance of atmosphere, a key input parameter, is relatively uncertain, but mass-radius constraints suggest that GJ 436b must be enriched to at least 10× solar levels. We model a range of atmospheric enrichment to cover this instrinsic uncertainty; we observe the trends when varying ζ, and rule out the possibility that intermediate values of ζ would spring any surprises. The UV fluxes of stars other than the Sun are often difficult to obtain. M-dwarf hosts can be chromospherically hyperactive, and because UV photolysis may drive the depletion of weakly bonded molecules such as CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 S, it is important to have an accurate UV estimate for GJ 436. We use a combination of GALEX and HST UV fluxes along with Rosat and XMM-Newton soft Xray fluxes to bound the UV continuum and line emission of GJ 436.</p><p>The GJ 436b model atmospheres show that a combination of photochemistry, chemical kinetics and transportinduced quenching drives the composition well out of equilibrium. While equilibrium conditions are maintained in the deep, hot, troposphere (below a 10s of bars for CO CH 4 , and 100s of bars for N 2 NH 3 ), the composition of the middle atmosphere is altered by the dredging up of quenched gases such as CO and NH 3 . The effects of transport disequilibrium are prominent in cooler planets such as GJ 436b because the quench points for major species depend on the temperature. As it gets colder, the pressure points for quenching are pushed deeper into the atmosphere due to the longer interconversion timescales from one species reservoir to another. In contrast to the quenched species (CO, CO 2 , NH 3 ), the effect of vertical mixing on the reservoir gases such as CH 4 and H 2 O is relatively feeble.</p><p>The reservoir gases H 2 O and CH 4 , and NH 3 are largely unaffected by photochemistry because of their (a) large abundances, and (b) rapid recycling. Nevertheless, it is their photolysis that drives the bulk of the disequilibrium chemistry in the upper atmosphere producing CH 4 and NH 3 sinks such as heavier hydrocarbons (such as C 2 H 2 , etc.) and simple nitriles (such as HCN). Much as in the hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liang et al. 2003</ref>), H is the most important and active atom in the bulk of the atmosphere; it is created by the photosensitized destruction of H 2 , catalyzed by the presence of H 2 O and H 2 S. The latter gas, though less abundant than water, is important because of its ability to capture incident starlight photons out wavelengths as long as 2600Å2600Å. In most models, H replaces H 2 as the most abundant species in the atmosphere above the planetary homopause at 1 µbar. Because CH 4 is the largest C carrier in the planet's UV photosphere, we create abundant C 2 compounds <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>) despite the relatively efficient hydrogenation back to CH 4 . Species such as acetylene, C 2 H 2 , formed in abundance in our enriched models, are precursors for potential hydrocarbon soot formation in the upper atmosphere (as opposed to the hotter Jupiters such as HD 209458b and HD 189733b, wherein CO carries the bulk of carbon in the stratosphere). Our reaction lists for hyrdocarbon chemistry are truncated at C 2 , and so we do not synthesize C 3 and heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles explicitly.</p><p>Within the range physical and chemical processes captured in our models, and the considered reaction sets and their kinetics, we find it difficult explain the observations suggesting a methane-poor GJ 436b. Except above 1 µbar pressure levels where CH 4 is photochemically converted to CO, HCN and C 2 hydrocarbons, it remains the predominant C reservoir in the lower atmosphere and in the region of the IR photosphere. The observed abundances of quenched CO and CO 2 are in agreement with an atmosphere enriched to levels intermediate between 1 to 50 times solar (as in <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2011</ref>). The depleted water may either contrarily suggest a sub solar metallicity <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, or skewed heavy metals ratios; the latter is a possibility which we have not considered herein as there are far too many combinations to explore. In the 1× solar models, the methane abundance  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Photochemically derived mixing ratios for ζ = 1 in the presence of sulfur species (H 2 S and HS) for the radicals (top), abundant species (middle), and disequilibrium species (bottom). Compare this Figure to the ζ = 1 cases in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 5, 6</ref>, and 7 to see the effects of H 2 S on the mixing ratios. Note that the abundance of atomic H is enhanced by orders of magnitude between 1 and 10 −4 bars as a result of scheme IX. This H increase enhances the hydrocarbon abundances significantly in this portion of the atmosphere.</p><p>is consistent with the values retrieved by <ref type="bibr">Beaulieu et al. (2010)</ref>  <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>) using transit observations. We suppose it is possible that a more complete inclusion of other relatively abundant elements such as S and P, or distorted elemental ratios (C/O or O/S etc.), or ill-understood chemistry and exotic processes (not considered herein, such as the 3 dimensionality of the problem) could do more to explain the chemistry of this enigmatic atmosphere.</p><p>We agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> that quench level arguments can be used to predict abundances, so long as this is done with the appropriate level of caution. By this, we mean that the relevant rate-limiting reaction must necessarily be identified in order to properly calculate the timescale for chemical loss. Also, quenched gases do not share a common quench level and assuming so can result in gross under-or overestimation of their abundances. For example, as shown herein, N 2 and CO have vastly different quench levels. For the moderate to high levels of incident UV flux, photolysis generates high concentrations of secondary byproducts, but does not significantly alter the abundances of the reservoir gases; in our estimation photochemistry cannot alter the dayside methane budget. Hotter atmospheres with sluggish vertical mixing and hot stratospheres are required for severe methane depletion. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 10</ref>, we approximate such as atmosphere as isothermal with T = 1200 K, ζ = 5, and K zz =1 × 10 6 cm 2 s −1 , and with zero UV irradiation (similar to models by ). In this hypothetical atmosphere there is relatively little quenched methane. At T = 1200 K and low pressures, the rate determining step for CH 4 → CO (reverse of R351) is faster than the vertical transport time throughout the atmosphere, allowing the CH 4 to be in thermochemical equilibrium with CO everywhere ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>). Since equilibrium conditions apply, the P 2 term in equation 2 results in the rapid vertical fall-off of CH 4 .</p><p>The models presented herein are by no means restricted in applicability to GJ 436b like Neptunes, and much of the modeled chemical state may be generalized to H/He dominated planets in the 500-1000 K temperature range. In this regime CH 4 is the primary carbon carrier and CO is quenched. The reverse is true in hotter atmospheres, T &gt; 10 3 K, where CO is the primary carbon carrier and CH 4 is quenched. NH 3 is quenched deep in the atmosphere and can be quite abundant in the photosphere. Higher hydrocarbons and HCN are produced photochemically in relatively high abundances at mbar to µbar pressures. Similarly, an enhancement of CO and CO 2 over the quench concentrations, driven by the photolysis of H 2 O, is observed in the high atmosphere. Water is in gaseous phase and abundant, and not condensed out as it would be in cooler atmospheres. GJ 1214b, a T 500 K low super Earth or mini Neptune, also orbiting an M dwarf primary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Charbonneau et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sada et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bean et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carter et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Désert et al. 2011</ref>), falls in this regime of warm atmospheres. If GJ 1214b is in possession of a reducing H-He atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Croll et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Crossfield et al. 2011</ref>), much of the atmospheric chemistry would be analogous to that in GJ 426b; this, however, is speculative as there is much current debate over the bulk composition of GJ 1214b.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Estimated temperature profiles for GJ 436b.
