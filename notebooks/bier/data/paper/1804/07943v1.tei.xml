				<p>Context. Inaccurate limb-darkening models can be a significant source of error in the analysis of the light curves for transiting exoplanet and eclipsing binary star systems, particularly for high-precision light curves at optical wavelengths. The power-2 limb-darkening law, I λ (µ) = 1 − c (1 − µ α), has recently been proposed as a good compromise between complexity and precision in the treatment of limb-darkening. Aims. My aim is to develop a practical implementation of the power-2 limb-darkening law and to quantify the accuracy of this implementation. Methods. I have used synthetic spectra based on the 3D stellar atmosphere models from the Stagger-grid to compute the limb-darkening for several passbands (UBVRI, CHEOPS, TESS, Kepler, etc.). The parameters of the power-2 limb-darkening laws are optimized using a least-squares fit to a simulated light curve computed directly from the tabulated I λ (µ) values. I use the transformed parameters h 1 = 1 − c (1 − 2 −α) and h 2 = c2 −α to directly compare these optimized limb-darkening parameters to the limb darkening measured from Kepler light curves of 16 transiting exoplanet systems. Results. The posterior probability distributions (PPDs) of the transformed parameters h 1 and h 2 resulting from the light curve analysis are found to be much less strongly correlated than the PPDs for c and α. The agreement between the computed and observed values of (h 1 , h 2) is generally very good but there are significant differences between the observed and computed values for Kepler-17, the only star in the sample that shows significant variability between the eclipses due to magnetic activity (star spots). Conclusions. The tabulation of h 1 and h 2 provided here can be used to accurately model the light curves of transiting exoplanets. I also provide estimates of the priors that should be applied to transformed parameters h 1 and h 2 based on my analysis of the Kepler light curves of 16 stars with transiting exoplanets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The specific intensity emitted from a stellar photosphere depends on both wavelength and viewing angle. For a source function that varies linearly with optical depth the specific intensity can be described by a linear limb darkening law, I λ (µ) = I λ (1) 1 − u(1 − µ) , where µ = cos(θ) is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the surface normal vector, and the wavelength dependence is implicit in the linear limb-darkening coefficient, u <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schwarzschild 1906)</ref>. In general, limb-darkening is more pronounced at shorter wavelengths, becoming almost negligible at infrared wavelengths. At optical wavelengths the best-fit linear limb-darkening coefficient computed from stellar atmosphere models are u ≈ 0.3 for hot stars (effective temperature T eff &gt; ∼ 15, 000 K) and then increases with decreasing T eff from this value to u ≈ 0.9 for stars with T eff ≈ 3500 K (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Claret 2004</ref>). Realistic stellar model atmospheres show that the actual limb darkening of solar-type stars varies by 10% or more around the best-fit linear limb-darkening law (e.g., Howarth 2011). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1 and 2</ref> only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/vizbin/qcat?J/A+A/000/A00 <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.

(2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kipping (2013)</ref>, etc. One well-established result from such studies is that using a linear limb darkening law can lead to significant bias in the parameters derived from the analysis of high quality photometry. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Espinoza &amp; Jordán (2016)</ref> found systematic errors in the radius estimates for small planets as large as 3% as a result of using linear limb-darkening coefficients. There are several alternative ways to parametrize limb-darkening. Among the alternative two-parameter laws, the most commonly used in exoplanet studies is the quadratic limb-darkening law <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kopal 1950</ref>) -</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I X (µ) = 1 − c 1 (1 − µ) − c 2 (1 − µ) 2 .</formula><p>This limb-darkening law has the advantage of being relatively simple and well-understood in terms of the correlations between the coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pál 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kipping &amp; Bakos 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Howarth 2011</ref>) and how to sample the parameter space to achieve a non-informative prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kipping 2013</ref>) but it fails to match optical high-precision light curves of transiting exoplanet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The Claret 4-parameter limb-darkening law (Claret 2000) is often used in exoplanet studies. As the name suggests, this limbdarkening law uses four coefficients to capture the detailed shape of the limb-darkening profile I X (µ) for a given bandpass X using the following equation -</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I X (µ) = 1 − 4 j=1 a j (1 − µ j/2 ).</formula><p>Including the coefficients of this limb-darkening law in a leastsquares fit to observed transit light curves is impractical because they are found to be strongly correlated with each other and degenerate with other parameters of the fit.

These coefficients may be fixed or the effective temperature used for the interpolation, T eff,ld , can be included as a free parameter in the fit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Maxted et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Among the limb-darkening laws with 2 coefficients, the power-2 limb-darkening law <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hestroffer 1997</ref>) has been recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morello et al. (2017)</ref> as they find that it outperforms other two-coefficient laws adopted in the exoplanet literature in most cases, particularly for cool stars.

There has been very little discussion in the literature of the power-2 limb-darkening law applied to exoplanet transit studies and so its properties and the practicalities of using this law to determine exoplanet properties are not yet well understood. Here I describe a practical implementation of the power-2 limbdarkening law, including a tabulation of the parameters for various passbands and instruments, and present an analysis of the Kepler light curves for 16 transiting exoplanet systems that has been used quantify the accuracy of these parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Analysis</head><p>The following section describes the calculation of the limbdarkening profiles, I X (µ), for various passbands and how the parameters of a power-2 limb-darkening law based on these profiles can be optimized for the analysis of the light curve for a given exoplanet system or binary star. I then compare these optimized power-2 limb-darkening law parameters to observed values for transiting planet host stars derived from the analysis of their Kepler light curves. This comparison shows a very good level of agreement between theory and observations so I then proceed to provide a tabulation of power-2 limb-darkening law parameters that can be used to model the light curves of exoplanet systems and binary stars together with some recommendations for their use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Calculation of the limb-darkening profiles</head><p>I have calculated the variation of specific intensity with viewing angle integrated over various passbands, i.e., the limb-darkening profile, I X (µ), where the subscript X denotes the passband. For the specific intensity as a function of wavelength and viewing angle, I λ (µ), I have used the synthetic 3D LTE spectra from the Stagger-grid calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Magic et al. (2015)</ref>. This grid of models spans a range of effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity that covers the majority of known exoplanet host stars. There are small but, for high-precision work, significant differences between the limb darkening predictions from 3D model atmospheres compared to 1D model atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Magic et al. 2015</ref>). 3D model atmospheres provide a more realistic description of the convective motions at different heights in cool star atmospheres than the simplified mixing-length approach adopted in 1D stellar model atmospheres. This is essential for accurate prediction of the limb darkening, which is determined mainly by the temperature gradient. The limb darkening predictions from 3D model atmospheres are a good match to the observed limb darkening profiles of the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pereira et al. 2013</ref>), α Cen A and B <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bigot et al. 2006</ref>) and HD 209458 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hayek et al. 2012</ref>). In all three cases, the 3D model atmospheres provide a better match to the observations than 1D model atmospheres. The 3D radiative hydrodynamic atmosphere models from which the spectra used here are calculated are described in more detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiavassa et al. (2018a)</ref>. The grid of stellar atmosphere models covers the effective temperature range T eff ≈ 4000 K to 7000 K in steps of approximately 500 K, the surface gravity range log g = 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and metallicity values of [Fe/H]= −2.0, −1.0, −0.5, 0.0 and +0.5. The coverage within these ranges is not uniform -the complete set of available models is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The effective temperature assigned to each model using the Stefan-Boltzmann law applied to the computed emergent spectrum is taken from <ref type="table">Table B0</ref>  The spectra at [Fe/H]= ±0.5 only cover the wavelength range up to 1 µm. The bandpasses for the CHEOPS and TESS instruments extend a small way beyond this limit. This was handled by calculating a linear fit to the log of the model flux, log f λ over the region 0.8 µm to 1 µm, and then extrapolating this linear fit up to 1.15 µm. Comparing this linear extrapolation to the computed flux at other values of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> shows that it provides a very good match to the actual flux distribution in this region, on average. In addition, the fraction of the stellar flux emitted in this extrapolated wavelength region for the CHEOPS and TESS bandpasses is &lt; ∼ 1% so this extrapolation will introduce negligible systematic error in the computed values of I X (µ).</p><p>The nature of the detector used in the instrument must be accounted for in the calculation of the limb-darkening profile ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bessell et al. 1998</ref>). Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) count photons, they do not measure energy, so for the accurate computation of I X (µ) over a passband with response function R X (λ) for an instrument with a CCD detector, the specfic intensity must be converted from energy flux to photon number flux, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I X (µ) = ∞ 0 R X (λ)I λ (µ)/(hc/λ) dλ.</formula><p>This has little effect for narrow passbands but can be a noticable effect for the broad-band photometers often used for planetary transit surveys such as Kepler and CHEOPS.</p><p>The irregular spacing of T eff values within the model grid and their relatively large spacing of about 500 K can be difficult to deal with when interpolating within the grid of I X (µ) values. To remedy this problem I have used interpolation of I X (µ) as a function T eff at each value of log g, [Fe/H] and µ to create a tabulation of I X (µ) on a regular grid of T eff with a grid spacing of 250 K. This requires a small degree of extrapolation at the edge of the model grid so I used quadratic spline interpolation to ensure that this extrapolation is stable. In a few cases there are only two values of T eff for a given pair of log g and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> values, in which case I use a linear fit to I X (µ) points for the interpolation and extrapolation. The model spectra for log g = 4.44 and (log g, [Fe/H]) = (3.0, −2) are only available for one value of T eff so there are no corresponding entries for these log g and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> values in the tabulations provided here. A complete tabulation of I X (µ) for each passband is provided in the electronic version of this journal, an excerpt from this table is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The limb-darkening profiles for T eff ≈ 5777 K are not included in tabulation of I X (µ) so interpolating in this table to match these profiles is a good test of the tabulated values and the interpolation scheme used. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> we compare the directly computed values of I X (µ) for T eff ≈ 5777 K and log g = 4.44 to the interpolated values using linear barycentric interpolation. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The rms residual between the computed and interpolated values is 0.5% or less over the µ range 0.01 to 1.0 for these data. Also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> are the corresponding power-2 limb-darkening laws where the parameters have been optimized as described Section 2.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Kepler light curves</head><p>To test the accuracy of the power-2 limb-darkening profiles calculated from the Stagger-grid I have compared model light curves generated from these data to high-precision light curves 1 implemented in the python module scipy.interpolate as the class LinearNDInterpolator for transiting exoplanet systems observed with Kepler. Transiting exoplanet systems with deep eclipses observed at high signal-to-noise with Kepler were selected from the list of 38 systems studied by <ref type="bibr">Müller et al. (2013)</ref>. I excluded stars for which there is no published estimate of T eff , log g and [Fe/H] based on high-resolution spectroscopy and also systems with stellar companions or eccentric orbits. There are also a few stars that had to be excluded from this study because they are too hot or too cool, i.e., the observed values of T eff , log g and [Fe/H] for these stars lie outside the grid of limb-darkening profiles from the Staggergrid.</p><p>Short cadence (SC) light curves from Data Release 25 (DR25, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Thompson et al. 2016</ref>) for the remaining 16 systems were downloaded from the the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes 2 (MAST). DR25 is the final data release from the Kepler mission and contains all the observation obtain during the original Kepler mission divided in 18 "quarters" (Q0 to Q17) with a typical duration of about 90 days each. I used the observations provided in the column PDCSAP_FLUX and their associated errors for this analysis. Observations with a non-zero value of the SAP_QUALITY quality flag were excluded from further processing. I also excluded outliers that deviated by more than 4 standard deviations from a running median filter. Trends in the data due to instrumental and stellar noise sources were modelled using a Gaussian process (GP) fitted to the data between the transits. I used the celerite package (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mackey et al. 2017</ref>) to model these data using the following kernel with the default value of = 0.01 to approximate the Matérn-3/2 covariance function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">k(τ) = σ 2 (1 + 1//) e −(1−) √ 3 τ/ρ (1 − 1//) e −(1+) √ 3 τ/ρ .</formula><p>Here, τ is the time difference between two observations and ρ is a parameter that controls the time scale over which observational errors are correlated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Light curve analysis</head><p>I used version 1.8.0 of the ellc light curve model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Maxted 2016)</ref> to determine the geometry and limb-darkening parameters for each of these 16 transiting exoplanet systems. The free parameters in the model for each system were: the radius of the host star in units of the semi-major axis, R /a, the ratio of the radii, k = R pl /R , where R pl is the radius of the companion; the impact parameter, b = a cos(i)/R , where i is the orbital inclination; the time of primary eclipse, T 0 ; the orbital period, P; and the power-2 limb-darkening parameters, c and α. For systems where contamination of the photometric aperture is noted in the MAST archive data I also include a "third-light" parameter, 3 , as a free parameter in the fit with a prior set by the mean and standard deviation of the contamination values given for each Kepler quarter. These contamination values are all very small ( &lt; ∼ 1%) so they have little influence on the analysis. I assume that the star in these exoplanet systems is spherical and use a polytrope with index n = 1.5 to calculate the dimensions of the ellipsoid used to approximate the shape of the planet. The flux contribution in the Kepler bandpass from the planet is assumed to be negligible for these systems. There is little or no information about the geometry of these systems in the observations between the eclipses so this analysis uses only observations obtained during transit plus an additional 25% of the transit width before and after start and end of the transit. Circular orbits have been assumed for all systems.</p><p>Some of the targets studied here show quasi-periodic variability due to magnetic activity (star spots). It is notoriously difficult to include star spots in the model for a transiting planet system because the number of free parameters required is large and the constraints on these parameters from the light curve are generally weak and highly degenerate. I did not attempt to model star spots for any of the systems here. Instead, I simply divideout the trend established from the Gaussian process fit to the outof-eclipse data. The effect of this approach on the results will be discussed below.</p><p>I used emcee (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mackey et al. 2013</ref>), a python implementation of an affine invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler, to calculate the posterior probability distribution (PPD) of the model parameters. An ensemble with 72 or (for cases where 3 was a free parameter) 80 samples per chain step ("walkers") was initialized using 512 "burnin" chain steps. The PPD was then calculated using 256 chain steps starting with the last ensemble from the burn-in phase. The convergence of the chain was judged by visual inspection of the parameters and the likelihood as a function of step number. In cases where it was suspected that the chain had not sampled the posterior probability distribution accurately, a new Markov Chain was calculated starting from the best-fit parameters in the previous chain. This initial optimization of the parameters was done using the "grid_1 = very_sparse" option in ellc to specify the minimum number of grid points for the numerical integration of the flux from the host star. This has the advantage of reducing the computation time but introduces a bias of approximately 50 ppm in the simulated eclipse depth. This bias is significant for the analysis of the very high precision light curves being used in this study so the results below were calculated using a second Markov chain with 256 chain steps following a burn-in phase of 128 steps using the option "grid_1 = default". The second chain was initialised using the best fit parameters found from the first Markov chain. In practice, this made a neglible difference to the result presented below for h 1 and h 2 but there are very small but significant differences to the parameters R /a, k and b for some stars.</p><p>The standard error for observation i was assumed to be σ 2 tot,i = σ 2 ext + σ 2 i where σ i is the standard error derived from the value PDCSAP_FLUX_ERR in the MAST archive file and σ ext is a constant that is optimized by including the relevant term in the calculation of the likelihood for each trial set of parameters. For most of the light curves studied here we find σ ext ≈ 20 ppm. If the out-of-eclipse level is included as a free parameter it is found to be always very close to the value 1 with a very small error and is not correlated with the other parameters so it was fixed this value for the analysis presented here.</p><p>A summary of the results from this analysis are given in Table A.1. The best fit found for each light curve is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. A.1</ref>. The values of T 0 and P are not quoted here because the long cadence (LC) data from Kepler and other times of mideclipse reported in the literature are not included in the analysis and so these estimates are not optimal. We also do not quote directly the values of c and α determined from these fits for the reasons described in the following section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Optimized power-2 limb-darkening law parameters</head><p>Howarth (2011) has outlined a simple and elegant method to achieve a "like-for-like" comparison between observed and theoretical limb-darkening profiles for transiting exoplanet systems. The essence of the method is to simulate light curves using the limb-darkening profile and then to find the parameters of the limb-darkening law that provide the best least-squares fit to this I used version 1.8.0 of the ellc light curve model to simulate light curves of transiting exoplanet systems using the limbdarkening profile data for the Kepler bandpass described in Section 2.1. After some experimentation I found that a simulated light curve with 32 points uniformly distributed from mid-transit to the end of the transit is sufficient to calculate h 1 and h 2 to a precision much better than the observed accuracy of these parameters. Similarly, the grid size option "very_sparse" is sufficient to precisely calculate the h 1 and h 2 for the transiting exoplanet systems studied here, although for the direct comparison with the values of h 1 and h 2 from the Kepler light curves in <ref type="table">Table A.</ref>1 we used the "default" grid size option in order to minimize the numerical noise in these results. The optimization of the limbdarkening parameters uses spheres to model both the star and the planet and a tabulation of the limb-darkening profile interpolated using a monotonic piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial 3 onto a regular grid of 51 µ values. The light curve is independent of the assumed value for R /a = 0.1 with these assumptions. The values of b = a cos i/R and k = R pl /R used for each system were taken from Table A.1. These calculations were done using the python module pycheops 4 that is currently under development in support of the ESA CHEOPS mission.</p><p>The values of h 1 and h 2 each define a relation between c and α, as follows -</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c = h 2 2 α ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">c = (1 − h 1 )/(1 − 2 −α ).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>These relations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. A.2</ref> for the values of h 1,comp and h 2,comp optimized as described above using limb-darkening profiles interpolated from  .

The bandpass, X, is noted in the first column as either the filter name for the Johnson photometric system, 'u_', 'g_', etc. for the SDSS photometric system, or the two initial letters for Kepler, CHEOPS, etc. For stars that do not show strong magnetic activity it can be assumed that h 1 is accurate to ±σ 1 = ±0.011 and h 2 is accurate to ±σ 2 = ±0.045.

The first case is similar to the exoplanet systems studied above but assuming that the observations have been done with CHEOPS rather than Kepler. The second case simulates an eclipsing binary containing two similar cool dwarf stars observed with TESS. The third case is a "worst-case scenario" of an eclipse of a metal-poor red giant observed in the Sloan u passband. The vertical scale in these diagrams is set by the median standard errors on h 1,obs and h 2,obs from Table A.1 (±0.003 and ±0.046, respectively). For the first two cases, the variation of h 1 and h 2 is always much less than the typical uncertainty on these values that can be achieved with the best data currently available. The variations in h 1 and h 2 are also less than ±0.003 and ±0.046 for b &lt; ∼ 0.9 in the worst-case scenario. For the first case we also simulated the case k = 0.9. In this case, h 1 and h 2 are also seen to have negligible dependence on k.</p><p>The optimized parameters of a power-2 limb-darkening law for all passbands are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for all values of T eff , log g and [Fe/H] in our re-sampled model grid. The optimization has only been done for the case b = 0 and k = 0.1 since, in general, the parameters h 1 and h 2 show very little dependence on these parameters. The calculation was done using the grid size option "default" in ellc to simulate 32 points evenly distributed through one half of a symmetrical transit light curve, as described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p>The differences ∆h 1 = h 1,obs −h 1comp and ∆h 2 = h 2,obs −h 2comp between the observed and computed values of h 1 and h 2 are shown <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. A simulated light curve for the following parameters: R /a=0.2, k=0.1, b=0.4, q=0.0008, h 1 = 0.75 ± 0.01, h 2 = 0.45 ± 0.05. The upper plot shows the light curve for the nominal values of h 1 and h 2 and (indistinguishable at this scale) the light curves for both h 1 and h 2 perturbed upwards by one standard deviation. The lower plot shows the change in flux due to a change by +1 standard deviation in h 1 (dashed line) and h 2 (dotted line). Also shown in the lower panel is the effect of using a sphere to model the shape of the transiting planet instead of a polytrope (dot-dashed line). Note that in the latter case the radius of the sphere has been reduced by 0.5% cf. the volume-average radius of the ellipsoid used to model the planet as a polytrope. This correction is required so that the eclipse depth for the spherical planet case matches the eclipse depth for the ellipsoidal planet model. as a function of effective temperature, T eff , in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kepler-17</ref> is a clear outlier in these plots. This is very likely to be a consequence of the magnetic activity that is obvious in the light curve of this star. The root mean square of this variation is about 0.8% on average in the Kepler SC light curves of Kepler-17, which is an order of magnitude larger than the next most variable star and approximately 60 times larger than the median value of this statistic for the other 15 stars in this sample. For this reason, we ignore Kepler-17 in the following discussion of the random and systematic errors in ∆h 1 and ∆h 2 .</p><p>The square root of the mean residuals excluding Kepler-17 are 0.012 for h 1 and 0.055 for h 2 . The mean value of the residuals are ∆h 1 = 0.010 ± 0.002 and ∆h 2 = −0.042 ± 0.010, where the uncertainty quoted here is the standard error on the mean. If we assume that there is some additional error σ 1 in either the computed or observed values of h 1 , and similarly for h 2 , then we find that σ 1 = 0.011 and σ 2 = 0.045 are required to achieve χ 2 = N df for the null hypothesis ∆h 1 = ∆h 2 = 0, where N df = 15 is the number of degrees of freedom, which is equal to the number of observations here since there are no free parameters in this model. The origin of this small additional uncertainty in h 1 , and h 2 will be discussed below, but it should be stated immediately that these statistics represent a remarkably good level of agreement between the state-of-the-art in stellar atmospheric models and the best available observational data for planet host stars. They also demonstrate that the power-2 limb-darkening law does indeed represent a very good approximation to both the observed and theoretical limb-darkening profiles of cool stars. It also has the advantage of being a simple function of two parameters, and the transformed parameters h 1 and h 2 provide a way to represent this limb-darkening law that allows for direct comparison between theory and observations. These transformed parameters are have the useful feature that they are not strongly correlated Article number, page 6 of 13 P. F. L. Maxted : Power-2 limb-darkening from the Stagger-grid when used as free parameters for the least-squares fit to the light curves of transiting exoplanet systems.</p><p>In general, there remains a weak correlation between h 1 and h 2 in the PPDs shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. A.2</ref>. It is possible to reduce or remove this correlation by adjusting the choice of a reference value of µ ref in the definition of the parameters h 1 = I X (µ ref ) = 1 − c 1 − µ α ref and h 2 = I X (µ ref ) − I X (0) = cµ α ref . We have not made this adjustment here because the aim is to compare the values of h 1 and h 2 for different stars. It is not straightforward to compare the values of h 1 and h 2 across a sample of stars because these values will depend on the different values of µ ref used for each transiting exoplanet as well as the properties of the star itself.</p><p>Kepler-17 is a clear outlier in terms of its variability between the transits and also an outlier in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>. A likely reason for this disagreement can be seen from careful inspection of the residuals from the light curve fit in <ref type="figure">Fig. A.1</ref>. There is clear excess noise during the transit that is not seen before or after the transit. This excess noise is due to the planet transiting magnetically active regions on the star (star spots and faculae). This strongly suggests that the reason for the offset between the observed and computed values of h 1 and h 2 is due to the relatively high level of magnetic activity in this star. It is also noticable that the small but significant mean offset between the observed and computed values of h 1 and h 2 for the other 15 stars in the sample are both in the same sense as for Kepler-17, i.e., ∆h 1 positive and is ∆h 2 is negative. This suggests that part of the reason for this offset may be weak magnetic activity in these solar-type stars that is not included in the stellar atmosphere models used here. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows the effect on a typical light curve of perturbing h 1 by σ 1 and similarly for h 2 and σ 2 . It can be seen that h 1 influences the overall shape and depth of the transit, whereas the influence of h 2 is mostly confined to the ingress and egress phases, as might be expected given that it is defined as the change in specific intensity due to limb darkening near the limb of the stars (h 2 = I X ( 1 /2) − I X (0)). It should be emphasized that changes in the transit depth and shape due to the uncertainties in h 1 and h 2 are very small ( &lt; ∼ 50 ppm) and so will only be noticable in light curves of the very highest quality for bright systems with deep eclipses. Indeed, it may be that some of the offset between the observed and computed values of h 1 and h 2 is due to small systematic errors in the photometry. In general, the current level of uncertainty in the computed values of h 1 and h 2 will have a negligible impact on the analysis of most light curves at optical wavelengths for many transiting exoplanets. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> also demonstrates that using a sphere to optimize of the power-2 limb-darkening law coefficients instead of an ellipsoid will have a negligible effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Using the power-2 limb-darkening law</head><p>The analysis above supports the conclusion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morello et al. (2017)</ref> that the power-2 limb-darkening law is to be recommended for the analysis of transiting exoplanet light curves. The atmospheric parameters (T ref , log g and [Fe/H]) for many planet host stars are covered by the grid of parameters for the power-2 limb-darkening law provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The power-2 limbdarkening law has been implemented in the light curve model ellc and can also be used with other light curve models, e.g., batman <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kreidberg 2015)</ref>. It is quite straightforward to implement this simple law in other light curve models. There does not appear to be any reason why the power-2 limb-darkening law cannot also be used to model eclipsing binary stars, and the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> suggest that the convenient properties of the transformed parameters h 1 and h 2 apply equally to these systems as for transiting exoplanet systems.</p><p>The transformed parameters h 1 and h 2 also make it straightforward to calculate a Bayesian prior that accounts for the uncertainties in the model coefficients when calculating the likelihood during the analysis of light curves using methods such as emcee or other Markov chain methods. For passbands similar to Kepler, e.g., CHEOPS, CoRoT and Gaia, the results from the analysis above can be used directly. For stars that do not show strong magnetic activity it can be assumed that h 1 is accurate to ±σ 1 = ±0.011 and h 2 is accurate to ±σ 2 = ±0.045. The Bayesian prior can then be calculated using a Gaussian centred on the values of h 1 and h 2 interpolated from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> with standard deviations σ 1,tot = √ σ 1 + σ 1,obs , where σ 1,obs is the standard error on h 1 due to the uncertainties in the observed values of T eff , log g and [Fe/H], and similarly for σ 2,obs . The values of σ 1,obs and σ 2,obs can be calculated using a Monte Carlo method, as described in Section 2.5. Limb darkening becomes less important at longer wavelengths so the same assumptions can also be made for redder passbands such as TESS, Johnson I band and Sloan z band. This assumptions may be a little pessimistic, but this is a sensible approach to take until the cause of the uncertainties in h 1 and h 2 are better understood. For bandpasses such as Johnson B band that cover shorter wavelengths where limb darkening is a stronger effect I would recommend increasing the assumed values of σ 1 and σ 2 by a factor of 2 or 3, perhaps even more for the Johnson U band and Sloan u band where the effect of uncertainties in the atomic data for the large number of atomic lines in these strongly line-blanketed regions may be much worse.</p><p>The analysis above only quantifies the uncertainties in the model coefficients for dwarf stars with [Fe/H] &gt; ∼ 0 showing weak magnetic activity. It is likely that the model uncertainties are larger for stars that are magnetically active and may well be biased in the sense that h 1 is too low and h 2 is too high. However, this conclusion is only based on one magnetically active star in the sample studied so far so it needs further investigation. Similarly, there is currently very little information available to quantify the uncertainties in the power-2 limb-darkening law coefficients for metal poor stars or giant stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The power-2 limb-darkening law can be recommended for the analysis of light curves for transiting exoplanet systems and binary stars for stars with T eff , log g and [Fe/H] within the model grid range studied here. Tabulations of the parameters of the power-2 limb-darkening law have been provided and tested against very high quality observations of transiting exoplanet systems obtained with Kepler. These observations have been used to quantify the uncertainties in the parameters h 1 and h 2 for dwarf stars with [Fe/H] &gt; ∼ 0 showing weak magnetic activity. There may be a small bias in the computed values of h 1 and h 2 compared to the best-fit values for magneticically active stars, but this needs further investigation. Further work is also needed to quantify the uncertainties in h 1 and h 2 for metal poor stars and red giants.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>of Chiavassa et al.
