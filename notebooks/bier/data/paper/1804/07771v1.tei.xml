			<abstract>
				<p>The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is the closest known planetary-mass, free-floating object and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar system gas giants. Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. (2016) presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5-5.1 µm (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here, we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4-4.14 µm. We present a set of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar abundance. We find that there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible exoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric dynamics and formation processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Planetary-mass free-floating brown dwarfs serve as touchstone objects for understanding planetary atmospheres. Most of these objects likely have the bulk compositions of stars, but the physics and chemistry that govern their atmospheres are complex and closely resemble those of giant planets. WISE J085510.83-071442.5, hereafter WISE 0855, is unique and valuable amongst the family of known freefloating planets. It is the coldest such object discovered to date and has a temperature of ∼250 K, only ∼100 K warmer than that of Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luhman 2014</ref>). WISE 0855 is one of our closest neighbors-the fourth closest system to the Solar System-with a distance measured to be 2.23 ± 0.04 parsec , so it provides the best opportunity to characterize a very cool substellar atmosphere. Its mass is very likely below the deuterium-burning limit: 3-10 M J assuming an age of 1-10 Gyr <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luhman 2014</ref>). Compared to currently known extrasolar gas giants that will be observed at high fidelity in the coming decade, WISE 0855 is the most similar object to the solar system gas giants.</p><p>With an effective temperature of ∼250 K, the spectrum of WISE 0855 is expected to be dominated by water, methane, and ammonia, much like Jupiter. While hotter brown dwarfs are enshrouded in refractory iron, silicate, sulfide, and salt clouds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Tsuji et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allard et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marley et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Helling et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cushing et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Witte et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morley et al. 2012</ref>), brown dwarfs cooler than T eff ∼350-375 K likely have volatile clouds of water ice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Morley et al. 2014b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Previous Photometric Observations of WISE 0855</head><p>A number of studies from both the ground and space have aimed to detect WISE 0855 and characterize its temperature, composition, and cloud properties. The first groundbased near-infrared observations found that WISE 0855 is very faint at these wavelengths; upper limits were placed on its flux in z, Y , and H bands ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beamín et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kopytova et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wright et al. 2014</ref>) while <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Faherty et al. (2014)</ref> detected WISE 0855 at 2.6σ confidence in a deep J band observation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schneider et al. (2016)</ref> and  aimed to further characterize WISE 0855's atmosphere using HST/WFC3 and some additional ground-based observations. The object was detected in six optical and near-infrared filters on WFC3 and confirmed to be very faint at these wavelengths. Each study independently concluded that none of the available models matched the full SED of WISE 0855 simultaneously. The photometry is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.1 and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Almost all of WISE 0855's emergent flux is at thermal infrared wavelengths longer than 2 µm, as the Wien tail collapses at T eff &lt;350 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2003</ref>). In fact, while a 425 K Y dwarf is expected to emit about 10% of its flux at wavelengths shorter than 2 µm, for a ∼250 K Y dwarf like WISE 0855, only 0.1% of its flux is emitted at these shorter wavelengths. WISE 0855 has been observed repeatedly using both WISE and Spitzer in the 3-15 µm region. The thirteen Spitzer photometry measurements are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>These observations consistently show that, compared to a range of models, WISE 0855 is significantly brighter at 3-4 µm than the models predict, by ∼1 mag <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luhman 2014</ref>). This discrepancy is not unique to WISE 0855; it is consistent across the population of late T and Y dwarfs cooler than 600 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Leggett et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beichman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. 2017</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. (2017)</ref> compared models with a variety of temperatures, gravities, clouds, disequilibrium carbon/nitrogen chemistry, and changes to the adiabatic slope (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tremblin et al. 2015</ref>), but found that none of these physical properties explained the mid-infrared colors of late T and Y dwarfs. Models that adequately fit the mid-infrared photometry have not yet been developed by any groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Esplin et al. (2016)</ref> monitored WISE 0855 for photometric variability in Spitzer IRAC1 and IRAC2 bands and detected peak-to-peak variability of 3-5% in both bands within a 23-hour observation, at two different epochs. This variability indicates that the photosphere of WISE 0855 is heterogeneous in brightness, potentially caused by patchy clouds, inhomogeneous chemistry, or hot/cold spots. 1.2. Previous Spectroscopic Observations of WISE 0855 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref> observed the first spectrum of WISE 0855 using the GNIRS instrument on the Gemini North telescope in M band, from 4.5-5.1 µm. The spectrum is dominated by water vapor features; it shows muted amplitude features and flat continuum shape consistent with a cloud deck in the atmosphere. The spectrum also revealed an unexpected lack of phosphine <ref type="bibr">(PH 3</ref> ) in contrast to Jupiter's atmosphere which has a strong PH 3 feature at these wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">This Work</head><p>Here, we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in the L band, from 3.4 to 4.14 µm. This wavelength region is complementary to the M band since it probes the long wavelength portion of a strong CH 4 absorption feature (and therefore carbon abundance), while the M band probes H 2 O features. This region is also sensitive to water clouds and PH 3 absorption. We combine this L band measurement with the M band spectrum from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref> to provide insight into the mid-infrared spectrum of WISE 0855. We generate a new set of cold atmospheric models, with a variety of compositions and including the effect of clouds, in order to fit the observed spectra and photometry of WISE 0855.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Observations</head><p>We obtained an L-band spectrum of WISE 0855 using the GNIRS spectrograph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Elias et al. 2006</ref>) on the Gemini-North Telescope (program GN-2017A-FT-6). Gemini North is operated in queue mode, which allowed us to observe WISE 0855 during clear, dry, calm conditions over the course of several nights. We used the 10.44 lines mm −1 grating with the 0. 05 pix −1 camera and a 0. 675 x 49 slit, resulting in a 3.2-4.14 µm spectrum. The spectral resolving power varies linearly with wavelength from ∼240 at 3.2 µm to ∼310 at 4.1 µm with an average of R ≈ 275. We used the "Bright Object" readout mode for GNIRS which includes one low noise read and 16 digital averages, resulting in a minimum integration time of 0.55 s. To balance observing efficiency with saturation at long wavelengths, we chose an integration time of 5 s. For observations of WISE 0855, each exposure was 5 s × 11 coadds. For observations of telluric standards, each exposure was 5 s × 4 coadds. All observations were taken using a 6 ABBA nod pattern to enable subtraction of the telescope and sky background. Nine ABBA patterns (36 total exposures, for 1980 s of total integration time) composed each set of WISE 0855 observations. A single ABBA pattern (4 total exposures, for 80 s of total integration time) was obtained for each telluric standard.</p><p>Our queue observations (summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) were conducted during 4 nights in March 2017. Each night, our observations started with the observation of a B8V type telluric standard, HIP 39898, followed by one ∼45 minute set of WISE 0855 observations. WISE 0855 was then reacquired, and another set of WISE 0855 observations were obtained, followed by observation of HIP 49900, an A0V telluric standard. The total integration time on WISE 0855 was 4.4 hours over 4 nights. All observations of WISE 0855 were obtained within 1.5 hours of meridian transit. Thus, the airmass at the time of our observations was optimal, and the airmass match between WISE 0855 and our telluric standards was excellent, with only a slight (≤0.04) difference in airmass between WISE 0855 and associated telluric standard observations. WISE 0855 has a high proper motion of 8.118 per year . The location of WISE 0855 at the time of the observations was calculated by propagating its proper motion and parallax , which provides a location accurate to better than ∼ 0.1 , which is the blind-offset pointing precision of Gemini. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref>, we used a blind acquisition technique to place WISE 0855 in the slit, using an offset from a nearby star on the sky with a calibrated astrometric location <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Faherty et al. 2014</ref>). The chosen 0. 675 slit assures us that the observation is not subject to significant slit losses.</p><p>Observing conditions for the Gemini queue were restricted to 0.50 seeing or better in L band (70th percentile on Mauna Kea), cloudless (50th percentile), and 3mm or less precipitable water vapor (80th percentile). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data Reduction</head><p>We first rotate the raw exposures by 90 degrees, so that the spatial direction is roughly aligned with image columns and the dispersion direction is roughly aligned with rows. We then flag any pixels with values greater than 10,000 per coadd as nonlinear. Rather than correct for non-linearity, we carry these flags throughout the reduction process. We scale each image by its median and then create nod-subtracted (A-B) pairs from adjacent A and B images.</p><p>To spatially and spectrally rectify our data, we use a mod-  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Space-based photometry of WISE 0855 from the literature, converted to flux density. Photometric measurements are shown as points; the corresponding filters are shown at the bottom, scaled for display on the plot. From blue to red, the filters are: HST/WFC3 F850LP, F105W, F110W, F125W, F127M, F160W, WISE W1 (yellow), Spitzer IRAC1 (green), Spitzer IRAC2 (red), WISE W1 (orange), WISE W3. vapor content of 1.0 mm. We first smooth the sky model to R∼273, and then run both the sky model and our observed sky emission through a high-pass filter to remove thermal emission. We create a 2nd-order polynomial wavelength solution for our observed sky spectrum using barycentric Lagrangian interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berrut &amp; Trefethen 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Waring 1779)</ref>. We use IDL's AMOEBA to solve for the wavelengths of the first, middle, and last pixels of our observed sky spectrum which minimizes residuals between our model and observed sky spectra. To create a spectral map, we use AMOEBA to solve for the dispersion solution at 5 different rows (i.e. different spatial positions), which we then use to remap each exposure so that each image column corresponds to a single wavelength. The spectral and spatial maps determined for each set of telluric standard data are likewise applied to adjacent observations of WISE 0855.</p><p>For observations of WISE 0855 we remove residual sky lines by subtracting the median from each column in the rectified, nod-subtracted A-B pairs. We then combine the rectified, nod-subtracted A-B pairs with 3-σ clipped mean at each pixel. The uncertainty of each pixel in the stacked image is the standard deviation of the mean. Our uncertainties agree with expectations from Poisson statistics.</p><p>We extract a spectrum for each nod position in our stacked A-B images. We first determine the row corresponding to each nod position by taking the median along each row for columns corresponding to wavelengths of 3.70-4.14 µm (where flux from the object is significant). We smooth this spatial cut by 7 pixels (0. 35), and then fit two Gaussians to the smoothed spatial cut. For each nod, we extract the spectrum using an aperture centered at the peak of the Gaussian and having an aperture radius of 6-9.5 pixels (0. 3-0. 475), which typically match the seeing and visually encompassed the bulk of the object's flux in the spatial cut. We subtract any sky background residuals by fitting a line to background regions 75 pixels in width and starting 3 aperture radii away from the edge of the aperture. If a pixel in the aperture is flagged as non-linear in more than 10% of the raw images, the extracted spectrum at that wavelength is also flagged. For  each night of observation, our reduction results in an A and B spectrum for each observation set, or four extracted spectra of WISE 0855. For our telluric standards, we use REDSPEC to extract the final spectra, tracking uncertainties using Poisson statistics. We correct each extracted spectrum of WISE 0855 for telluric absorption by creating a telluric spectrum from an adjacent telluric standard. To create a telluric absorption spectrum, we first remove the Pfund γ and Brackett α lines in the telluric standard spectrum by fitting and subtracting Gaussian fits to the lines. We then divide the telluric standard spectrum by an appropriate blackbody for the temperature and V -band magnitude of the telluric star. In total, we had 16 telluriccorrected spectra of WISE 0855, which we then combine using robust weighted mean ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cushing et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>The spectrum is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. We bin the final spectrum in wavelength using a weighted average to a spectral resolution of ∼250 (∼10 pixels per bin). The final binned spectrum, shown in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>, has a mean S/N per bin of ∼6 from 3.53 to 4.14µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Model Atmospheres</head><p>We generate new atmospheric models to compare to the measured photometry and spectra of WISE 0855. We run models with a small range in effective temperatures of 250-270 K and log g=4.0. WISE 0855's effective temperature has been constrained to a small range in previous works using models with a wider range of temperatures (e.g., Luhman 2014, find that the best fit models are in this T eff range). We find comparing to previous larger model grids at solar metallicity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Morley et al. 2014b</ref>) that models around 250-270 K provide the best fits, and therefore focus on this range for our detailed model grid presented here.</p><p>We To generate model atmospheres, we calculate the temperature structures assuming radiative-convective equilibrium.

Cloud material in excess of the saturation vapor pressure of the limiting gas is assumed to condense into spherical, homogeneous cloud particles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Partial vs. Homogeneous Clouds</head><p>One substantial difference from the approach taken in Morley et al. (2014b) is that we consider homogeneous clouds rather than 'partial' (50%) cloud cover, converging pressuretemperature profiles in radiative-equilibrium with a fully cloudy atmosphere. Homogeneous clouds have a stronger effect on the mid-infrared spectrum.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Morley et al. (2014b)</ref>, the majority of models were 50% cloudy, 50% clear, which ensured that pressure-temperature profiles could converge for all objects in that temperature range. The most numerically unstable region-in terms of converging the temperature profile-is from ∼300 to ∼375 K, right as the water ice clouds are beginning to form. This occurs because the clouds form high in the atmosphere, and the temperature profile ends up very close to, and parallel to, the condensation curve. Small changes in temperature therefore give a large change in cloud opacity and gas opacity. For colder objects, the water clouds form deeper, in a region where the temperature profile is steeper and no longer parallel to the condensation curve. The same small deviations in temperature have a smaller impact on gas and cloud opacity, and the models converge somewhat more easily. We run homogeneous models for this new work, more similar to all of the previous cloudy brown dwarf models from our group ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marley et al.

These include species that might increase in abundance due to disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry as well as species predicted to be present in equilibrium in trace amounts.

Instead, Jupiter's atmosphere is abundant in PH 3 with a mixing ratio around 0.8 ppm (about 3× solar) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Irwin et al. 1998</ref>). This indicates that vertical mixing from deep, hot layers of Jupiter's atmosphere must occur on a faster timescale than PH 3 can be converted into P 4 O 6 , allowing us to probe mixing in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other trace species can be used to measure atmospheric dynamics in a similar way.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, we include the carbon-bearing species CO, CO 2 , HCN, CH 3 D and C 2 H 2 .

It also shows a number of absorption features, in particular at ∼3. <ref type="bibr">65</ref> 1200 K, log g=4.5 1100 K, log g=4.5 500 K, log g=4. We then compare the L band spectrum we observe in this work to other brown dwarfs and to Jupiter in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>. We include, from hottest to coldest, SDSS 0857+57 (spectral type L8), SDSS 0758+32 (spectral type T2), and UGPS 0722-05 (spectral type T9). The T9 dwarf UGPS 0722-05 was the coldest brown dwarf for which a spectrum in L band was available previous to this work. The spectra of SDSS 0857+57 and SDSS 0758+32 were taken with the Near InfraRed Imager and spectrograph (NIRI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hodapp et al. 2003</ref>) and published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Stephens et al. (2009)</ref>. The spectrum of UGPS 0722-05 was taken with the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kobayashi et al. 2000</ref>) on the Subaru telescope and published in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leggett et al. 2012</ref>). The Jupiter spectrum was observed using the Short Wave Spectrometer (SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (Irwin 2009).</p><p>Methane absorption is clearly seen in the L8 and T2 spectra at 3.3-3.35 µm, strengthening in amplitude with later spectral type. The slope of the overall spectrum changes from relatively flat to significantly more sloped with decreasing T eff . For the T9 and for WISE 0855, methane absorption is even stronger and the objects are not detected at high significance within the 3.3 µm feature, but other weaker absorption features are seen from 3.6-4.1 µm (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>; these features increase in strength with decreasing T eff . Jupiter's L band spectrum also shows a number of the same absorption features. However, Jupiter's spectrum in L band is dominated by reflected light rather than thermal emission, so we expect the overall shape of the spectrum and amplitude of the features to be distinct from the brown dwarfs, which have contributions only from thermal emission.</p><p>Model pressure-temperature profiles with effective temperatures and gravities that correspond to the objects shown in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">How Different Atmospheric Properties Change Model Spectra</head><p>The four physical properties of the atmosphere that we focus on in this study are metallicity, C/O ratio, clouds, and effective temperature. Each of these properties has a significant effect on the resulting thermal emission spectrum. These effects are shown for a selection of illustrative models in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ures 9</ref> and 10; in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>, the full spectrum from 0.8-15 µm is shown, and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref>, the spectrum is binned to approximately the resolution of the observed L and M band spectra and normalized.</p><p>Lower metallicity models typically have broader nearinfrared spectral features and more flux at the K band peak (∼2.1 µm). Because lower metallicity models have less CH 4 , the emergent flux from 3-4 µm increases at lower metallicity (see, e.g., Tremblin et al. models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. (2017)</ref>, their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>). As discussed in Section 1.1, a long-standing discrepency between model Y dwarfs and observed Y dwarfs is that the models are too faint in bandpasses that probe this 3-4 µm flux, so in general we find that lower metallicity models match the mid-infrared photometry better than higher metallicity models. Decreasing the metallicity subtly decreases the size of features in L band, while making the overall slope of the M band spectrum shallower.</p><p>Decreasing the C/O ratio is another way to decrease the overall methane abundance in our models, since methane is the dominant carbon-bearing species in the atmosphere. For these models, we hold oxygen abundance steady while changing the carbon abundance to change the C/O ratio. Lower C/O ratio model spectra have more flux within major CH 4 features including the red side of H band (1.65 µm), 3-4 µm, and 7-8 µm. Decreasing the C/O ratio makes the L band slope more shallow, while leaving the M band spectrum essentially unchanged.</p><p>The formation of water clouds has a substantial effect on the spectrum. Clouds both provide a continuum opacity source in the atmosphere and make the atmosphere slightly warmer, especially in the upper regions where the clouds are forming. Water clouds are especially interesting because they have strongly wavelength-dependent opacity (see discussion in Section 4.2.2), with more strongly absorbing optical properties in the thermal infrared than in the near-infrared. The effect of water ice clouds on the spectrum is apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 9</ref>, where the cloud-free and cloudy models have distinctly different SEDs; the cloudy model has a lower peak flux from 4-5 µm, and higher flux in absorption bands and through the rest of the spectrum. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref> The bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 9 and 10</ref> show the effect of changing the temperature; in general, changing the temperature does not change the shape of the spectrum, but just scales the flux. The lack of large changes in spectral shape is because the chemistry does not change substantially across this small temperature range.</p></div>

We do not set out to perform a quantitative numerical analysis of the full range of models that provide the best-fits to the spectra and photometry of this object. We suggest that this endeavour is better suited to future studies using retrieval techniques to fit this wealth of data, as developed for brown dwarf studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Line et al.

We include the three bluest WISE bands (3.4, 4.6, and 12 µm) and two Spitzer IRAC bands (3.6 and 4.5 µm). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 12</ref> shows the data with a model from our small grid that best-matches the full set of photometry from HST, Spitzer, and WISE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the spectral data with a model that best matches the L and M band spectra. We find that solar composition, solar carbon-abundance models fit the mid-infrared color very poorly, in agreement with a variety of previous studies (e.g., Luhman 2014; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. 2017)</ref>. We start by focusing on finding a family of models that can match these mid-infrared data, since &gt;99% of the thermal emission is expected to be emitted at wavelengths longer than 2 µm.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>, there are a variety of ways to increase the flux from 3-4 µm relative to 4-5 µm as is needed to fit the observed photometry: decrease the metallicity, decrease the C/O ratio, and increase the cloud opacity. A variety of models are found to provide reasonable fits to the data, including some at extremely low metallicities ([M/H]=−0.75 to −1), well outside of the expected range of metallicities for stars in the local neighborhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hinkel et al. 2014</ref>). and N is the number of data points. We find similarly good fits (χ 2 /N ∼4-5) for models with solar metallicty and evenmore-sub-solar C/O (0.15, quarter-solar C/O). These lowmethane abundance models are substantially better matches to the observed mid-infrared photometry than the best-fit solar metallicity and solar C/O ratio models, which have a goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N &gt;41.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> shows the same model zoomed in to compare to the L and M band spectra of WISE  0855. The model has goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N=6.7 (L band) and χ 2 /N=7.6 (M band). Fitting to the full set of photometry of WISE 0855 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure  12</ref>) provides qualitatively similar results. We favor somewhat colder models (T eff =250 instead of 270 K), but similarly find lower metallicities and lower C/O ratios provide the best matches. We note that none of the models are good matches to the full dataset, with a best goodness-of-fit in the grid χ 2 /N &gt; of 23.7. We suggest a possible mechanism that could explain this discrepancy in Section 4.3.1.</p><p>In general, these results suggest that a promising way to match the infrared colors of WISE 0855 is to decrease the amount of methane in the atmosphere, either through primordial abundances (low metallicity or low C/O ratio) or by an as-of-yet-unaccounted for sink of carbon or methane.</p><p>We do not however expect mixing from deep, hot layers of the atmosphere to be an effective mechanism for decreasing the CH 4 abundance: as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>, for a ∼250 K object, even deep layers at nearly 1000 bar pressures are dominated by CH 4 . Using more detailed models including vertical mixing, Morley et al. (2014b) (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 12</ref>) similarly find no significant spectral changes due to disequilibrium carbon (and nitrogen) chemistry from vertical mixing for the coldest objects.</p><p>As discussed previously, the [3.6]- <ref type="bibr">[4.5]</ref> color is discrepant between models and observations for all T and Y dwarfs cooler than 600 K; the proposed solution of lower methane absorption may therefore potentially solve this problem for WISE 0855 and other cold dwarfs. While a single object like WISE 0855 might have a primordial composition that deviates from solar, it is unlikely that all T and Y dwarfs have sub-solar compositions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. (2017)</ref> investigated metallicity variations in the population of Y dwarfs and did not find that WISE 0855 appeared to be an outlier in its composition. Given that a systematic low primordial metallicity or C/O ratio is unlikely to be causing these differences, further modeling work is needed to determine the root cause of the apparent low methane absorption in the population of T  and Y dwarfs studied to date.</p></div>

Previous observational studies have invoked heating in the radiative part of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf to match the mid-infrared colors of some brown dwarfs. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sorahana et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burningham et al. (2017)</ref> found that the spectra of several L dwarfs can be better matched with atmospheres that depart from radiative equilibrium.</p><p>Here we run several models to test how atmospheric heating between 0.1 and 100 mbar could change the spectra of a 250 K object like WISE 0855. We incorporate atmospheric heating following the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marley et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Morley et al. (2014a)</ref> by adding energy at specified pressure levels of model atmospheres as we calculate the pressure-temperature structure in radiative-convective equilibrium. The perturbations have the shape of a Chapman function with a width of a single pressure scale height, which is often used to represent heating by incident flux within molecular bands (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chamberlain &amp; Hunten 1987)</ref>. We center the heating at 0.01 and 0.1 bar. We use an 'internal temperature' of 225 K and add 10 5 erg cm −2 s −1 , resulting in a T eff of 256 K (this results in a spectrum that is ∼1.7 times brighter than a "standard" 225 K model).</p><p>The resulting model spectra and pressure-temperature profiles are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 14</ref>. We find that the shape of the mid-infrared spectrum changes considerably as the atmosphere is heated at both 0.1 and 0.01 bar. In particular, the deep absorption features at 3.3, 6, 8, and 10 µm become less deep. However, the resulting model photometry at 3-4 µm is not actually closer to the observed photometry; the effect is not large enough for atmospheric heating, at least of this magnitude, to resolve the discrepancies between the observed and model photometry.</p><p>Deviations in the adiabatic structure of the deep atmosphere have also been suggested as a mechanism that may be important in brown dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tremblin et al. 2015</ref>). However, we do not model this here since <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leggett et al. (2017)</ref> explore this idea in more detail and find that a modified shallower adiabat does not bring the model photometry substantially closer to the observed photometry (e.g., their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 12</ref>).</p><p>Future observations with JWST would likely be sensitive to such major deviations from radiative-convective equilibrium. Further modeling work on the climate and atmospheric circulation of 250 K planets would provide theoretical insight into the causes of such deviations; for example, energy could be deposited by the breaking of upward propagating gravity waves in the radiative part of the atmosphere.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">The Spectral Effect of Non-gray Water Clouds</head><p>The shape of WISE 0855's mid-infrared spectrum holds more information than the photometry alone. We have com-  pared the overall slope of the L and M band spectra and the size of spectral features in each bandpass. We find that only models that include clouds can fit the flat slope of the M band spectrum and muted size of the features. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows a model fit to both L and M band data together (χ 2 /N=7.2 in L band, χ 2 /N=5.1 in M band). For comparison, the nominal best-fit model to the L band data alone has a goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N=5.2; the nominal best-fit model to the M band data has a goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N=5.0.</p><p>The shape of the M band data provides more information about water clouds with fewer degeneracies than the L band data; for example, C/O ratio and clouds have a similar effect on the shape of the L band spectrum at this resolution, but a very different effect on M band (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10)</ref>. Out of the grid of models considered here, the cloud-free models provided the worst fits in M band, with χ 2 /N&gt;17. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> shows a typical cloudy model and cloud-free model compared to the spectroscopic data. In this figure, the best-fitting cloud-free model has goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N =17.4, while the cloudy model has a goodness-of-fit χ 2 /N =5.0. We also note that the spectrum of WISE 0855 should be sensitive to clouds at longer wavelengths, including those probed by the WISE W3 photometry. We find that the cloud-free models do tend to be fainter than the observed photometry, but not at high significance (∼ 1.1-2.4σ). Cloudy models provide good matches to the W3 photometry. Future spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths will be informative.</p><p>The necessity of clouds to match WISE 0855's spectrum is in qualitative agreement with the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref>, in which simplified clouds were included in a cloud-free model atmosphere during post-processing when generating a model spectrum. Here we include 'real' water ice clouds with the spectral properties of pure ice spheres, which are calculated self-consistently with the pressuretemperature profile in radiative-convective equilibrium.</p><p>These advancements in the models are critical for the current work, which investigates both the spectra and photometry of WISE 0855. While the the nominal best-matching cloudy model with ad hoc post-processed gray cloud opacity in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref> provides a relatively good fit to the observed M band spectrum (χ 2 /N ∼4.4), it does not fit the observed photometry (χ 2 /N ∼1100). The limitations of the models used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref> make it hard to interpret the solidness of the conclusions regarding evidence for clouds; adding a continuum opacity source at the appropriate pressure level allowed the spectrum to approximately match, but the model itself became much too cold to fit the photometry since the temperature profile was not selfconsistently calculated. In addition, gray opacities are not appropriate for non-gray water ice clouds; the effect of this wavelength-dependent opacity was not explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref>. However, our new models, with self-consistent water ice clouds, are able to reproduce the features in M band as well as the post-processed clouds, without a negative effect to the SED fit. The models in this work therefore provide much stronger evidence that clouds are necessary to match the spectrum of WISE 0855.</p><p>We find that since scattering by water ice particles is strongly wavelength-dependent, the assumptions about the cloud properties strongly impact the emergent spectrum. We show some simple tests to demonstrate this dependence, in which we change the single scattering albedo to be constant. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref> shows the single scattering albedo of the water ice cloud: it scatters strongly at short wavelengths through the near-infrared, and then the single scattering albedo decreases sharply between 2 and 3 µm and varies throughout the midinfrared. The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref> shows the optical depth τ of the cloud multiplied by (1−ω) to show the absorptivity of the cloud. The black line shows true water ice, and the colored lines show the three test cases (ω =0.0, 0.3, 0.7).</p><p>The spectra of these test cases are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 17</ref>. The constant, highly scattering cloud (ω = 0.7) matches the water ice cloud at short wavelengths (&lt;2 µm) where the water cloud is strongly scattering, and is brighter than the water cloud model at longer wavelengths. In contrast, both more absorbing models (ω=0.0 and 0.3) are fainter than the water cloud model at all wavelengths. However, zoomed in to L and M band in the bottom panel, all of the constant-ω test clouds have more strongly sloped M band spectrum than the waterice cloud because of the change in the water ice single scattering albedo between 4.5 and 5 µm. This test illustrates that the mid-infrared thermal emission spectrum of WISE 0855 is sensitive to the scattering properties of the cloud itself. Future work will be needed to study the effects of particle size, non-spherical particles, and impurities in the grains on the spectrum.</p></div>

The PH 3 band is centered around 4.3 µm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>), between L and M bands, and extends into the red side of L band from 4.0-4.2 µm. We see no evidence for PH 3 absorption in L band either, confirming the <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Skemer et al. (2016)</ref> results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 18</ref> shows the abundance of PH 3 expected assuming (rainout) chemical equilibrium, and the timescales for vertical mixing and chemical destruction of PH 3 in the atmosphere. The mixing ratio of PH 3 is as high as ∼ 5 × 10 −7 around 100 bar and decreases sharply in abundance to be &lt; 10 −10 at 10 bar. In the convective region of the atmosphere, we calculate the approximate characteristic mixing timescale (τ mix ∼ H 2 /K zz , where H is the scale height and K zz is the eddy diffusion coefficient) along the pressure-temperature profile using mixing length theory and find that it ranges between 10 4 s and 2×10 5 s in the deep atmosphere. In the radiative part of the atmosphere we show the approximate mixing timescale corresponding to two constant K zz values (10 6 and 10 8 cm 2 s −1 ). However, the timescale for PH 3 to be depleted (forming P 4 O 6 ) is typically slower than the mixing timescales in cool planet and brown dwarf atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barshay &amp; Lewis 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fegley &amp; Lodders 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Visscher et al. 2006</ref>). We follow the methods presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Visscher et al. (2006)</ref> to estimate PH 3 → P 4 O 6 destruction timescales for the model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 18</ref>: for the conditions here in the deep atmosphere (1200 K, 100 bar) the timescale is ∼10 7 s and increases quickly with decreasing temperature and pressure. The chemical timescale is faster than the mixing timescale in the deep atmosphere (P&gt;130 bar) and slower than the mixing timescale in the rest of the atmosphere. This means that we expect the PH 3 abundance to be constant through the atmosphere above 100-200 bar, with a mixing ratio around 5×10 −7 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 19</ref> shows how a typical model spectrum changes with additional PH 3 mixed from the deep atmosphere.

We do not see this spectral shape in either the observed L or M band spectra.</p><p>To put further constraints on the PH 3 abundance and therefore the chemistry and mixing in WISE 0855, the spectral region inaccessible from the ground due to CO 2 absorption from 4.2-4.5 µm is needed. JWST will be perfectly suited to this purpose, and a detection or upper limit of PH 3 will likely be an early result from Y dwarf observational programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">A missing deep continuum opacity source?</head><p>None of the models, across a range of metallicities, cloud, C/O ratios, and temperatures, fit both the near-and midinfrared photometry simultaneously. In most cases, models that fit the mid-infrared photometry and spectra are much brighter than the observations in the near-infrared. Because there is very little near-infrared gas phase opacity in a cold object (because a number of molecular species have con- Figure 19. Spectra that show the effect of PH3 on the spectrum. The gray line shows the spectrum assuming chemical equilibrium including rainout.

The wavelength regions of L and M bands are shaded.  densed at cold temperatures), the model spectra probe deep layers in the near-infrared (700-900 K, or 20-40 bar). A continuum opacity source at a temperature around 600 K (around 8-10 bar) would decrease the flux substantially at those short wavelengths without changing the mid-infrared spectrum at all. Models illustrating the effect of such a continuum opac- ity source are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 20</ref>. A standard model (with a water ice cloud) is shown in blue. The same pressuretemperature profile and abundance profile is used to generate two new spectra, including a deep cloud with τ = 1, ω=0, and asymmetry parameter g 0 =0 in each layer, extending to pressures of 11 and 8.5 bar respectively. The models including this deep cloud layer have identical mid-infrared flux to the original model, but substantially lower thermal emission at near-infrared wavelengths, matching the observed nearinfrared flux much more closely.</p><p>We note that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 17</ref>, models with clouds at the altitudes of water ice clouds, but with more absorptive optical properties, also have substantially lower near-infrared thermal emission compared to the water ice clouds. It is possible that some of the assumptions made about the clouds, including that they are spherical homogeneous particles, are not applicable here. Different shaped water ice particles, or inhomogeneous ice particles, could increase the single scattering albedo at some wavelengths. Further work should be done to investigate the formation of water ice clouds in microphysical cloud models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Helling &amp; Woitke 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Helling et al. 2008a)</ref> If this additional opacity source is not some form of "dirty" water ice, it is possible that another cloud is condensing around 500-700 K. One possibility is that the phosphorous is condensing into a condensate such as ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ). We show the condensation curve for this species compared to P-T profiles for WISE 0855 and Jupiter in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Figure 21</ref>, along with the approximate location of the gray opacity source in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 20</ref>. This material has been predicted to condense in cool planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fegley &amp; Lodders 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Visscher et al. 2006</ref>), though it does not form a cloud in Jupiter's atmosphere because of the disequilibrium PH 3 chemistry. Nonetheless as the phosphorous chemistry in WISE 0855 appears to be distinct from Jupiter's (since we do not see PH <ref type="bibr">3</ref> features in the spectrum) it is a candidate for the additional deep opacity source we propose here. If NH 4 H 2 PO 4 condenses, it would remove phosphorous from the gas phase chemistry, which could also explain lack of PH 3 features in the spectrum. WISE 0855 is a prime candidate for detailed characterization with JWST, and as such it is being observed in a number of Guaranteed Time Observers (GTO) programs. For example, in the first years of JWST's lifetime it will be observed by three of the near-infrared instruments (NIRSpec (G395 filter and PRISM mode), NIRCam, NIRISS) and the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI/MRS), and will likely be proposed for additional observations by Guest Observers (GO) programs.</p><p>These measurements will allow us to observe the spectrum of WISE 0855 at higher resolution and higher signalto-noise. They will likely confirm the presence of water and methane, and also detect ammonia. Trace species with features in the mid-infrared such as phosphine, deuterated methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and acetylene will either be detected or have upper limits placed on their abundance. The presence of water ice clouds will likely be confirmed or refuted.</p><p>The abundances of the major species can be used to determine the metallicity and C/O/N ratios within WISE 0855's atmosphere. The trace species can be used to study vertical mixing and chemistry in the atmosphere, comparing to Jupiter's atmosphere and other warmer brown dwarfs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a ground-based spectrum of the coldest known brown dwarf, WISE 0855, from 3.4-4.14 µm. This L band spectrum shows strong methane features, as predicted by atmospheric models. WISE 0855 now has a rich dataset of photometry and spectroscopy, including photometry from 0.8 to 15 µm and ground-based spectra in the L and M bands. With these data and a new set of atmospheric models that include different metallicities, C/O ratios, and water ice clouds, we probe the properties of WISE 0855.</p><p>We find that WISE 0855's mid-infrared photometry can be better matched with models that include depleted methane abundance; further modeling work is needed to determine the root cause of this apparent depletion. Using self-consistent non-gray water ice cloud models, we show that there is evidence for water ice clouds in M band, as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Ske- mer et al. (2016)</ref>. We confirm the distinct lack of PH 3 compared to Jupiter's atmosphere. We also see that WISE 0855's near-infrared photometry is faint compared to models that fit the mid-infrared data, and suggest that a deep continuum opacity source could readily mask the near-infrared flux. One possibility for this deep opacity source includes a cloud of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate.</p><p>With the upcoming launch of JWST, we will soon probe WISE 0855 and other Y dwarfs in greater detail, detecting molecules and clouds in their atmospheres. WISE 0855 bridges the temperature regime between warmer exoplanets and the solar system giant planets, allowing us to study the physics of cool planetary atmospheres. Using WISE 0855 as a benchmark "water cloud planet", we will develop a deeper understanding of the processes that shape these atmospheres in advance of future missions that probe a diverse range of exoplanetary systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.

We also in- clude three different C/O ratios: 0.6 (solar), 0.3, and 0.15. To model different C/O ratios, we keep the oxygen abundance constant and vary the carbon abundance. Solar metallicity ([M/H]=0.0) corresponds to a deep H 2 O mixing ratio of 8.2×10 −4 and CH 4 mixing ratio of 4.7×10 −4 . [M/H]=−0.25 corresponds to a deep H 2 O mixing ratio of 4.6×10 −4 and a CH 4 mixing ratio of 2.6×10 −4 . Other car- bon and oxygen-bearing species like CO and CO 2 are also included; neither are abundant (mixing ratios smaller than 10 −20 ) in the photosphere (1 bar), but can be present in the deep atmosphere. For example, at solar metallicity the CO and CO 2 mixing ratios at ∼300 bar are 4.6×10 −4 and 5×10 −7 respectively.</figDesc></figure>
