				<p>Executive Summary: The next generation ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs) present incredible opportunities to discover and characterize diverse planetary systems, even potentially habitable worlds. Adaptive-optics assisted thermal-IR (3-14 Âµm) imaging is a powerful tool to study exoplanets with extant 6-12 meter telescopes. ELTs have the spatial resolution and sensitivity that offer an unparalleled expansion of the available discovery space. AO-assisted thermal-IR instruments on ELTs will be superior to JWST for high contrast imaging in the thermal-IR, and complementary to high contrast observations at shorter wavelengths, in space or with second-generation extreme AO instruments. With appropriate investments in instrumentation and precursor observations, thermal-IR equipped ELTs could image the first terrestrial and super-earth planets around nearby stars, opening the door to characterization of potentially habitable planets from the ground and space. Direct imaging and secondary eclipse measurements are two ways to directly detect light from other worlds. To date, direct detection is limited to dozens of objects beyond several AU (high contrast imaging-see Figure 1) and within a few tenths of AU (secondary eclipse). While characterizing these atmospheres provides fundamental insights, most exoplanets are found at intermediate separations which have yet to be studied (e.g. Meyer et al. 2018, A&amp;A, in press, arXiv:1707.05256). Characterizing those within the liquid-water or &apos;habitable zone&apos; of stars is clearly a priority. The probability for transit, and thus secondary eclipse, drops as a function of semi-major axis, while direct imaging of self-luminous planets is easier at larger orbital radii. Imaging can be achieved by observing reflected light or thermal emission each carrying important characterization information. Both reflect light and thermal emission of a planet depend on stellar luminosity, orbital separation, planet radius, and albedo as a Figure 1-Planet mass as a function of orbital separation (from Pepe et al. 2014, Nature, 513, 358). Orange circles are transiting planets (including those with direct detection secondary eclipse) with confirmed RV masses. Open circles are RV discovered planets, while green points represent planets detected through timing variations. Magenta points represent microlensing detections and blue diamonds are companions discovered through direct imaging (those numbered have mass ratios relative to their star &lt; 0.02 within 100 AU). Notice the gap between transits (including secondary eclipse) in orange and direct imaging in blue.</p>
