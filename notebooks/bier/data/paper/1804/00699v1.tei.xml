			<abstract>
				<p>Direct imaging is likely the best way to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. Previously, Stark et al. (2014, 2015, 2016) estimated the Earth twin yield of future direct imaging missions, such as LUVOIR and HabEx. We extend this analysis to other types of planets, which will act as false positives for Earth twins. We define an Earth twin as any exoplanet within half an e-folding of 1 AU in semi-major axis and 1 R ⊕ in planetary radius, orbiting a G-dwarf. Using Monte Carlo analyses, we quantify the biases and planetary false positive rates of Earth searches. That is, given a pale dot at the correct projected separation and brightness to be a candidate Earth, what are the odds that it is, in fact, an Earth twin? Our notional telescope has a diameter of 10 m, an inner working angle of 3λ/D, and an outer working angle of 10λ/D (62 mas and 206 mas at 1.0 µm). With no precursor knowledge and one visit per star, 77% of detected candidate Earths are actually unEarths ; their mean radius is 2.3 R ⊕ , a sub-Neptune. The odds improve if we image every planet at its optimal orbital phase, either by relying on precursor knowledge, or by performing multi-epoch direct imaging. In such a targeted search, 47% of detected Earth twin candidates are false positives, and they have a mean radius of 1.7 R ⊕. The false positive rate is insensitive to stellar spectral type and the assumption of circular orbits.</p>

Many studies have shown that direct imaging is also a viable way to discover these planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agol 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stark et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stark et al. , 2014</ref>). Given enough time, a mission could discover hundreds to thousands of planets and characterize them all. In practice, there will only be enough time to characterize some of these worlds in detail. We would therefore like to distinguish between Earths and un-Earths as efficiently as possible. For although they are expected to revolutionize many aspects of planetary science, mission concepts such as LUVOIR quately suppressed. Obscuration and low contrast are the two dominant factors that could hinder a detection. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> If one is equally interested in all planets, then an "average" mission completeness suffices, without looking at the demographics of the mission's yield. But what if one prefers a certain kind of planet? Then we would do best to consider how a mission may be biased towards inopportune radii and semi-major axes.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stark et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. ( , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stark et al. ( , 2016</ref>) cared about semimajor axes between 0.7-1.5 AU, they assigned a radius of 1 R ⊕ to all planets in their completeness calculator. In reality, most planets are not the size of Earth.</p><p>We want to not only detect as many Earth twins as possible, but also know that a detected planet is an Earth twin. Many un-Earths will show up at the correct projected separation and brightness to be Earthlike. We would confuse these planets with true Earth twins, so we call them false positives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">An observation flowchart</head><p>Suppose we image a star and see a dot that we have identified as a companion, and which may be a newlydiscovered Earth twin. Our options include: (i) we get a spectrum of the dot immediately; or (ii) we return to this star at a later epoch, to better constrain the companion's semi-major axis, hoping that the planet has not become obscured by the IWA or confused with another planet in the system. If we choose option (ii), and the next image is not dissuading, then the choices are the same, ad infinitum until we are ready to commit to spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> A third option is to get another image in a different filter, if one believes that colour is a useful discriminant between different types of planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Krissansen-Totton et al. 2016</ref>), but phase-variable colours make this strategy more challenging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cahoy et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayorga et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Roughly speaking, one direct imaging detection provides two data: the RA and Dec of the planet relative to its host star. There are seven orbital parameters, so 4 detections are needed to establish an orbit. However, it is beyond our current scope to determine the best number of revisits, or their cadences.</p><p>Rather, our analysis considers two endmember scenarios. In "blind" searches, we assume no prior observations of the planet; our only known parameters are the <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Others include exo-zodiacal dust ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Roberge et al. 2012</ref>) and integration time.</p><p>2 A silver lining to obtaining spectra of un-Earths is that they provide a control for biosignatures, as long as we eventually determine which planets are in fact habitable.

On the other hand, in "targeted" searches, we have the luxury of knowing where and when to look at each system. We assume their orbits can be predicted, based on data from either multi-epoch direct imaging, radial velocity, 3 or astrometry. The Keplerian orbital fits from these observations are adequate for us to target the wanderers at gibbous phase outside the IWA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shao et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Butler et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ranalli et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We therefore investigate how well a direct imaging mission can distinguish between Earths and un-Earths, based solely on photometry.

Section 3 presents results, and section 4 our discussion, including a sensitivity analysis to test our assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODEL DESCRIPTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Direct imaging signal scaling</head><p>The signal from a directly imaged planet is the planet/star contrast ratio, parameterized for reflected light as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ε = A * φ L (α) R a 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with planetary radius R, semi-major axis a, and apparent albedo A * <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Traub &amp; Oppenheimer 2010)</ref>. The phase function φ L (α) describes how the light scattered by a planetary atmosphere changes with the star-planetobserver angle α. For the purposes of our numerical experiment, we adopt the Lambertian phase function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ L (α) = 1 π [sin α + (π − α) cos α] .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The phase angle is related trigonometrically to orbital phase ξ and inclination i <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Traub &amp; Oppenheimer 2010)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">α = cos −1 (cos ξ sin i) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>2.2. Conditions for detectability <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the detection conditions for direct imaging. The top panel shows detected and undetected planets for an idealized survey in which all stars are at the same distance and all planets are in face-on orbits and have the same albedo. The only parameters allowed to vary here are planetary radius and semi-major axis. We see a distinct wedge-shaped pattern with sharp inner and outer working angle cutoffs (left and right, respectively), and a hard-edged contrast floor (bottom right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Photometric condition</head><p>For a planet to be detected, its planet/star contrast ratio must exceed the coronagraph raw contrast, ε &gt; ε min . We assume an optimistic LUVOIR-esque value of ε min = 1 × 10 −10 . This implicitly assumes a volumelimited survey, such that integration time per target is allotted as generously as necessary to achieve the intended signal-to-noise ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Stark et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Obscurational condition</head><p>Detectable planets must also have a projected separation a proj falling outside the IWA of the coronagraph, and inside the OWA. That is, a IWA &lt; a proj &lt; a OWA . Both angles are set by some multiple of λ/D, where D is telescope diameter. The IWA is often not actually a hard cutoff; it denotes the angular separation where the instrument sensitivity drops to 50% its nominal value. The approximation is nonetheless reasonable <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Stark et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Projected separation is the planet's semi-major axis convolved with orbital elements,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a proj = a sin 2 ξ + cos 2 ξ cos 2 i,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>so a proj ≤ a. For now we assume circular orbits, but we test this assumption below. The IWA limit is important for targets orbiting distant stars and/or at long wavelengths, while the OWA will pose a challenge for planets orbiting the nearest stars. The OWA is mostly of concern for blind surveys. If we already know a planet's orbit, then we can target it at a gibbous phase with a sufficiently small projected separation (and better contrast), unless the orbital inclination is too small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Generation of planet parameters</head><p>2.3.1. Demographics: radius and semi-major axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Petigura et al. (2013)</ref> showed that near 1 R ⊕ and 365 days, the phase-space density of planets is approximately uniform in its natural logarithms (the actual variation was a factor of two). This distribution easily applies to semi-major axis due to Kepler's Third Law.</p><p>We adopt log-uniform demographics but test the impact of this assumption below. The normalized probability densities are</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">df d(ln R) = 1 ln (R max /R min ) (5) 4</formula><p>The sensitivity slope has a ∆λ/D of ∼ 1 (Guyon 2011), which is short compared to the OWA-IWA ∆λ/D of 7 adopted here.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">and df d(ln a) = 1 ln (a max /a min ) .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>These describe the likelihood of a planet having radius R and semi-major axis a, given that the planet exists within that range of semi-major axes and radii. For a given star, the probability of a planet occurring in our playing field is about 7 in 10, as explained in section 2.4.3. Note that these ranges are broader than our adopted definition for Earth twins (see <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>). For mathematical convenience, each cell in our 3 × 2 a-R grid (figure 1) has a height of one e-folding in R and a width of e 2/3 in a (equal to one e-folding in period). The axis limits are chosen such that the cell defining Earth twins is centred at 1 AU and 1 R ⊕ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Orbital elements: phase and inclination</head><p>At a given point in time, planets can be anywhere along their orbits. We assume circular orbits, so orbital phase is uniformly distributed in ξ ∈ [0, 2π), and the normalized distribution function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">df dξ = 1 2π .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Meanwhile, inclination varies between 0 and π/2 and is uniform in cos i ∈ [0, 1]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">df d(cos i) = 1.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Inclination is an unchanging property of a planet, but orbital phase, by definition, varies as the planet orbits its star. For a given inclination and semi-major axis, there exists a maximum detectable planet/star contrast, occurring each orbit, associated with a certain orbital phase. This "optimal phase" depends on our choice of phase function model. Assuming the planet is a Lambertian reflector, the optimal phase is at the gibbous phase corresponding to a proj = a IWA , or simply the fullest unobscured phase.</p><p>Analytically, the phase angle α corresponding to the optimal phase is given by substituting a proj = a IWA into equation 4, solving for ξ, and then substituting the result into equation 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">α opt = sin −1 a IWA a .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>This equation has multiple roots; we are interested in the gibbous phase, so phase angle is α opt ∈ 0, π 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Planetary albedo</head><p>The distribution of planetary albedos is completely unconstrained for exoplanets at large separations. We parameterize this uncertainty by allowing A * to vary over an order of magnitude, with uniform probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">df dA * = 1 A * max − A * min .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We have adopted conservative values of A * max = 0.5 and A * min = 0.05. As we will show in section 4.1.6, the false positive rate in a blind search is insensitive to the underlying albedo distribution, or our knowledge thereof. Shrinking the albedo range decreases the false positive rate in targeted searches, but only under certain assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Distance to system</head><p>We assume a constant density of stars out to the farthest distance probed r max , so the likelihood of a planetary system falling within a sphere of radius r is proportional to r 2 . The normalized probability density is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">df dr = 3 r 3 max r 2 .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Unfavourable orbits and/or greater distances shorten the time a planet spends between the inner and outer working angles. This decreases the number of detections, compared to a nonvarying universe (cf. top and bottom panels of figure 1). The difference between figure 1's middle and bottom panels is due to the planet's location in its orbit, ξ, at the time of the image. In the middle panel, we assume that the orbit of each planet is known, so we know to target stars when the planet is brightest and unobscured. On the other hand, blindly searching stars for planets is equivalent to drawing ξ from its density function (eq. 7), as in the bottom panel.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Telescope</head><p>Diameter -Our notional telescope has a 10-m primary mirror, comparable to the proposed architecture B of LUVOIR and slightly greater than architecture A of HabEx.</p><p>Wavelength -We use a wavelength of 1.0 µm to image planets in reflected starlight. This is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. (2015)</ref>; they choose 1 µm as their baseline characterization wavelength due to the water vapour feature at 0.95 µm. Although searching at 0.4 µm would yield more Earth twins because the IWA would be smaller, merely finding planets at this shorter wavelength is fruitless if we cannot also characterize them.</p><p>Working angles -We adopt an IWA of 3λ/D and an OWA of 10λ/D, similar to the "pessimistic" case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>Contrast -We assume the coronagraph has a raw contrast of ε min = 1 × 10 −10 . This threshold is often quoted as the technological goal for detection of Earth-sized planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dooley &amp; Lawson 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rauscher et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dalcanton et al. 2015</ref>). We further assume that postprocessing would provide an extra order of magnitude in contrast, enabling robust detection of planets at ε min .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Maximum survey distance</head><p>Since we have adopted a fairly long wavelength with an accordingly large IWA, the distances at which we can probe Earth twins are limited. An Earth twin r max parsecs away, orbiting at a ⊕,max , would just reach the IWA at maximum elongation; any stars beyond this point could not host detectable Earth twins. This sets our maximum survey distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">r max = a ⊕,max IWA = 22.6 pc.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This is a smaller search volume than <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stark et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. ( , 2015</ref>, who choose 50 pc as their maximum distance using telescope diameters of 4-20 m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Number of targets</head><p>We assume that our survey is volume-limited, and that stars are evenly distributed across the search volume. This lets us quickly calculate the number of target stars within a sphere defined by our maximum survey distance. We use the stellar density model from Bovy (2017):</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">dN * dV dM * = (0.016 pc −3 M −1 ) M * M −4.7 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>which we integrate over [0.84, 1.15] M . In reality, not only are ∼50% of Sun-like stars in binary pairs (Bate 2009), but the period distribution of binaries peaks at 10,000 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kroupa &amp; Burkert 2001)</ref>, about the semi-major axis of Saturn. These companion stars may pose a problem for starlight suppression. Although one could improve detection yields by a factor of ∼2 with careful attention to coronagraph design, this is outside the scope of our current paper. We therefore eliminate half the target stars; so the number of target stars in a given simulated survey is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">N * = floor 1.793 × 10 −2 r 3 max 2 .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>This evaluates to 136 G-type stars for r max = 22.6 pc. For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stark et al. (2014)</ref> report a target list of 5449 stars within 50 pc and with spectral type A to M. Substituting these limits-excepting M-dwarfs 5 -into equation 13, we get 4937 stars. Simulating a realistic target list, however, is not the focus of this work. We report absolute numbers primarily as a sanity check. Indeed, most of our figures and statistics come from running 100 simulated surveys to minimize Poisson noise. Results are otherwise unaffected by our chosen N * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Planet occurrence rates</head><p>To populate each star with 0 or more planets with radius R ∈ [R min , R max ] and semi-major axis a ∈ [a min , a max ], we assume an across-the-board occurrence rate density of Γ = dN p / (d ln R d ln P ) = 0.12 planets per star per per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kopparapu et al. 2018)</ref>. This corresponds to an occurrence rate, η, of about 0.7 planets per star. In accordance with Poisson statistics, most stars have 0, 1, or 2 planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>We define Earth twins in terms of planetary radius and semi-major axis. A planet orbiting a G-dwarf with</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">R ∈ e −1/2 , e 1/2 R ⊕ and a ∈ e −1/2 , e 1/2</formula><p>AU is an Earth twin. Note that both ranges correspond to one e-folding; e.g., R ⊕,max = eR ⊕,min . This is convenient because planetary demographics are often reported as dN /(dlnR dlnP ), so the Earth twin rate is simply equal to the rate density at Earth. Our Earth twins roughly encompass the "rocky" and "super-Earth" classes of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kopparapu et al. (2018)</ref>, who classify planets based on expected atmospheric chemistry. Of course, there is no evidence that all planets with the same size and orbit as Earth are anything like Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Planetary false positive rates</head><p>Locating Earth twins in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> is easy-they all live in the highlighted centre grid cell on the bottom row. The problem is that a single epoch of direct imaging does not yield semi-major axis and radius, but rather, projected separation and contrast ratio. Locating Earth twins on those axes is much trickier. We must sift through some number of un-Earthlike planets, indistinguishable from our real quarry.</p><p>We now calculate the likelihood that a planet actually is an Earth twin, given that it is detected in the contrast-separation region where an Earth twin could appear. We label this region the Earth twin candidate zone; it denotes where an Earth twin might conceivably  show up in a direct imaging snapshot. The extent of the candidate zone depends on whether or not we know the planets' orbits.</p><p>Candidates in blind searches -If we know nothing about orbital phase or inclination, then the projected separation of an Earth twin on a circular orbit is at most a ⊕,max , and can be as small as 0: 0 ≤ a proj ≤ a ⊕,max . The maximum planet/star contrast for an Earth twin is ε max = (R ⊕,max /a ⊕,min ) 2 ; this comes from setting the apparent albedo to unity, adopting the largest Earthlike radius, and adopting the largest possible value of φ L /a 2 ≈ 1.44/(πa 2 proj ). 6</p><p>Candidates in targeted searches -If we know the planet's orbit, then the semi-major axis criterion for Earth twin candidacy is a ⊕,min ≤ a ≤ a ⊕,max .</p><p>To get the maximum contrast ratio, we divide ε by its Lambertian phase function, again setting A * to unity, to compare against the stricter limit</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ε ≤ R ⊕,max a 2 (15)</formula><p>where ε is the phase-standardized contrast.</p><p>6 Given an observed projected separation, there is a trade-off between the semi-major axis (smaller a are brighter) and orbital phase (smaller α are brighter). One can numerically solve for the maximum contrast ratio, which occurs at an orbital phase of about 63 degrees.</p><p>Un-Earthlike planets falling within the Earth twin candidate zone are false positives. They appear there for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p>1. a &lt; a ⊕,min , but due to the planet's unknown phase and inclination, we cannot rule it out as an Earth twin in gibbous or crescent phase.</p><p>2. a &gt; a ⊕,max , but the planet is in gibbous or crescent phase, so its projected separation appears smaller.</p><p>3. R &gt; R ⊕,max , but the planet has low albedo, decreasing its planet/star contrast to something reasonable for an Earth twin.</p><p>The degeneracy between projected separation and semimajor axis can be broken if a planet is imaged at a known orbital phase, hence ruling out the first two scenarios and ameliorating the third.</p></div>

Dashed vertical lines represent the distances at which a planet's projected angular separation would be just inside the IWA, if it orbited at a⊕,min (rmax = 11.6 pc), and if it orbited at a⊕,max (rmax = 22.6 pc). A targeted survey out to the leftmost dashed line would therefore detect every Earth twin bright enough to surpass the contrast floor, while no additional Earth twins could be detected beyond the rightmost dashed line. Calculated from 10 5 simulated stars, where yields are scaled to the realistic number of stars at the given rmax (equation 14).</p><p>Similarly, the fraction of Earth twins detected is the number of filled teal dots to the number of teal dots:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">f det,⊕ = [# Earths] det [# Earths] total ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>which we call the detection efficiency of the survey. This metric, like the false positive rate, describes the survey as a whole (cf. completeness from Brown 2005 being a function of a star). It is strongly dependent on the size of the search volume: visiting more distant stars becomes less efficient, despite the higher cumulative yield of planets (figure 3). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> presents the false positive rate for blind and targeted searches. Imaging planets at their optimal orbital phases produces a lower false positive rate because the Earth twin candidate zone is smaller. Targeting planets at their optimal phases slightly improves their planet/star contrasts and minimizes the odds of missing a planet inside the IWA.</p><p>However, knowing orbits to break degeneracy is the key here, as opposed to a better-timed observation. Merely increasing the Earth twin yield via waiting for brighter and unobscured phases-without changing the candidate zone area accordingly-actually increases the false positive rate by a few percentage points to 81%. This is because more un-Earths are also detected alongside the Earth twins. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> also reports the biases in these searches. Most detected Earth twin candidates will have radii large enough such that they must have massive gaseous envelopes, making them sub-Neptunes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lopez &amp; Rice 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fulton et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rogers 2015)</ref>. Phase knowledge reduces the mean radius of detected candidates from 2.3 R ⊕ to 1.7 R ⊕ -just outside our Earth twin box.</p><p>The worst culprits are planets with radii too large to be Earthlike, but whose low albedos reduce their planet/star contrasts. For a blind search, we find that 67% of Earth twin candidates will fall in this category. This statistic drops to 47% for targets at known phase.</p><p>Semi-major axis degeneracy only creates false positives for a blind search. In this scenario, planets orbiting exterior to a ⊕,max make up 27% of Earth twin candidates. Finally, planets interior to a ⊕,min make up 9% of candidates. Note that these categories do not add to 100% because they are not all mutually exclusive. As a sanity check, we can estimate Earth twin yields based on a realization scaled to a realistic number of targets, N * = 136 G stars. Our simulation finds ∼2 Earth twins in a blind search, and ∼5 in a targeted search. Of course, our yields vary under different model assumptions, as we discuss throughout the rest of this paper.</p><p>To compare our yield results with Stark et al. (2014), we adopt their baseline mission parameters: a less forgiving telescope diameter of 8 m and IWA of 4λ/D, but a more optimistic λ = 550 nm, and a larger target list of 5449 FGK stars within 50 pc. We also follow suit by fixing the occurrence rate, η ⊕ , at 0.1 planets per star across <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Target list sizes, number of underlying Earth twins, yields of Earth twins and un-Earths in the Earth twin candidate zone, and false positive rates under model assumptions which are relaxed one at a time. The false positive rate is quite consistent across different assumptions, despite changes in yields and target list sizes. Note that for the bottom five rows, the survey visits a dramatically different number of stars. This is due to equation 12, where any stars with maximum Earth twin semi-major axis inside the IWA are discounted from the target list. Based on 10 5 simulated stars, where yields are scaled to a realistic number of targets (as listed in columns 2 and 7).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Search volume</head><p>In a volume-limited survey, one must decide on a maximum survey distance, r max . There is a trade-off between detection efficiency and Earth twin yield for a given value of r max ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 3</ref>). Whereas our baseline survey sets the search volume such that a star at r = r max would have all of its Earth twins obscured by the IWA, we tested a simulation where the furthest star would be complete for Earth twins. We find that this assumption reduces the targeted false positive rate from 47% to 43%-not a very significant decrease-and this smaller volume may yield little-to-no Earth twins.</p></div>

However, F, G, and K stars may be optimistically classified as "Sun-like". The semi-major axis range within which a planet would receive Earth-like insolation is farther out for F stars and closer in for K stars; we therefore expect different Earth twin detectabilities, via changes in both planet/star contrast and obscuration. Here we evaluate how a realistic distribution of stellar masses would affect our results.</p><p>Our re-analysis is limited to stars at least as massive as the K5 spectral type. Habitable zone planets orbiting stars less massive than this-e.g., M-dwarfs-will not only have zero obliquity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller et al. 2011</ref>), but they The dashed blue line shows aproj = a cos i, which is the minimum aproj for fixed inclination and circular orbits.

Stellar luminosity is calculated by L * /L = (M * /M ) 4</formula><p>. The values of a ⊕,min and a ⊕,max at star q are then scaled by the square root of L * ,q , which effectively ignores the planetary albedo dependence on wavelength ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>). Because a ⊕,max sets the edge of the the search volume (equation 12), this means that the furthest K star probed for Earth twins is nearer than the furthestprobed F star. In other words, a star q is disqualified if a ⊕,max,q &gt; r q × IWA. We find that relaxing M * = M slightly increases the false positive rate, but this is probably not significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Planetary demographics</head><p>How appropriate is the assumption that radius and semi-major axis have log-uniform distributions?

For planets in the habitable zone of G dwarfs in particular, the radius distribution is still poorly constrained. In any case, radius comes into the direct imaging signal as A * R 2 , where the apparent albedo A * is unknown.

Moreover, A * may change as we observe different regions of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cowan &amp; Fujii 2017)</ref>.</p><p>As for our assumptions about A * min and A * max , hot Jupiters exhibit more than an order of magnitude range in albedo <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heng &amp; Demory 2013)</ref>, despite being relatively simple planets: similar mass, size, composition, etc. There is therefore reason to believe that smaller, cooler planets, which are inherently more diverse, will exhibit a variety of different albedos.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, we present the Earth twin false positive rate as a function of the underlying range of apparent Blind, assume A * &lt; 1 Blind, assume A * &lt; 0.5 Blind, known A * maximum Targeted, assume A * &lt; 1 Targeted, assume A * &lt; 0.5 Targeted, known A * maximum <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Effect of albedo distribution-and our knowledge thereof-on the false positive rate, or, the odds of an Earth twin candidate being an un-Earth. The x-axis is the range within which albedo is allowed to randomly vary in the model : the greatest range corresponds to A * ∈ [0.05, 0.5], and the smallest range to A * = 0.3. Dashed lines represent searches for planets at random phase, while solid lines represent targeted searches. Colours show different assumed maximum albedos (e.g., the value of A * in equation 15). Noise in this figure is due to model Poisson noise: because A * is generated anew for each planet per albedo range increment, sometimes planets will be assigned new A * values sufficiently low to diminish their planet/star contrasts below the instrument floor, which renders them undetectable. The false positive rate in a blind search is insensitive to the underlying albedo distribution, or our knowledge thereof (dashed lines). Targeted searches still have false positive rates of at least 1 in 2, unless all planets have the same albedo (albedo range of 0) and we know that universal albedo a priori (solid purple line).</p><p>albedo. The problem of unknown albedo is twofold: not only do we not know the albedos of individual planets, but we do not even know the albedo distribution of planets at 1 AU. Therefore, we are left with (i) our best guess for A * max (which affects the extent of the Earth twin candidate zone), as well as (ii) our luck in nature's range of A * being on the small side.</p><p>The Earth twin false positive rate varies with both of these estimates. If every candidate planet had the same albedo and phase function and we knew the universal albedo and phase function a priori, then-and only then-would a targeted search return a 0% false positive rate, since the radius-albedo degeneracy would be broken. As the universe's underlying distribution widens, however, our knowledge of the albedo maximum gives us less and less of an advantage. The hatched regions have little-to-no overlap, meaning that no planets can be simultaneously imaged from 0.4 to 2.5 µm, and a full spectrum can only be stitched together for the very nearest and most inclined planets. Because the x-axis is scaled to constant volume per centimetre, this demonstrates that the vast majority of Earth twins have too tight a projected angular separation for longwave characterization. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that adopting an underlying normal distribution for A * (µ = 0.3, σ = 0.1) also reduces the false positive rate of a targeted search, in a similar way to shortening the range of A * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.7.">Wavelength and working angles</head><p>Inner and outer working angles depend directly on imaging wavelength. Shorter wavelengths will tighten the working angles, while longer wavelengths will push them to wider separations. The wavelength we choose to work with thus affects which planets are obscured and which are not. Our adoption of 1.0 µm dictates that planets are obscured more often than the 0.55-µm assumption of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Stark et al. (2014)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stark et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stark et al. ( , 2016</ref> require that planets are simultaneously detectable at 0.55 and 1.0 µm. Regardless, the false positive rate is roughly insensitive to both the wavelength and the working angles themselves <ref type="table">(table 2)</ref>.</p><p>If we want to spectroscopically characterize the atmospheres of planets we detect, then we require observations at multiple bands. For full characterization, we would hope for a spectrum ranging from 400 nm in the shortwave (Rayleigh scattering), to 2.5 µm in the longwave (greenhouse gas absorption, e.g. methane).</p><p>Directly imaging a planet at multiple wavelengths is not trivial, however, due to chromatic working angles. We illustrate this in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref> by showing the projected angular separations at which an Earth twin might appear, overlain by the working angles at some different wavelengths.</p><p>If we want to simultaneously detect a planet at multiple wavelengths, then the regions bounded by the relevant IWAs and OWAs and the planet's angular separation must all overlap somewhere. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref> shows, this is unfortunately not achievable for 400 nm and 2.5 µm, if OWA = 10λ/D and IWA = 3λ/D. Parallel coronagraphs, with different IWAs and OWAs, are a possibility for imaging more planets at such a range of wavelength bands.</p><p>Thus we may be forced to attempt stitching together observations taken at different phases, at least for planets on inclined orbits. This raises practical challenges, since φ(α) varies with wavelength; phase variations are likely chromatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cahoy et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayorga et al. 2016)</ref>. Further-and this extends to all of Earth twin spectroscopy-we are chasing moving targets. The integration time required to characterize an Earth twin could be on the scale of months ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robinson et al. 2016)</ref>, and a planet on a 1-AU orbit will surely move during this time. 8 It may therefore be necessary to acquire orbital constraints before obtaining spectra.</p><p>Regardless, even with snapshots at several orbital phases, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref> illustrates that only the nearest (r 9 pc) Earth twins are possibly observable both at 400 nm and 2.5 µm. Of the simulated Earth twins detectable at 400 nm, 23.9% are detectable at 1.0 µm at any phase, and only 0.6% at 2.5 µm.</p><p>One debatable solution is to use a starshade, rather than a coronagraph, to obtain spectra of Earth twin atmospheres. The IWA of a starshade depends on the starshade radius divided by the starshade-telescope distance, and its OWA is simply the field of view. This results in a greater unobscured range of separations. Starshades also have greater bandwidth, so obtaining a full spectrum requires fewer passes. However, because starshade slew time is long, fewer stars can be targeted, and starshades themselves pose different technical challenges.</p><p>8 A planet with a = 1 AU at r = 10 pc would move 5 pixels over a 30-day integration, assuming a Nyquist-sampled pixel scale and a 10-m telescope. The same planet at r = 20 pc would move 2.5 pixels.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">&amp; Kipping (2017)</ref>. Grey swath shows 68% confidence interval.

Other lines show different planet/star contrasts for the same phase and separation. The error on radius, as estimated from massor from spectral retrieval, directly propagates to an error on albedo. We might then estimate albedo to within roughly ±0.05(σ1) or ±0.25 (σ2), respectively, for planets with Earthlike albedo and radius.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.8.">Multiple observations</head><p>Our blind search model assumes one observation per star, while our targeted search assumes either precursor orbit constraints, or enough direct imaging visits per star to fully constrain planetary orbits. A realistic mission will fall between these endmembers-at a given point, we may have visited a star more than once, yet possibly not enough times to precisely know the semimajor axis of the hosted planet(s). This raises an interesting question: how does the false positive rate change with each additional visit to the same star? The answer requires knowing the most efficient timing of visits, an important area of future research. For now, we posit that our false positive rates reported for the blind and targeted scenarios represent upper and lower bounds, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Breaking the radius-albedo degeneracy</head><p>We consider two possible routes to constraining planetary albedo ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 7)</ref>. One route is to choose targets whose masses are known from radial velocity or astrometry surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plavchan et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shao et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bendek et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischer et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Weiss et al. 2016</ref>). We can use a mass-radius relation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen &amp; Kipping 2017)</ref> to estimate the planet's radius from its mass. This is a risky endeavour, as current massradius relations are necessarily for short-period planets and therefore may not be representative of Earth twins. A corollary benefit of targeting known-mass planets is that their orbits would have been constrained along with mass. This would inform us of which stars to target and when to look.</p><p>The second route takes advantage of Rayleigh scattering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Feng et al. (2018)</ref> showed that modeled Rayleigh scattering spectra are independent of surface albedo, and could therefore constrain radius. In theory, if we measure the Rayleigh scattering spectrum of a planet at known phase, then we can estimate its radius.</p><p>This retrieval is more complicated for an atmosphere with clouds. However, the longer atmospheric pathlengths at crescent phase mean that surface and cloud scattering are less important at these phase angles. Thus, reflected light at crescent phase is-in principle-closer to pure Rayleigh scattering, and hence might constrain radius, even for cloudy atmospheres. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows that a 10% constraint on mass would propagate to approximately a ±0.1 R ⊕ constraint on radius and a ±0.05 constraint on albedo, for Earthlike planets at 1 AU, and that a 50% radius constraint from a Rayleigh scattering spectrum would propagate to an ±0.25 constraint on albedo. A precise value of σ A * is not reported because this error would be dominated by systematic errors; e.g., using a mass-radius relationship for short period planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of reflected light direct imaging surveys adopting a simple telescope model. Our main finding is: if we image stars at random, ∼77% of the detected planets that appear Earthlike in separation and planet/star contrast will in fact not be Earth twins. Meanwhile, ∼88% of Earth twins go undetected within our search volume of 22.6 pc, although this depends on model assumptions; namely, the maximum survey distance in our volume-limited survey.</p><p>We can double the chances that detected Earth candidates are true Earth twins-and triple the chances of seeing Earth twin planets, on average-by only targeting known planets. Yet even then we cannot do better than a 50% false positive rate, as our capacity to know whether a planet is an Earth twin is set by our knowledge of the albedo distribution of rocky planets at large semi-major axes.These two estimates of the false positive rate represent endmember search scenarios, in which we either know nothing or everything about the orbits of the imaged planets. The false positive rate of a realistic direct imaging mission would fall in between these values.</p><p>Our results are robust to working angle geometry (including imaging wavelength), to the assumption of noncircular orbits, to the inclusion of F and K stars, and to the underlying radius, period, and albedo distributions of planets.</p><p>Breaking the radius-albedo degeneracy should be a focus of research before choosing Earth twin candidates for costly spectroscopic characterization. We may be able to constrain a planet's radius from its mass, motivating cooperation between direct imaging and radial velocity and astrometry. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

Density scatter plots showing the distribution of projected separation with semi-major axis for different assumptions about eccentricity and inclination distributions. The solid blue line indicates 1:1 correspondence, aproj = a. The dashed blue line shows aproj = a cos i, which is the minimum aproj for fixed inclination and circular orbits. The distribution of aproj with a is bimodal for fixed inclination (right column) because the apparent orbital speed of the planet has minima at both aproj = a and aproj = a cos i, effectively piling-up planets at these four points on the orbit.</figDesc></figure>

Inner and outer working angles at various wavelengths (horizontal lines), for a 10-m telescope with an IWA of 3λ/D and an OWA of 10λ/D. Hatched regions represent where an exoplanet would be unobscured. The angular projected separation for an Earth twin, as a function of distance, is shown by the grey region. Targets are only visible at some wavelength if the grey swath intersects a wavelength's working angle box. The hatched regions have little-to-no overlap, meaning that no planets can be simultaneously imaged from 0.4 to 2.5 µm, and a full spectrum can only be stitched together for the very nearest and most inclined planets. Because the x-axis is scaled to constant volume per centimetre, this demonstrates that the vast majority of Earth twins have too tight a projected angular separation for longwave characterization.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Figure 7 .</head><label>7</label><figDesc>Figure 7. Left: Planetary mass-radius relation from Chen &amp; Kipping (2017). Grey swath shows 68% confidence interval. Horizontal error bars are the hypothetical mass measurement error, here set at a very optimistic value of 10% (e.g., using 1 cm/s precision radial velocity; Plavchan et al. 2018). Vertical error bars show a hypothetical radius constraint retrieved from a Rayleigh scattering spectrum (Feng et al. 2018). The dashed lines show 1σ radius constraints, where grey lines correspond to the mass constraint and ochre lines correspond to the spectral retrieval constraint. Right: radius-albedo degeneracy at a constant planet/star contrast of 1.73×10 −10 (bold line), which corresponds to an Earth twin at quadrature and 1 AU separation. Other lines show different planet/star contrasts for the same phase and separation. The error on radius, as estimated from massor from spectral retrieval, directly propagates to an error on albedo. We might then estimate albedo to within roughly ±0.05(σ1) or ±0.25 (σ2), respectively, for planets with Earthlike albedo and radius.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> Only one M-dwarf, Proxima Centauri, is near enough to host Earth twins outside our adopted IWA.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> To get a more accurate number of G dwarfs, one should use an initial mass function below 1 M and add the result to equation 13 above 1 M (Bovy, pers. comm.). Because stellar number density is only important for absolute yield estimation, we skip this step.</note>
