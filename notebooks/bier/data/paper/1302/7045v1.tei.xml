				<p>Context. High-contrast imaging for the detection and characterization of exoplanets relies on the instrument&apos;s capability to block out the light of the host star. Some current post-processing methods for calibrating out the residual speckles use information redundancy offered by multispectral imaging but do not use any prior information on the origin of these speckles. Aims. We investigate whether additional information on the system and image formation process can be used to more finely exploit the multispectral information. Methods. We developed an inversion method in a Bayesian framework that is based on an analytical imaging model to estimate both the speckles and the object map. The model links the instrumental aberrations to the speckle pattern in the image focal plane, distinguishing between aberrations upstream and downstream of the coronagraph. Results. We propose and validate several numerical techniques to handle the difficult minimization problems of phase retrieval and achieve a contrast of 10 6 at 0.2 arcsec from simulated images, in the presence of photon noise. Conclusions. This opens up the the possibility of tests on real data where the ultimate performance may override the current techniques if the instrument has good and stable coronagraphic imaging quality. This paves the way for new astrophysical exploitations or even new designs for future instruments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Ground-based instruments have now demonstrated the capability of detecting planetary mass companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chauvin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lagrange et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Marois et al. 2008</ref>) around bright host stars. By combining adaptive optics (AO) system and coronagraphs, some first direct detections from the ground have been possible in favorable cases, at large separations and in young systems when lowmass companions are still warm (≥ 1000 K) and therefore not too faint. There is a very strong astrophysical case to improve the high-contrast detection capability (10 5 for a young giant planet to 10 10 for an earth-like planet in the near infrared) very close to stars (&lt; 0.1" to 1").</p><p>Several instruments will be capable of performing multispectral imaging and will allow characterizing the planets by measuring their spectra. This is the case of GPI (Gemini) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Graham et al. 2007</ref>), Palm 3000 (Palomar) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hinkley et al. 2011</ref>), SCExAO (Subaru) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Martinache &amp; Guyon 2009)</ref>, SPHERE (VLT) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beuzit et al. 2008)</ref>, and several others that will follow, such as EPICS (E-ELT) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kasper et al. 2008)</ref>. By combining extreme adaptive optics (Ex-AO) and more accurate coronagraphs than before, the level of star light cancellation is highly improved, leading to a better signal-to-noise ratio. Even so, the residual host star light is affected by the instrument aberrations and forms a pattern of intensity variations or "speckle noise" on the final image. Part of the speckles cannot be calibrated because they evolve on various time scales (neither fast enough to smooth down to a halo nor stable enough to remove) and for this reason, these "quasi-static speckles" are one of the main limitations for high-contrast imaging.</p><p>Several authors have discussed the challenge posed by the elimination of speckle noise in high-contrast multispectral images. It can be done by post-processing, after the best possible observations. Because images are highly spectrally correlated, one can use the wavelength dependence of the speckles to subtract them. In the particular case of coronagraphic multispectral imaging, only some empirical methods have been developed to subtract the speckle field from the image in the focal plane.</p><p>We propose an alternative approach based on a parametrized imaging model for the post-processing of multispectral coronagraphic imaging corrected by an extreme AO system in the near-infrared domain. The aberrations and bright companions at small separations are estimated jointly in a Bayesian framework. In particular, it is possible to take advantage of prior information such as a knowledge on the aberration levels. This type of approach will be all the more efficient as the instruments improve with lower or more stable aberrations and more efficient coronagraphs.</p><p>In section 2, we explain how previous methods used the information redundancy to suppress the speckles in highcontrast imaging. Then, we describe the advantages of a joint Bayesian estimation of the aberrations in the pupil plane and of the planet map, based on a parametrized model of coronagraphic imaging. Section 3 presents the long-exposure coronagraphic imaging model that is used to simulate the images and to restore them. We also study the case of an approximate model. Section 4 describes the proposed Bayesian joint estimation method as well as theoretical and numerical problems of an alternating restoration algorithm. In particular, we address the strong minimization difficulties associated to the aberration estimation and we propose some solutions. In Section 5, our method is validated by restoring images simulated with a perfect coronagraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Post-processing speckle subtraction and multispectral imaging</head><p>Several empirical post-processing methods have already been proposed to overcome the problem of detection limitation caused by the quasi-static speckles. Some of these methods used the wavelength dependence of the speckle pattern ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref> to estimate it and subtract it from the image, while preserving both the flux and spectrum of the planet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Racine et al. (1999)</ref> suggested to subtract two images at different wavelengths to eliminate both the point-spread function (PSF) and the speckle field in non-coronagraphic images. The main limitation of this simultaneous differential imaging (SDI) method comes from the residuals caused by the evolution of the general PSF profile and of the speckle pattern with wavelength. These residuals can be reduced by increasing the number of images used for the speckle field subtraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Marois et al. (2000)</ref> showed with their double difference method that adding another image to the SDI theoretically improves the signal-to-noise ratio in the final image of the restored companion. The case of multispectral images has been tackled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sparks &amp; Ford (2002)</ref>, who described the so-called spectral deconvolution method in the framework of space-based observations for an instrument combining a coronagraph and an integralfield spectrometer (IFS). The method, subsequently improved and tested on ground-based non-coronagraphic data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Thatte et al. (2007)</ref>, is entirely based on a speckle intensity fit by low-order polynomials as a function of wavelength in the focal plane. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Crepp et al. (2011)</ref> combined this method with the LOCI algorithm, which is based on a linear combination of images Lafrenì ere et al. 2007). They tested this approach to restored on-sky images from the Project 1640 IFS on the Palomar telescope. These methods are applicable to any optical system and in particular to those with coronagraphs. However, it is challenging to prevent the planet signals from being eliminated with the speckles because the planet presence is not explicitly modeled.</p><p>In addition, some information on the measurement system can be very useful to distinguish a planet from the speckle field. <ref type="bibr">Burke &amp; Devaney (2010)</ref> combined classical empirical techniques of differential imaging with a multiwavelength phase retrieval method to estimate the aberration pattern in the pupil plane with a simple imaging model without a coronagraph. This multi-wavelength phase retrieval is nicknamed wavelength diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Gonsalves 1982)</ref>. Information diversity is obtained here by different wavelengths whereas it is obtained by introducing a known phase, e.g. defocus, in phase diversity. But in contrast to the phase diversity, the wavelength diversity does not remove the phase sign ambiguity. In <ref type="bibr">Burke &amp; Devaney (2010)</ref>, the inversion algorithm is based on a maximum-likelihood estimator, which measures the discrepancy between the data and an imaging model. The minimization of this estimator is all the more difficult as the number of unknowns to estimate is high. This problem is overcome by the sparse parametrization of the unknown phases φ λ through the optical-path-errors (or aberrations) δ, assuming that the former are achromatic: φ (λ) = 2πδ/λ. This allows one to exploit jointly the images at all wavelengths to estimate the aberrations efficiently: the map of the unknown opticalpath-errors δ is common to all wavelengths. The number of unknowns is thus limited and the problem constrained. In the present case, Burke's wavelength diversity method does not apply readily, because it assumes non-coronagraphic imaging, whereas we consider the highly non-linear case of a coronagraphic imaging model. That is why we propose to take advantage of a combined use of wavelength diversity applied in a case of a coronagraphic imaging model, and a Bayesian inversion to jointly estimate the aberrations in the pupil plane and the planet map. The joint estimation aims at taking up the challenge of preserving the planets signal. An advantage of the Bayesian inversion is that it can potentially include an important regularization diversity to constrain the problem, using for example prior information on the noise, the planet map (position, spectrum, etc.) or the aberrations. In the Bayesian framework, the criterion to be minimized is the sum of two terms: the data fidelity term, which measures the distance between the data and the imaging model, and one or more penalty terms. An important difficulty is to define a realistic coronagraphic imaging model, that depends on parameters (e.g. aberrations) that can be either calibrated beforehand or estimated from the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Parametric model for multispectral coronagraphic imaging</head><p>To carry out the Bayesian inversion, we need a parametric direct model of coronagraphic imaging. This direct model will also be useful to simulate our test images. We used a non-linear analytical expression of the coronagraphic image as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sauvage et al. (2010)</ref>, with an explicit role of the optical aberrations before and after the coronagraph, and turbulence residuals. This model assumes that the coronagraph is "perfect" in the sense that the coherent energy is perfectly canceled out. The presence of upstream aberration however, will result in remaining intensity from the star in the image. The aberrations, or optical-path-errors, δ, are assumed to be achromatic as an approximation. The most recent spectro-imagers take increasing care to avoid any source of chromatism, such as out-of-pupil aberrations, down to a level compatible with contrasts higher than 10 6 . The variable α ≡ (α x , α y ) represents the angular position in the focal plane in radians and the variable ρ ≡ (ρ x , ρ y ) is the angular position in the pupil plane in radians −1 . Finally, λρ ≡ (λρ x , λρ y ) corresponds to a spatial position in the pupil plane in meters.</p><p>We recall and discuss this model below. In particular, we estimate its simplified expression in the asymptotic case of very low phase, with its second-order Taylor expansion. This simplified expression helps to understand the explicit <ref type="bibr">Ygouf et al.:</ref> Exoplanet detection and instrument aberration retrieval in multispectral coronagraphic imaging <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.

It also helps to identify some important ambiguities with different sets of phases that can produce similar images, which will guide the subsequently selected approach for phase retrieval. We also estimate the departure from this low-phase approximation when the phase grows and discuss the validity of this approximation in a SPHERE-like case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Imaging model</head><p>We assume that for an AO-corrected coronagraphic image at the wavelength λ, the direct model is the following sum of three terms, separating the residual coronagraphic stellar halo, the circumstellar source (for which the impact of coronagraph is neglected), and noise n λ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">i λ (α) = f * λ · h c λ (α) + [o λ ⋆ h nc λ ] (α) + n λ (α) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where i λ (α) is the data, i.e., the image to which we have access, f * λ is the star flux at wavelength lambda and h nc λ (α), the non-coronagraphic PSF, which can be estimated separately. Solving the inverse problem is finding the unknowns, namely the object o λ (α) and the speckle field h c λ (α), which we also call the "coronagraphic PSF".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Long-exposure coronagraphic PSF model</head><p>A model description of h c λ (α) directly depends on the turbulence residuals and optical wave-front errors. After previous works to model non-coronagraphic PSFs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Perrin et al. 2003</ref>) and coronagraphic PSFs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cavarroc et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Soummer et al. 2007</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sauvage et al. (2010)</ref> proposed an analytical expression for the coronagraphic image with a distinction between upstream and downstream aberrations (cf. Equation (16) in Appendix B). The considered optical system is composed of a telescope, a perfect coronagraph, and a detector plane (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure (2)</ref>). Some residual turbulent aberrations δ r (ρ, t) are introduced in the telescope pupil plane. δ r (ρ, t) is assumed to be temporally zero-mean, stationary and ergodic. Because we only consider exposure times that are long with respect to turbulence timescales, these turbulent aberrations contribute only through their statistical spatial properties: power spectral density S δr (α) or structure function D φr . The static aberrations are separated into two contributions: the aberrations upstream of the coronagraph δ u (ρ), in the telescope pupil plane P u (ρ) and the aberrations downstream of the coronagraph δ d <ref type="bibr">(ρ)</ref> in the Lyot Stop pupil plane P d (ρ). The perfect coronagraph is defined as an optical device that subtracts a centered Airy pattern of maximal energy from the electromagnetic field. Finally, the coronagraphic PSF depends on three parameters that define our system: the aberration maps δ u , δ d and, the residual phase structure function D φr .</p><p>3.2.1. Approximate long-exposure coronagraphic model in the low-phase regime</p><p>Because the analytical expression for h c λ is a highly nonlinear function of the aberrations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sauvage et al. 2010</ref>), we derived and studied the relevance of an approximate expression for this model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ygouf et al. 2010</ref>). Approximate coronagraphic imaging models have been derived in several works. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cavarroc et al. (2006)</ref> have developed a shortexposure expression and showed by simulations that the main limitation comes from the static aberrations and particularly the aberrations upstream of the coronagraph. Here, we consider a long-exposure imaging model and confirm analytically the dominance of the upstream aberrations. <ref type="bibr">Soummer et al.

Nevertheless, these terms are not explicitly linked to the aberrations, which is what we are interested in.</p><p>Assuming that all phases are small and that the spatial means of φ u (ρ) and φ d (ρ) are equal to zero on the aperture, we derive a second-order Taylor expansion of expression 24 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sauvage et al.

This is consistent with the analysis of <ref type="bibr">Soummer et al. (2007)</ref> with the advantage that these terms depend on the parameters of interest.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Discussion</head><p>Because of the complexity of the long-exposure coronagraphic PSF model of Sauvage et al., we first considered using the approximate model in our inversion algorithm to decrease the number of unknowns to estimate and simplify the criterion to minimize. But a study of this approximate model showed that the resulting image is too different from the one simulated with the Sauvage et al. expression: computing the root mean square of the difference between the two images leads to a substantial error of typically 30% in SPHERE-like conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ygouf et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Speckle non-centrosymmetry. A substantial part of this error arises because in the approximate model, the quasistatic speckles are purely centrosymmetric. Thus, if we eliminate the centrosymmetric part of the image by combining it with a 180 degree rotated version of itself as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">i antisym = i − i 180 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>there are no residuals with this model, i.e. i antisym = 0. But this is not the case with a more physically realistic image such as the one simulated with the model of Sauvage et al..</p><p>The level of residuals after such a subtraction is determined by the quantity of upstream aberrations, as we can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. For example, with 30 nm rms of upstream aberrations, the level of residuals is about six times lower than the rms value of the simulated image (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4)</ref>. Thus, for a significant quantity of upstream aberrations, using the model of Sauvage et al. rather than the approximate model for an inversion, should lead to fewer residuals on the final image.</p><p>Speckle dilation. Another difference between the two models tips the balance toward the model of Sauvage et al..</p><p>Indeed, in the approximate model the speckle dilation is powered by the 1/λ 2 factor. If we subtract an image at 950 nm from its 1650 nm-dilation, there are no residuals with this model. The same operation with the model of Sauvage et al. (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>) shows some residuals, at a level 2.5 lower than the rms value of the simulated image, which attests that it is not a pure speckle dilation.</p><p>To do this, we took the images at the minimum and maximum wavelengths and rescaled the image at 950 nm with respect to the image at 1650 nm. Finally, we performed the following spectral differences between the two images: i diff 1650 = i 1650 nm − γi 950 nm , where γ is a coefficient that minimizes the squared difference |i max − γi min | 2 , and is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cornia et al. (2010)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">γ = ρ i 950 nm (ρ)i 1650 nm (ρ) ρ i 2 1650 nm (ρ)</formula><p>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">(5)</ref> A fine model of the speckle field must be able to account for deviations form centrosymmetry and for deviations from a radial scaling of the speckles proportional to the wavelength. That is why we adopted the model of Sauvage et al. rather than the approximate one in the inversion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Assumptions on the long-exposure coronagraphic PSF model</head><p>The information we obtained from the approximate model study helped us define some key assumptions for the success of the speckle field estimation with the Sauvage et al. longexposure coronagraphic PSF model. Because they have quite a different impact on the final image, it is important to distinguish the aberrations upstream and downstream of the coronagraph. The effect of the downstream aberrations is lower than that of the upstream aberrations, and furthermore, in predicted systems such as SPHERE, they are expected to be much more stable and easier to calibrate than upstream aberrations. Additionally, because we consider long-exposure images, the residual turbulent aberrations will be averaged to form a smooth halo that is easily distinguishable from a planet. Furthermore, the statistical quantity D φr , which characterizes this halo, will be measured through the AO system wavefront sensor <ref type="bibr">(Véran et al. 1997</ref>). Therefore, we here assumed that both the static downstream aberrations and the residual turbulent aberrations are calibrated and known. This decreases the number of unknowns because the only aberration map to estimate in order to access the coronagraphic PSF is the quasi-static upstream aberrations. We therefore denote the long-exposure coronagraphic PSF by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h c λ (δ u ; δ d , D φr ) instead of h c λ (δ u , δ d , D φr )</formula><p>to underline the fact that δ d and D φr are assumed to be known.</p><p>An advantage of our approach is that these assumptions can evolve. The formalism will allow us to refine our method if we finally decide to estimate either the downstream aberrations or the residual turbulent aberrations. Thus, we can slowly increase the complexity of the problem in anticipation of using real data from SPHERE or from another instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Joint estimation of wavefront and object algorithm and minimization strategy</head><p>This section introduces the criterion to be minimized (4.1) as well as the regularization elements that were used to constrain the problem for the present validations (4.2).</p><p>The minimization algorithm is then described, stressing the two stages that constitute its core (4.3). One of these stages presents some convergence difficulties. A minimization strategy is described in Subsection (4.4). The chosen optimizer in described in Subsection 4.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Definition of the criterion to be minimized</head><p>Following the Bayesian inverse problem approach, solving the inverse problem consists of finding the unknowns, firstly the object characteristics o (α, λ) = {o λ (α)} λ , secondly the parameters of the speckle field h c λ (δ u ; δ d , D φr ) and f * (λ) = {f * λ } λ , which are the most likely given the data and our prior information about the unknowns. This can be reduced to minimizing the following criterion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">J(o, f * , δ u ) = λ α 1 2σ 2 n,λ (α) |i λ − f * λ · h c λ (δ u ; δ d , D φr ) − o λ ⋆ h nc λ (δ u ; δ d , D φr )| 2 (α) + R o + R f * + R δ + · · ·.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This criterion is the sum of two terms: the data fidelity term, which measures the distance between the data and the imaging model, and a non-exhaustive list of regularization terms on our unknowns R o , R f * , R δ . We consider that the noise is the sum of a photonic contribution and a detector contribution, that it is white and approximately Gaussian, which is a valid approximation for the flux as considered in this application. The noise variance is assumed to be known here and if it were not, it could be estimated asˆσasˆ asˆσ 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">n,λ = ˆ σ 2 ph,λ + ˆ σ 2 det,λ (Mugnier et al. 2004), wherê σ 2 ph,λ = max(i λ , 0)</formula><p>is the photon noise variance andˆσ andˆ andˆσ 2 det,λ is the detector noise variance previously calibrated. It is assumed that the noise is not correlated from pixel to pixel or between images.</p><p>The star flux at each wavelength can be analytically estimated from the criterion provided the regularization on flux is quadratic or absent. In the latter case, the maximum likelihood solution being given by ∂J ∂f * λ = 0, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ˆ f * λ (o λ , δ u ) = α h c λ (i λ − o λ ⋆ h nc λ ) /σ 2 n,λ (α) α (h c λ ) 2 /σ 2 n,λ<label>(α)</label></formula><p>.</p><p>Thanks to this analytical expression, the criterion to be minimized is that of Eq. (6) with f * λ replaced byˆfbyˆ byˆf * λ , which will be denoted by J ′ (o, δ u ) and depends explicitly on o λ and δ u only.</p><p>Estimating both the object and the aberrations from a single image is a highly underdetermined problem. Any diffraction-sized feature in the halo can be interpreted either as a circumstellar point-source or as a part of the stellar speckle halo. This ambiguity can be decreased by using multispectral images but it is not sufficient. It is thus necessary to regularize the problem by adding more constraints. This is the role of the regularization terms. In this paper, we study the case of constraints on the object that is sufficient for the simulated images we used, but we should keep in mind that it is also possible to use constraints on the aberration map.</p></div>

By penalizing the energy in the object map, it favors the energy in the aberration map and prevents the speckles from being mistaken for a planet.</p><p>The regularization term R o includes the prior spatial and spectral information we have on the object. We chose here an L1-L2 white spatial regularization, which assumes independence between the pixels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Meimon et al. 2009</ref>) be-cause we are mainly looking for point sources. We used an L1-L2 regularization rather than a true L1 regularization to keep a differentiable criterion, which simplifies the minimization problem. The spectral prior is based on smoothness of the object spectrum. We currently assume that the object is white (constant spectrum) but as the final aim is to extract some spectra, for future validations we will use a L2 correlated spectral regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Thiébaut &amp; Mugnier 2006</ref>), which will involve the differences between the spectrum at neighboring wavelength at each pixel and will enforce smoothness on the object spectrum.</p><p>The regularization on the object is necessary to obtain a sparse object.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Positivity and support constraints on the object</head><p>The object intensity map is a set of positive values, which is an important prior information. One should therefore enforce a positivity constraint on the object. This constraint can be implemented in various ways, such as criterion minimization under the positivity constraint, reparameterization of the object, or explicit modification of the a priori probability distribution (e.g., addition of an entropic term). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mugnier et al. (2004)</ref> have found that the best way to ensure positivity, with respect both to speed and to not introducing local minima, is to directly minimize the criterion under this constraint. We proceeded similarly.</p><p>Because the star light is concentrated around the optical axis, the flux is essentially estimated on this very bright region (cf. Equation 7). But if there are too many residuals on the object, the flux estimation can be biased. Thus, imposing, as is physically meaningful, that the object is null very close to the star, in a region of typically 3λ/D radius, helps us estimate the star flux accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Regularization on the star flux R f *</head><p>To make the minimization more robust, it can be useful to constrain the flux estimation to physical values. Indeed, if there are no turbulent aberrations, there is an indetermination between the star flux value and the phase rms value in the approximate model of Eq. (13). Consequently, for aberrations with very low rms values, the coronagraphic PSF h c λ is close to zero and thus the analytical flux estimate given by Eq. (6) can diverge. The presence of known turbulent aberrations naturally constrains the flux value, but to make the method more robust, we chose to prevent the flux from diverging. In practice, we regularized the flux estimation by the following quadratic metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R f * = (f * λ −f0) 2 2σ 2 f,λ</formula><p>. This metric can be interpreted as a Gaussian prior low on the flux, but its role is not as essential for the criterion minimization as that of the L1-L2 regularization and the positivity constraint. This leads to the following expression for the analytic star flux:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ˆ f * λ = α h c λ (i λ − o λ ⋆ h nc λ ) /σ 2 n,λ + f 0 /σ 2 f,λ α (h c λ ) 2 /σ 2 n,λ + 1/σ 2 f,λ .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>In practice, we chose a very high standard deviation σ f,λ = 100 × α i λ , to avoid biasing the flux. With this standard deviation, we can choose any mean flux, for example, f 0 = 0. This is sufficient to avoid the division by zero in the flux computation and thus the flux divergence.</p></div>

Choice of an appropriate starting point: very small random phase</p><p>To keep the computation time reasonable, we used the local descent algorithm described in Subsection 4.5 to minimize the criterion. Because the latter is highly non-convex, the chosen starting point so that we are fully in the conditions where the Taylor expansion developed in 3.2.1 is valid and where the criterion is less non-convex. It allows the algorithm to avoid many wrong directions, and thus many local minima. As the algorithm converges, the upstream aberration rms value increases toward its true value and a gradual non-linearity of the model is gradually introduced. We tested the phase retrieval capability of our algorithm with respect to the chosen starting point, assuming that there is no object to estimate. We give the rms value of the estimated upstream aberration map and the rms value of the difference between the simulated and the estimated maps estimated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">rms diff = ρ δ simulated u − δ estimated u 2 1/2 ρ (δ simulated u ) 2 1/2 × 100.

Indeed, the algorithm converges very quickly toward a local minimum and the estimated aberration map (rms a = 307 nm at 950 nm) is completely different from the simulated one (rms diff,a = 10 3 %). (b) Using a zero-aberration map as a starting point does not work either. This is probably because the approximate model is an even function. For this particular starting point, the gradient is null, which leads to some convergence difficulties. The rms of the difference between the two maps is about 1.4 × 10 4 %. The estimated aberration pattern (rms b = 4069 nm at 950 nm) seems to show that the algorithm does not explore the high frequencies. (c) The solution we propose is to use as a starting point for the minimization a non-null random aberration map with a low rms value compared to those of the "true" simulated aberration map. In practice, we chose an rms value about 10 8 times lower than the "true" value. This leads to a correct estimation of the aberration map (rms c = 30.2 nm at 950 nm) with an rms of the difference between the two maps of about 0.6%.</p><p>If we plot the same results for images simulated with turbulence, the conclusions are not the same. The convergence to an aberration map that resembles the true one and has similar rms value is easier:</p><p>(a') By using a random aberration map with the same rms value as the true aberrations (30 nm at 950 nm) as a starting point, the rms value of the estimated aberration map (30.7 nm) is close to the true value. After a careful inspection, the estimated aberration map turned out to be similar to the opposite of the simulated one. This is discussed in more detail in 4.4.2. (b') Using a zero-aberration map as a starting point leads to a good pattern and a good rms value of aberration map (30.1 nm). (c') Using a non-null random aberration map with a low rms value as a starting point also leads to a good pattern and a good rms value of the aberration map (30.1 nm).</p><p>For the (b') and (c') cases, the difference between the two maps is bigger than before (17%) but the estimated aberration map is a sufficiently good starting point for the alternating minimization. The choice of an appropriate starting point seems not to be as essential with turbulent aberrations as it was without turbulent aberrations. Indeed, the presence of turbulent aberrations raises the ambiguity that exists between the value of the star flux value and the rms value of the upstream aberration map. Nevertheless, even if we assume that there are turbulent aberrations in the following, we chose to use a random aberration map with a low rms value as a starting point of the phase retrieval because it allows us to avoid some local minima by linearizing the highly non-linear model used in the inversion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2.">Avoiding some local minima by testing quasi-equivalent starting points</head><p>In the approximate model, four different aberration maps can give the same image (cf. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> in Appendix A). This means that, from a given starting point, the minimization algorithm can take four different but equivalent directions from the approximate model point of view. But from the point of view of the model used in the inversion, this is not the case because it depends on downstream aberrations, which break the symmetry. That is why we call them "quasi-equivalent" aberrations maps (cf. 3.2.1).</p><p>The idea is then to explore the several regions offered by the four different quasi-equivalent aberrations maps to determine which of these solutions gives the smallest criterion. To do this, we performed an initialization step where the very small random phase is taken as a starting point. A first phase retrieval stage was performed with this starting point, leading to a first estimated aberration map denoted by δ u init,1 (ρ). Then, the three other quasi-equivalent aberration maps δ u init,1 (−ρ), −δ u init,1 (ρ) and −δ u init,1 (−ρ) were taken as starting points for three other phase retrieval stages. This led to three more estimated aberration maps denoted by δ u init,2 , δ u init,3 and δ u init,4 . <ref type="figure">Figure (7)</ref> shows the four estimated aberration maps at the end of the initialization step.

We begin by an inversion with one spectral channel. Then, we add some more spectral channels for new inversions and each time, we take the previous estimated aberration map as a starting point.

If the planet with a contrast of 10 5 is detected each time, only the two broader bandwidths (700 and 400 nm) allow one to detect the two planets with a contrast of 10 6 . With a 200 and a 100 nm bandwidth, the planet with a contrast of 10 6 which is at a separation of 0.4 arcsec is detected, whereas the one that is at a separation of 0.2 arcsec is not. The detection performance increases with the bandwidth because the incorporated spectral information helps the algorithm to distinguish between speckles and planets. Indeed, from one wavelength to another, the amplitude of a  speckle movement is proportional to the wavelength difference and to the radial position of the speckle. For a given spectral bandwidth, it is therefore easier to detect a planet that is far away from the star than a planet than is close to the star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed an original method that jointly estimates the object (multispectral deconvolution) and the aberrations (multispectral phase retrieval) for the new generation of planet finders. For the first time, a fine parametric model of coronagraphic imaging, describing the instrument response, is used for the inversion of simulated multispectral images in a solid statistical framework. Even though the model remains a simplification of reality, in particular when assuming achromatic wavefront errors, it goes much further than only assuming that the spatial speckle pattern essentially scales with wavelength. We have shown that the second-order approximation of the imaging model has the same behavior as the often-used model for the problem at hand: the speckle pattern is centrosymmetric, it scales with the wavelength, and it is not dependent on the downstream aberrations. The departure from this case quickly becomes very significant as the phase grows. It is clear that the ability of a finite phase to produce non-symmetric speckles induces a strong ambiguity between the estimates of the aberrations and the object, even if the latter is a point-like companion.</p><p>To set up our method, we developed an iterative algorithm. With only one spectral channel, this joint estimation is an underdetermined problem, as we emphasized before. This underdetermination results mathematically in a degeneracy of the global minimum. A multispectral inversion raises this underdetermination but it is still possible to fall into local minima. Because of the high non-linearity of the coronagraphic imaging analytical model and the number of unknowns to estimate (about 10 3 in our case), the phase retrieval, even if it is multispectral, remains a difficult problem. We set-up a minimization approach that remains quite fast (without systematically exploring the whole parameter space in a search for global minimum) but that is still relatively robust: extensive tests showed the success in converging to a good solution in 90% of the cases in a systematic manner, and in the other cases, the failure appears obviously in the results with no risk of confusion and can motivate tests with alternative criterion minimization approaches. We obtained these convergence capabilities of the algorithm by bringing original solutions to the minimization difficulties of the phase retrieval, inspired by studying the imaging model. One element of the solution is to use a small random aberration map as starting point. Another element is to explore the several directions offered by the quasi-equivalent aberration maps. A wide variety of prior information, either about the system (aberrations, flux, noise) or about the object of interest, can be used to constrain the problem. The choice of a Bayesian approach allows this flexibility. In particular, a regularization that minimizes the energy on the object map helped us in separating the aberrations from the object and in decreasing the speckle noise in the reconstructed object map.</p><p>The restoration of images simulated with a perfect coronagraph is very encouraging for the extraction of planetary signals at levels that begin to be astrophysically interesting. We demonstrated the efficiency of the method even with only two spectral channels, by achieving a contrast of 10 5 at 0.2 arcsec. Multispectral redundancy improves the detection, which allowed us to achieve a contrast of 10 6 at 0.2 arcsec with six spectral channels.</p><p>We therefore believe that this approach will be quite powerful when we are faced with experimental data. This deserves to be studied, as well as how the performance will evolve in the cases of images simulated with a nonperfect coronagraph, real images from the SPHERE instrument in the lab, or real images from an instrument on-sky. Eventually, this method could be used to improve the performance of the existing multispectral imaging instruments, providing better astrophysical exploitations. Now that we demonstrated that we can manage the difficulties linked to the criterion minimization, we can now focus on its applicability, and on adding more prior information, starting with the full set of information that can be obtained from the instrument calibrations.</p><p>The lessons learned by applying the method could also facilitate the approach for the design of future instruments such as EPICS for the European Extremely Large Telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kasper et al. 2008)</ref>, and the definition of their calibration procedures. This yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Γ (P d ·δu)(ρ) = Γ (P d ·δu)(−ρ) = Γ (P d ·(−δu))(ρ) = Γ (P d ·(−δu))(−ρ) ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>which means that the upstream aberration sets δ u (ρ), δ u (−ρ), −δ u (ρ) and −δ u (−ρ) are equivalent with respect to the approximate model, because they give the same image. This is true even in the presence of the turbulent term</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P d 2 ⋆ S φr (α) − |P [φ r ]| 2 t · P d 2 .</formula><p>Appendix B: Indetermination on the estimated aberrations from an image simulated with the Sauvage et al. model</p><p>In classical imaging, i.e. "non-coronagraphic imaging", the sign of the even part of the phase cannot be deduced from only one image in the focal plane <ref type="bibr">(Blanc 2002)</ref>. In other words, if we denote φ e and φ o , the even and the odd parts of the phase, the two phases φ = φ e + φ o and φ ′ = −φ e + φ o give the same image. In this appendix, we show that this is also the case for the <ref type="bibr">Sauvage et al. expres- sion (Sauvage et al. 2010</ref>) in coronagraphic imaging, if we assume that the sign of the even part changes for all phase errors. The expression of Sauvage et al. is |(η 0 )| 2 represents the mean Strehl ratio during observation, such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">h c λ = A n A * n + |(η 0 )| 2 A d A * d − 2ℜ {{η 0 A * n A d } ,<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">η 0 (t) = Ψ 0 (ρ)|P u (ρ) = 1 S ρ Ψ * 0 (ρ)P u (ρ)d 2 ρ = 1 S 2 ρ P 2 u (ρ)e −jφ(ρ,t) d 2 ρ,</formula><p>with φ(ρ, t) = φ r (ρ, t) + φ u (ρ). The first term of Sauvage et al.'s expression A n A * n is the classical case of non-coronagraphic PSF, which is well-known <ref type="bibr">(Blanc 2002</ref>). The term A n A * n stays identical whatever the sign of the even part of the phase.</p><p>The second term of Sauvage et al.'s expression is the product of two factors: |(η 0 )| 2 and A d A * d . The latter stays identical whatever the sign of the even part of the phase. We take the following phase φ ′ = −φ e + φ o and calculate the corresponding η ′ 0 (t), assuming that ρ ′′ = −ρ: </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">η ′ 0 (t) = 1 S 2 ρ P 2 u (ρ)e −jφ ′ (ρ,t) d 2 ρ = 1 S 2 ρ P 2 u (ρ)e −</formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">= [η 0 (t)] * . |(η 0 )| 2 = |(η 0 · η 0 (t) * )| 2</formula><p>is then independent of the sign of the even part of the phase. Thus, the product |(η 0 )| 2 A d A * d is also independent of the sign of the even part of the phase.</p><p>We study now the third term 2ℜ {{η 0 A * n A d }.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Assuming that φ d = (φ d ) e + (φ d ) o and φ ′ d = −(φ d ) e + (φ d ) o : A ′ d (α) = TF −1 P d (ρ) e jφ ′ d (ρ) = ρ ′ P d (ρ) e j[−(φ d )e(ρ)+(φ d )o(ρ)] e −2iπ(ρα) d 2 ρ = ρ ′ P d (ρ ′′ ) e −j[(φ d )e(ρ ′′ )+(φd)o(ρ ′′ )] e 2iπ(ρ ′′ α) d 2 ρ ′′ = [A d ] * .</formula><p>In the same way as the previous demonstration, we can show that A * n = A n . Under the effect of the transformation φ → φ ′ , the different terms become</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">η 0 → η * 0 A * n → A n A d → A * d .</formula><p>In other words,</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">η 0 A * n A d → [η 0 A * n A d ] *</formula><p>When we take the conjugate of a complex number, only the sign of the imaginary part changes. Because we take the real part of this expression, changing the sign of the even part of the phase does not change the term.</p><p>To conclude, like in classical imaging, changing the sign of the even part of the phase does not change the image in the focal plane. This means that two sets of aberrations give the same image. But if we assume like in this communication that the downstream aberrations are fixed and known, this removes the degeneracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.
