				<p>In Paper I, we presented a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model for the winds of close-in exoplanets. However, close-in exoplanets are tidally locked and irradiated only on the day sides by their host stars. This requires two-dimensional hydrodynamic models with self-consistent radiative transfer calculations. In this paper, for the tidal locking (two-dimensional radiative transfer) and non-tidal locking cases (one-dimensional radiative transfer), we constructed a multi-fluid two-dimensional hydrodynamic model with detailed radiative transfer to depict the escape of particles. We found that the tidal forces (the sum of tidal gravity of the star and centrifugal force due to the planetary rotation) supply significant accelerations and result in anisotropic winds. An important effect of the tidal forces is that it severely depresses the outflow of particles near the polar regions where the density and the radial velocity are a factor of few-ten smaller than those of the low-latitude regions. As a consequence, most particles escape the surface of the planet from the regions of low-latitude. Comparing the tidal and non-tidal locking cases, we found that their optical depths are very different so that the flows also emerge with a different pattern. In the case of the non-tidal locking, the radial velocities at the base of the wind are higher than the merid-ional velocities. However, in the case of tidal locking, the meridional velocities dominate the flow at the base of the wind, and they can transfer effectively mass and energy from the day sides to the night sides. Further, we also found that the differences of the winds show middle extent at large radii. It expresses that the structure of the wind at the base can be changed by the two-dimensional radiative transfer due to large optical depths, but the extent is reduced with an increase in radius. Because the escape is depressed in the polar regions, the mass loss rate predicted by the non-tidal locking model, in the order of magnitude of 10 10 g-3-s −1 , is a factor of 2 lower than that predicted by one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The results of tidal locking show that the mass loss rate is decreased a order of magnitude, only 4.3× 10 9 g s −1 , due to large optical depths on the night side. We also found that the distributions of hydrogen atoms show clear variations from the day side to night side, thus the origin of the excess absorption in Ly α should be reexamined by using multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The excess absorption in Lyman α of HD 209458b and HD 189733b have been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003)</ref> and Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Etangs et al. (2010)</ref>. From the excess absorption those authors suggested that the hydrogen clouds of HD 209458b and HD 189733b are above their Roche lobe. Most of the explanations attribute the excess absorption to mass loss from the surfaces of exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lammer et al. 2003</ref>; Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Etangs et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yelle , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tian et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">García Muñoz 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Penz et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Murray-clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lammer et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guo 2011 (Paper I)</ref>). To simplify the calculations, all the hydrodynamic models above are one dimensional. Recently, two-and three-dimensional hydrodynamic models have been presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stone &amp; Proga (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schneiter et al. (2007)</ref>, however, some challenging physical processes have been neglected by them. All the above one-dimensional models described thermal particle escape, namely, the particles of the planets escape from their gravity potential wells as a result of the irradiation from the host star. However, the charge exchange between the stellar wind and the planetary escaping exosphere can result in the same observation phenomenons <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Holmström et al. 2008</ref>). The loss of nonthermal neutral atoms via interactions between the stellar wind and the exosphere have been discussed by many researchers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Erkaev et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Holmström et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ekenbäck et al. 2010)</ref>. Their results showed that the fresh neutral atoms produced by the charge exchange can match the Ly α excess absorption.</p><p>Although current theoretic models predicted the mass loss at the upper atmosphere of Hot Jupiters, no clear observational evidences support the thermal or non-thermal explanations. Either the energetic HI of stellar origin or thermal HI populations in the planetary atmosphere can fit the observations of Ly α (Ben-Jaffel &amp; Hosseini 2010).</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koskinen et al. (2010)</ref> found that the excess absorption can be explained solely by absorption in the upper atmosphere and the process of charge exchange might not be necessary. According to the examples from our solar system, however, the charge exchange can play an important role in explaining the excess Ly α absorption (see Lammer 2011 for more details).</p><p>The extent of understanding the excess absorption depends strongly on the physics described in theoretical models. To fully distinguish the thermal or non-thermal processes, the single-fluid and one-dimensional models are not enough. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yelle (2004) and</ref><ref type="bibr">García Muñoz (2007)</ref> have used the diffusion approximation to depict the velocity differences between different species, and photochemistry, ionization and recombination have also been included. Moreover, Guo (2011) presented a multi-fluid one-dimensional model to depict the atmospheric escape and predicted reasonable mass loss rates for HD 209458b and HD 189733b. The multi-fluid model is more advantageous than single-fluid one because the interactions among different species between the stellar and planetary winds are depicted by its own continuity, momentum and energy equations. However, the model of Paper I can be improved in two points at least. First, the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model only simulates the case along the line connecting the center of planet and the center of the star.</p><p>For the close-in expolanets, the tidal forces between the star and planet tend to circularize the orbit and synchronize the rotation of the planet with the orbital period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guillot et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Trilling 2000)</ref>. Thus, for the close-in exoplanets it is reasonable to assume that their same sides are always facing the star. If the irradiation and tidal effects of the host star are included, multi-dimensional models are more suitable. Second, the constraint of stellar wind has been omitted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stone &amp; Proga (2009)</ref> discussed the interaction between the stellar and planetary winds and found that the planetary wind is confined to a small volume by the stellar wind. However, their model used the assumption of a single-fluid so the processes of charge exchange could not be simulated.</p><p>These issues as above motivated us to construct a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model with realistic treatment of radiative transfer and tidal forces. We have developed a time-independent model with the one-dimensional assumption, however, it is impractical to extend the method to two-dimension because of the existence of critical points. In this paper we constructed a time-dependent two-dimensional model including the micro-physics processes, the influence of tide and radiative transfer. The interactions between the stellar and planetary winds will be discussed in the further work.</p><p>This paper aims to calculate the escape of atomic hydrogen and protons through the solution to their mass, momentum and energy equations. The microscopic physics processes are covered in the mass, but not in the momentum and energy equations (Section 2.1). The processes of radiative transfer are discussed in Section 2.2. We used semi-implicit scheme to calculate these equations (Section 2.3) and tested the model in Section 3. We incorporated one-and two-dimensional radiative transfer into the hydrodynamic models (Section 4), and focus on the differences between them. In Section 5 we discussed the influence of the boundary conditions and stellar activity. Our results are summarized in Section.6</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Equations and Assumptions</head><p>In Paper I (Guo 2011) we described a steady-state, radial expansion of plasma containing three species: atomic hydrogen (h), protons (p) and electrons (e). In this paper, we extend the previous work to two-dimensions. But thermal electrons are not included.</p><p>Atomic hydrogen (h) and protons (p) have their own continuity equations and are described by a particle density n h and n p . Since this model deals with a mixture of atomic hydrogen and protons, the following processes are considered: photoionization and recombination.</p><p>Further, we assumed that the velocities and temperatures of the particles are the same, namely, u h = u p = u and T h = T p = T . The assumption is acceptable because the mass loss rates predicted by this model are higher than 10 9 g s −1 (see Section 3 and 4), if the mass loss rates are below the value the velocities and temperature should be calculated separately because of the decoupling of particles (Guo 2011). As in Paper I, we did not include H 2 in this model because the thermosphere of close-in planets should be composed primarily of H and H + . The location of transition from H 2 to H is about 1.1R P (Yelle 2004).</p><p>We described the planetary wind by using multi-particle two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations that can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂n j ∂t + ▽ · (n j u) = S j (1) ∂(nu) ∂t + ▽ · (nuu) + ▽p = na ext (2) ∂[n(e + u 2 2 )] ∂t + ▽ · [nu(e + u 2 2 )] + ▽(pu) = na ext · u + Q,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where n j (j=h,p) is particle number density of hydrogen atoms and ions. n=n h +n p is the number density of the gas as a whole. S j denotes the production/destruction of particles.</p><p>The specific internal energy is e = RT γ−1</p><p>, and u 2 = u 2 r + u 2 θ is the sum of squares of velocities, wherê r andˆθandˆ andˆθ velocities are u r and u θ . γ is set to 5/3. The accelerations produced by the gravities of planet and star as well as the centrifugal forces due to the rotation of the planet around the star are included in the term of a ext . The net heating rate is expressed as Q = H − L, where H is the heating from irradiation of the star and L is cooling due to the atmospheric radiation.</p><p>The hydrodynamic equations are solved in spherical polar (r,θ) coordinates.

Finally, we can obtain the accelerations as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">a r = − GM p r 2 + GM * (D cos θ − r) (D 2 + r 2 − 2Dr cos θ) 3/2 − G M * D 3 cos θ(D − r cos θ)<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">a θ = − GM * D sin θ (D 2 + r 2 − 2Dr cos θ) 3/2 + G M * D 3 sin θ(D − r cos θ).<label>(13)</label></formula><p>In Equation (12), the first term represents the gravity of planet. The second and third terms as well as the two terms of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> are the accelerations produced by the gravity of host stars and orbital motion, respectively. Except the first term of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(12)</ref>, we refer to the other terms as "tidal accelerations". How do the tidal accelerations alter the behaviors of flows? We can estimate this by considering some special cases. In the case of θ =0 • , Equation (12) can be simplified to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">a r = − GMp r 2 + GM * (D−r) 2 − G M * D 3 (D − r)</formula><p>. This form is consisitent with the Equation (15) of García Muñoz (2007) and hints that the tidal forces supply positive acceleration along the line connecting the planet to the star. However, the radial tidal acceleration gradually decreases with the increase of θ and become negative at 60 • θ 120 • . This means that the escape of particles in the polar regions can be depressed by the tidal forces. In addition, we also note thatâthatˆthatâ θ is always negative (positive) if the θ is smaller (greater) than ∼ 90 • . These characteristics will also be discussed further in Section 4.</p><p>The Coriolis forces have been neglected in the calculations. In the regions close to host stars, the escape velocities of particles which are in the order of magnitude of 20-40 km s −1 are smaller than the orbital velocities (in the order of magnitude of 100 km s −1 ).</p><p>This means that the planetary wind can be deflected by Coriolis forces. However, our calculations are limited to the regions close to exoplanets where the velocity of the wind is much less than the orbital velocity. Thus, Coriolis forces can be neglected safely near the planet.</p><p>The source terms S 2 can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">S 2 =             Q 2 2 r 2 sin θ γ rec − Q 1 γ pho Q 1 γ pho − Q 2 2 r 2 sin θ γ rec 0 0 r 2 sin θ(H − L)/m H             ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where m H is the mass of hydrogen atom, γ pho = In an ionized atmosphere composed of H and H + , photoelectrons distribute their energy via the collision with thermal electrons. H + obtain energy from thermal electrons via Coulomb collisions while hydrogen atoms share the energy of thermal electrons by elastic and inelastic collisions. Here we assumed that H and H + have the same temperatures, therefore, the total heating of the atmosphere can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">H = n h ν η ν F ν e −τν σ ν .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>For different photon energies, we defined the net heating efficiency as η ν = (hν−13.6)/hν that is the maximum heating efficiency. In fact, the fraction of photon energy deposited as heat in the atmosphere of exoplanet should be smaller than the definition above. It also shows that the heating efficiency is higher for the photons with higher energy. Equation </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L = L rec + L f f ergcm −3 s −1 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>In addition, we can not calculate the infrared emission of H + 3 as done by Yelle (2004) and García Muñoz (2007) due to the lack of photochemistry in our model. The cooling of H + 3 could be important because it can modify the location of maximum temperature, but the mass loss rates are not affected by the cooling of H + 3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Penz et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>There are not resolved emission spectra from the host stars of exoplanets. For HD 209458, we used the EUV spectra of the sun as its emission spectra. Those data are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Richards et al. (1994)</ref>. Our calculations are completed with a solar proxy P 10.7 = 80 that corresponds to a middle-low level of stellar activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Radiative transfer</head><p>The radiative transfers are the most important processes in determining the atmospheric structure of planet. In the case of non-tidal locking, both hemispheres of the planet can receive the irradiation from its host star. Thus, the one-dimensional radiative transfer can approximately depict the process. In the assumption of 1D radiative transfer, the optical depth at frequency ν can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">τ ν = r Rmax n h σ ν dr.<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Clearly, Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">(17)</ref> shows that the optical depth is function of radii, but is not relative with θ. Thus, it cannot correctly depict the penetration of the EUV radiation from the face of day-side to night-side if the planets are tidally locked by their host stars. To calculate an accurate optical depth in the case of tidal locking, two-dimensional radiative transfer calculations are needed. Here we present a simplified treatment in which both the impact factor q(r, θ) = r sin θ and latitude θ determine the final optical depths. For each grid point, the nodal points at every radii are found along the opposite direction of stellar radiation, and the values of latitude at those radii are determined (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>For a given grid point P(i, j), the nodal point at the next radius r i+1 can be expressed as P(i+1, j') (Note that the impact factor q(r, θ) of the given grid point P(i, j) is same with that of P(i+1, j').). Generally, the latitude of P(i+1, j') is between grid points θ j and θ j−1 rather than consistent with the grid points of angular direction. Finally, the corresponding number density of P(i+1, j') at radius r i+1 can be approximated as n h = n i+1,j +n i+1,j−1 2</p><p>. Therefore, the optical depth along the z-direction (the direction of stellar radiation) can be approximated to</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">τ i,j ν = p zmax n h σ ν dz.<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The optical depth is set to 10 10 when the impact factor q is smaller than R p . Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(18)</ref> is used to calculate the radiative transfer of tidal locking.</p><p>The simplified calculations represent the variations of the optical depth at all grid points. We believe that small differences due to the approximation do not affect the results quantitatively.</p></div>

The velocities predicted by our model are higher than those of Yelle <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2004)</ref> The fact that as much as 50% of hydrogen at r = 2.R p is ionized is a consequence of being irradiated by the host star. Due to lack of photochemistry, the ionization state cannot be predicted accurately by our model. In fact, the atmosphere can be thought of as if made up solely of hydrogen if the amounts of heavy constituents are small enough.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, we summarized the cases with P Rp =10 dyn cm −2 and P 10.7 = 200. The mass loss rate of 2.2× 10 11 g s −1 is comparable with that of García Muñoz <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">(2007)</ref>). Some chemical processes are not included in our model. Thus, the net chemical expense of energy cannot be calculated. However, the escape of particles in the atmosphere of planet should be driven mainly by irradiation of host star.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The effect of tidal force</head><p>In this section we solved the two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations. To separately discuss the effect of the tidal force, we assumed the case of non-tidal locking, thus the one-dimensional radiative transfer is used (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">(17)</ref>). However, the opacities on the day and night sides may be very different. We will further discuss it in Section 4.2.</p><p>The left panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show the images of the density (with velocity vectors) and temperature. Note that the density is the sum of hydrogen atoms and ions.</p><p>In the 2D model, the number density of hydrogen decreases but the ionization fraction increases with radius as does one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The temperature rises with an increase in radius up to r/R p = 2. The two-dimensional models show that wind temperature can attain 10000K at about 1.5R p and then drop to 3000K.</p><p>The mass loss rates are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">˙ M = 2πm H (r max ) 2 [ 0 π n h u r sin θdθ + 0 π n p u r sin θdθ],<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where r max is the upper boundary. We obtained a mass loss rate of ˙ M = 1.72 × 10 10 g s −1 which is a factor of 2 smaller than that calculated by one-dimensional hydrodynamics model. only contribute to 20% of the mass loss rate due to their low density and radial velocity.</p><p>As a consequence, the mass loss rate of the two-dimensional hydrodynamics is only half of that of one-dimensional hydrodynamics. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> further shows the effect of tidal forces at different radii. Due to strong gas pressure, the radial velocities are evidently higher than the meridional velocities at the base of the wind (r/R P =2). However, the ratios of u θ /u r rapidly increase with an increase in radius. At r/R P =4, the ratio can attain 0.6 at θ=70 • , and the value even approaches 1 at r/R P =7. The trend shows how the tidal forces enforce the flows moving in horizonal direction when the gas pressures decrease with an increase in radius. In addition, the peaks of u θ /u r are almost emerge at θ=70 • rather than θ=90 • can be attributed to the balance of orbital motions and gravity accelerations of host star.</p><p>To further explore the effect of tidal force, we neglected the tidal force and recalculated the model. The right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show spherically symmetric distributions for density, velocity and temperature. Comparing the left and right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 3 and   4</ref>, we can find that the tidal forces not only supply strong accelerations inˆθinˆ inˆθ direction but also decrease the radial velocity in the polar regions. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that the tidal forces not only impel the non-radial flows in the planetary atmosphere but also inhibit the escape of particles from the polar regions so that most particles escape the bound of the planet from the zones of low latitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Case of Tidal Locking</head><p>In Section 4.1, we discussed the case of non-tidal locking. However, about 25% extrasolar planets are very close to their host stars thus they should be tidally locked. To inspect the case, we recalculated the two-dimensional planetary winds by using two-dimensional radiative transfer (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(18)</ref>), which appropriately depicts the irradiation of the host star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 7</ref> displays that the decline of density on the night sides with the radius is slightly slower than that on day sides. At large radii, the densities of polar regions are lower than that of the regions of low-middle latitude. Close to the planet, the meridional velocities dominant the velocity field and transfer the mass and energy from the day side to the night side (see the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 7</ref> for details). The appearance of strong non-radial flows at the base of the wind can be explained by the variations of the optical depth. The optical depth of single photon of 20 ev for two-dimensional radiative transfer is shown in right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. The contours of the optical depth extend toward a larger radius from the day side to the night side. When the impact factor q approaches the radius of the planet, the optical depth is in the order of magnitude of 10 −1 − 10 1 . The heating is proportional to e −τ (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(15)</ref>), therefore, more energy can be received on the day side. With an increase in radius, the radial velocities increase gradually. Finally, the pattern of flows at the base of the wind is nearly in the direction of meridian. In the upper atmosphere, the non-radial flows are comparable with the radial flows, but the radial velocities are stronger in the zones of low-latitude.</p><p>The distributions of temperature are also non-spherically symmetric due to the influence of the optical depth (the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Evidently, the distributions of by PdV work, heating, cooling and work W ext done by external forces (gravity of the planet and tidal forces) are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Heating from the irradiation and PdV work continuously decline to zero from the day side to night side. However, the work done by external forces continuously rises with the increase of θ. Due to de = dQ − P dV + W ext , this hints that external forces can do positive work due to the contraction of gas, which results in the increase of gas temperature (In generally, PdV work expands the atmosphere and lowers the gas temperature.). Therefore, the cause of temperature increase from the day to night side can be explained by the increase of net heating rate. While 105 • θ 125 • , the temperature slightly declines with the decrease of net heating rate. And eventually, the temperature becomes a constant because the net heating is maintained at a stable level.</p><p>We also display the angular slices of the density and velocity at the different radii in</p><p>Figures 10-12. For comparison, the winds of one-dimensional radiative transfer are also included (solid lines). Seen from <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, the difference in the number density between one-and two-dimensional cases is clear. The total number densities of the two-dimensional radiative transfer are much less than those of one-dimensional radiative transfer, by a factor of 2-10 (depend on θ). Thus, the mass loss rate also decreases a factor of 4, only 4.3 × 10 9 g s −1 .</p><p>The changes of radial velocity with the angles demonstrate different features between the upper and lower atmospheres. In the upper atmosphere (r/R p = 4 and 7), the radial velocities decline with an increase in angle but rise at θ = 90 • again (the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). The minimum and maximum radial velocities at r/R p = 7 are 4 (θ ≈ 90 • ) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">21(θ ≈ 0 • ) km s −1 , respectively.</formula><p>In comparing with the case of one-dimensional radiative transfer, the differences decrease with an increase of radius.</p><p>However, we also note that the radial velocities at r/R p = 2 almost decline to zero with an increase of θ in the case of two-dimensional radiative transfer. Moreover, the complex behaviors at r/R p =1.5 reflect the difference between two-with one-dimension radiative transfer (the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). This can be attributed to the effect of optical depth.</p><p>At r/R p ≈ 1.5 and 2, the optical depths can vary few order of magnitude from the day side to the night side, thus the processes of radiative transfer play an important role.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 12</ref>, interesting trends in the angular velocity can be found. First, for both one-and two-dimensional radiative transfers, the meridional velocities show the sine-like profile in the middle-upper atmosphere (the left of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 12</ref>) and are always negative (positive) if θ is smaller (greater) than π/2. In contrast, the meridional velocities are always positive at small radii for the case of two-dimensional radiative transfer (the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 12</ref>), which reflects the transfer of mass and energy from the day side to the night side. Second, the meridional velocities are comparable with (or even large than) the radial velocities in the middle-high latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. Third, the meridional velocities dominant the velocity field in the base of the wind for the case of two-dimensional radiative transfer, but we have not found similar phenomena in the case of of one-dimensional radiative transfer.</p><p>Therefore, from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figures 7-12</ref>, we can conclude that the two-dimensional radiative transfer prominently affects the properties of flow. The influence of velocity field is remarkable at the base of the wind. Due to the large optical depth on the night side, the density decrease a factor of few so that the mass loss rate is a factor of 4 lower than that of one-dimensional radiative transfer. However, the atmosphere becomes transparent with an increase in the radius so that there is moderate difference in the upper atmosphere between the one-and two-dimensional radiative transfer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Boundary conditions</head><p>So far, our models used P Rp =1 dyn cm −2 to calculate the mass loss from the surface of the planet. It is unclear what the suitable lower boundary is? Here we have also computed a model in which the lower boundary is set to P Rp =10 dyn cm −2 . As expected, the mass loss rates are higher than those in the cases of P Rp =1 dyn cm −2 . Specially, the mass loss rates enhance 40-70% for the all cases (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.). This hints that the mass loss rates are very sensitive to lower boundary conditions, and same conclusion has also been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Penz et al. (2008)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, a possible cause that can lead to the reduction of mass loss rate is the day-night temperature contrasts at the lower boundary. Theoretical studies have shown that the day-night temperature contrasts (300K or more) are likely to occur in the planetary photospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Showman &amp; Guillot 2002)</ref>. These predictions are also verified by the observed surface temperature distribution of HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>In the above calculations, we used the same temperature over the lower boundary.</p><p>In order to further discuss the influence of day-night temperature contrasts, we set the temperature at the lower boundary to</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">T (R p , θ) =    1500K, (θ 90 • ) 1500K max(0.5, sin θ), (θ &gt; 90 • ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Dependence of ˙ M on Stellar Activities</head><p>The Swift XRT light curve of HD189733 shows that the escaping hydrogen is observed when the star exhibits a bright flare that occurrs about 8 hours before the planetary transit (Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Etangs et al. 2012</ref>), which implies a possible correlation between the high level of stellar activity and the atmospheric escape of hydrogen. Thus, we also calculated the cases with high level of stellar activity (with a solar proxy P 10.7 = 200). For the high activity, the whole EUV flux is about 2.5 times of the low activity. Our calculations show that the mass loss rates produced by high activity are a factor of 5-10 higher than those of low activity, and the temperatures predicted are also higher. By comparing the structures of wind, we found that the model with higher stellar activity predicted higher radial velocity, and the ratios between meridional and radial velocity are lower. Evidently, higher activities supply more UV radiations, especially in the band of higher energy (note that the increases of photon energy are not linear with frequency between the low and high stellar activity).</p><p>More high energy photons mean that the deeper base of the atmosphere can be heated, and the hydrodynamic escape parameter, λ = GMpµ RpkT (µ is mean mass per particle), can decrease to a lower value at deeper atmosphere. Thus gas pressure drives a faster expanding atmosphere and partly counteracts the effect of the optical depth. It explains the reason why the ratio of mass loss rate is only 2.4 for model 8 and 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Comparison with Observations</head><p>An interesting issue is which mass loss rate predicted by our model is supported by the observations.

First, they estimated a mass loss rate of 1-10×10 10 g s −1 , which is higher than our result. Second, in order to fit the observations, they estimated a number density of 2.6× 10 7 cm −3 for hydrogen atoms at r=2.9R p . However, we found that the number densities of hydrogen atoms in our model are about 10 5 -10 6 cm −3 at r=2.9R p (depend on θ), and the number density distributions of hydrogen atoms show clear variations from the day-side to night-side (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure. 13</ref>).

Thus, one-dimensional models are not accurate enough in calculating the HI transit depth. Our results can be applied further to check if the upper atmosphere contributes significant absorption. exists still a few key problems to be solved, such as the proper descriptions to radiative transfer and charge-exchange reactions between the planetary and stellar wind particles.</p></div>

In the case of tidal locking, we found that the wind is controlled by meridional velocity in the regions of r/R p ∼ 1.5.

The mass loss rates are affected by both two-dimensional radiative transfer and hydrodynamics.

In the continuity equation, the sources and sinks to the particle flux density are due to photoionization and recombination. In energy equation, the sources and sinks are heating and cooling, respectively. The heating processes in the mixed flows are complex. The models of Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Paper I in which the heating from the host stars is simplified to a single photon of 20 ev predicted reasonable mass loss rates. However, the assumption of single photon energy could miss some important physical processes, such as the penetration of higher energy photons deeper in the atmosphere. In fact, the stellar radiation ionizes the species to produce high-energy photoelectrons that share their energy with other species via collisions. The heating of exoplanet atmospheres mainly comes from photoelectrons produced by photoionization, therefore, here we included EUV irradiance shortward of 912 ˚ A, namely, the threshold value of photoionization in hydrogen atoms.</figDesc></figure>

Subsequent 1D models also support this. However, the influences of two-dimension and charge exchange between the stellar wind and the planetary escaping exosphere were neglected by all the 1D models. Recently, Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2012) updated the mass loss rate to 10 9 g s −1 for the atmospheric escape of HD 189733b though the previous mass loss rate requested in their model is in the order of magnitude of 10 9 -10 11 g s −1 . Moreover, Holmström et al. (2008) found that a mass loss rate of 7 × 10 8 g s −1 can explain the observations of HD 209458b when the charge exchange is included. We must be careful in the interpretation of mass loss rates because only atomic hydrogen contributes to the excess absorption of Ly α. In our models, the mass loss rates of atomic hydrogen are 3.78 × 10 8 g s −1 , 9.85 × 10 8 g s −1 , 7.60 × 10 9 g s −1 and 1.45 × 10 10 g s −1 for models 9-12, respectively. If the charge exchange indeed results in the excess absorption of Ly α, our results favor the low activity for HD 209458 when it is transited by HD 209458b. However, the possibility that planetary origin hydrogen result in excess absorption of Ly α cannot be excluded because Koskinen et al. (2010) explained this by solely absorption in the upper atmosphere based on the 1D assumption.
