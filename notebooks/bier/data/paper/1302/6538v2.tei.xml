				<p>The equations of gas dynamics are extensively used to describe atmospheric loss from solar system bodies and exoplanets even though the boundary conditions at infinity are not uniquely defined. Using molecular-kinetic simulations that correctly treat the transition from the continuum to the rarefied region, we confirm that the energy-limited escape approximation is valid when adiabatic expansion is the dominant cooling process. However, this does not imply that the outflow goes sonic. In fact in the sonic regime, the energy limited approximation can significantly under estimate the escape rate. Rather large escape rates and concomitant adiabatic cooling can produce atmospheres with subsonic flow that are highly extended. Since this affects the heating rate of the upper atmosphere and the interaction with external fields and plasmas, we give a criterion for estimating when the outflow goes transonic in the continuum region. This is applied to early terrestrial atmospheres, exoplanet atmospheres, and the atmosphere of the ex-planet, Pluto, all of which have large escape rates. The paper and its erratum, combined here, are published: ApJL 768, L4 (2013); ApJ, 779, L30 (2013). Introduction Rapid atmospheric escape is often described as a gas that goes sonic, sometimes called blow-off (Hunten 1982), a process that can account for certain isotope ratios on terrestrial planets. Transonic models have also been used to describe rapid escape from exoplanets (e.g., Murray-Clay et al. 2009) and from Pluto (e.g., Strobel 2008). However, we recently showed that this model for Pluto gave an incorrect upper atmospheric structure (Tucker et al. 2012; Erwin et al. 2013). In simulating rapid escape using continuum gas dynamics, the Jeans expressions at the exobase have been applied for the uncertain boundary conditions at infinity (e.g., Tian et al. 2008). More often, a sonic point is assumed to occur at some altitude, above which the density and temperature dependence can be simply characterized (Parker 1964a,b). The so-called energy-limited escape rate, extensively applied to exoplanet atmospheres (e.g., Lammer et al. 2009), is often assumed to imply that sonic boundary conditions are applicable (e.g., Erkaev et al. 2012). Here we use molecular-kinetic simulations to show that is not the case. We briefly review the continuum and molecular-kinetic models, and then present results of our simulations. These test the applicability of the energy-limited escape rate and our proposed criterion for determining whether sonic or kinetic upper boundary conditions are applicable. The results are applied to escape from Pluto, early terrestrial planet, and exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models</head><p>We describe escape from a one-dimensional (1D), steady state, single component atmosphere as illustrative, leaving out thermal transport by horizontal flow. For radial distance , flow speed , number density , temperature , pressure and escape rate Φ Φ 444 const, the momentum and energy equations are often used ignoring viscosity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">/2 --- (1) ΦΦΦΦ /2 2 2 444 κ 444 (2)</formula><p>Here is the Boltzmann constant, κ κ the thermal conductivity, the specific heat at constant pressure, the molecular mass, // the gravitational energy ( the gravitational constant, the planet's mass), and is the net heating rate per molecule produced by incident photons or plasma particles, in which we include radiative cooling. Knowing the density, , and temperature, , at a lower boundary, , a unique solution requires two other conditions, typically at the upper boundary. The gravitational energy is characterized by the Jeans parameter, λ() and the rarefaction by the Knudsen number, //, the ratio of the mean free path of gas molecules, , to the local scale height, For an escaping gas at large distances from the source, where free molecular flow occurs, → →/2; in the hydrostatic regime → →/λ(r).</p><p>The Jeans expressions for the number, Φ , and thermal, 〈Φ〉 , escape rates have been used as upper boundary conditions for Equations (1-2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Φ 444 1 1 1 exp (3a) 〈Φ〉 Φ (3b)</formula><p>The subscript 'x' indicates quantities evaluated at the nominal exobase, , where 1, often assumed to be the upper boundary of the continuum region. When the upper atmosphere heating rate is large, the equations are more often solved through a sonic point, * , where * ( γ// the sound speed, γ // , the specific heat at constant volume). For ≫ ≫ * , and decay as power laws (Parker 1964a,b). Unfortunately those continuum solutions for which Jeans escape is applicable and those for which a sonic point is reached in the continuum region do not simply track from one to the other as the heating rate increases.</p><p>Kinetic models can simulate both continuum ≪ ≪≪ and non-continuum (transitional, ~~, and free molecular, ≫ ≫≫ gas flows and can, therefore, describe the change from Jeans-like to transonic escape. Since such simulations track particles in the potential well of the body (or bodies) of interest, escape is a natural outcome. We numerically implement a kinetic description of rarefied gas flow in an upper atmosphere based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bird 1994)</ref>. In this method, the gas flow is represented by a large set of representative atoms or molecules that are tracked subject to binary collisions and gravity <ref type="bibr">(Volkov 2011a,b)</ref>. Heating of the atmosphere is implemented by scaling the thermal velocities of the representative molecules according to the local energy deposition rate.</p><p>The lower boundary of the simulation region, , is below the depth at which the UV/EUV or plasma energy deposition occurs and ≪ 1. Because the density drops rapidly with increasing , but escape occurs at large where the density is low, DSMC simulations starting at small ) can require an enormous number of particles to accurately describe escape. Therefore, we also use a hybrid continuum/kinetic model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tucker et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. 2013</ref>) in which the Equations (1-2) are solved at ~0.1 1 0.01, where the gas is collisionally dominated, and the velocity and internal energy distributions are reasonably well represented by Maxwellians, and then iteratively couple it to a DSMC simulation in the rarefied region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heating</head><p>Parker (1964a,b) used Equations (1-2) to describe escape when the dominant heat source is internal, as it is for expansion of the solar corona: i.e., 0 for . This model was subsequently applied to planetary atmospheres primarily heated at . For Jeans parameters at as large as λ( )=λ ~ 40, such models were assumed to produce a transonic expansion, often referred to as 'slow hydrodynamic escape' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Strobel 2008)</ref>. Although, rapid escape can occur for relatively largeλ and ≪ 1, for λ ~~~ the gas does not go sonic in the collision-dominated region and the escape rate is a factor of a few larger than the Jeans rate ( <ref type="bibr">Volkov et al. 2011a,b)</ref>. Ignoring the thermal conductivity in Equation (2), this corresponds to the enthalpy of fluid particles becoming sufficient to produce a transonic, isentropic expansion starting at r 0 . For smaller λ a non-equilibrium region, called a Knudsen layer, forms above and there is a steep transition with decreasing λ to supersonic escape at λ ~2.1 and ~2.8-3.5 for monatomic and diatomic gases respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Volkov &amp; Johnson 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In an upper atmosphere heated by short wavelength radiation, or by incident plasma particles, escape is driven by the energy absorbed. Energy absorbed below ~0.1 is typically converted to heat using an efficiency, ε, that depends on the radiation type and atmospheric composition. The heating rate is either directly calculated or a value of ε is estimated: often a constant 5 0.4) up to the exobase where it goes to zero. Typically the gas-dynamic equations for exoplanet or early terrestrial atmospheres are then solved with Jeans-like or sonic upper boundary conditions. As discussed below, we used a hybrid continuum/DSMC model to describe escape from Pluto heated by the solar UV/EUV and a DSMC model to describe escape from an atmosphere in which, the heating is assumed to occur in a narrow layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Energy Limited Escape</head><p>Because thermal conduction in the upper atmosphere is inefficient, adiabatic cooling by escape or horizontal transport often dominates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. 2013</ref>). For a globally averaged heating rate and adiabatic cooling, integration of Equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> gives a rough upper bound to the escape rate, Φ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lammer et al. 2009</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Φ /// /22| .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the denominator is the difference in the average energy of a molecule between the lower, , and upper, , boundaries of the simulation. In Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(4)</ref> is assumed to be below the heated region, above which adiabatic cooling dominates; 44</p><p>is the integrated heating + radiative cooling rate. This expression is often referred to as the energy-limited rate, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Watson et al. (1981)</ref> discussed a related quantity. For deep in the gravitational well and λ ≫ ≫ , Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(4)</ref> is often approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Φ //// .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Assuming a small fraction of is deposited for ~0.1 , so non-thermal escape processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Johnson et al. 2008</ref>) can be ignored, we showed that UV/EUV heating of Pluto's atmosphere resulted in an escape rate very close to that in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(5)</ref>, but the gas did not go sonic below the exobase. Rather, a large expansion of the upper atmosphere occurred ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tucker et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. 2013</ref>). Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tian et al. (2008)</ref> found that above a heating threshold, the atmosphere rapidly expanded and the escape rate increased with increasing EUV heating, consistent with energy-limited escape, even though the gas remained subsonic. Therefore, the energy limited escape rate is not contingent on the flow going sonic below the exobase. If the heating rate is increased to the point where the atmosphere does go sonic in the continuum region, energy limited escape can still apply if one accounts for the large , enhanced radiative cooling, recombination in an ionized atmosphere, etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for Transonic Solutions</head><p>Since the isentropic approximation and energy-limited escape are applicable to both sub-sonic and transonic rapid outflows, we use the Mach number, /γγγ//, and rewrite Equation (5):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">444 (6)</formula><p>Because the boundary conditions for sub-sonic and transonic solutions differ, it is important to be able to estimate the minimum value of required to apply sonic boundary conditions, which we will call . Assuming the sonic point, * , occurs in the continuum region, the flow can be effectively approximated by the isentropic model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">222 * * γ 11 * * * .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>(e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>). For * 0 Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(7)</ref> reduces to λ( * )=λ * 22 and transonic escape occurs when 1 in Equation <ref type="formula">(6)</ref> giving:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">444 * * * ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with * * . Below we estimate and test it against molecular kinetic simulations. We first consider a narrow heating layer located at with ≪ 1, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Watson et al. (1981)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McNutt (1989)</ref>, and give an approximate analytic solution to Equations <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> </p><note type="other">in the Appendix. For this case, we performed DSMC simulations for a monatomic gas of hard spheres with λ 10, 10 , // 1.1. Although the results can be roughly scaled, the simulation results shown in Figures 1 and 2 are for an N 2 atmosphere with hard sphere collision diameter 4.76610 , planet mass 4.45510 , 10 , 0.993310 // , and 1000 . For 0, we showed earlier that these conditions correspond to enhanced Jeans-like escape with Φ Φ 1.6Φ (Volkov et al. 2011a,b) which for our simulation parameters is ~0.7710 Φ , where Φ is the upward flow across the lower boundary of the simulation, : Φ 444 /2222 .. .</note><p>Increasing to find when the outflow goes sonic in the continuum regime, it is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> that for ≫ 0 a non-equilibrium layer forms near in which the parallel and perpendicular components of temperature differ. For small the flow properties in this layer are analogous to those in the Knudsen layer discussed above for heating below . Near the density and temperature change dramatically but the pressure from to ~~ can be estimated from the hydrostatic approximation. When the outflow goes sonic, a pressure drop occurs from ~ to * : * // (Volkov and Johnson 2013). Since the transition layer is narrow, * , we rewrite Equation (8) using values at :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">〈Φ〉 (9)</formula><p>Here Φ Φ 222 Φ 444</p><p>222 //// .. is the upward Maxwellian energy flux of molecules leaving the source at . When the effects of thermal conduction are small relative to adiabatic cooling, then Equation (9) can be derived from the analytic expression in the Appendix. The barometric equation gives // expλ // 111 with depending on the number of degrees of freedom: ~0.4 for a monatomic gas. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the transition to supersonic flow occurs for 0.46 6 // 0.67 with Q ~4.5510 in Equation 9 for our simulation parameters. Due to the above approximations, Equation (9) overestimates by about a factor of two. It is also seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c) that for the subsonic solution increases slowly for ≫ ≫ , resulting in a significantly expanded atmosphere, but for the transonic solution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(e) roughly decreases as a power law consistent with transonic escape. As important, the escape rate increases dramatically above 0 and becomes close to Φ in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(5)</ref> in the subsonic regime as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Although Φ does not change significantly in the transition to transonic escape, a steep increase is seen in the thermal + flow energy removed, Φ. It is also seen that additional heating primarily increases the average kinetic energy of escaping molecules so that Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(5)</ref> becomes a poor approximation if ≫ ≫ . For very large Q in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> the escape rate is limited to a fraction of Φ and Φ Φ approaches Q . For small Q downward thermal conduction affects the escape rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. 2013</ref>), which is eventually driven by the temperature at . We now consider more realistic heating profiles. In order to apply sonic boundary conditions in Equations (1-2), * must be in the continuum region below some maximum, : i.e., * * // * . Using * ~ * // * and * 1/// * , where is determined by the energy dependence of the total collision cross section (e.g., √2 , for the gas of hard sphere molecules of diameter d), then 22/// * * . From Equation (8), we estimate requiring as that * occurs in the continuum domain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">444 * * ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where * . When there is a sharp change in the gas properties, as for the heated layers discussed above, then ~ 0.1 (Volkov and Johnson 2013). However, if the heat is primarily absorbed over a board range of below , then ~ 1 is sufficient. It is seen in Equation 10 that does not explicitly depend on , consistent with simulations when Φ is large. Because depends on the sonic point only via * // , a rough lower bound can be obtained by replacing * with the mean energy absorption depth, estimated from the absorption cross section, . More accurately, at threshold the sonic point approaches so that * ~~ 1 1 11 // where ~~~ 222/2 slightly increasing . For a close-in exoplanet, tidal heating can be included in and ion escape can dominate so that becomes large due to ion-neutral or ionion collisions reducing .</p><p>For solar minimum, medium, and maximum conditions we simulated Pluto's upper atmosphere at the New Horizons encounter using our hybrid fluid/kinetic model ignoring the interaction with the solar wind and Charon, as well as non-thermal escape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. 2013</ref>). For all three cases ( = 0.38, 0.78, ~1.6x10 8 W) the atmosphere became highly extended, but the flow remained subsonic contrary to all earlier models (e.g., Strobel 2008) with the escape rate close to the energy-limited estimate in Equation (4). It is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> that at solar medium is more than twice that obtained when sonic boundary conditions are applied and, although the escape rate is large, using the Jeans boundary conditions results a much better approximation to the upper atmosphere structure. For UV/EUV absorption at ~1.5 times Pluto's radius, , using ~1 to get a very rough lower bound and * ~~ ~~ , Equation <ref type="formula">(9)</ref> gives ≫ ~10 10 . This is  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 10 10 11 10 12 10 13 10 14 10 15 10 16 10 17 10 18</ref> Density (m − 3 )</p><p>well above the largest heating rate (~1.6x10 8 W) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al. (2013)</ref>. Therefore, Pluto's atmosphere at the New Horizon encounter will be highly extended with an escape rate very close to the energy-limited rate, but the flow in the continuum region will be subsonic.</p><p>In order to further test Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(10)</ref>, we performed DSMC simulations with a distributed heating model in which, for simplicity, we used Beer's law along the radial direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>): ε //// exp , where , ε, and are the absorption cross section, the heating efficiency and solar energy flux at the upper boundary of our domain, , and ̅ ̅ , with constant out to . The transition to a transonic solution with * in the continuum region of the atmosphere was found to occur at 0.69 9 9 // 1.6, in agreement with our criterion calculated from Equation (10). The threshold for transonic flow can be related to the absorbed energy converted to heat, , by accounting for the non-adiabatic cooling processes, , : ~~ (Erwin et al. 2013, <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref>). If is small, writing ~ επ , then Φ in Equation (5) can be roughly scaled by the luminosity if the solutions are subsonic or do not significantly exceed . Because the atmospheric expansion affects , iterative solutions can improve estimates of . Ignoring this, we note that for an early earth-like upper atmosphere dominated by N or O, a solar EUV flux more than 100 times the present would be required for the escaping gas to go sonic in the continuum regime using data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tian et al. (2008)</ref> in Equation (10). It is, therefore, unlikely that escape from such an atmosphere on a super-earth in the habitable zone would have a sonic point in the continuum regime. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lammer et al. (2013)</ref> calculated the escape rate from a hydrogen atom thermosphere due to XUV radiation on super-earths observed orbiting close to their star. They used Parker's upper boundary conditions to solve the continuum equations and then decided that blow-off occurred if 3/2 (Öpik 1963). Rather than solving these equations and then deciding whether the sonic or Jeans conditions should have been used, Equation (10) can be used to estimate whether a sonic point might occur in the continuum regime for a given . For example, using ~1 and * ~~ we find that ~ 0.6 10 W and 2.5510 W for Kepler11b and 11c respectively, using data in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lammer et al. (2013)</ref>. These values can be compared to their heating rates obtained using ε 0.15: ~1.2 and 0.3x10 W respectively. For this ε, Kepler11b has a sonic point in the continuum region, whereas Kepler11c does not ). Therefore, Φ in Equation (5) is most applicable to Kepler11c which requires kinetic, not sonic, boundary conditions to obtain for an accurate description of its upper atmosphere. Of course, increasing ε or reducing the gravitational energy due to the tides can change this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>We have used results from DSMC simulations to show that the oft-used energy limited rate in Equation (5) for an isentropic expansion of a heated upper atmosphere is most reasonable for a subsonic expansion with a large escape rate. The accuracy depends on how well one estimates . Conversely, agreement with the energy limited escape rate does not imply that sonic boundary conditions are applicable to continuum models of thermal escape. In fact the simple approximation in Equation (5) becomes less good with increasing above as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Although the size of the escape rate might not be strongly dependent on whether sonic, Jeans, or kinetic boundary conditions are used, the upper atmosphere can be significantly affected as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Therefore, past applications Parker's (1964a,b) model have led to incorrect descriptions of the upper atmosphere when rapid escape occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Tucker and Johnson 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tucker et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erwin et al 2013)</ref>. Since the upper atmosphere structure affects the interaction of the escaping gas with the ambient plasma and with neighboring bodies, we have given an expression in Equation (10) to estimate when sonic boundary conditions are likely to be applicable in calculating the escape from and the expansion of the upper atmosphere of a planetary body.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
