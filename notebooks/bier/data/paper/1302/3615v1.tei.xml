			<abstract>
				<p>Exoplanets have been observed at many stages of their host star&apos;s life, including the main sequence (MS), subgiant and red giant branch stages. Also, polluted white dwarfs (WDs) likely represent dynamically active systems at late times. Here, we perform 3-body simulations which include realistic post-MS stellar mass loss and span the entire lifetime of exosystems with two massive planets, from the endpoint of formation to several Gyr into the WD phase of the host star. We find that both MS and WD systems experience ejections and star-planet collisions (Lagrange instability) even if the planet-planet separation well-exceeds the analytical orbit-crossing (Hill instability) boundary. Consequently, MS-stable planets do not need to be closely-packed to experience instability during the WD phase. This instability may pollute the WD directly through collisions, or, more likely, indirectly through increased scattering of smaller bodies such as asteroids or comets. Our simulations show that this instability occurs predominately between tens of Myr to a few Gyrs of WD cooling.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A planet's life may be split into four distinct stages: 1) formation and concurrent dynamical excitation, 2) main sequence (MS) evolution, 3) evolution during post-MS stellar phase changes, and 4) white dwarf (WD) evolution. The first stage generally lasts no longer than 0.1% of the entire MS lifetime. The second stage is relatively dynamically quiescent, with only occasional but often important scattering interactions. In the third stage, the planet is subject to dynamical changes due to the star's violent actions as it becomes a giant. In the final stage, the star has become a WD, and the planet again enters and remains in a phase of relative dynamical quiescence occasionally punctuated by scattering interactions or external forcing. This general picture, which does not include possibilities such as the capture of free-floating planets, planetary destruction due to supernovae, or multiple host stars, describes the life cycle of the vast majority of known exoplanets. first two stages dwarfs the literature describing the final two stages, despite the fact that the Universe is already over 13.5 Gyr old ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jarosik et al. 2011</ref>) and that the Milky Way contains about 10 9 WDs <ref type="bibr">(Binney &amp; Tremaine 2008, Pgs. 2-3 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Holberg et al. 2008</ref>).

We combine stellar evolution with planetary gravitational scattering amongst multiple massive planets, and extend the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Debes &amp; Sigurdsson (2002)</ref> by considering full-lifetime simulations with realistic mass loss prescriptions at each post-MS phase. Following the evolution over the whole stellar lifetime means that we can be sure that systems whose stability is investigated on the giant and WD stages will have survived the long MS evolution. Through these integrations, we can determine what types of planetary architectures might be expected in exoplanet-hosting WD systems, and could allow us to extrapolate backwards in time from observed WD systems. We restrict our explorations to two-planet systems in this initial study given the vast phase space to explore; three-planet simulations will be presented in a follow-up paper. First, we briefly summarize our knowledge of planetary instability for one-and two-planet systems during the MS (Subsection 1.1) and post-MS (Subsection 1.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Instability in Main Sequence Planetary Systems</head><p>Dynamical instability in planetary systems is often said to occur when a planet suffers a close encounter with the star or another planet, or is ejected from the system. Occasionally, investigators use stricter definitions of instability, such as when the semimajor axis or eccentricity variation of a planet exceeds a certain per cent of its nominal value. Additionally, a wide body of literature has arisen characterizing chaotic orbits as a precursor to instability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Darriba et al. (2012)</ref> and references therein summarize many of these techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">One-Planet Instability</head><p>One planet orbiting a MS star will typically remain stable throughout the star's MS lifetime in the absence of external forces. Exceptions may include planets which are close enough to their parent stars to be tidally disrupted (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gu et al. 2003</ref>) and possibly evaporated (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Guillot et al. 1996</ref>). In the opposite extreme, a planet which is far enough away from its parent star may be ejected due to external forces such as passing stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Zakamska &amp; Tremaine 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Veras &amp; Moeckel 2012</ref>) or achieve a high enough eccentricity through Galactic tides to cause a collision with the star (Veras &amp; Evans 2013a,b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Two-Planet Instability</head><p>In addition to tidal interactions and external forces, the mutual perturbations between two planets may also create instability. Partially motivated by tractable analytical solutions to the general three-body problem, the source of this instability has been studied extensively. If the orbits of two planets are guaranteed to never overlap (precluding a collision between both planets), then they are said to be "Hill stable". <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gladman (1993)</ref> pioneered the analytic use of Hill stability for planetary systems in specific cases and has motivated many subsequent analyses, as recently summarized by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Donnison (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donnison ( , 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr">Donnison ( ,b, 2011</ref>). Hill stability does not guarantee that the outer planet remains bound to the system, nor does it prevent the inner planet from colliding with the star. If both planets remain bound and retain their ordering, and no collision with the star occurs, then the system is "Lagrange stable" 1 . Unlike Hill stability, Lagrange stability does not benefit from a known analytical formulation, but rather empirical estimates based on numerical simulations.</p><p>The analytical Hill stability boundary is conservative. Two planets whose initial separation is less than the Hill stable distance may in fact remain stable. If the initial separation is greater than the Hill stable distance, then the planets are guaranteed to retain their ordering. In simulations of the HD 12661 and 47 Uma systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes &amp; Greenberg (2006)</ref> found that pairs of planets close to the Hill stability boundary are not Lagrange stable, and hence are not generally stable. They tentatively suggest that the Lagrange stability boundary exceeds the Hill stable boundary by at least 21% as measured by the semimajor axis ratio. Subsequent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnes &amp; Greenberg 2007)</ref> revealed how mean motion commensurabilities can broaden the divide between the Hill and Lagrange stable boundaries; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kopparapu &amp; Barnes (2010)</ref> demonstrated how the boundary between stable and unstable systems is not sharp. Hence, numerical validation of analytical stability estimates is crucial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Instability in Post-Main Sequence Planetary Systems</head><p>Mass loss from a dying star can trigger planetary instability in different ways, which are outlined below. A common assumption amongst the studies which have considered instabilities in post-MS systems is isotropic stellar mass loss. We also adopt this assumption here, as modelling non-isotropic mass loss would significantly complicate both numerical and analytical modelling and is best left to separate, dedicated studies. One such dedicated post-MS study <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Parriott &amp; Alcock 1998</ref>) importantly observes that the speed of (effectively massless) comets near the boundary of a planetary system may be comparable to the recoil velocity of the parent star due to asymmetric mass loss. That study suggests that anisotropic mass loss will affect the details of planets being ejected after scattering but is unlikely to have a significant effect on the prior dynamics. Other studies modelling planetary dynamics due to non-isotropic mass loss instead focus on jet accelerations present at the birth sites of planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Namouni 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Namouni , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Namouni , 2012</ref>. Further, in all cases we assume the planets are orbiting a single star. Extensions to the multiple-star case <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kratter &amp; Perets 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Portegies Zwart 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Veras &amp; Tout 2012</ref>) are likely to be nontrivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">One-Planet Instability</head><p>For decades, binary star investigations revealed that stellar mass loss causes orbital semimajor axis expansion. Less well-known is that when the mass loss is rapid enough, the eccentricity of the companion's orbit can change as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Omarov 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hadjidemetriou 1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hadjidemetriou , 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Veras et al. 2011</ref>). If the eccentricity is great enough, a planetary companion may escape from the system.</p><p>In the more commonly-used adiabatic limit, de/dt = 0 and da/dt = − (a/µ) (dµ/dt). Here, µ ≡ G (M⋆ + Mp), M⋆ and Mp are the masses of the star and planet, a is the planet's semimajor axis, and e is the planet's eccentricity. This limit holds when the mass loss timescale is much longer than the orbital timescale. Adiabaticity will be broken, even briefly, if at any point a sudden burst of mass loss causes the timescales to become comparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Veras &amp; Tout 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Veras &amp; Wyatt 2012)</ref>. Hence, characterizing whether or not planetary evolution is adiabatic amidst mass loss will be important for any post-MS scattering study.</p><p>Another source of instability for one-planet systems could come from tidal orbital decay and potentially direct engulfment by the rapidly expanding stellar envelope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Villaver &amp; Livio (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, 2009</ref> and Villaver (2011) treat this effect in detail with additional physics such as frictional drag, planet accretion and planet evaporation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mustill &amp; Villaver (2012)</ref> model individual thermal pulses and demonstrate how they affect planetary stability. In this study, we only consider planets that are too distant to be affected by the stellar envelope expansion and so are not affected by tides, accretion or evaporation (see Section 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2">Two-Planet Instability</head><p>Debes &amp; Sigurdsson (2002) considered adiabatic evolution of two-planet systems while exposed to a 1M⊙ star losing half of its mass over 1000 planetary orbits. This foundational study considered circular and coplanar equal mass planets, with planet/star mass ratios ranging from 10 −3 to 10 −7 . They discovered importantly that although adiabatic evolution causes both planets to move outward and maintain their initial semimajor axis ratio, their critical Hill separation changes.</p><p>The rate of change of the separation measured in units of Hill's radii is equal to µ −2/3 dµ/dt. This dependence causes previously Hill stable planetary systems to become unstable, and incite gravitational scattering which could not occur on the MS. Their simulation results suggest that scattering instabilities may be more widespread during post-MS evolution than during MS evolution. Here, we investigate this claim in significant detail. For discussion on the high mass-loss non-adibatic multi-planet case recently presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Voyatzis et al. (2013)</ref>, please see Section 6.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Paper Outline</head><p>We begin in Section 2 with a description of the challenges of using N-body numerical simulations for gravitational scattering amidst mass loss. In Section 3 we determine the regimes where engulfment and tides from stellar envelope expansion can be neglected for this study. Section 4 presents a general formulation of the Hill stability limit and shows how it changes due to stellar mass loss. We use the results of Sections 2-4 to motivate the setup for our numerical scattering simulations. In Section 5, we perform these simulations, and report the results. We discuss the consequences in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">NUMERICAL CONVERGENCE</head><p>In this section, we highlight the difficulty in achieving accurate N-body simulations that model both central star mass loss and gravitational scattering amongst multiple massive planets, and implement a solution.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Difference between interpolating SSE-outputted mass at every Mercury timestep (blue circles) versus interpolating this mass within Mercury timesteps (orange squares). "Spliced" indicates the latter and "Not Spliced" indicates the former. Shown are the final values of the inner planet's semimajor axis for a pair of 0.001M ⊙ -planets with initial semimajor axes of 10 AU and 30 AU, and initial eccentricities of 0.0 and 0.5, respectively. The parent Solar-metallicity star was modeled to lose ≈ 6.22M ⊙ of its initial ≈ 7.66M ⊙ at the start of an asymptotic giant branch phase lasting almost 5 × 10 5 yr. The "Analytical" line refers to the final semimajor axis of the inner planet predicted by adibatic mass loss. The convergence properties of the spliced BS integrator for systems with both gravitational scattering and mass loss is a significant improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Stellar Evolution Code</head><p>We utilize the SSE stellar evolution code <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hurley et al. 2000)</ref>, which adopts empirically-derived algebraic formulations in order to quickly generate a stellar evolutionary track solely from a given progenitor mass and metallicity, and stellar model parameters such as the Reimers mass-loss coefficient. We use the same mass loss prescriptions as described in Section 7.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hurley et al. (2000)</ref> with their Reimers mass-loss coefficient default value of 0.5. Their choice is observationally motivated by the Horizontal Branch morphology in Galactic globular clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Iben &amp; Renzini 1983)</ref>, and lies in the center of the range recently considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Veras &amp; Wyatt (2012)</ref>, who discuss this choice in light of an updated version of the Reimers law <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Schröder &amp; Cuntz 2005</ref>). The SSE code allows us to sample many different evolutionary tracks easily, and outputs the important parameters, M⋆(t) and R⋆(t), where R⋆ is the radius of the star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Planetary Evolution Code</head><p>We also use the Mercury integration package (Chambers 1999), which specializes in modeling planetary dynamical evolution. In order to accurately model close encounters between planets and the parent star -a necessity for this study -we use the Bulirsch-Stoer (BS) integrator. This integrator features an adaptive timestep, which is determined by a tolerance parameter given at the start of the simulation. A tolerance of 10 −12 is considered to be highly accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Smaller tolerance values should roughly converge to the same result; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7b</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Smith &amp; Lissauer (2009)</ref> demonstrates that in crowded 5-planet systems separated by several Hill radii, toler-ances of 10 −12 , 10 −13 , 10 −14 , 10 −15 and 10 −16 will yield instability timescales which are all within the same order of magnitude. Tolerances below 10 −16 generally cannot be achieved because in those cases the accuracy requested is greater than machine precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Merging Both Codes</head><p>Veras et al. <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> found that linearly interpolating SSE stellar mass output at each Mercury timestep adequately models the dynamical evolution of a single planet amidst stellar mass loss because the numerical simulations reproduced the analytical results. For multi-planet systems, this technique alone is inadequate. The interaction between both planets coupled with stellar mass loss causes a failure of convergence of orbital parameters as the tolerance is decreased.</p><p>In order to improve the accuracy, we have performed an additional interpolation of the SSE stellar mass output in between each Mercury timestep at each BS substep. The resulting finer gradation makes a crucial difference, as demonstrated by <ref type="figure">Fig.  1</ref>. The figure plots the final semimajor axis values for the inner 10 −3 M⊙ planet and the outer 10 −3 M⊙ planet in a system with initial semimajor axes of 10 AU and 30 AU, and initial eccentricities of 0.0, 0.5, respectively. All initial orbital angles were set to 0 • . The simulations were run for the entire evolution of the Thermally Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TPAGB) phase of a Z=Z⊙ = 0.02 (Solar metallicity) star. We chose a progenitor mass of 8M⊙ to model particularly violent mass loss. Our simulations ran during the TPAGB phase only, when M⋆ was reduced from 7.659M⊙ to 1.438M⊙ in about 492,744 yr.</p><p>The plot contains two curves from the simulation output, representing final values of the semimajor axis due to SSEoutputted mass interpolation at each Mercury timestep (blue circles; "non-spliced"), and with an additional interpolation inbetween timesteps (orange squares; "spliced"). The third, green, curve is the analytic prediction for the final semimajor axis of the inner planet. This value can be determined because the mass loss is adiabatic and the planets are not near a strong mean motion commensurability (hence their semimajor axes remain secularly unaffected).</p><p>Without the additional interpolation, the results do not appear to converge until perhaps at the machine precision limit for the BS tolerance 2 . Further, the extent of the variance in the non-spliced curves may fundamentally change the endstate of the system if any more close encounters occur. Therefore, we use the spliced BS integrator throughout the rest of this work. Convergence with the spliced integrator is achieved in this case at an accuracy of ∼ 10 −12 ; we are conservative and adopt the value of 10 −13 for our integrations.</p><p>Another consideration is the ejecta-crossing lag time. Stellar ejecta will cause the inner planet's orbit to shift before the outer planet's orbit. In some cases, this "lag time" between orbital shifts may produce a noticeable change in the dynamics that is missed by assuming both planets simultaneously change their orbits. The weakness of this assumption is accentuated for widely-spaced orbits and for systems which are not in the adiabatic regime. For the (adiabatic) systems studied here, however, this assumption likely produces a negligible effect 3 , and hence is neglected for the remainder of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Further Adaptations</head><p>All orbital elements in this work are reported in Jacobi coordinates. Therefore, as Mercury receives input in astrocentric coordinates, we performed the conversion. Further, we had to modify the default version of Mercury to account for a changing stellar mass in the output file xv.out so that the conversion from Cartesian output to Jacobi elements was performed correctly. Consequently, the size of xv.out nearly triples in size. Although this increase might be prohibitive for high-resolution studies of individual systems, here we are interested primarily in the final stability state of each system. Therefore, in our case, outputs at a Myr resolution are all that is required. Independent of the paucity of outputs, Mercury does record the times of collisions to within a timestep.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TREATING THE STELLAR RADIUS</head><p>Additionally, we modified Mercury to incorporate the stellar radius evolution profiles from SSE. Over its lifetime, a star's radius evolves nonlinearly and nonmonotonically. Because these variations are modest and all occur within 0.05 AU during the MS, most previous planet scattering studies treated the radius as static and/or negligible. However, during the post-MS, the radius variations can be violent and extend beyond several AU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Expansion</head><p>Because of the potential for planetary collisions, evaporation and/or envelopment due to the expanding stellar envelope, the variations in stellar radius must be taken into account during post-MS scattering simulations. An important question is whether or not a planet, expanding its orbit due to mass loss, can outrun an expanding stellar envelope. The answer is complicated by the fact that the timescales for and amplitudes of mass loss and radial increase are not completely in sync, although they often are similar. Additionally, a star's radius may decrease. WD radii are even more compact than MS radii.</p><p>In order to characterize these variations, we generated Figs. 2-3, with SSE data. The figures characterize the maximum stellar radius for different metallicities and stellar phases, respectively. In particular, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> suggests that the maximum stellar radius is largely independent of metallicity, and that roughly the number of AU at the maximum radius is equal to the number of initial M⊙. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates that the stellar radius generally increases during post-MS phases, although for the 1M⊙ case, there is an order-of-magnitude decrease after the RGB stage. This decrease becomes progressively smaller as the progenitor stellar mass is increased until vanishing at about 3M⊙.</p></div>

Other stellar evolution codes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Vassiliadis &amp; Wood 1993)</ref> demonstrate that as a result of thermal pulses on the AGB the expanding stellar radius can expand up to 1 AU more than the rule-of-thumb maximum radius from the last paragraph.

Because modeling tides is both beyond the scope of this study and remains the subject of debate, we choose initial conditions for our numerical simulations where we can safely neglect tidal effects. Planets are not necessarily destroyed by tides nor by being engulfed in the stellar envelope. The remarkable sub-10 hour periods of the two planets in the hot B subdwarf star KIC 05807616 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charpinet et al. 2011</ref>) provide strong evidence that planets can survive deep immersion into the stellar envelope.</p><p>Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Villaver &amp; Livio (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kunitomo et al. (2011)</ref> have analyzed planet engulfment by Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars by including a number of physical factors, and use more detailed stellar evolution models than SSE. Their results indicate that, for lower-mass stars, tides can significantly affect planets with semimajor axes that are about 2.5 times as high as the maximum stellar RGB radius, and that engulfment is sensitively dependent on progenitor stellar mass. However, the RGB radius does not greatly exceed 1 AU. Although AGB radii are significantly larger <ref type="figure">(Figs. 2 and 3</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mustill &amp; Villaver (2012)</ref> found that for higher-mass stars, the most distant Jovian planet that becomes engulfed is initially at approximately the maximum stellar radius; tides can slightly shrink the orbits of planets for about an AU beyond this maximum. Hence, we adopt 10 AU as the initial orbit of the innermost planet in our simulations. This planet will certainly be safe from engulfment in the envelope, and will experience no significant tidal decay except possibly from the most massive stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Radius-based Code Modifications</head><p>Our simulation initial conditions are chosen such that stable planetary systems are well beyond the influence of tidal effects. However, instabilities which arise during the simulations may cause planets to approach or collide with the expanding stellar envelope. If a collision occurs, the system is flagged as unstable and is stopped. In reality, if a star engulfs a planet, the star's mass would increase slightly and as a result its radius might change as well. Remaining planets in the system would then be affected because angular momentum must be conserved.</p><p>Additionally, Mercury's collision detection algorithm mce cent checks to see if the pericenter of a planet's orbit lies within the star's radius. If so, a collision is flagged. However, if the star's reflex velocity is sufficiently high, then a collision might not occur. Therefore, we modified mce cent to account for the stellar reflex velocity. For planetary mass companions, however, the reflex velocities are low, and are not likely to factor into collision statistics. </p></div>

We particularly seek systems that are likely to be stable on the MS and subsequently destabilised during the giant or WD stages. Donnison (2011) provides a formulation of Hill stability in Jacobi coordinates which allows for arbitrarily inclined and eccentric orbits. His treatment is fully general with one exception: the expression for the system energy is the two-body approximation. This approximation is necessary in order to obtain an analytically tractable (but not strictly correct) solution; the intractable terms appear, for example, in Eq. (2.27) of Veras <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2007)</ref>, which provides the complete expression for the energy of a three-body system in </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">8M ⊙ [1.44M ⊙ ], 7M ⊙ [1.29M ⊙ ], 6M ⊙ [1.14M ⊙ ], 5M ⊙ [1.00M ⊙ ], 4M ⊙ [0.87M ⊙ ], 3M ⊙ [0.75M ⊙ ], 2M ⊙ [0.64M ⊙ ] and 1M ⊙ [0.52M ⊙ ].</formula><p>The figure illustrates that the Hill radius is sensitively dependent on eout, e in , im, M 1 , and M 2 , but weakly dependent on M⋆.

We have undertaken a wider parameter exploration of phase space, and have discovered that this result generally holds true for orbits of any eccentricity, inclination and stellar mass as long as the planetary masses are at most about one Jupiter-mass each. Our results are presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, where each panel showcases a different parameter dependency.</p><p>The variation in the Hill stability limit due to stellar mass loss is often equivalent to several AU for planets which reside beyond about 10 AU. Consequently, if planetary packing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Raymond et al. 2009</ref>) produces planets near the Hill stability limit during the MS, then post-MS evolution may trigger instability.</p><p>Despite these considerations, one must remember that the Hill stability criterion is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the planets to remain ordered. Hill stable planets may be Lagrange unstable, and planets failing to satisfy the Hill stability condition may nevertheless be stable. Regarding the latter case, one outstanding feature of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> is that moderately eccentric or inclined orbits yield critical semimajor axes ratios that are high -much higher, for example, than the semimajor axis ratios of any adjacent pair of planets in the Solar System.</p><p>Large critical semimajor axis ratios may strongly influence the location where two planets become Lagrange stable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Veras &amp; Armitage (2004)</ref> show that as the mutual inclination of the circular orbits of two equal mass planets increases, the critical Hill stability limit becomes a progressively worse indicator of the separations at which planets may actually become Lagrange stable. Their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref> illustrates that for im = 35 • , instability occurs effectively for values under half of the critical separation. However, their numerical simulations were run for just 2 Myr, almost certainly missing instances of longer-term instability.</p><p>Therefore, determining how mass loss affects the stability prospects of the orbits of two planets is perhaps more complex than just considering the analytic effect on the Hill stability limit. Hence, we now turn to N-body simulations.</p></div>

With a MS lifetime of over 10 Gyr, a Solar-mass, Solar-metallicity star with orbiting planets is particularly prohibitive to integrate. This long timescale helps explain the uncertainties in long-term evolution of the Solar System planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kholshevnikov &amp; Kuznetsov 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Laskar et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> provides estimates for the number of planetary orbits that would be achieved during the MS as a function of stellar progenitor mass, for a variety of planetary semimajor axes. The curves result from the competition between the decreased orbital timescale with increased stellar mass, and the decreased MS lifetime with increased stellar mass; the latter overwhelmingly wins. Note the number of orbits tails off significantly as M⋆ <ref type="formula">(0)</ref> is increased, for all semimajor axes. A one order-of-magnitude change in semimajor axis corresponds to 1.5-order-of-magnitude change in the number of MS orbits.   <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

Compared to its MS mass, the WD mass is greatly reduced, and cannot exceed the Chandrasekhar Limit of ≈ 1.4M⊙. The result is that the planetary period may be drastically increased. Assume that the planet's evolution is entirely adiabatic. A reduction of the star's mass by a factor  of k will cause the planet's semimajor axis to be increased by a factor of k. Hence, the planetary period around the WD is k 2 times the period around the MS star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> plots this enhancement factor as a function of progenitor stellar mass, and demonstrates both that WD planets perform fewer orbits than MS counterparts in the same amount of time (with possible implications for scattering) and that WD numerical simulations may proceed much more quickly than MS simulations. .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">Fiducial Choices</head><p>The above considerations lead us to choose an integration duration of 5 Gyr and Solar-metallicity progenitor masses of 8M⊙, 7M⊙, 6M⊙, 5M⊙, 4M⊙ and 3M⊙. This mass range extends down to the upper mass-end of the observed range of exoplanet host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sato et al. 2012b</ref>). This combination allows us to sample an ensemble of multi-planet systems over every phase of evolution, including a substantial sampling (over 4.5 Gyr) of evolution in the WD phase. Simulation output occurs at a frequency of 1 Myr. Performing a statistically significant simulation ensemble for 1M⊙ stars is well-beyond our available resources; for more details on the planetary consequences of the possible evolutionary tracks of 1M⊙ stars, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Veras &amp; Wyatt (2012)</ref>. We adopt one Jupiter mass for the mass of each planet (M1 = M2 = MJ ), assume the planets are on coplanar orbits (im = 0 • ), and assume they have small but non-negligible MS eccentricities (e1(t = 0) = e2(t = 0) = 0.1). These eccentricities are low compared to the observed MS values for massive exoplanets beyond the tidal circularlization limit, but higher than the near-circular orbits predicted by core accretion theory. The inner planet is initially set at a1 = 10 AU to avoid tides with the expanding stellar envelope; over 25 known planets are thought to harbor a &gt; 10 AU 5 . Also, this semimajor axis guarantees that orbital evolution due to mass loss will be adiabatic unless in the presence of an event such as a supernova, which is not modelled here.</p><p>We perform 632 simulations per ensemble, where each ensemble features a different progenitor mass. In each individual simulation, the orbital angles (mean anomalies and longitudes of pericenter) of both planets are selected from a uniform random distribution. We adopt 79 values of a2 so that we sample 8 different sets of orbital angles for each a2 value. The range of a2 values sampled encompasses both the "chaos limit" and the Hill stability limit in order for us to sample many different types of dynamical behaviour.</p><p>The chaos limit refers to a maximum semimajor axis ratio separation at which mean motion resonances do not necessarily overlap.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Additional Simulations</head><p>Motivated by the outcome of our fiducial simulations, we performed two additional ensembles of simulations (632 simulations per ensemble). In both, we adopted a stellar progenitor mass of 5M⊙. The first case assumed different planetary masses; we adopted 1 Earth-mass for each planet (M1 = M2 = M⊕). In the second, we adopted e2 = 0.5 to model a moderately eccentric outer planet. Doing so yields a much wider Hill stability separation (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) than in the fiducial case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1">Overview</head><p>Our goal is to identify instability and when it occurs. We define instability as Lagrange instability: if the planets at any point are found to achieve a hyperbolic orbit, cross orbits, or collide with each other or the star. Hill instability includes just a few of these possibilities: planet-planet collisions and crossing orbits. Therefore, Hill stable systems may eventually be Lagrange unstable. Those that do will feature ejection of the outer planet and/or collision of the inner planet with the star.</p><p>We plot instability time vs. initial semimajor axis ratio in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, which represents our main result. Dots indicate unstable systems. No dot appears for a system that has remained stable over the entire 5 Gyr integration. If all 8 simulations for a given semimajor axis ratio are stable over 5 Gyr, then we place a blue star at 10 10 yr in the appropriate horizontal position, even though the vertical position of the star has no physical meaning and is selected for visual impact.</p><p>The figure includes the six ensembles of simulations with different progenitor stellar masses. Each post-MS phase change occurs at different times on each plot. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hurley et al. (2000)</ref> for detailed physical descriptions of each phase. Although the horizontal lines are close together in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, they are clearly distinguishable on the zoomed-in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> plots. Different progenitor masses also cause differences in the location of the Hill stability</p><note type="other">limit. On each plot is a black vertical dashed line, representing the Hill stability limit computed from the star's MS mass. The black dotted lines represent the Hill stability limits computed</note><p>with the star's WD mass (see the <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> caption for these values).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.2">Physical Description of Figure 9</head><p>The Hill Stability limits and the onset of post-MS evolution provide boundaries within which one can understand the different regions in the <ref type="figure">Fig. 9 plots:</ref> 1) During the MS, represented by the region under all the coloured horizontal lines, dots appear predominately inside of the MS Hill stability limit and predominately at times under 10 7 yr. Hence, the limit is useful for identifying short-term instability.</p><p>2) Some dots appear on the MS but outside of the MS Hill stability limit in the plots with progenitor stellar masses of 5M⊙, 4M⊙ and 3M⊙. All these dots indicate long-term instability (occurring after ∼ 10 7 yr). The long-term MS unstable simulations with initial separations exceeding the Hill stability limit must be (and indeed are) Lagrange unstable: where the outer planet is ejected and/or the inner planet collides with the star. As the progenitor mass is decreased, the number of unstable MS systems beyond the MS Hill stability boundary increases. One possible reason is because the longer MS lifetimes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>) translate into more orbits for the planets (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>), and hence a greater opportunity for instability to occur. Another potential reason is that smaller planet-star mass ratios broaden the boundaries between Hill and Lagrange instability.</p><p>3) MS instability beyond the MS Hill stability limit appears to extend only as far as the WD Hill stability limit. However, this must be coincidence -due to our choice of initial conditions -as the planetary system has no knowledge of the post-MS mass loss that will occur.</p><p>4) The WD Hill stability limits ensure that any WD instability occurring beyond this limit must be Lagrange instability. Our simulations corroborate this statement. 5) Each plot in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> demonstrates that all systems become Lagrange stable for a2/a1 1.55, just inside the 2:1 commensurability. Reinforcing this estimate are blue stars which were excluded from the plot (for visual clarity) that extend all the way out in an unbroken chain to a2/a1 ≈ [1.779, 1.775, 1.770, 1.765, 1.757, 1.747] for M⊙(0) = [8M⊙, 7M⊙, 6M⊙, 5M⊙, 4M⊙, 3M⊙]. This sampled range helps to establish the robustness of the Lagrange stability boundary for our chosen 5 Gyr integration duration. This boundary lies at a distance corresponding to approximately [178%, 176%, 176%, 172%, 167%, 163%] of the MS Hill stability limit and [138%, 134%, 133%, 130%, 126%, 123%] of the WD Hill stability limit.</p><p>In all our cases, planets with initial separations that exceed the 2:1 commensurability are stable throughout the 5 Gyr integration 6 . However, the Lagrange stability limit may be higher than the values reported here for progenitor masses lower than those sampled here. Especially for 1M⊙ stars, the outcome is uncertain, given the long MS lifetime and strong mass loss over <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The strong, first-order 2:1 mean motion commensurability perhaps plays a role in establishing the Lagrange stability boundary (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes &amp; Greenberg 2007</ref>) for our fiducial cases. both the RGB and AGB (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>). The distribution of unstable systems in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows a wide variation of instability times, and suggests that longer simulations, perhaps out to the age of the Universe, could yield additional instability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.3">Description of Figures 10-12</head><p>Post-MS pre-WD phase changes can prompt instability, which can be seen more clearly in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. The phases which cause the greatest mass loss (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>) also tend to be the phases which are most likely to trigger instability. This tendency is indicated by the number of dots between the TPAGB and WD lines versus the number of dots appearing below the TPAGB line. Note however, that the relatively long length of the core helium burning phase helps to increase the number of unstable systems during that phase. The abundance of dots just above the WD line indicates that the TPAGB can unsettle stable systems enough to cause slightly delayed instability. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>, the WD Hill stability limit appears to provide an effective boundary beyond which post-MS pre-WD instability does not occur. However, this apparent boundary again must be coincidence because the systems are unaware of forthcoming post-MS mass loss.</p><p>In support of the above claims, we quantify the types of instability in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref> for each progenitor mass. The figure shows six normalized bar plots. The blue, or topmost, bars represent the fraction of systems (out of 8) that feature a collision between both planets; orange bars represent a collision with the central star; yellow bars represent any other type of instability (including ejection or periodic instances of a planet attaining a hyperbolic orbit); green, or bottommost, bars, indicate systems which remained stable for 5 Gyr. Therefore, Lagrange unstable systems are represented by orange and yellow bars. The predominance of the yellow bars towards the right sides of the plots indicate that any type of collisions become less likely as the initial planet separations are increased. Any blue bars beyond the MS Hill stability limit indicate planet-planet collisions during the post-MS, importantly demonstrating that after leaving the MS, planets are not restricted to (but still predominately experience) Lagrange instability. There are no blue bars that exceed the WD Hill stability limit, as expected. The height of the green bars around the 3:2 commensurability demonstrates how it helps stabilize the simulated systems.</p><p>Also of interest is the evolutionary phase at which instability occurs. The collision of a planet with a star has been proposed to explain both the existence of extreme horizontal branch stars without stellar binary companions -as the envelope of the progenitor giant could be removed by the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charpinet et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bear &amp; Soker 2012</ref>) -and the enrichment of Lithium seen in a few per cent of stars at all parts of the RGB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lebzelter et al. 2012</ref>). Of particular interest here is the planet candidate proposed orbiting the Lithium-rich giant BD+48 740, whose eccentric orbit suggests a past strong scattering interaction such as we are considering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adamów et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Although the fraction of post-MS pre-WD instability can be deduced from <ref type="figure">Figs. 9 and 10</ref>, we have created a separate figure, <ref type="figure">Fig. 12</ref>, which better visualizes the result. <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> displays the fraction of systems which are stable (green bars), and those which incur instability on the MS phase (purple bars), on the WD phase (orange bars) and in between the MS and WD phases (gray bars). Instability during a giant branch phase occurs relatively infrequently: [4.0%, 5.4%, 6.9%, 6.7%, 8.7%, 4.6%] of all unstable systems for each stellar progenitor mass. WD instability is not limited to systems with initial separations beyond the Hill stability limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.4">Potential Resonance Behaviour</head><p>Mean motion commensurabilities, shown on the upper x-axes of Figs. 9-12, appear to play an important role in affecting stability. At these locations, stability may be either enhanced or additionally disrupted. A few suggestive instances of these commensurabilities making a contribution include the 5:4 location in the M⋆(0) = 8M⊙ simulations and the 5:3 location in the M⋆(0) = 3M⊙ simulations. The 3:2 commensurability demonstrably provides a protection mechanism for planetary systems in each plot. The 4:3 commensurability seems to yield all possible outcomes for M⋆(0) 5M⊙, but no stable systems for M⋆(0) &lt; 5M⊙.</p><p>Hence, exploring the resonant character of these systems is of potential interest. However, our 5 Gyr simulations are not well-suited to determine if a given system is locked into mean motion resonance because our output frequency of 1 Myr is over 4 orders of magnitude greater than a typical orbital period. The sudden and drastic changes in eccentricity and inclination which can arise from purely 3-body interactions (not including any type of dissipation nor external forces) may act well within 1 Myr (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Naoz et al. 2011</ref>), and hence disrupt and/or create resonances. Additionally, resonance behaviour may manifest itself only periodically due to repeated separatrix crossings, which yield different intervals of libration and circulation of one or more resonant angles (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Farmer &amp; Goldreich 2006</ref>). Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ketchum et al. (2012)</ref> has classified this behaviour as "nodding" and analytically characterized it.</p><p>Despite these caveats, we have considered the evolution from selected resonant angles from our output. Identifying resonant systems requires defining a libration centre, maximum libration amplitude about this centre, and a duration.  demonstrated that fully characterizing potential resonant behaviour for two massive planets may require the sampling of several libration centres, as well as computing a mean absolute deviation or root mean squared deviation about each centre, for each resonant angle. Here we do not pursue any such analysis, but instead simply point out that the majority of stable fiducial systems over 5 Gyr do not appear to exhibit resonant libration. These systems include planets with Hill unstable separations. Conversely, a smaller number of systems do appear to exhibit resonant libration, typically close to the strong first-order mean-motion resonant commensurabilities. This result is expected, as forming resonances of Jovianmass planets from uniformly-sampled orbital angles should be infrequent (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Veras 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A perhaps better measure of the effect of mean motion commensurabilities is by considering the geometric mean of instability times for each semimajor axis ratio set of 8 simulations that produces at least 1 unstable system. We plot these mean times in <ref type="figure">Fig. 13</ref>, where the 4:3 commensurability is shown to have a clear effect. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.

The longest pre-WD post-MS phase is the Red Giant Branch; the most violent phase (with the greatest mass loss, and causing the greatest amount of instability) is the TPAGB. The WD Hill Stability limit acts as an effective empirical boundary for pre-WD post-MS instability.  <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>. Phases of instability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.5">Survivor Orbit Properties</head><p>Of potential interest to WD pollution investigators and WD planet hunters is the properties of planets undergoing Lagrange instability during the WD phase. In some cases, the inner planet simply collides directly with the WD, creating a direct pollutant. However, our simulations suggest that these occurences are rare, occuring [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0] times for M⊙(0) = [8M⊙, 7M⊙, 6M⊙, 5M⊙, 4M⊙, 3M⊙]. In other cases, the outer planet is ejected and the inner planet survives on a bounded orbit. A bound, eccentric inner planet may induce pollution by scattering comets or asteroids close enough to the WD to be tidally disrupted and ingested by the WD. To gain insight into how an inner planet survives on an eccentric bounded orbit, we use conservation of energy and angular momentum. Although energy is not conserved in a system with mass loss -and certainly not in our integrationsafter the parent star has become a WD, mass loss ceases and then energy is conserved for the future. Thus, we can compare the states at the beginning of the WD and at the moment of ejection (≡ tins). Further, because the mass loss is adiabatic, we can relate the semimajor axes of the planets on the MS and the WD phases through knowledge of how much mass is lost. Therefore, we find that the semimajor axis of the bound planet should be at most:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">a1(tins) M⋆(0)a1(0)a2(0)M1 M⋆(tW D ) [a2(0)M1 + a1(0)M2]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where M⋆(tW D ) is the mass of the WD. Angular momentum is conserved throughout a planetary system's life, even under the effects of mass loss. Thus, in principle, one can use conservation of angular momentum to determine the value of e1(tins). However, doing so requires knowledge of the hyperbolic values of a2(tins) and e2(tins). These values are set by the ejection velocity, which is determined by the strength of the instability in each case. Our numerical simulations show that e1(tins) varies considerably.</p><p>We plot the semimajor axes (blue squares) and periastra (orange dots) of the surviving planets in systems featuring ejections in the WD phase only, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 14</ref>. Superimposed on the plots through aqua lines are the analytically predicted maximum values of a1(tins) through Eq. <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. Also plotted as a solid black horizontal line is the maximum stellar radius (see <ref type="figure">Figs. 2 and  3</ref>) attained during the star's evolution. The presence of orange dots below the black line suggest the presence of a population of highly eccentric planets orbiting WDs whose present pericentres take them inside the maximum AGB radius. These planets cannot have been formed in situ or anywhere near their WD locations because otherwise they would have been destroyed or suffered radical orbital alterations on the AGB. The fractions of orange dots below the black line for each progenitor mass are 8.4% (8M⊙), 10.9% (7M⊙), 8.4% (6M⊙), 5.1% (5M⊙), 1.7% (4M⊙) and 0% (3M⊙).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.1">Terrestrial Planet Masses</head><p>Now we consider variations on the fiducial case. First, we set the planet masses such that M1 = M2 = M⊕. The results of those 632 simulations are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 15</ref>, which include plots for instability time versus initial semimajor axis ratio, the types and phases of instability, and the geometric mean of instability time. The smaller planetary masses here shrink the chaos limit and the Hill stability limit -as well as the difference between the MS and WD Hill stability limits (see bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> -and introduces a different set of potentially important commensurabilities, displayed on the top x-axis of all plots.</p><p>Earth-mass planets fail to go unstable beyond the MS Hill stability limit in all but a few cases; the blue stars continue in an unbroken chain out to a2/a1 ≈ 1.510. Therefore, Hill stability and Lagrange stability appear to have almost identical boundaries in this case.</p><p>No system features a collision of a terrestrial planet with the WD. This result should not imply that this type of collision cannot occur, but rather that giant planet collisions are likely to be much more frequent.</p><p>Almost all instability involves collision between both planets. Interestingly, one planet-planet collision occurs just beyond the WD Hill stability boundary, meaning that the real boundary must differ from the line on the plot. This situation arises because planets arrive on the WD phase with slightly different osculating orbital parameters than they harboured at the start of the MS (primarily due to their mutual interactions, and slightly due to post-MS mass loss). Hence, the real WD Hill stability limit for each individual system is different, and differs from the line shown in the figure that was computed for e1 = e2 = 0.1 exactly.</p><p>Although only one system undergoes instability in the post-MS pre-WD phases, instability during the WD phase is common, and is in fact greatest for separations close to the tightly-packed 11:10 commensurability (corresponding to a2/a1 ≈ 1.066). Other instances of WD instability occur around the 7:6 and 5:4 commensurabilities, and to either side of the 4:3 commensurability, on which all 8 systems are stable. The influence meted by these first-order commensurabilities therefore appears to be extensive. However, the bottom plot of the figure might suffer  <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>.

Dots below this curve indicate the existence of WD planets orbiting inside the maximum AGB radius even though the planets were formed elsewhere. c 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-24 bias due to small number statistics. An investigation of individual systems indicates that resonant behaviour appears to be more common for these terrestrial-mass planet systems than for the fiducial Jovian-mass systems, perhaps demonstrating the importance of the planet/star mass ratio in creating resonance behaviour from random initial conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.2">Different Planetary Eccentricities</head><p>Next, we consider systems with an initially moderately eccentric outer planet orbit (e2 = 0.5) and the same fiducial inner planet eccentricity (e1 = 0.1) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 16</ref>. In this case, the analytic MS Hill stability limit is much larger (a2/a1 ≈ 2.73) than in the fiducial case, which is expected (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). For these systems, instability beyond the MS and WD Hill limits is extensive. In fact, the Lagrange unstable region extends out nearly 7 AU from the location of the MS Hill stability boundary for a1 = 10 AU. However, the Lagrange stability boundary lies at a distance that is 143% and 135% of the MS and WD Hill stability limits; the former value is a much smaller factor than in the fiducial cases.</p><p>Collisions with the star are infrequent and ejections are common, perhaps because the inner planet has the much lower eccentricity. In fact, inner planets which survive outer planet ejections largely fail to attain high enough eccentricities to intrude within the maximum stellar radius achieved during the host star's evolution: only 0.85% of the orange dots are below the black line in the bottom-right plot. In that same plot, the two outliers likely represent systems that experienced pre-WD instability that was missed by our low output frequency. Instability during the giant phases is uncommon, and is restricted to the region around the 4:1 commensurability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Consequences for White Dwarf Pollution</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Background</head><p>One potential consequence of dynamical instabilities induced due to stellar mass loss is WD pollution. WDs are surrounded by thin atmospheres of either hydrogen or helium. Heavier elements sink rapidly in such thin atmospheres and it is therefore puzzling that such a high fraction of WDs have evidence for metal pollutants in their spectra (25% of single DA WDs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zuckerman et al. 2003</ref>). Such metal pollution has been associated with excess emission in the infrared consistent with a close-in dust disc in more than a dozen cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Farihi et al. 2009</ref>) and gas discs in a handful of cases ( <ref type="bibr">Gänsicke et al. 2006, 2007, 2008)</ref>. It has been suggested that these observations could be explained by planetary material, motivated by the similarity of the composition of the accreted material with planetary material ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Klein et al. 2010;</ref>).</p><p>In order for a WD to be polluted by material from an outer planetary system, comets, asteroids or planets must be scattered at least close enough to the star (at about one Solar radius) so that they are tidally disrupted. Changes to the dynamics of the planetary system following stellar mass loss has been suggested as a potential cause of increased numbers of planetary bodies scattered onto star-grazing orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Debes &amp; Sigurdsson 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jura 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bonsor et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Debes et al. 2012</ref>). Even in planetary systems where the planets remain on stable orbits, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bonsor et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Debes et al. (2012)</ref> show that sufficiently many asteroids or comets can be scattered onto stargrazing orbits to explain some of the observations of polluted WDs. Such mechanisms, however, struggle to explain observations of high accretion rates in old polluted WDs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koester et al. 2011;</ref>).</p><p>Instabilities in planetary systems could provide a potential explanation for pollution in these, and other, WDs. Depending on the exact nature of the instability and structure of the individual planetary system, in many cases the number of planetary bodies scattered onto star-grazing orbits increases significantly following an instability. This means that the planetary systems presented in this work in which instabilities occurred during the WD phase have the potential to produce polluted WDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Our Simulations</head><p>We qualify the following discussion by reminding the reader that we have not probed progenitor masses between 1M⊙ and 2M⊙, where the true WD population appears to peak. The reason for not considering this range is due to computational limitations, as tracking planetary orbits over such long MS lifetimes is prohibitive. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> showcases the different types of instability which can occur during the WD phase. First, many systems with giant planets that were Hill stable on the MS become Hill unstable due to mass loss preceding the WD phase. Second, other systems that were technically Hill unstable on the MS, but were protected against instability by commensurabilities, become unstable during the WD phase. Third, some of the systems that are Hill stable during the WD phase are actually Lagrange unstable, and experience instability at a late time.</p><p>We can now relate the WD instability to the cooling age of the WD, which is the time lapsed since the star became a WD. The cooling age of real (not simulated) WDs are readily determined from observations, and hence provide an opportunity for comparison with and motivation for numerical simulations. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure</ref> 17 displays the number of planetary systems that become unstable during the WD phase as a function of cooling age; each plot corresponds to a different progenitor mass. Any instance of instability could represent a trigger for a potentially polluting event. An ejection especially suggests that the inner planetary system will be significantly perturbed, and this perturbation can throw planetesimals or terrestrial planets that were originally in the inner system onto the star.</p><p>The figure contains several notable features: 1) planetplanet collisions tend to occur at short cooling ages (∼ 10 4 −10 7 yr), 2) escape and stellar collisions becomes prevalent only after ∼ 10 7 yr, but tails off after a few Gyr, 3) the cooling age of this type of instability increases as the progenitor mass increases, and 4) direct collisions with the WD are rare. The striking delay of ∼ 10 7 yr before escape instability becomes dominant reflects the (largely unexplored) dependencies of Lagrange instability on number of orbits completed, the initial values of the semimajor axes, and the mass ratios. In fact, perhaps the positive correlation of cooling age instability with progenitor mass is due to more orbits being required for smaller mass ratios for Lagrange instability to kick in, a feature also apparent on <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> on the MS. Alternatively, the correlation may result from the much wider orbits of the giant planets around higher-mass WDs.</p><p>The few giant planets which hit the WD are particularly interesting as pollution sources, and imply that some polluted WDs may result from the disruption of giant planets rather than comets or asteroids. Planetary material that is accreted onto WDs might be composed of many small asteroids or comets <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jura 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bonsor et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Debes et al. 2012</ref>), but could also be the result of a single large object. Detailed compositional analysis of some objects concludes that the accreted material resembles more closely the bulk Earth in composition than chondritic material (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zuckerman et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Klein et al. 2010)</ref>; it is feasible that a disrupted planet would produce high levels of pollution in a WD. Such disrupted planets could provide the explanation for a handful of polluted WDs, in particular old, heavily polluted WDs. However, our simulations indicate that star-grazing giant planet collisions are too rare to alone account for the abundance of observed differentiated material. This result agrees with the implied low fraction of planetary collisions with WDs from the finding that at most 1-5% of WDs have high accretion rates due to dust disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Debes et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Farihi et al. 2012c</ref>).</p><p>Observed polluted WDs can provide the inspiration for extensions to our work, with numerical simulations tailored to particular observational samples or campaigns. However, the pur- Planet-planet collisions occur quickly (∼ 10 4 − 10 7 yr), whereas instances of escape or stellar collisions typically do not occur until after a few tens of Myr.</p><p>pose of this paper is not to make a detailed comparison with the observed polluted WD population, which is heavily biased and suffers from uncertainty of the distribution of their progenitor masses. Our computationally-expensive simulations were set up to demonstrate that full-lifetime orbital integrations including realistic mass loss are now achievable, and to explore dynamical properties of the resulting instability. Nevertheless, we can make a crude comparison of the potentially WD-polluting events in our simulations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 17)</ref> and the observed distribution of polluted WDs (in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig 18)</ref>. Data for the observed distribution of 78</p><p>Full-Lifetime Two-Planet Simulations 21 WD ages was taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Farihi et al. (2012b)</ref> and . Both the observations and simulations show a broad consensus. Observations confidently detect pollution at cooling ages from a few tens of Myr (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Gänsicke et al. 2012</ref>) to several Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koester et al. 2011</ref>), but cannot detect pollution at earlier times when the WD is too hot to rule out a primordial origin for metals 7 nor at later times when the WDs are too intrinsically faint. The simulations begin to demonstrate ejection instability only at times greater than tens of Myr due to a true physical effect which may be explained by the timescale for Lagrange instability to act on the WD phase. This instability appears to have largely run its course after a few Gyr have passed, so that relatively fewer systems are likely to become unstable beyond the 5 Gyr integration time. Observationally, comparing the pollution frequency at 5 Gyr with that at tens of Myr is difficult due to intrinsic biases, despite the suggestive nature of the distribution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 18</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Nevertheless, Bonsor et al. (2011)</ref> found that asteroidal accretion onto WDs from particles scattered due to the overlap of mean motion resonance exterior to the planet follows a similar trend of being present beyond a few tens of Myr after post-MS evolution before eventually tailing off after a few Gyr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Debes et al. (2012)</ref> later found that asteroidal accretion onto WDs from both exterior and interior resonances also follow this trend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Phase Space Extrapolation</head><p>The results of this study raise several questions. One important question is how robust our conclusions are to variations of the initial conditions. Because of the computational expense of running simulation ensembles for 5 Gyr with the Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm, we could not perform a wider phase space exploration. However, we can guess how the outcomes would vary in other circumstances.</p><p>Varying a1 would change the number of orbits completed over the main sequence; the effect is similar to varying M⋆. Hence, <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> demonstrates the likely consequence: if the planets complete enough orbits, they will be prone to long-term MS instability. If the initial planetary separation is beyond the Hill stability limit, then this instability must be Lagrange instability. Otherwise, the type of instability is unrestricted.</p><p>The consequence of varying planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations is less clear. What is clear is that planets on eccentric orbits will feature in post-MS systems. Observations suggest that if giant planets are formed at several AU on circular orbits, they are unlikely to retain their primordial eccentricities on the MS. According to the Extrasolar Data Explorer 8 , as of 31 Oct, 2012, only 20.4% of exoplanets with Mp 0.1MJ and a 1 AU have e &lt; 0.1. This percentage shrinks to 10.4% for e &lt; 0.05 9 . If one were to include only planets in multi-planet systems, these percentages become 18.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Therefore, if the planets we currently observe predominately survive until the post-MS, the significant majority will 7 These young WDs are able to radiatively levitate metals, masking what could be external pollution. 8 at http://exoplanets.org/ 9 Admittedly, there is a bias towards fitting higher eccentricity values than the true values. The disparity worsens with sparser data, which is often associated with the most distant radial velocity planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of WD Polluted Systems</head><p>An Observed Polluted WD Sample enter those phases with nonzero eccentricities. Nevertheless, it is of interest to determine if MS Lagrange instability can occur for planets formed on perfectly circular orbits. Therefore, we have performed 48 additional simulations with e1(0) = e2(0) = 0.0 for M⋆(0) = 3M⊙ at different locations beyond the Hill stability limit. We can confirm that a few of those systems become Lagrange unstable. A detailed statistical comparison is best left to a more comprehensive phase space study. We can estimate the dependence on planetary mass by extrapolating from Figs. 9 and 15. The trend suggests that as the test particle limit is approached, where there is no mutual interaction between secondaries, the difference between the Hill and Lagrange boundaries might tend to zero faster than the Hill boundary itself. In the opposite limit, for two brown dwarfs and a more massive evolving primary, we expect the stability boundaries to widen even further than in our fiducial case. In these instances, instabilities might be common, and could represent a significant catalyst for WD pollution.</p><p>Adding more planets to model real systems such as HR 8799 introduces a significant complication, but is a viable avenue of future study with our numerical code <ref type="bibr">(Mustill &amp; Veras, in prep)</ref>. If additional planets are of similar masses, then we expect them to represent destabilizing influences, particularly in the post-MS stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Comparison with Radial Velocity Exosystems</head><p>The majority of known exoplanets are likely to be engulfed during the post-MS phase, as the population of planets beyond 10 AU is largely unknown. Nevertheless, scaled versions of many known systems could represent genuine test cases for our model, because of the observed close separations of pairs of exoplanets. Further, our findings of MS instability warrant a closer look at these systems.</p><p>We have compiled a list of all pairs of planets in the same system with a &gt; 1 AU each that were detected by radial velocity measurements. We obtained the data from the Extrasolar Planets Explorer on 6 November, 2012. Using Eqs.

Hence, these planets are likely to be protected by their proximity to mean motion commensurabilities inside small islands of stability, as in, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Wittenmyer et al. (2012)</ref>. This behaviour is reflective of some of our Hill unstable systems in Figs. 9, 15 and 16. BD +20 2457 is notable because its mass is about 2.8M⊙, and may be related to our 3M⊙ simulations. However, both planets in the system are likely instead to be classified as brown dwarfs (M1 ≈ 22.7MJ and M2 ≈ 13.2MJ ). The correspondingly high mass ratios in the system, coupled with their close separations (a2/a1 ≈ 1.39), perhaps intuitively suggest that instability should be imminent. Hence, the existence of such a system is stark confirmation that Hill unstable systems can remain stable for long periods. The system's future prospects for stability on the MS would require detailed modelling.</p><p>Three pairs of planets are Hill stable, but have a separation ratio which exceeds the Hill stability limit by no more than 30% (HD 37124 c,d; 47 Uma b,c; HD 183263 b,c). Based on our simulations, the close proximity of these systems to the Hill stability limit suggests that they might not be Lagrange stable for the remainder of their MS lifetimes. Testing this suggestion would require a detailed suite of long-term simulations for each system. If Lagrange instability scales strongly with planet/star mass ratio, then the planets in HD 183263 are perhaps in the greatest danger: the mass ratios in those systems are about 9.5 times as great as any mass ratio that we considered in our simulations.</p><p>Three pairs of Hill stable planets have separations exceeding the Hill stability limit by between 45% and 65% (HD 108874 b,c; HD 159868 c,b; HD 10180 g,h), and two planet pairs (HD 4732 b, c; mu Ara b, c) have separations that are over twice the Hill limit. Although the Lagrange stability boundary is likely dependent on several variables, we have performed additional simulations as proof of concept to show that in at least one case, this boundary can extend out to twice the Hill stability boundary. Hence, HD 108874, HD 159868 and HD 10180 are not guaranteed to be Lagrange stable without further detailed analyses.</p><p>If the planets in any of these observed systems are not coplanar, then they are more likely to be Hill unstable (see the middle panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>. A mutual inclination of just 12.3 • would render the planets in HD 37124 Hill unstable. At the opposite extreme, for the widely separated planets in HD 4732, a mutual inclination of 61.0 • would be required.</p></div>

If we were to assume the twobody definition of adiabaticity for each of the planets in each of our simulations, then we can claim that at no time did our stable planetary systems (with a1(0) = 10 AU) approach a regime that featured non-adiabatic mass loss. However, if 2 planets were stably orbiting at separations of hundreds of AU on the MS, then the mutual planet-planet interaction coupled with stellar mass loss could yield unpredictable evolution during the post-MS. <ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref>.

The resulting instability (manifested by escape or collision) may be latent, sometimes not appearing for a time that exceeds the duration of the mass loss by a factor of tens. In cases where the outer planet escapes, distinguishing whether the instability was triggered by Lagrange instability, non-adiabatic mass loss, or both might require detailed follow-up simulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>Architectures of planetary systems during each stellar phase may represent historical tracers of formation and presage future evolutionary instability and death. We have performed 5 Gyr simulations that consistently treat the dynamics of two massive planets and every phase of stellar evolution for a wide range of progenitor stellar masses (3M⊙ -8M⊙). These computationallydemanding simulations suggest that stable MS systems are in danger of future instability. The zone of danger is wide, reaching out to 163%-178% of the MS Hill stability limit and 123%-137% of the WD Hill stability limit for our low eccentricity (e1(0) = e2(0) = 0.1) simulations. The consequences for WD pollution may be significant: For example, the inner planet can be perturbed onto a highly eccentric orbit which takes the planet close to the WD or hits the star directly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Silvotti et al. 2007; Mullally et al. 2008; Geier et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2009; Mullally et al. 2009; Setiawan et al. 2010; Wickramasinghe et al. 2010; Charpinet et al. 2011; Adamów et al. 2012; Farihi et al. 2012a; Lee et al. 2012a,b; Sato et al. 2012a).</figDesc></figure>

The figure illustrates that the Hill radius is sensitively dependent on eout, e in , im, M 1 , and M 2 , but weakly dependent on M⋆.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> This type of stability has also been referred to as &quot;Laplace stability&quot; (e.g. Kubala et al. 1993) and featured but remained unnamed in many papers published before the discovery of exoplanets and high-speed computing.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In the one-planet case, when the outer planet is removed from these particular simulations, then all three curves are visually indistinguisable from one another on this plot. This result reinforces the finding of Veras et al. (2011) that splicing within timesteps is generally not necessary in one-planet simulations.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> By using the observed mass ejecta speed in the post-MS system R Sculptoris of ≈ 14.3 km/s (Maercker et al. 2012), one can estimate that the ejecta will take 121 days to travel 1 AU. Thus, for an inner planet at 10 AU and an outer planet at 12 or 13 AU, the travel time is less than a year, a small fraction of the inner planet&apos;s orbital period.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We have discovered two typographic errors in the previous literature: The last quantity of the LHS of Eq. (2.13) in Veras &amp; Armitage (2004) should not be squared, and the sign in front of A in Eq. (9) of Donnison (2011) is incorrect. c</note>
