			<abstract>
				<p>Short-period exoplanets can have dayside surface temperatures surpassing 2000 K, hot enough to vaporize rock and drive a thermal wind. Small enough planets evaporate completely. We construct a radiative-hydrodynamic model of atmospheric escape from strongly irradiated, low-mass rocky planets, accounting for dust-gas energy exchange in the wind. Rocky planets with masses 0.1M ⊕ (less than twice the mass of Mercury) and surface temperatures 2000 K are found to disintegrate entirely in 10 Gyr. When our model is applied to Kepler planet candidate KIC 12557548b-which is believed to be a rocky body evaporating at a rate of ˙ M 0.1 M ⊕ /Gyr-our model yields a present-day planet mass of 0.02 M ⊕ or less than about twice the mass of the Moon. Mass loss rates depend so strongly on planet mass that bodies can reside on close-in orbits for Gyrs with initial masses comparable to or less than that of Mercury, before entering a final short-lived phase of catastrophic mass loss (which KIC 12557548b has entered). Because this catastrophic stage lasts only up to a few percent of the planet&apos;s life, we estimate that for every object like KIC 12557548b, there should be 10-100 close-in quiescent progenitors with sub-day periods whose hard-surface transits may be detectable by Kepler-if the progenitors are as large as their maximal, Mercury-like sizes (alternatively, the progenitors could be smaller and more numerous). According to our calculations, KIC 12557548b may have lost ∼70% of its formation mass; today we may be observing its naked iron core.</p>

An introductory overview of atmospheric escape in the Solar System is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Catling &amp; Zahnle (2009)</ref>.</p><p>Smaller bodies lose their atmospheres more readily because of their lower surface gravities. Bodies closer to their host star also lose more mass because they are heated more strongly. Extrasolar planets on close-in orbits are expected to have highly processed atmospheres. In extreme cases, stellar irradiation might even evaporate planets in their entirety -comets certainly fall in this category.</p><p>Hot Jupiters are the best studied case for atmospheric erosion in extrasolar planets (for theoretical models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Yelle , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tian et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">García Muñoz 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Holmström et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Murray-Clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ekenbäck et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tremblin &amp; Chiang 2013)</ref>. For these gas giants, mass loss is driven by stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation which photo-ionizes hydrogen and imparts enough energy per proton to overcome the planet's large escape velocity (∼60 km/s). Mass loss for hot Jupiters typically occurs at a rate of ˙ M ∼ 10 10 -10 11 g/s so that ∼1% of the planet mass is lost over its lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Yelle 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">García Muñoz 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Murray-Clay et al. 2009)</ref>. Although this erosion hardly affects a hot Jupiter's internal structure, the outflow is observable. Winds escaping from hot Jupiters have been spectroscopically detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). During hot Jupiter transits, several absorption lines (H i, O i, C ii, Mg ii, and Si iii) deepen by ∼2-10% (Vidal- <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Madjar et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Madjar et al. , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Madjar et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ben-Jaffel 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fossati et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linsky et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Because of their lower escape velocities, lower mass superEarths should have their atmospheres more significantly sculpted by evaporation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lopez et al.

When dayside temperatures surpass ∼2000 K, rocks, particularly silicates and iron (and to a lesser extent, Ti, Al, and Ca), begin to vaporize. If the planet mass is low enough, thermal velocities of the high-metallicity vapor could exceed escape velocities. Under these circumstances, mass loss is not limited by stellar UV photons, but is powered by the incident bolometric flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">KIC 12557548b: A Catastrophically Evaporating Planet</head><p>In fact, the Kepler spacecraft may have enabled the discovery of an evaporating, close-in rocky planet near the end of its life. As reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref>, the K-star KIC 12557548 dims every 15.7 hours by a fractional amount f that varies erratically from a maximum of f ≈ 1.3% to a minimum of f 0.2%. These occultations are thought to arise from dust embedded in the timevariable outflow emitted by an evaporating rocky planet -hereafter KIC 1255b. Because Kepler observes in the broadband optical, the obscuring material cannot be gas which absorbs only in narrow lines; it must take the form of dust which absorbs and scatters efficiently in the continuum. As we will estimate shortly, the amount of dust lost by the planet is prodigious.</p><p>From the ∼2000 K surface of the planet is launched a thermal ("Parker-type") wind out of which dust condenses as the gas expands and cools. The composition of the high-metallicity wind reflects the composition of the evaporating rocky planet (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schaefer &amp; Fegley 2009)</ref>: the wind may consist of Mg, SiO, O, and O 2 -and Fe if it has evaporated down to its iron core. Stellar gravity, together with Coriolis and radiation-pressure forces, then shape the dusty outflow into a comet-like tail. The peculiar shape of the transit light curve of KIC 1255b supports the interpretation that the occultations are caused by a dusty tail. First, the light curve evinces a flux excess just before ingress, which could be caused by the forward scattering of starlight toward the observer. Second, the flux changes more gradually during egress than during ingress, as expected for a trailing tail. Both features of the light curve and their explanations were elucidated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref>, and further quantified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref> who presented a phenomenological light-scattering model of a dusty tail. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>Alternative ideas might include Roche lobe overflow from a companion to the star (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lai et al. 2010)</ref>. A problem with this scenario is that the mass transfer accretion stream, funneled through the L1 Lagrange point, Spectra of KIC 12557548 taken using the Keck Telescope reveal no radial velocity variations down to a limiting accuracy of ∼100 m/s (A. Howard and G. <ref type="bibr">Marcy 2012, personal communica- tion)</ref>. A deep Keck image also does not reveal any background blended stars. These null results are consistent with the interpretation that KIC 1255b is a small, catastrophically evaporating planet.</p><p>The characteristic mass loss rate for KIC 1255b -a quantity that we will reference throughout this paper -can be estimated from the observations as follows. First compute the total mass in grains required to absorb/scatter a fraction f of the starlight, assuming that the dust is optically thin (or marginally so). Out of the total area πR 2 * presented by the stellar face, take the dust cloud to cover an area A and to have a characteristic line-of-sight optical depth Σ d κ d , where Σ d is the grain mass per unit area (on the sky) and κ d is the grain opacity. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f = A πR 2 * Σ d κ d .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Assume further that grains can be modeled as a monodispersion of spheres with radii s and internal material density ρ int so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">κ d = 3 4ρ int s .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The total mass in dust covering the star is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M d = Σ d A = 4π 3 f ρ int R 2 * s .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>To obtain a mass loss rate, divide this mass by the orbital period of 15.7 hours on the grounds that transit depths change by up to an order of magnitude from orbit to orbit. For f = 1% -when KIC 1255b is in a state of relatively high mass loss -the resultant mass loss rate in grains is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">˙ M 1255b, dust ∼ 0.4 R * 0.65R ⊙ 2 f 0.01 s 0.5 µm ρ int 1 g/cm 3 M ⊕ Gyr −1 .</formula><p>(4) This is the mass loss rate in dust only, by construction. The gasto-dust ratio by mass, η, must be at least on the order of unity if outflowing gas is to carry, by Epstein drag, embedded grains out of the gravity well of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>). Henceforth we will adopt as our fiducial total mass loss rate (for the relatively high value of f = 1%):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">˙ M 1255b = (1 + η) ˙ M 1255b, dust ∼ 1 M ⊕ Gyr −1 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>would lead the companion in its orbit, not trail it as is required by observation. By comparison, in our dusty wind model, there is no focussing of material at L1 because the wind is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and therefore does not conform to Roche lobe equipotentials. Moreover, stellar radiation pressure, usually neglected in standard Roche-overflow models, is crucial for diverting the flow so that it trails the planet in its orbit (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mura et al. 2011</ref>). Another alternative involves bow shocks of planets passing through stellar coronae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vidotto et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vidotto et al. , 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Llama et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tremblin &amp; Chiang 2013</ref>) which may explain the ingress-egress asymmetry observed for the exoplanet WASP-12b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fossati et al. 2010</ref>). Bow shocks between the planetary wind and the stellar wind are also expected to occur for KIC 1255b, but would be hard to detect through Kepler's broadband filter since the shocked gas alone would absorb only in narrow absorption lines. At the low gas densities characterizing exoplanet winds, only dust can generate the large continuum opacities required by the deep transits observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler. Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref> reviews these and additional arguments supporting the dust tail model. A similar interpretation was proposed for the light curve of beta Pictoris (Lecavelier Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lamers et al. 1997</ref>).</p><p>The total mass loss rate ∝ ρ int s(1 + η). Given the uncertainties in these three factors (some rough guesses: ρ int 0.5 g cm −3 for possibly porous grains; s 0.1 µm; η 1), the total mass loss rate could take any value ˙ M 1255b &gt; 0.1 M ⊕ / Gyr (but see also our Figures 8 and 10 which place upper bounds on mass loss rates). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref> claimed that the present-day mass of KIC 1255b is ∼0.1 M ⊕ . They estimated, to order-of-magnitude, the maximum planet mass that could reproduce the observed mass loss rate given by equation (5). Here we revisit the issue of planet mass -and the evaporative lifetime it implies -with a first-principles solution of the hydrodynamic equations for a planetary wind, including an explicit treatment of dust-gas thermodynamics. We will obtain not only improved estimates of the present-day mass, but also full dynamical histories of KIC 1255b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Plan of This Paper</head><p>We develop a radiative-hydrodynamic wind model to study mass loss of close-in rocky planets with dayside temperatures high enough to vaporize rock. Although our central application will be to understand KIC 1255b -both today and in the past -the model is general and can be easily be modified for parameters of other rocky planets.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. In §2 we present the model that computes ˙ M as a function of planet mass M. We give results in §3, including estimates for the maximum present-day mass and the maximum formation mass of KIC 1255b. A wide-ranging discussion of the implications of our results -including, e.g., an explanation of why mass loss in this context does not obey the often-used energy-limited mass loss formula (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>), as well as the prospects of detecting close-in Mercuries and stripped iron cores -is given in §4. Our findings are summarized in §5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE MODEL</head><p>We construct a 1D model for the thermally-driven atmospheric mass loss from a close-in rocky planet, assuming that it occurs in the form of a transonic Parker wind. The atmosphere of the planet consists of a high-metallicity gas created by the sublimation of silicates (and possibly iron, as we discuss in §4.7) from the planetary surface. We focus on the flow that streams radially toward the star from the substellar point on the planet. The substellar ray is of special interest because the mass flux it carries will be maximal insofar as the substellar point has the highest temperature -and thus the highest rate of rock sublimation -and insofar as stellar gravity will act most strongly to accelerate gas away from the planet.</p><p>As the high-metallicity gas flows away from the surface of the planet, it will expand and cool, triggering the condensation of dust grains. Dust grains can affect the outflow in several ways: (a) latent heat released during the condensation of grains will heat the gas; (b) continuously heated by starlight, grains will transfer their energy to the gas via gas-grain collisions; and (c) absorption/scattering of starlight by grains will reduce the stellar flux reaching the planet, reducing the surface temperature and sublimation rate. In this work, we do not account for the microphysics of grain condensation, as cloud formation is difficult to calculate from first principles (see, e.g., the series of five papers beginning with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Helling et al. 2001</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Helling et al. 2008a and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Helling et al. 2008b</ref>). Instead, we treat the dust-to-gas mass fraction x dust as a free function and explore how our results depend on this function. In our 1-fluid model, dust grains are perfectly entrained in the gas flow, an assumption we test a posteriori ( §4.2).</p><p>We begin in §2.1 by evaluating thermodynamic variables at the surface of the planet -the inner boundary of our model. In §2.2 we introduce the 1D equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation. In §2.3 we explain the relaxation method employed to solve the conservation laws.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Base Conditions of the Atmosphere</head><p>Dayside planet temperatures peak at approximately</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T surface ≈ T * R * a e −τ surface /4 ≈ 2150 e −τ surface /4 K,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where for our numerical evaluation we have used parameters appropriate to KIC 12557548 (orbital semimajor axis a ≈ 0.013 AU; effective stellar temperature T * ≈ 4450 K; and stellar radius R * ≈ 0.65 R ⊙ ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>). Here τ surface is the optical depth between the planet's surface and the star due to absorption/scattering by dust grains. We expect rocky extrasolar planets to consist of the same silicates predominantly found in the mantle of the Earth: pyroxene ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe,Mg]</ref>SiO 3 ) and olivine ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe,Mg]</ref> 2 SiO 4 ). At the estimated T surface , these silicates will vaporize and form an atmosphere whose equilibrium vapor pressure can be described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P vapor = exp − mL sub kT surface + b ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where m is the mass of either a pyroxene or olivine molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, L sub is the latent heat of sublimation, and b is a constant. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kimura et al. (2002)</ref> in our choice of parameters for equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7</ref> , an endmember of olivine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Nagahara et al. 1994)</ref>. For pyroxene, m = 60 m H , L sub = 9.61 × 10 10 erg g −1 , and e b = 3.13 × 10 11 dyne cm −2 ; these values were determined by Hashimoto (1990) for SiO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kimura et al. (2002)</ref> argue that the parameters for SiO 2 are appropriate for pyroxene because evaporation experiments of enstatite (MgSiO 3 ) show that SiO 2 escapes preferentially, leaving the mineral with a polycrystalline forsterite coating ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tachibana et al. 2002)</ref>. We plot equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> for both olivine and pyroxene in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schaefer &amp; Fegley (2009)</ref>, the atmosphere of a hot rocky planet at temperatures similar to T surface is primarily composed of Mg, SiO, O, and O 2 . In our model we choose a mean molecular weight for the atmospheric gas of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ = 30 m H ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>similar to the average molecular mass of Mg and SiO. Additionally, we set the adiabatic index of the gas to be γ ≡ c P /c V = 1.3, appropriate for diatomic gases at high temperatures (e.g., γ T =2000K <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lange &amp; Forker 1967</ref>). The gas density at the surface of the planet is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">H 2 = 1.318,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">ρ vapor = µP vapor kT surface .<label>(9)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Equations Solved</head><p>In our 1D hydrodynamic model, we solve the equations for mass, momentum, and energy conservation of the gas, assuming a steady flow. From mass conservation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∂ ∂r (r 2 ρv) = 0,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where r is the radial distance from the center of the planet, and ρ and v are the density and velocity of the gas. In the frame rotating at the orbital angular frequency of the planet, momentum conservation -with the Coriolis force omitted -implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ρv ∂v ∂r = − ∂P ∂r − GMρ r 2 + 3GM ⋆ ρr a 3 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where G is the gravitational constant, P = ρkT/µ is the gas pressure, T is the gas temperature, and M and M * = 0.7M ⊙ are the masses of the planet and the host star (KIC 12557548), respectively. The last term on the right-hand side of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, which we refer to as the tidal gravity term, is the sum of the centrifugal force and the gravitational attraction from the star. In deriving eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, we have neglected terms of order (r/a) 2 . We do not include the contribution of the Coriolis force because its magnitude will only be comparable to the gravitational attraction of the planet when the gas moves at bulk speeds comparable to the escape velocity of the planet at its Hill sphere (a.k.a. the Roche lobe). This generally occurs near the outer boundary of our calculation, which is set by the location of the sonic point. Although the sonic point radius and Hill sphere radius are distinct quantities, we will find in practice for our models that they are close to one another, which is not surprising since the wind most easily accelerates to supersonic velocities where the effective gravity is weakest -i.e., near the Hill sphere. The steady-state energy conservation equation, ∇ · (ρuv) = −P∇ · v + Γ, together with equation (10) and the specific internal</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">energy u = kT/[(γ − 1)µ], yields ρv ∂ ∂r kT (γ − 1)µ = kT v µ ∂ρ ∂r + Γ col + Γ lat .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The left hand side of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> tracks changes in internal energy, while the terms on the right hand side track cooling due to PdV work, heating from gas-grain collisions, and latent heat released from grain condensation. We have omitted conduction because we found it to be negligible compared to all other terms. For gas heating by dust-gas collisions, we assume that each collision between a gas molecule and a dust grain transfers an energy k(T dust − T ) to the gas molecule. Then the rate of gas heating per unit volume is</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Γ col = 3x dust 4sρ int k µ (T dust − T ) ρ 2 c s ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where x dust (r) ≡ ρ dust /ρ is the spatially varying dust-to-gas mass ratio, s = 1 µm is the assumed grain size, ρ int = 3 g cm −3 is the grain bulk density, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">c s = γkT µ<label>(14)</label></formula><p>is the sound speed of the gas. As discussed in §4.2, our assumption that micron-sized grains are entrained in the flow is valid for the lowest mass planets we consider (a group that includes, as best we will gauge, KIC 1255b) but not the highest mass planets. We adopt</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">T dust = T * R * a e −τ/4<label>(15)</label></formula><p>for simplicity, so that T dust equals T surface at the surface of the planet.

We have two reasons for choosing x dust to increase rather than decrease with increasing height. The first is physical: as the wind launches into space, it expands and cools, allowing the metal-rich vapor to more easily saturate and condense (see also §4.8). The second is motivated by observations: on length scales on the order of the stellar radius, far from the planet, the wind must have a relatively high dust content so as to produce the deep transits observed by Kepler. Of course, neither of these reasons constitutes a first-principles proof that x dust actually does increase with r.</p><p>Indeed the increasingly low density of the wind may frustrate condensation. A physics-based calculation of how grains may (or may not) form in the wind is sorely needed ( §4.8); our present study merely parameterizes this difficult problem. As dust condenses from gas and x dust rises, the gas density ρ must fall by mass conservation. For simplicity we neglect the dependence of ρ on x dust and so restrict our analysis to x dust, max ≪ 1; in practice, the maximum value of x dust, max that we consider is 10 −0.5 ≈ 0.32.</p></div>

We evaluate partial derivatives numerically, by introducing changes of order 10 −8 in dependent variables and computing the appropriate finite differences. Newton's method produces a 4N × 4N matrix, which we invert using the numpy library in python.

We then gradually added the missing physics to the code, obtaining a solution with each new physics input until the full problem was solved. Specifically, we began by solving the isothermal Parker wind problem (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lamers &amp; Cassinelli 1999</ref>). We enforced the isothermal condition by declaring γ to be unity, so that our energy equation read dT/dr = 0 (see eq. 21). Additionally, we set M * and x dust to zero to remove the effects of tidal gravity and dust. We then slowly increased each of the parameters M * , γ, and x dust (in that order) to their nominal values. Any subsequent parameter change (e.g., M) was also performed in small increments. In summary, our code contains three main input parameters: x dust, amp and x dust, max which prescribe the dust-to-gas profile x dust (r), and the planet mass M.

Although this is a highly idealized problem, its solution provides us with a starting point (i.e., an initial model) from which we are able to solve more complicated problems (see §2.3.3). Our code accepts the standard isothermal wind solution (e.g., Chapter 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lamers &amp; Cassinelli 1999</ref>) as an initial guess, with minimal relaxation.</p><p>Mass loss rates derived for the isothermal model (T =2145 K, the temperature given by eq. 6 with τ surface = τ s = 0.01) are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. They depend strongly on planet mass, with large gains in ˙ M for comparatively small reductions in M, for the basic reason that atmospheric densities are exponentially sensitive to surface gravity. Tidal gravity boosts ˙ M by reducing the total effective gravity. As M decreases, gravity becomes increasingly irrelevant, the thermal speed of the gas eventually exceeds the surface escape velocity, and the dependence of ˙ M on M weakens. In the "freestreaming" limit (dotted lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), mass loss is no longer M vs. planet mass M for isothermal dust-free winds. Solid lines are for models that include stellar tidal gravity, while dashed curves are for models that do not. As the planet mass is reduced, all solutions converge toward the free-streaming limit where ˙ M is not influenced by gravity but instead scales with the surface area of the planet (eq. 28). As inferred from observations, possible present-day mass loss rates ˙ M 1255b for KIC 1255b are marked in gray. Technically we have only a lower limit on ˙ M 1255b of 0.1M ⊕ / Gyr; for purposes of discussion throughout this paper, we adopt 0.1-1M ⊕ / Gyr as our fiducial range (see discussion surrounding equation 5). Clearly KIC 1255b cannot be a pure pyroxene planet.

For M ∼ 0.03M ⊕ , a pure olivine surface can produce a (dust-free, isothermal) wind for which ˙ M becomes compatible with the observationally inferred value for KIC 1255b, on the order of ˙ M 1255b ∼ 1 M ⊕ /Gyr (this is the observed mass loss rate for both dust and gas combined; see our discussion surrounding equation <ref type="bibr">5 and Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>). By contrast, for a pure pyroxene surface, ˙ M ≪ ˙ M 1255b always. Henceforth we will calculate the density ρ vapor of gas at the surface using parameters appropriate for olivine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Full Solution</head><p>We relax the isothermal condition in our code by slowly increasing γ from 1 to 1.3. With this parameter change, we are solving the full energy equation (eq. 12). Grains are gradually added by modifying x dust, amp and x dust, max , necessitating the calculation of optical depth (eq. 16).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> we show the solution for which ˙ M was maximized (over the space of possible values of x dust ) for M = 0.03 M ⊕ , or about half the mass of Mercury. Recall from §3.1 that when the wind was assumed to be isothermal, a planet of this mass was able c <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Radial dependence of wind properties in the full solution for a planet of mass M = 0.03M ⊕ . Parameters of the x dust function are chosen to maximize ˙ M. In the upper six panels, the full solution is shown by solid curves, while the dust-free isothermal solution is marked by dashed curves. Values for v have been normalized to the sound speed at T = 2145 K, and values for ρ have been normalized to the density ρ 0,2145K = µP vapor /(kT ) evaluated also at T = 2145 K. The ×-symbol marks the location of the sonic point (the outer boundary of our solution), which occurs close to the Hill radius R Hill (marked by a vertical line). The two lower panels show the contributions of the individual terms in the energy and momentum equations (left and right panels, respectively).</p><p>to reproduce the inferred mass loss rate of KIC 1255b. Now, with our treatment of the full energy equation and the inclusion of dust, max ˙ M plummets by a factor of 40. Relative to the isothermal solution, the reduction in mass loss rate in the full model is mainly caused by the gas temperature dropping from 2095 K at the planet surface to below 500 K at the sonic point, and the consequent reduction in gas pressure. The temperature drops because gas expands in the wind and does PdV work. Gas heating by dust-gas collisions or grain formation could, in principle, offset some of the temperature reduction, but having too many grains also obscures the surface from incident starlight, decreasing T surface and ρ vapor (the latter quantity depends exponentially on the former). The particular dustto-gas profile x dust that is used in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is such that the ability of dust to heat gas is balanced against the attenuation of stellar flux by dust, so that ˙ M is maximized (for this M). Note that the flow at the base begins with velocities of ∼10 −3 the sound speed. At these subsonic velocities, the atmosphere is practically in hydrostatic equilibrium, with gas pressure and gravity nearly balancing. Only when velocities are nearly sonic does advection become a significant term in the momentum equation (bottom right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Flow speeds are still high enough at the base of the atmosphere to lift dust grains against gravity for all but the highest planet masses considered ( §4.2; gas speeds as low as ∼1 m/s in a ∼1 µbar atmosphere can enable micron-sized grains to escape sub-Mercury-sized planets, as can be verified by equation 30; furthermore, the condition that grains not slip relative to gas is conveniently independent of gas velocity in the Epstein free-molecular drag regime, as can be seen in equation 29. Our flows are entirely in the Epstein drag regime, as explained below equation 29.)</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, we show how ˙ M and τ surface vary with the function x dust . As just discussed, max ˙ M is reached for a specific choice of parameters which balance gas heating by dust and surface obscuration by dust. (We emphasize, here and elsewhere, that we have not identified a physical reason why actual systems like KIC 1255b should have mass loss rates ˙ M that equal their theoretically allowed maximum values.) Apart from the region near the peak in ˙ M, contours of constant τ surface are roughly parallel to contours of constant ˙ M, suggesting that the value of τ surface is more important for determining ˙ M than the specific functional form of x dust . This finding increases the confidence we have in the robustness of our solution.</p><p>It is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref> that a planet of mass M = 0.03 M ⊕ can only emit winds for which max ˙ M &lt; min ˙ M 1255b ∼ 0.1M ⊕ / Gyr (at least within the context of our energy equation). In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> we show results for M = 0.01 M ⊕ , for which max ˙ M &gt; min ˙ M 1255b . For this M, the mass loss rate ˙ M is maximized when the planet surface is essentially unobscured by dust. At our arbitrarily chosen value for x dust ∼ 3×10 −7 , the wind is not significantly heated by dust and expands practically adiabatically. The maximum ˙ M is reached for an essentially dust-free solution because the wind is blowing at too high a speed for dust-gas collisions to be important. That is, the timescale over which gas travels from the planet's surface to the sonic point is shorter than the time it takes a gas particle to collide with a dust grain: gas is thermally decoupled from dust. Were we to increase x dust to make dust-gas heating important, the flow would become optically thick and the wind would shut down. If the model shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> does represent KIC 1255b, then the dust grains that occult the star must condense outside the sonic point, beyond the Hill sphere. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows the solution for M = 0.07 M ⊕ . In this case ˙ M is maximized when enough dust is present to heat the gas significantly above the adiabat. At this comparatively large planet mass, initial wind speeds are low enough that a gas particle collides many times with dust over the gas travel time, so that dust-gas collisions heat the gas effectively near the surface of the planet. Further downwind, near the sonic point, latent heating overtakes PdV cooling and actually increases the temperature of the gas with increasing altitude. The wind is much more sensitive to heating near the base of the flow than near the sonic point: if we omit latent heating from our model -so that gas cools to ∼500 K at the sonic point -then ˙ M is reduced by only a factor of two. In comparison, ˙ M drops by several orders of magnitude if dust-gas collisions are omitted.</p><p>The dependence of ˙ M on x dust in both the "dust-free lowmass" and the "dusty high-mass" limits is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. In the low-mass limit, ˙ M = max ˙ M when no dust is present. In this regime, gas moves too quickly for heating by dust to be significant; dust influences the flow only by attenuating starlight, and as long as τ surface ≪ 1, dust hardly affects ˙ M. By contrast, in the high-mass limit, ˙ M = max ˙ M for the dustiest flows we consider (i.e., the high- est values of x dust, max ). In this regime, ˙ M is very sensitive to dust abundance, with values spanning six orders of magnitude over the explored parameter space.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> we show mass loss rates as a function of planet mass for the full model. We emphasize that these are maximum mass loss rates, found by varying x dust . At low planet masses, max ˙ M for the full model converges with ˙ M for the isothermal model because both approach the free-streaming limit, where gravity becomes irrelevant and ˙ M is set entirely by conditions at the surface of the planet (eq. 28). To reach ˙ M 1255b &gt; 0.1M ⊕ / Gyr, the present-day mass of KIC 1255b must be 0.02 M ⊕ , or less than about twice a lunar mass.</p><p>We have verified a posteriori for the models shown in <ref type="figure">Figures  3, 5</ref>, and 6 that the sonic point is attained at an altitude where the collisional mean free path of gas molecules is smaller than r s , so that the hydrodynamic approximation embodied in equations (10)-(12) is valid. In other words, the exobase lies outside the sonic point in these ˙ M = max ˙ M models. The margin of safety is largest for the lowest mass models.</p></div>

Before we integrate, however, we introduce 0 &lt; f duty &lt; 1 to account for the duty cycle of the wind: we define f duty · max ˙ M as the time-averaged mass-loss rate. We estimate that f duty ∼ 0.5 based on the statistics of transit depths compiled by <ref type="bibr">Brogi et al. (2012, see their</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref>). We timeintegrate f duty · max ˙ M to obtain the M(t) curves shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>(This factor of 2 correction for the duty cycle should not obscure the fact that the actual mass loss rate, time-averaged or otherwise, could still be much lower than the theoretically allowed max ˙ M, a possibility we return to throughout this paper.)</p><p>We highlight the case of a planet with a lifetime of t life = 5 Gyr. Under our full (non-isothermal) model (right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure  9</ref>), such a planet has a mass at formation of 0.06 M ⊕ and gradually erodes over several Gyr until it reaches M ∼ 0.03 M ⊕ -whereupon the remaining mass is lost catastrophically over a short time (just how short is estimated for the specific case of KIC 1255b below). Contrast this example with planets having initial masses 0.07 M ⊕ -these have such low ˙ M that they barely lose any mass over Gyr timescales.</p><p>For comparison, we also present mass-loss histories using a dust-free isothermal model with stellar tidal gravity (left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Compared to our non-isothermal solutions -for which gas temperatures fall immediately as the wind lifts off the planet surface -the isothermal solution corresponds to a flow which stays relatively pressurized and which therefore enjoys the largest ˙ M for a given M. The isothermal wind thus represents an endmember case. However, the mass-loss histories under the isothermal approximation do not differ qualitatively from those using the full energy equation. For isothermal winds, the dividing mass between planet survival and destruction within 10 Gyr is about 0.11 M ⊕ , only ∼40% larger than the value cited above for our non-isothermal solutions.</p><p>c <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Same as <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, but for a planet of mass M = 0.01M ⊕ . For this planet mass, ˙ M is maximized when essentially no dust is present (i.e., the atmosphere is essentially transparent) as gas moves too quickly for dust-gas collisions to heat the gas. As such, all heating terms are negligible and the gas expands adiabatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Possible Mass Loss Histories for KIC 1255b</head><p>Figures 8 and 9 can be used to sketch possible mass-loss histories for KIC 1255b. For our first scenario, we employ the full model that solves the full energy equation. Today, to satisfy the observational constraint that ˙ M 1255b &gt; 0.1 M ⊕ /Gyr (see the derivation of our equation 5), the planet must have a present-day mass of at most M ≈ 0.02 M ⊕ , or roughly twice the mass of the Moon <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig- ure 8)</ref>. Such a low mass implies that currently KIC 1255b is in a "catastrophic evaporation" phase (vertical straight lines in <ref type="figure">Figure  9</ref>). Depending on the age of the planet (i.e., the age of the star: 1-10 Gyr), KIC 1255b originally had a mass of at most 0.04-0.07 M ⊕ : 2-4 times its maximum current mass, or about the mass of Mercury. Starting from today, the time the planet has before it disintegrates completely is on the order of t evap ∼ M/( f duty · max ˙ M), which is as long as 400 (40) Myr for M = 0.02 M ⊕ , f duty = 0.5, and max ˙ M = 0.1 (1) M ⊕ / Gyr. If our energy equation were somehow in error and the wind better described as isothermal, then the numbers cited above would change somewhat. The present-day mass of KIC 1255b would be at most M ∼ 0.07M ⊕ ; the maximum formation mass would be between 0.08-0.11 M ⊕ ; and the evaporation timescale starting from today could be as long as t evap ∼ 400 Myr if the present-day mass M ∼ 0.07M ⊕ .</p><p>As we have stressed throughout, a critical assumption we have made is that the time-averaged mass loss rate is f duty · max ˙ M with f duty as high as 0.5. We have not identified a physical reason why the actual mass loss rate should be comparable to the theoretically allowed max ˙ M for a given M. If our assumption were in error and actual mass loss rates ˙ M ≪ max ˙ M, then the present-day mass of KIC 1255b, the corresponding evaporation time, and the formation mass of KIC 1255 would all decrease from the upper bounds cited above.</p><p>The degeneracy of possible masses and evaporative histories outlined in this section could be broken with observational searches for the progenitors of KIC 1255b-like objects ( §4.6).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mass Loss is Not Energy-Limited</head><p>Atmospheric mass loss rates are commonly assumed to be "UVenergy-limited": it is assumed that a fixed, order-unity fraction ǫ of the incident UV flux F UV does PdV work and lifts material out of the planet's gravitational well. Under the energy-limited assumption, the mass loss rate is ˙ M ∼ ǫπR 2 F UV /(GM/R). The validity of this formula has been tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Watson et al. (1981)</ref> for terrestrial atmospheres and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref> for hot Jupiters.</p><p>The energy-limited formula does not apply at all to the evaporating rocky planets considered in this paper. The stellar UV flux is not essential for low-mass planets because their escape velocities are so small that energy deposition by photoionization is not necessary for driving a wind. Even optical photons -essentially the stellar bolometric spectrum -can vaporize close-in planets. Merely replacing F UV with F bolometric in the energy-limited formula would still be misleading, however, because most of the incident energy is radiated away and does no mechanical work. More to the point, ǫ is not constant; as discussed in §3.2, the energetics of the flow changes qualitatively with planet mass. If we were to insist on using the energy-limited formula, we would find ǫ ∼ 10 −8 for M ∼ 0.1M ⊕ , and ǫ ∼ 10 −4 for M ∼ 0.01M ⊕ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>).</p></div>

Such changes would cause ˙ M to drop by more than a factor of 10, because ˙ M scales super-linearly with ρ vapor : a linear dependence results simply because ˙ M scales with gas density, while an additional dependence arises because the wind speed increases with the gas pressure gradient, which in turn scales as ρ vapor T surface .</p><p>To reproduce the orbit-to-orbit variations in transit depth observed for KIC 1255b, the dynamical time t dyn of the wind cannot be much longer than the planet's orbital period of P orb = 15.7 hr.

The first integral is performed numerically using our full model (upper left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), while the second integral is estimated to order-of-magnitude using a characteristic grain velocity (well outside the planet's Hill sphere) of v 2 ∼ 10 km s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>; see their equation 6 and related commentary). Since t dyn P orb , we conclude that the wind/cometary tail can refresh itself quickly enough to change its appearance from orbit to orbit. We can go one step further. The timescale over which ˙ M changes should be the timescale over which the stellar insolation at the planetary surface changes -in other words, the timescale over which the "weather" at the substellar point, where the wind is launched, changes from, e.g., "overcast" to "clear". Ignoring the possibility of volcanic eruptions, we estimate this variability timescale as the time for the wind to reach the Hill sphere boundary, at which point the Coriolis force has turned the wind by an order-unity angle away from the substellar ray joining the planet to the star (i.e., beyond the Hill sphere, the dust-laden wind no longer blocks stellar radiation from hitting the substellar region where the wind is launched). Because the Hill radius is situated near the sonic point, this variability timescale is given approximately by the first integral in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref>: t a dyn ≈ 13 hr. The fact that t a dyn is neither much shorter than nor much longer than P orb supports our proposal that the observed time variability of KIC 1255b is driven by a kind of limit cycle involving stellar insolation and mass loss. Clearly if t a dyn ≫ P orb , orbit-to-orbit variations in ˙ M would be impossible. Conversely, if t a dyn ≪ P orb -or more precisely if t a dyn were much shorter than the transit duration of 1.5 hr -then the wind would vary so rapidly that each transit observation would time-integrate over many cycles, yielding a smeared-out average transit depth that would not vary from orbit to orbit as is observed.</p></div>

The implied order-of-magnitude variations in ˙ M can be explained in principle by the exponential sensitivity of ˙ M to conditions at the planet surface. The dynamical "refresh" timescale of the wind t dyn ∼ 14 h is similar to the orbital period P orb = 15.7 h. This supports our dusty wind model because were t dyn ≫ P orb or t dyn ≪ P orb , then eclipse depths would correlate from orbit to orbit, in violation of the observations. (v) Progenitors and occurrence rates KIC 1255b's current catastrophic mass loss phase may represent only the final few percent of the planet's life. As such, for every KIC 1255b-like object, there could be anywhere from 10 to 100 larger planets in earlier stages of mass loss. These close-in, relatively quiescent progenitors may be detectable by Kepler through conventional "hard-sphere" transits if they are as large as Mercury.</p><p>We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the progenitors are lunar-sized or even smaller. If KIC 1255b remains the only catastrophically evaporating planet in the Kepler database, then the occurrence rate of close-in progenitors orbiting K-stars with sub-day periods is &gt; 0.1%, with larger occurrence rates for progenitors increasingly smaller than Mercury. (vi) Iron planet KIC 1255b may have lost ∼70% of its formation mass to its thermal wind. It seems possible that today only the iron core of KIC 1255b remains and is evaporating. Transmission spectra of the occulting dust cloud might reveal whether the planet's surface is composed primarily of iron or silicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(vii) Future modelling and observations</head><p>Keeping the wind hot as it lifts off the planet surface significantly enhances mass loss rates. In our model we have included heating of the gas by micron-sized grains embedded in the flow. But these grains can also shadow the surface from starlight and reduce ˙ M if they are too abundant. Additional heating may be provided by super-blackbody grains with sizes ≪ 1 µm which do not significantly attenuate starlight. Future models should incorporate such tiny condensates -and treat the dusty comet-like tail that our paper has completely ignored. More information about grain size distributions and compositions might be revealed by Hubble observations of KIC 12557548 scheduled for early 2013.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Solid lines are for models that include stellar tidal gravity, while dashed curves are for models that do not. As the planet mass is reduced, all solutions converge toward the free-streaming limit where ˙ M is not influenced by gravity but instead scales with the surface area of the planet (eq. 28). As inferred from observations, possible present-day mass loss rates ˙ M 1255b for KIC 1255b are marked in gray. Technically we have only a lower limit on ˙ M 1255b of 0.1M ⊕ / Gyr; for purposes of discussion throughout this paper, we adopt 0.1-1M ⊕ / Gyr as our fiducial range (see discussion surrounding equation 5). Clearly KIC 1255b cannot be a pure pyroxene planet. Subsequent figures will refer to planets with pure olivine surfaces (except in §4.7 where we consider iron).</figDesc></figure>

The dust abundance parameters x dust, max and x dust, amp are defined in equation (19); see also Figure 3. Both parameters are varied independently to find the maximum ˙ M, which occurs at log(x dust, amp , x dust, max ) ∼ (1.7, −2.2). The full model corresponding to this maximum ˙ M is detailed in Figure 3. Each black dot corresponds to a full model solution. Colour contours for ˙ M are interpolated using a cubic polynomial. Right panel: Optical depth τ surface between the star and the planetary surface as a function of dust abundance for a planet of mass M = 0.03M ⊕ .

Right panel: Same as left panel, but for a planet of mass M = 0.1M ⊕ . In this high-mass limit, ˙ M is maximized for the dustiest flows we consider (i.e., the highest values of x dust,max ) because flow speeds near the surface are slow enough for dust-gas energy exchange to be significant.</figDesc></figure>

At each ×-marked mass, max ˙ M was found by varying x dust as described, e.g., in Figure 4. The solid curve is a cubic spline interpolation. Mass loss rates for the full model are generally lower than for the isothermal model (dashed curve) because the dust-gas heating terms we have included in our full model turn out to be inefficient. At low planet masses, the isothermal and full models converge because both approach the free-streaming limit, where gravity becomes irrelevant and ˙ M is set entirely by conditions at the surface (i.e., surface area, equilibrium vapor pressure, and sound speed; eq. 28). According to the full model, the present-day mass of KIC 1255b is 0.02 M ⊕ , or less than twice the mass of the Moon; for such masses, max ˙ M &gt; min ˙ M 1255b ∼ 0.1 M ⊕ / Gyr.</figDesc></figure>

In the low-M, free-streaming limit, the higher vapor pressure of iron allows for a higher ˙ M than for olivine. At larger M, mass loss rates are lower for iron planets than for olivine planets because of the higher molecular weight of iron. Our estimate for the maximum present-day mass of KIC 1255b varies by a factor of two between the iron and olivine scenarios.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> These stellar wind parameters are appropriate for the &quot;slow&quot; Solar wind blowing primarily near the equatorial plane of the Sun. In addition, the Solar wind also contains a &quot;fast&quot; component which emerges from coronal holes. During Solar minimum, the fast Solar wind is confined mainly to large heliographic latitudes, but may reach the equator plane during periods of increased solar activity (Kohl et al. 1998; McComas et al. 2003). Because most planets are expected to orbit near their stellar equatorial planes, we take the slow component of the Solar wind to be a better guide.</note>
