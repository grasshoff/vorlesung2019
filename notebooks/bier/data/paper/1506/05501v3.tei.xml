			<abstract>
				<p>We present a self-consistent formalism for computing and understanding the atmospheric chemistry of exo-planets from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist. Starting from the first law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that the van&apos;t Hoff equation (which describes the equilibrium constant), Arrhenius equation (which describes the rate coefficients) and procedures associated with the Gibbs free energy (minimisation, rescaling) have a common physical and mathematical origin. We address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium constant, which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate coefficients, and restate its two definitions. By necessity, one of the equilibrium constants must be dimensionless and equate to an exponential function involving the Gibbs free energy, while the other is a ratio of rate coefficients and must therefore possess physical units. We demonstrate that the Arrhenius equation takes on a functional form that is more general than previously stated without recourse to tagging on ad hoc functional forms. Finally, we derive analytical models of chemical systems, in equilibrium, with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. We include acetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends, versus temperature and carbon-to-oxygen ratio, published in the literature. The rich variety of behavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio is merely the outcome of stoichiometric book-keeping and not the direct consequence of temperature or pressure variations.</p>

Despite its somewhat late start in the study of exoplanets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zahnle et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Moses et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Moses et al. , 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hu, Seager &amp; Bains 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Madhusudhan 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Line &amp; Yung 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blecic et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Venot et al. 2015</ref>), atmospheric chemistry has a long and rich history in the Earth and planetary sciences and the study of brown dwarfs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Prinn &amp; Barshay 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barshay &amp; Lewis 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen &amp; Yung 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fegley &amp; Lodders 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lodders &amp; Fegley 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ciesla &amp; Charnley 2006</ref>). Yet, a first-principles, self-consistent formalism that unifies all of the quantities and terminology in a form that is useful for astrophysicists is missing from the literature. For example, there is more than one definition of the "equilibrium constant".</p><p>Within the same framework, we demonstrate that the van't Hoff equation (which describes the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant), the Arrhenius equation (which describes the rate coefficients) and procedures associated with the Gibbs free energy (minimisation and scaling) all originate from the first law of thermodynamics. The foundations of atmospheric chemistry are built upon statistical mechanics, since the first law derives from it. To demonstrate the usefulness of our formalism, we use it to compute analytical solutions of chemical systems with pure hydrogen and with carbon, oxygen and hydrogen (gas phase only); we show that these solutions generalise the work of Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999) and correctly reproduce all of the expected trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Survey of monographs</head><p>The novelty of the present study is not in the individual formulae stated, which are mostly previously known; with one exception, we certainly do not claim to be the first to derive these formulae. Rather, it is in the way these results are derived and unified under a common, self-consistent, mathematical formalism that is accessible and palatable to astrophysicists (rather than to chemists). We will now demonstrate this claim of novelty by surveying several textbooks in chemistry.</p><p>Specifically, equations (5), (7), (10), (13), (17) and (22) are commonly stated in textbooks. Our intention is to weave a common mathematical thread between them.

None of these monographs derive the generalised form of the Arrhenius equation that we present in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> or the generalisation of the Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999) analytical solutions we present in §4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">GENERAL SETUP</head><p>In general terms, we consider a chemical reaction involving a pair of reactants (X 1 and X 2 ), which produces a pair of products (Z 1 and Z 2 ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a 1 X 1 + a 2 X 2 ⇆ b 1 Z 1 + b 2 Z 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a 1 , a 2 , b 1 and b 2 are the stoichiometric coefficients.

Gibbs free energy minimisation Generally, the entropy of a system increases according to the second law of thermodynamics; at constant temperature and pressure, its Gibbs free energy generally decreases and seeks a minimum. If one is interested in solving for the chemical equilibrium of a network of reactions, then one needs to minimise the Gibbs free energy of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(van Zeggeren &amp; Storey 1970)</ref>. Within the context of our formalism, we will now elucidate the exact expressions involved in this minimisation. Generally, we have C j = C j (T, P ) and equation (5) cannot be straightforwardly integrated.

Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> is the quantity we need to minimise, but we need additional equations to close the system. In the absence of nuclear reactions, this arises naturally from the notion that the elemental building blocks of molecules cannot be created or destroyed. Thus, the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc, atoms in a system is invariant between the reactants and the products, whether they exist in their atomic form or are sequestered in molecules.

The equilibrium constant: more than one definition A persistent source of confusion exists in the literature regarding the definition of the equilibrium constant. Several references list it as being composed of a series of partial pressures associated with the reactants and products and equates it to an exponential term involving the Gibbs free energy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jacobson 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Visscher &amp; Moses 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kopparapu, Kasting &amp; Zahnle 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Line &amp; Yung 2013)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">K eq,literature = P b1 Z1 P b2 Z2 P a1 X1 P a2 X2 .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Taken at face value, the partial pressure has physical units.</p><p>Since the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants (a 1 + a 2 ) and the products (b 1 + b 2 ) are generally unequal, K eq,literature must generally have physical units and cannot be equated to an exponential term (which is by definition dimensionless), unless the partial pressures have somehow been normalised. It is not always explicitly explained that this normalisation has been performed. Several monographs have previously mentioned this normalisation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fermi 1936;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moore 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smith &amp; Missen 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atkins &amp; de Paula 2006</ref>), but we will now provide a derivation that is consistent with the rest of our formalism.</p><p>To derive the equilibrium constant, we return to equation (5) and consider it in the limit of dT = 0 and dN j = 0. If we invoke the ideal gas law (P = ρRT ), then we obtain (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eisenberg &amp; Crothers 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DeVoe 2015</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">G = G 0 + RT ln P P 0 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where P 0 is a reference pressure, R is the specific gas constant and G 0 ≡ G(P 0 , T ).

The factors of P 0 appear without being inserted in an ad hoc manner. Physically, the system adjusts itself until it reaches chemical equilibrium, which occurs when ∆G = 0. Let the reference state, characterised by P 0 , not be in equilibrium, such that ∆G 0 = 0. If one is referring to a molecule, then ∆G 0 is the energy needed to construct it from its constituent atoms-it is the Gibbs free energy of formation. If one is referring to mixtures of molecules, then ∆G 0 is the difference in the Gibbs free energies of formation between the reactants and products.

Our derivation demonstrates that there is a sound basis to including these terms. Thus, the Arrhenius equations attain a status that is elevated above that of mere ad hoc fitting functions. Typically, c f = 0 and c r = 0 suffice for low temperatures; "non-Arrhenius" behavior, where c f = 0 and c r = 0, is important at high temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Glassman, Yetter &amp; Glumac 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Kinetic theory states that the rate coefficient is given by σ coll v rel , where σ coll is the cross section for collisions between the reactants and v rel is the relative velocity between them.

If σ coll depends on the relative velocity, then more general power-law dependences on T are possible. The Arrhenius equations do not account for three-body reactions. When the number density of the third body is low, the reaction rate is linearly proportional to it. As it increases, a point is reached where the reaction rate saturates to a limiting value. Fitting functions for implementing this saturation effect have previously been given by, for example, Visscher &amp; Moses (2011).</p></div>
