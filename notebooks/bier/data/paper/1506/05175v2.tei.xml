			<abstract>
				<p>Many exoplanets have now been detected in orbits with ultra-short periods, very close to the Roche limit. Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (&quot;stable mass transfer&quot; in the language of binary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code MESA. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation and photo-evaporation of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have a rocky core and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via photo-evaporation at nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets (M pl 5 M ⊕) in ultra-short periods (P orb &lt; 1 d) cannot be produced through this type of evolution.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">STELLAR AND PLANETARY MODELS</head><p>The stellar and planetary models adopted in this work are computed with MESA (version 7184; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Paxton et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paxton et al. , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paxton et al. , 2015</ref>). In particular, the planets are created and evolved closely following the test suite make planets provided within MESA and the input files yielding <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paxton et al. (2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . In what follows we give specifications only for those MESA parameters that are changed from the values adopted in these input files.</p><p>In all our calculations, we consider a 1 M ⊙ star paired with a 1 M J planet. We assume solar composition (Y = 0.27, Z = 0.02) for both the star and planet envelope, and keep the mixing length parameter α MLT to MESA's default value of 2. For the planet, we expand on our previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. 2014</ref>) and consider models with solid cores of masses M c = 1 M ⊕ , 5 M ⊕ , 10 M ⊕ , 15 M ⊕ and, 30 M ⊕ . For the cores, we use a constant density of 5 g cm −3 , following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batygin &amp; Stevenson (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, we take the heat-flux arising from radioactive decay in the core to be zero, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>. As these authors point out, this is a common assumption in evolutionary models of Jupiter-and Saturn-type planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hubbard 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Saumon et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fortney &amp; Hubbard 2003)</ref>, as this approach introduces a small error compared to other unknowns entering the problem. However, we note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref> found such heating to play an important role in delaying cooling and contraction, particularly for planets less than 5M ⊕ . This could lead to an underestimate of the radii of sub-Neptune planets, especially at ages ≤ 1 Gyr. Below we focus on planetary models at least 2 Gyr old.</p><p>We account for the effects of irradiation and photoevaporation as follows. For irradiation, we use the F * − Σ pl surface heating function. Here F * is the day-side flux from the star at the substellar point, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F * = σ T 4 * R * a 2 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The planet equilibrium temperature, T eq , is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T eq = T * R * 2a 1/2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Saumon et al. 1996</ref>) so that the power received from the host star could be radiated away in equilibrium if the planet had this temperature over its entire surface. The parameter Σ pl is the column depth reached by irradiation. Here we adopt a value of Σ pl = 1 g/cm 2 , which yields planetary mass-radius relations in agreement with detailed models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, within a few percent for highly irradiated planets, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>. We discuss the effect of varying Σ pl in Section 4.1.3. In what follows, the planetary radius corresponds to an optical depth τ = 2/3. Irradiation leads to photo-evaporative ('PE') mass loss from the planet. Specifically, this process is thought to be most efficient when a hot Jupiter is strongly irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray photons, which photo-ionize atomic H in the planetary atmosphere. The resulting heat input, when high enough to induce temperatures corresponding to the escape velocity, can cause outflows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref> identified two regimes, based on the stellar flux F XUV (however, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Owen &amp; Alvarez 2015)</ref>. For large F XUV , like those typical of T-Tauri stars ( 10 5 erg cm −2 s −1 ) the mass loss is "radiation/recombination" limited and it is described No core <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Planetary mass-radius relations at 4.5 Gyr for different core masses and equilibrium temperatures. From top to bottom: core-less planets, Mc = 10 M ⊕ , and 25 M ⊕ , as illustrative examples. The solid lines are the models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> (from <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> of their paper) at an equilibrium temperature of 78 K (light grey), 1300 K (dark grey), and 1960 K (black). The data points are the models computed with MESA for Σ pl set to 1 g/cm 2 ("× ′′ ) and 100 g/cm 2 (" "). Varying Σ pl between 0.1−1 g/cm 2 makes no significant difference. The value of Σ pl is not important for Teq ≤ 1300K (symbols overlap). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, the radii correspond to a pressure of ∼1 bar. We note that the initial value of the planetary radius required by the create initial model routine (see Section 2.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paxton et al. 2013</ref>) was varied between 2−5 R J to facilitate MESA's convergence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">by ˙ M rr−lim ∼ 4 × 10 12 F XUV 5 × 10 5 erg cm −2 s −1 1/2 g s −1 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For lower F XUV values the mass loss is "energy limited" and it is described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erkaev et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">˙ M e−lim ≈ ǫπF XUV R 3 XUV GM p K tide ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K tide = 1 − (3/2)(1/ξ) + (1/2)(1/ξ 3 ) and ξ = R Hill /R XUV .</formula><p>Since in all our calculations F XUV (computed as described below) remains below 10 5 erg cm −2 s −1 , we use only Eqn.

However, we discuss whether our results are sensitive to the photoevaporation prescription in Section 4.1.4 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>For the flux, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ribas et al.

The parameter ǫ represents the efficiency of converting F XUV into usable work, while R XUV is the radius of the planet at which the atmosphere becomes optically thick to XUV photons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref> place R XUV at a surface pressure of ∼ 10 −9 bar, which corresponds to a radius that is typically 10%−20% greater than the optical photosphere <ref type="bibr">(Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013, hereafter LF13</ref>). Here we closely follow the recent results of LF13 and adopt ǫ = 0.1. We note, however, that hydrodynamic calculations suggest that ǫ can vary between 0.01−0.2, depending on the mass of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Owen &amp; Jackson 2012</ref>). With ǫ = 0.1, the R XUV value that better matches the results of detailed numerical calculations by LF13 for systems 1−10 Gyr old is R XUV = 1.2 R pl (see below) and we use this estimate of R XUV throughout our calculations 6 . Finally, K tide is to account for the fact that the mass leaving the planet needs only to reach the Hill radius to escape, where <ref type="bibr">et al. 2007</ref>). We test the implementation of photo-evaporation by comparing with the mass loss calculations presented by LF13 for the planet Kepler-36c. These are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Following their work, we create a 9.4 M ⊕ , 10 Myr old irradiated planet with a core of 7.4 M ⊕ and Z = 0.35. We adopt T eq = 930 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carter et al. 2012</ref> reports T eq = 928 ± 10 K) and evolve the planetary model with irradiation (fixed) and photo-evaporation, according to Eqn. (4). The parameters adopted in this work are those yielding agreement with LF13 within a few percent for 1−10 Gyr old systems (black solid line).</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R Hill = M 1/3 pl (3M * ) −1/3 a (Erkaev</formula><p>3. ORBITAL EVOLUTION MODEL MESA allows us to track the evolution of both the planet and star simultaneously, while orbital evolution is followed by taking into account changes to the orbital angular momentum of the system. Below we describe the physical mechanisms included in our model: photo-evaporation ('PE'), tides, magnetic braking ('MB'; Skumanich 1972), and RLO. For simplicity, we neglect the effects of stellar wind mass loss. From the wind prescription provided in MESA's test suite 1M pre ms to wd for the evolution of a 1M ⊙ star (Bloecker 1995; Reimers <ref type="bibr">6</ref> MESA uses automatic mesh refinement, thus adjusting the number of mesh points of the planetary model at the beginning of each timestep, if necessary. For this reason, the point at the surface where the pressure is ∼ 10 −9 bar is not always resolved. The parameter Σ pl was set to 1 g cm −2 . For F XUV , we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ribas et al. (2005)</ref>, but rescale the flux at the Kepler-36c orbital separation (a = 0.12 AU). As in LF13, we keep F XUV constant at the 100 Myr value when the star is younger than 100 Myr and we let it evolve when the star is older than 100 Myr. Here we assume a 1 M ⊙ companion. At the surface (τ = 2/3), the pressure is ∼ 10 mbar (where LF13 place the transiting radius).</p><p>1975), we find that the orbital evolution timescales associated with stellar winds are longer than 10 12 yr throughout the main-sequence evolution of the host star.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Tides</head><p>Tides affect the stellar and planetary spins, as well as the orbital separation, transferring angular momentum between the orbit and the components' spin. Within MESA, tides are first applied to the spins. The orbital separation is then varied so as to conserve total angular momentum. Here we take the components to be rotating as solid bodies <ref type="bibr">(however, see Stevenson 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barker et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>For stellar tides we proceed as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Valsecchi &amp; Rasio (2014a,b)</ref>. Specifically, we adopt the weak-friction approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Zahn 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Zahn , 1989</ref>) using a parametrization for tidal dissipation calibrated from observations of stellar binaries, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hurley et al. (2002)</ref>. This assumes that tides are dissipated in the stellar convection zone via eddy viscosity. Furthermore, we reduce the efficiency of tides at high tidal forcing frequencies (when the forcing frequency is higher than the convective turnover frequency of the largest eddies) linearly, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zahn (1966)</ref>, and as suggested by recent numerical results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Penev et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>For planetary tides, we assume they efficiently maintain the planet in a tidally locked configuration (Ω pl = Ω o ) throughout the evolution. In fact, for a tidal quality factor Q ′ = 10 6 (typical for gas giants) and a nearly synchronized planet 7 , the spin synchronization timescale due to static tides in the planet is ∼ 2−4 orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale related to the main driver of the orbital evolution (i.e., mass loss from the planet; see Section 4), depending on the core mass. Clearly, tides would synchronize the planet even faster for lower values of Q ′ more appropriate for rocky planets. We further discuss tidal locking for the planet in Section 5.</p><p>Even though our calculations account for tides in both components, our results show that only stellar tides can affect the orbital separation significantly. In particular, for a slowly spinning stellar host, tides transfer angular momentum from the orbit to the stellar spin, causing orbital decay.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Stable Conservative Mass Transfer</head><p>During conservative MT, the evolution of J orb is generally computed under the assumption that MT proceeds through an accretion disk. In the standard picture, the matter flowing through the inner Langrangian point appears to be pushed into orbit about the host star by Coriolis forces (as viewed in the corotating frame). Subsequently, viscous stresses spread this material into a disk around the accretor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Frank et al. 1985)</ref>. This disk transports mass toward the accretor and angular momentum away from it. The latter is eventually returned to the orbit via torques operating between the donor and the outer edge of the disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lin &amp; Papaloizou 1979</ref>) and a small residual angular momentum is transferred to the spin of the star. Our calculations with MESA include spin-up through accretion. However, as the material accreted by the star is only a tiny fraction of its total mass, spin-up due to accretion is negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Stable Non-Conservative Mass Transfer</head><p>During non-conservative MT, changes in J orb are computed as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Soberman et al.

This mass is then lost from the system, taking with it the specific angular momentum of the ring. The remaining fraction of the mass (1 − δ) is assumed to be accreted onto the host star. Below we describe our choices for γ and δ, based on the expected stability of MT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">Considerations on the Stability of Mass Transfer</head><p>The calculations presented in Section 4 show that conservative MT is always stable. Instead, some care must be taken when considering non-conservative MT.</p><p>For the systems under consideration, the stability of the MT phase depends mainly on the fraction of planetary mass leaving the system, its specific angular momentum, and the response of the planet to mass loss. For a mass-losing planet the latter cannot be determined a priori and it is computed with MESA as the orbital evolution proceeds. We also have no prior knowledge of the values of γ and δ (the parameters regulating the amount of mass leaving the system and how much specific angular momentum is carried away) that correspond to dynamical stability of MT. However, some guidance on the region of stability can be gained as follows. For systems with extreme mass ratios (q ≪ 1, such as those considered here) and ˙ J orb /J orb given by Eqns. (6) and (9), the planetary mass during RLO changes according to (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rappaport et al. 1982</ref> for a derivation)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">˙ M pl,RLO M pl ≃ − ˙ J orb J orb tides + 1 2 ˙ R pl R pl therm − ˙ M pl,PE M pl ( 1 6 − ξ 2 ) ξ 2 − δγ + 5 6 .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Here ( ˙ R pl /R pl ) therm is the fractional rate of change of the planet radius due to its thermal evolution and ( ˙ J orb /J orb ) tides is the fractional rate of change in orbital angular momentum due to tides. Finally, ξ = (d lnR pl /d lnM pl ) ad is the planet's adiabatic logarithmic derivative of radius with respect to mass, not to be confused with the mass-radius relations in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, valid for thermal equilibrium models. A necessary condition for stable MT is that the denominator of Eqn. (11) be positive.</p><p>Our goal here is to improve on the stable MT calculations presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref> by investigating the importance of irradiation effects and self-consistent models for the planet. To explore MT stability in the present work, we set δ = 1 and consider γ values for which the MT is expected to be dynamically stable. There is no loss of generality in this prescription since γ and δ appear only as a product in Eqn. (11). We discuss possible realistic mass transfer configurations in Section 5, while reserving a more detailed analysis of MT stability in hot-Jupiter systems to a future study. Such analysis should account for a broad range of γ and δ values, as well as initial orbital configurations and properties of the components (e.g., M * , M pl , and metallicity; see Section 6).</p><p>With δ = 1 and γ = 0 we are assuming that all RLO material leaves the system carrying away a specific angular momentum equal to γ √ GM * a. The condition for stability, i.e., the requirement of a positive denominator in Eqn. (11), then reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">γ &lt; 5 6 + ξ 2 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> shows that an increase in the planetary radius with adiabatic mass loss (i.e., ξ &lt; 0) has a destabilizing effect, as expected. We test different values of γ with MESA and find that, depending on the planetary core mass, M c , the computation becomes numerically difficult for γ values higher than about 0.6 − 0.8. This suggests that the MT may indeed become dynamically unstable and that, according to the criterion in Eqn. (12), ξ is inferred to be close to zero. To avoid the instability region, while still considering somewhat significant angular momentum loss from the system, we provide examples for non-conservative MT with γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.6 for the 1 M ⊕ and 5 M ⊕ core cases, respectively, and γ = 0.7 for the higher core masses. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>. RESULTS We consider a typical hot-Jupiter system comprising a 1M ⊙ star and a 1M J planet at solar metallicity. For the planet we took M c = 1 M ⊕ , 5 M ⊕ , 10 M ⊕ , 15 M ⊕ and, 30 M ⊕ . The initial period was set to P orb = 0.7 d in all cases. This corresponds to the orbital period at which a hot Jupiter with a 1.5R J radius would be at its Roche limit and it is chosen arbitrarily to have all systems starting with the same initial period "close enough" to the Roche limit.</p><p>For the initial systems' age we chose 2 Gyr (t ≃ 20% t MS ), as it is at the low end of the ages of the currently known hot Jupiters closest to their Rochelimit separation (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> in Valsecchi &amp; Rasio 2014a and references therein; see also Section 5). Accordingly, we create 2 Gyr old stellar and planetary models with MESA's "single-star" module. Each planet is irradiated according to the host star properties at 2 Gyr and the 0.7 d period (F * = 5.4 × 10 9 erg cm −2 s −1 ).</p><p>The models are then used in MESA's "binary" module to compute the orbital evolution. During this step both stellar and planetary evolution, as well as irradiation and photo-evaporation are computed self-consistently (Section 2). For the stellar spin, we choose an initial value of Ω * ∼ 0.1 Ω o , where Ω o is the orbital frequency. This is consistent with the observed slow stellar rotation rates for the tightest hot-Jupiter systems known (Ω * ≃ 0.1 − 0.2 Ω o ; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Valsecchi &amp; Rasio 2014a</ref>). Finally, as described in Section 3.4, we consider both conservative and non-conservative MT.</p><p>The results are presented as follows. In Section 4.1 we describe in detail the evolution of the 5 M ⊕ and 30 M ⊕ planetary core cases. We take these as extreme examples among those considered here. In fact, as described below (Section 4.2), the behavior of the 1 M ⊕ core model needs a more in-depth investigation. For M c = 5 M ⊕ and M c = 30 M ⊕ , we mainly focus on the non-conservative MT evolution and briefly describe the conservative case at the end of each section. For these same core masses, we also investigate the effect of varying the column density for irradiation in Section 4.1.3, and the photo-evaporation recipe in Section 4.1.4. In Section 4.2 we present an overview of how the orbital period evolves as the planet loses mass, as well as how the planetary radius evolves with mass, for the full range of core masses. A summary of the results for all core masses and physical assumptions is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. In all examples considered, the evolution is quite rapid after the planet is left with only a few percent of the envelope mass. Thus, we discuss the final stages of the planetary evolution qualitatively, guided by the relevant timescales entering the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Detailed Examples: Different Core Masses</head><p>4.1.1. The 5 M⊕ Core Model <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the evolution of a Jupiter with a 5 M ⊕ core undergoing non-conservative MT. The top panel displays the evolution of various system and planetary properties, while the bottom panel investigates a number of different timescales of the system. For convenience in studying the plot we arbitrarily subtract 2 Gyr from the time axis (this is just the time over which we evolved the star and the planet before inserting them into the binary evolution version of the MESA code; see discussion above). Hereafter, when describing various features in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> (as well as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>) we refer to the time marked on the axis, i.e., after subtracting off a 2 Gyr reference time.</p><p>For the first ∼ 70 Myr the planet underfills its Roche lobe while the orbit shrinks due to the tides transferring angular momentum from the orbit to the stellar spin, in a vain attempt to try to spin-up the star. Eventually, when P orb shrinks to ≃ 0.5 d (a ≃ 0.01 AU) the planet fills its Roche-lobe. This occurrence can be seen when the dotted curve in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> (indicating the Roche lobe radius) merges with the planetary radius curve (solid blue).</p><p>The system remains in Roche lobe contact for the ensuing 1.6 Gyr, while the planet loses more than 95% of its mass. Concomitantly, the orbital period grows from about 0.5 to 3.9 days. During this same interval, the effective temperature of the planet decreases from about 2500 K to about 1300 K, due largely to the increasing distance between the host star and the planet.</p><p>During the RLO phase there is a competition between the tidal effects which tend to drive orbital decay and mass transfer which generally drives orbital expansion [see Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref>]. Both effects operate simultaneously, and the one that dominates depends on the response of the planet's radius to mass loss. For Roche-lobe overflowing objects with mass lower than the accreting star, there is a universal relation between the orbital period, and mass and radius of the donor [see, e.g., Eqn. (2) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Howell et al. 2001]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P orb ≃ 0.4 (M pl /M J ) −1/2 (R pl /R J ) 3/2 days<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Thus, if the mass transfer remains stable, then the orbital period will grow or shrink in accordance with how the planetary radius changes with mass loss. In this example with a 5 M ⊕ core, we can see from <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> that the planet's radius does not vary very much during most of the RLO phase, and in fact, slightly increases to 1.6 R J . Therefore, P orb will simply grow mostly as ∝ M</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">−1/2 pl</formula><p>. By the end of the RLO phase the planet's mass has shrunk to 8.5 M ⊕ , and, according to Eqn. (13) P orb should be about 4 days, which it is. The Roche lobe overflow phase ends when the combination of tidal decay of the orbit and planetary expansion is no longer sufficient to keep the planet filling its Roche lobe, and the planet, which is now quite low in mass, starts to shrink well inside its Roche lobe.</p><p>The post-RLO phase is driven mainly by photoevaporation. In fact, the tidal decay timescale becomes longer than a Hubble time for the majority of this phase due to the longer orbital period and the greatly reduced planetary mass. Photo-evaporation removes mass from the planet at a rate of about 10 −16 − 10 −15 M ⊙ yr −1 (10 10 − 10 11 g s −1 ) and it does not affect the orbital separation significantly [see Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7)</ref>]. For the 5.4 Gyr duration of the post-RLO phase the planet remains in a 3.9 d orbit and its mass decreases from about 8.5 M ⊕ to about 5.4 M ⊕ (when M env /M pl ≃ 7%), when the calculation ends because of convergence problems.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> displays various timescales for this evolution, including the mass loss timescales via the photo-evaporative wind, |M pl / ˙ M pl | PE , and due to orb orb <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Detailed evolution of some of the components and orbital parameters (top) and of the relevant timescales (bottom) for a Jupiter with Mc = 5 M ⊕ . For this evolution we adopt the parameters δ = 1 and γ = 0.6. The subscripts "RLO", "PE", and "Tides" refer to the timescales associated with mass loss due to Roche-lobe overflow and photo-evaporation, and to tidal decay, respectively. For the latter we note that only stellar tides play a significant role, as the planetary tides timescale is always longer than a Hubble time. The peaks in the tidal timescales occur when the contributions from stellar and planetary tides cancel out. The dotted blue curve in the upper panel indicates the Roche-lobe radius, while the dotted curve in the bottom panel is the stellar nuclear timescale. The RLO phase ends after about 1.6 Gyr, when the system is about 3.6 Gyr old. For clarity, the timescale for the evolution of the planetary radius (bottom panel, green line) is computed taking the median of 20 consecutive values. The calculation ends when Menv/M pl 7% because of convergence problems.</p><p>RLO, |M pl / ˙ M pl | RLO , as well as the timescale for tidal decay of the orbit, |J orb / ˙ J orb | tides , and for the thermal expansion/contraction of the planetary radius, |R pl / ˙ R pl |. What we see is that, after RLO commences, the black curve, showing the mass transfer timescale (due to RLO), lies a factor of about 8 lower than the tidal decay timescale, and much lower than the mass loss timescale associated with PE winds. We learn from Eqn. (11) that the mass loss rate due to RLO is therefore essentially proportional to the rate of decay of the orbit due to tides, and inversely proportional to the denominator which is ξ/2 − γδ + 5/6 = ξ/2 + 0.23. Putting these together implies that the denominator must equal approximately 1/8. From this we can infer that the effective adiabatic index of the planet during most of the RLO phase is ξ ≃ −0.2, in other words the planet reacts to adiabatic mass loss by slightly expanding. Later in the RLO phase, the tidal decay timescale greatly increases due to the increasing orbital separation, but the thermal expansion timescale of the planet decreases dramatically to pick up the slack of the declining tidal effects. We also see that the mass loss rate in a PE driven wind dramatically increases (i.e., the timescale decreases) due to the increasing radius and the decreasing mass of the planet [see Eqn. (4)].</p><p>Even though our evolution calculation ends when the envelope mass fraction drops to about 7%, we argue that eventually, the host star will approach the end of its main sequence lifetime and it will begin expanding. The increase in R * will cause a concomitant increase in both the tidal decay rate and in the amount of irradiation received by the planet. The latter occurs because R * evolves faster than T * in Eqn. (1). Such an increase in irradiation will yield an increase in R pl and, as a consequence, even stronger photo-evaporation. What happens to this system after the envelope of the planet has been removed, leaving only its rocky core, depends mainly on the tidal timescale compared with the stellar nuclear evolution timescale. The former determines the rate of tidal decay (leading to a second planetary RLO), while the latter determines the rate of stellar expansion (leading to stellar RLO). Given the (very steep) dependence of the tidal decay timescale as (a/R * ) 8 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Valsecchi &amp; Rasio 2014b)</ref>, we argue that tides will likely drive the planet down to its Roche limit. Here, it will be stripped of the remaining envelope and, assuming a constant density for the core, it will be consumed at approximately constant P orb on the rapid tidal decay timescale. This follows from Paczy´nskiPaczy´nski's (1971) approximation for the Roche limit separation a R = (R pl /0.462)(M * /M pl ) 1/3 ∝ (M * /ρ pl ) 1/3 , where ρ pl denotes the mean density of the planet.</p><p>orb orb The above discussion was for the case of nonconservative MT (with γ = 0.6). In the case of conservative mass transfer, we find that the orbital evolution proceeds similarly to the examples presented above, but the duration of the various phases is different. In fact, when MT is conservative, the tidally-driven orbital decay is counteracted by a more substantial RLO-driven orbital expansion [δ = 0 in Eqn. (10)], which results in a slower overall evolution. This is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. In particular, the RLO phase lasts for about 4.5 Gyr, leaving an 8.3 M ⊕ planet in a 3.4 d orbit. The remainder of the evolution proceeds similarly to the non-conservative case. However, the evolution when little envelope mass is left is shorter. This is due to the irradiation-driven decrease in planetary mass loss timescale (|M pl / ˙ M pl,PE |) due to the star approaching the end of its main sequence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows the evolution of a Jupiter with a 30 M ⊕ core undergoing non-conservative MT (with γ = 0.7). As in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> (for the case of a 5 M ⊕ core), the top panel presents the evolution of various system and planetary properties, while the bottom panel displays a number of different timescales of the system. For the first ∼ 70 Myr tides cause the orbit to shrink and the planet fills its Roche lobe when P orb ≃ 0.5 d (the same as for the 5 M ⊕ core case).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">The 30 M⊕ Core Model</head><p>At the onset of RLO, the orbit expands as mass is removed from the planet at a rate of ∼ 10 −13 − 10 −12 M ⊙ yr −1 (10 13 − 10 14 g s −1 ). However, after about a Gyr, the orbit begins shrinking once the period has grown to only ∼0.8 days. Overall, we follow the RLO phase for about 2.1 Gyr, to the point where the planetary envelope has been completely removed. At this time, the orbital period has shrunk to 0.3 d, and the effective temperature of the planet has increased to nearly 3000 K.</p><p>The difference in evolutionary history between this planet with a 30 M ⊕ core and the one with a 5 M ⊕ core (described in Section 4.1.1) results largely from the fact that planets with more massive cores exhibit an earlier (i.e., at higher M pl ; <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>) decrease in planetary radius with continuing mass loss. During the RLO phase with a 30 M ⊕ core, the mass of the planet decays essentially as a power law in time, while the radius does not decrease significantly until M pl drops below ∼60 M ⊕ . From Eqn. (13) we can deduce that this combination of mass and radius changes will lead to a steady increase in the orbital period. However, once the radius starts to decline substantially, the R 3/2 pl dependence in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> dominates the orbital period evolution, and P orb starts to decay.</p><p>We can gain some further insight into the evolution of this system by considering the timescales displayed in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. For most of the evolution, the tidal decay timescale (|J orb / ˙ J orb | tides ) is about 6 times longer than the mass loss timescale (|M pl / ˙ M pl | RLO ). Furthermore, at least for the earlier portion of the RLO phase, both the contraction timescale of the planet (|R pl / ˙ R pl |) and the timescale of photoevaporation (|M pl / ˙ M pl | PE ) are both longer yet than the tidal decay timescale. From this we can infer that the denominator in Eqn. (11) must be ≃ 1/6. In turn, we can conclude that ξ ad ≃ 0.07 (i.e., very close to zero). During this earlier portion of the RLO evolution, the orbital period grows and the mass of the planet declines, a combination that leads to an ever increasing tidal decay timescale (i.e., weakening of the tidal evolution of the orbit).</p><p>During the later portion of the RLO phase, both |R pl / ˙ R pl | and |M pl / ˙ M pl | PE become shorter than the tidal driving timescale. This means that there is close competition in the numerator of Eqn. (11) for maintaining Roche-lobe contact among all three terms: (i) tidal decay; (ii) the photo-evaporative mass loss term (tending to shrink the Roche-lobe radius of the planet and main-tain RLO), and (iii) the shrinkage of the planet as it loses mass, which tends to push the planet back within its Roche-lobe. Apparently, the combination is sufficient to maintain RLO until we terminate the evolution.</p><p>Our calculation ends when the planetary envelope has been completely removed. However, the core itself may well eventually undergo RLO and, if the core has a constant density, it will be consumed at constant orbital period on the rapid tidal decay timescale ( 100 Myr, at the end of the evolution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4)</ref>.</p><p>The conservative mass transfer case for the same model with a 30 M ⊕ core differs only insofar as the duration of the RLO phase is concerned (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). This is the same as what we found for the conservative vs. nonconservative cases with a 5 M ⊕ core. In fact, during conservative MT, the RLO phase until the envelope is removed lasts about 3.8 Gyr. At the end of the calculation P orb = 0.3 d.</p></div>

(2007)</ref> in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> are bracketed by those computed with MESA for irradiation absorption column densities of Σ pl = (1−100) g/cm 2 . We tested the effect on planetary RLO evolution by increasing Σ pl by two orders of magnitude in the 5 M ⊕ and 30 M ⊕ core mass models. We find that the overall evolution does not change significantly (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Qualitatively, for the 5 M ⊕ core case, at the beginning of the calculation the radius at higher Σ pl is a few percent larger. As a result, RLO starts at a longer orbital period and, for the same evolutionary time, it continues at longer P orb . When the planet retreats back within its Roche-lobe, the longer orbital period yields a less severe mass loss via photo-evaporation. Consequently, the planet retains a higher envelope mass fraction (f in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) for a longer time. A similar behavior occurs for the 30 M ⊕ core model, but the percent difference in radius (orbital period) increases from ∼ 5% to ∼ 15% (from ∼ 5% to ∼ 20%) between the beginning and the end of the calculation. Again, mass loss proceeds on a longer timescale and, for the same evolutionary time, the models with higher Σ pl retain a larger fraction of the envelope for longer.</p></div>

(2009)</ref> uses F XUV ∼ 10 4 erg cm −2 s −1 as a threshold between the energy limited and radiation/recombination limited regimes. Below we investigate whether our results for the 5 M ⊕ and 30 M ⊕ core cases change significantly by using Eqn. (3) when F XUV &gt; 10 4 erg cm −2 s −1 and Eqn. (4) otherwise. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> (denoted with "e-Lim + rr-Lim" in the column named "PE").</p><p>The planetary mass loss rate in the radiation/recombination limited regime is slower. This naturally leads to a longer duration of the RLO phase for all examples considered. For the 5 M ⊕ core undergoing conservative MT, R pl is a few percent larger. As a result, the orbit evolves at longer period. However, because of the longer RLO phase, by the time the planet is left with about 10% of its envelope mass the star is approaching the end of its main sequence. Consequently, the increase in R pl driven by the increase in stellar irradiation leads to faster mass loss via photo-evaporation towards the end of the calculation. For the 5 M ⊕ core undergoing non-conservative MT, the evolution follows this same line of logic, but the planetary radius is a few percent smaller for most of the evolution. As a result, the orbit evolves at shorter period. For the 30M ⊕ core case, the response of R pl to mass loss for the different photo-evaporation prescriptions differs by only 1 − 2%. Therefore, only the duration of the RLO phase changes significantly, while the orbital period at the various stages of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> is not significantly affected.</p><p>In summary, none of our basic results would change significantly if we were to utilize both the energy-limited and radiation/recombination-limited prescriptions for photo-evaporation over the entire evolution. However, certainly a number of the details of the evolutionary models would look somewhat different. The bottom panels show the corresponding evolutionary tracks for planetary mass and radius. The evolution tracks for different core masses are denoted with different colors and line-styles. For all cases considered, the MT proceeds on a timescale longer than the thermal timescale of the planet. Thus, the planet remains in near thermal equilibrium throughout the MT. Here we note that our 1 M ⊕ core model shows a severe increase in R pl that needs further investigation. In fact, R pl increases up to about 10 R J when M pl ≃ 1 M ⊕ . However, we note also that the core-less models in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 8</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> have radii ranging up to R pl ≃ 2.3 R J when M pl ∼ 30 M ⊕ (the lowest mass considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fortney et al. 2007</ref> for a core-less Jupiter), depending on the age of the planet and the level of irradiation. This is consistent with our radii for masses down to ∼10 M ⊕ . We omit the 1 M ⊕ core model from the subsequent discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">A Range of Evolutionary Models</head><p>The evolution in time in the M pl − P orb plane is downward (i.e., shrinking mass), initially toward longer periods, but then decaying toward shorter P orb . The tracks in the (R pl − M pl ) diagram proceed from the right to the left. The shape of the evolutionary tracks in such diagrams depends on the competing effects of stellar tides (tending to shrink the orbit) and RLO (tending to expand the orbit). As described in Section 4.1.1, the R pl − M pl tracks in the bottom panels of Figures 5 and 6 partly determine which mechanism ends up dominating in terms of net orbital contraction or expansion [see Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>].</p><p>At the onset of RLO, the nearly constant or increasing R pl with decreasing M pl causes the RLO term to dominate over the tidal contribution.

While this agreement with our MT models is very encouraging, our calculation neglects some important effects which we discuss below.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Mass Transfer Scenarios and Stability</head><p>In this work we neglected the effects of magnetic fields and stellar winds on the RLO material. These mechanisms can affect the flow of MT (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cohen &amp; Glocer 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Owen &amp; Adams 2014</ref>), potentially playing a crucial role in determining whether any mass is transferred or an accretion disk ever forms. On the opposite side of conservative MT, is the case where mass is blown away directly from the planet or the inner Lagrangian point (L 1 ). For a 1M J planet and a 1 M ⊙ star, L 1 is located at ≃ 0.93 a [Eqn. (10) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lai et al. 2010]</ref>. In the formalism of Section 3 these scenarios can be reproduced by setting δ = 1 and γ = 1 (mass lost from the planet) or γ = 0.97 (mass loss from L 1 ). In this configuration, Eqn. (12) requires ξ to be larger than (0.27-0.33) in order for the MT to be dynamically stable. The values of ξ inferred in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 for our extreme core masses (ξ = −0.2 and 0.07 for the 5M ⊕ and 30M ⊕ , respectively) suggest that the MT will likely be dynamically unstable if γ 0.97. Furthermore, we have performed test runs with MESA fixing δ = 1 while varying γ. We find that the MT may become dynamically unstable for γ ≥ 0.8. In fact, the computation becomes numerically difficult, with the integrator time-step dropping to less than one month. This limit on γ for stability suggests that the effective value of ξ is close to zero, or negative (as directly computed within MESA).</p><p>To gain better insight into more physically meaningful values of the parameter γ, consider the case where matter flows in a narrow stream from the L 1 point, and forms a ring around the star which is then blown away. This case has been discussed in the context of MT stability in stellar binary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hut &amp; Paczynski 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Verbunt &amp; Rappaport 1988)</ref>. If, in fact, the lifetime of the gas in the ring, before being blown away, is shorter than the viscous timescale for the ring, then the angular momentum may not be returned to the orbit. In this case, the angular momentum leaving the system would be determined by how much angular momentum a particle has before it is blown away (i.e., by the mean ring radius r d ). We combine calculations of r d by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lubow &amp; Shu (1975)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hut &amp; Paczynski (1984)</ref>, covering M pl /M * down to 10 −3 , with our own calculations, extending these down to M pl /M * = 10 −6 . We find r d to range between ≃ 0.7 − 0.9 for a 1 M J − 10 M ⊕ planet. This range implies γ values between ≃ 0.84 − 0.95 and a value of ξ for stability between ≃ 0−0.23 <ref type="bibr">[Eqn. (12)</ref>]. This scenario appears borderline between stable and unstable MT. Clearly any scenario where γ &gt; 1 would be dynamically unstable.</p><p>If the MT were indeed dynamically unstable, one could envision the system undergoing a common-envelope-like evolution ('CE'), that is somewhat distinct from the standard binary stellar evolution picture <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Webbink 1984)</ref>. We envision that the envelope of the planet would quickly flow though the inner Lagrange point and form a disk-like structure around the host star. The core of the planet would then find itself orbiting within this ring or disk of envelope material. Depending on the detailed coredisk interactions, the core may spiral-in toward the host star and eject the disk material. This is distinct from the usual CE scenario in that the envelope of the planet becomes bound to the host star, rather than the planet, and it is the planet which ejects its own remnant envelope via tidal and viscous interactions. Insights into the outcome of such a phase can then be gained from the energy equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">α CE GM * M c 2a f − GM * M c 2a i ≃ GM * M env 2a i . (14)</formula><p>Here, α CE represents the efficiency with which the planet core's orbital energy can be used to unbind the envelope material which is now in a ring around the host star. The parameters a i and a f denote the orbital separation at the onset and at the end of this 'CE' phase, respectively. Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> can be directly solved for the ratio of a f /a i , and we find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">a f a i ≃ α CE M c α CE M c + M env .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>For plausible values of α CE near unity, this expression yields a f /a i ≃ M c /M pl . This, in turn, implies that the orbital separation would decay by a factor of more than an order of magnitude if the mass transfer is unstable at the onset of RLO. Thus, all cores considered in this work would reach their own Roche limit in the event of unstable RLO 8 . A new RLO phase would then begin driven, this time, by the interplay of viscous drag on the core due to the remaining envelope mass orbiting the host, and the backreaction from continuing (now stable) MT through RLO. The former would tend to shrink the orbit, while the latter would cause the orbit to expand.</p><p>The actual outcome of an unstable MT phase from a hot Jupiter to its stellar host is still an unexplored question which we are currently addressing via smoothedparticle hydrodynamics simulations. Furthermore, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations are needed to determine the role played by magnetic fields. Here we note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Matsakos et al. (2015)</ref> recently investigated magnetized star-planet interactions via 3D MHD numerical simulations including stellar wind and photoevaporative mass loss. They found that, depending on the planet's magnetic field and outflow rate, as well as the stellar gravitational field, the star can accrete part of the mass lost by the planet via photo-evaporation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pillitteri et al. (2015)</ref> proved this to be a plausible scenario via far-ultraviolet observations of HD 189733.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Planetary Tides</head><p>In this work we have taken planetary tides to be efficient in keeping the spin of the planet tidally locked. This assumption is justified by the magnitude of the tidal synchronization timescales discussed in Section 3. However, we neglected the resulting effects of tidal dissipation on the planetary structure. These include potentially significant heating, inflation, and resultant stronger mass loss. To gain some intuition into their significance we compute the power deposited between two consecutive integration steps and compare it with the planet luminosity, L pl , at each integration step. For the former we use L tide = 1 2 I pl |Ω 2 o (t + ∆ t) − Ω 2 o (t)|/∆ t, where I pl is the moment of inertia. We find that L tide /L pl decreases from 10 −4 to 10 −11 throughout the calculation. This suggests that the power deposited in the planet via tides may not affect its structure dramatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Observational Signatures</head><p>As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref>, this evolutionary scenario has several observational consequences. First, the properties of stars hosting hot Jupiters and those hosting Super-Earth and mini-Neptune-type planets should be similar. For example, if all RLO material is lost from the system, the host stars should have similar mass and composition, but super-Earth and miniNeptune host stars should be somewhat more evolved. Furthermore, depending on the core mass and the details of the MT process (whether any mass is lost from the system and the location where angular momentum is removed), a system may spend enough time in RLO that it might be possible to observe planets in such a phase. If MT really proceeds through an accretion disk, this may produce observational signatures (e.g., line absorption of stellar radiation and time-dependent obscuration of the starlight; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lai et al. 2010</ref>). Finally, the results in <ref type="figure">Figures 5 and 6</ref>, and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> suggest that, if this model is a viable formation channel for super-Earth and mini-Neptune-type planets, there should be a correlation between M pl and P orb . Specifically, the more massive planets should be found at shorter orbital periods. This is a major result when compared to the simple model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref>. In fact, without a self-consistent calculation of planetary evolution and irradiation effects for a spectrum of core masses, we had found no trend between final M pl − P orb pairs. The different selection of core masses adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref> does not allow for a one-to-one comparison of those results with the findings of this paper. However these different results can be understood simply via the way in which the orbital separation evolves in response to planetary mass loss, and via the incomplete description of the pre-determined mass-radius relations utilized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Valsecchi et al. (2014)</ref>. The latter fixed M pl − R pl relations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>, compared with those computed with MESA during the course of the evolutions.</p><p>This inverse correlation between orbital period and planetary mass that we have found also suggests that dynamically stable MT phases like those presented here do not seem to represent a viable channel for the formation of the so-called 'ultra-short-period planets' (e.g., 'USPs'; Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014 and reference therein).</p><p>These planets have typical radii smaller than 2R ⊕ (corresponding to a mass of about 5 M ⊕ ; Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014) and orbital periods shorter than one day.</p><p>6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented the first evolutionary calculations of irradiated hot-Jupiters undergoing tidally-driven Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). We found that, depending on the size of the planetary core and the details of the mass transfer, the RLO phase and, in turn, the detached phase (after RLO had ceased) can last from a few to several Gyrs. For the smaller core masses (M c ≤ 15 M ⊕ ), after most of the envelope has been removed during RLO, the planet spends a few Gyrs losing mass via photo-evaporation at nearly constant orbital period. This is consistent with the density of known super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, for which detailed modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014</ref>) place tens of percent of the total mass in a H/He envelope surrounding a rocky core.</p><p>As noted above, we find an inverse correlation between the core mass of the planet and its final orbital period. This results from the basic fact that, in general, the irradiated planets with larger core masses decrease in radius faster/earlier with mass loss than planets with lowermass cores. Final orbital periods of 1 day appear to require large core masses of 15 M ⊕ , which are likely substantially higher than the masses of the USP planets found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014)</ref>. Thus, the scenario we are presenting here probably does not account for the USPs.</p><p>In this work we have considered a coarse grid of core masses and one initial binary configuration. However, as summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and 2</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figures 5 and 6</ref>). Such an extended parameter space study should also explore in more detail the boundaries for MT stability. Future observations of increasingly massive super-Earths and subNeptune-type planets in increasingly tighter orbits might provide an important observational test of the ideas presented here.</p><p>Finally, we remark that the value of γδ, the parameter describing mass and specific angular momentum loss, is crucial to the stability of RLO mass transfer. Where matter goes after RLO, and how much of it is actually accreted by the host star or ejected from the system, can only be determined by hydrodynamic calculations. The results of such calculations could well determine whether hot Jupiters can undergo the kind of stable RLO mass transfer described in this work. -------------- Note. -The results include f = Menv/M pl values down to 7% (but for the values in boldface where f ≥8%), to allow a comparison between different MT assumptions and Mc values. In fact, for some of the models considered MESA does not converge when Menv/M pl drops below about 7%. Time intervals are denoted with ∆ t. Column P E denotes the photo-evaporation prescription, with e − lim and rr − lim indicating the energy-limited and radiation/recombination-limited regimes, respectively. The parameter t denote the age of the system in units of the stellar main sequence lifetime. The first four examples are for conservative MT. For non-conservative MT we use δ = 1 and vary γ as summarized in the second column. Note, the 30 M ⊕ core cases never detaches, but for the last case (non-conservative MT evolution with Σ pl 100 g cm −2 ). In this case, 0.5 Gyr after the first 2 Gyr long RLO phase, the planet fills its Roche lobe again).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
