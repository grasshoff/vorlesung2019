			<abstract>
				<p>Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars could lose some fraction of their atmospheres because of the extreme irradiation 1-6. Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to suggest that hot rocky planets 7-9 might have begun as Neptune-like 10-16 , but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum 17. Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 ± 3.5% (1σ), far beyond the 0.69% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start ~2 h before, and end &gt;3 h after the ~1 h optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim 6 (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of ~10 8-10 9 g s −1 , which today is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past. Three transits of GJ 436b, which occur every 2.64 days, were observed on 7 December 2012 (ref. 6) (visit 1), 18 June 2013 (visit 2) and 23 June 2014 (visit 3) with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A stellar spectrum acquired using similar settings in January 2010 (ref. 17) (visit 0) was retrieved from the archive for comparison purposes. HST data in visits 2 and 3 were complemented with simultaneous Chandra X-ray observations. The HST data consist of time-tagged, far-ultraviolet spectra obtained with a grating dispersing light over the 1,195-1,248 Å domain, with a spectral resolution of ~20 km s −1 at 1,215.6 Å (the Lyman-α transition of 2 atomic hydrogen, H I). Exposure times of 1,500 s to 2,900 s were used to observe the star for four successive HST orbits during each visit. Each HST orbit lasts for 96 min, during which GJ 436 is visible for 56 min before being occulted by the Earth, yielding 40 min gaps in the data. The most prominent spectral feature is the H I Lyman-α emission (Fig. 1). Absorption in the blue wing of this line has been reported in other systems, during transits of hot Jupiters. This is interpreted by the presence of escaping hydrogen exospheres surrounding giant planets 1,5,18-20. Tentative evidence that the Neptune-mass planet GJ 436b possesses such an extended atmosphere was drawn from visit 1 data despite the signal being observed after one optical transit 6 , raising questions on its planetary origin. Visits 2 and 3 were carried out to determine the signal nature. We performed a careful analysis to check for the existence of instrumental systematics in the data and correct for them (see Methods). Large variations are detected over a part of the Lyman-α line at times corresponding to the optical transit, which cannot be explained by any known instrumental effects. The most notable absorption occurs in the blue wing of the line for radial velocities between −120 km s −1 to −40 km s −1 , ~2 h before the optical mid-transit time (&apos;pre-transit&apos;), during the optical transit (&apos;in-transit&apos;) and ~1 h after the optical mid-transit time and beyond (&apos;post-transit&apos;) in the three visits (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). In-transit, over half the stellar disc (56.2 ± 3.6%, 1σ) is eclipsed (Fig. 2a). This is far deeper than any ultraviolet transits of hot Jupiters and significantly (~9σ) deeper than the 22.9 ± 3.9% (1σ) post-transit signal previously reported in visit 1 data 6. The ultraviolet transit also starts much earlier (~2.7 h) than claimed previously; the difference is mainly due to our finding of a pre-transit absorption and updated transit ephemeris (see Methods). Visit 0 data 17 acquired ~3 years before visit 1 and ~30 h after transit show that the out-of-transit variability is small compared with the blue-shifted signature. This gives us confidence that the true out-of-transit baseline is measured in visits 2 and 3, whereas it is missing in visit 1. By contrast, the flux remains stable over the whole red-shifted wing of the line (Fig. 2b). The decrease of the red-wing flux seen 6 during the post-transit phases of visit 1 is not reproduced during visits 2 and 3. The mean post-transit red-shifted signal is compatible with no detection at the 3σ level. Our combined analysis of X-ray and ultraviolet data (see Methods) shows that stellar magnetic activity cannot explain the observed decrease at Lyman-α. We propose that the 3 asymmetric absorption is caused by the passage of a huge hydrogen cloud, surrounding and trailing the planet (Fig. 3). The planetary atmosphere is an obvious source for this hydrogen. To produce this extinction signature, we estimate that an ellipsoidal, optically thick cloud of neutral hydrogen should have a projected extension in the plan of the sky of ~12 stellar radii (R * ≈ 0.44 R☉) along the orbital path of the planet and ~2.5 R * in the cross direction, well beyond the planet Roche lobe radius (0.37 R *). Since GJ 436b grazes the stellar disc during transit, we surmise that a central transit would have totally eclipsed the star. This could happen in the case of other red dwarfs exhibiting central transits from planets similar to GJ 436b. Future ultraviolet observations of systems similar to GJ 436 could potentially reveal total Lyman-α eclipses. The radial velocity interval of the absorption signal constrains the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms and the three-dimensional structure of the exospheric cloud. The whole velocity range is in excess of the planet escape velocity (~26 km s −1 at the planet surface), consistent with gas escaping from the planet. The acceleration mechanism of hydrogen atoms escaping from highly irradiated hot Jupiters is debated: after escaping the planets with initial velocities dominated by the orbital velocity (~100 km s −1 for GJ 436b in the host star reference frame), atoms are submitted to the stellar radiation pressure, interact with the stellar wind and are eventually ionized by stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 10-91.2 nm) radiation. For strong lines such as Lyman-α, radiation pressure can overcome the stellar gravity, repelling the escaping atoms towards the observer and producing a blue-shifted signature. In one hot Jupiter (HD 189733b), the absorption observed at large blue-shifts is best explained by charge exchange interaction with the stellar wind, creating energetic neutral atoms with large blue-shifted radial velocities 19-22. In other cases 1,18,23 , radiation pressure alone explains the observed radial velocities of the escaping gas. We ran a three-dimensional numerical simulation of atmospheric escape 20 to understand the origin of the absorption signature observed at GJ 436b. The line profile corrected from interstellar absorption 17,24 is used to calculate the stellar radiation pressure on hydrogen atoms. These are released isotropically from the Roche lobe limit of GJ 436b. The calculation takes the orbital eccentricity of GJ 436b (e = 0.15) into account. The main parameters of the atmospheric escape model are the mass-loss rate ṁ of hydrogen lost by the planet and the photo-ionization rate α EUV of hydrogen atoms. The model computes the structure of the escaping gas cloud, its radial velocity absorption signature, and the integrated light curve. Adjusting for the spectra at different phases (Extended Data Fig. 2), we determine 4 that a family of models, with parameters in the 1σ ranges of ṁ ≈ 10 8-10 9 g s −1 and α EUV ≈ 8 × 10 −7-3 × 10 −6 s −1 (implying neutral atom lifetimes of ~4-18 min at the distance of the planet), provide good fits to the data, yielding reduced χ 2 values close to unity for 544 degrees of freedom. A synthetic light curve is plotted in Fig. 2. The model correctly matches the ~2 h early ultraviolet transit ingress observed with respect to the optical transit, as well as the transit depth in the correct range of velocities. It provides a good match to the reanalysed visit 1 data. It furthermore predicts that the ultraviolet transit could last up to ~20 h after the optical transit, due to the extended hydrogen tail of the exospheric cloud. More ultraviolet observations will be needed to verify this prediction. According to our simulation, the stellar radiation pressure counterbalances ≲70% of the star&apos;s gravity pull on escaping atoms, which is much less than in hot Jupiter systems, in which radiation pressure takes over stellar gravity by factors of 3 to 5 (ref. 20). The low stellar radiation pressure at GJ 436b allows the formation of a large coma and tail of escaping atoms, co-moving with the planet although not gravitationally bounded to it (Fig. 4). Atmospheric escape is involved in the possible loss of a whole population of irradiated exoplanets 11,13,15,16. The average mass-loss rate of ~5 × 10 8 g s −1 at GJ 436b means that the planet loses ~0.1% of its atmosphere per billion years (assuming it accounts for 10% of the planet mass, like Neptune). This rate requires ~1% efficiency in the conversion of input X and EUV energy (estimated in Methods) into mass loss 15. In the past, an M dwarf such as GJ 436 would have been more active and the planet could have received ≲100 times more X-ray and EUV irradiation over ~1 Gyr 25 , resulting in a possible loss of ≲10% of its atmosphere during the first billion years. This planet thus stands on the edge of considerable mass loss, leading us to surmise that closer-in Neptunes could have evolved more dramatically because of atmospheric escape. This 16σ detection implies that large atmospheric signals from comet-like exospheres around moderately irradiated, low-mass planets could be retrieved in the ultraviolet. Over ~10,000 systems similar to GJ 436 will be discovered by upcoming transit surveys carried out from the ground and from space-for example, with the K2, CHEOPS, TESS and PLATO missions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis and correction of systematics</head><p>Because Lyman-α observations are photon-starved, the exposures are as long as the visibility of the target by HST allow. This yields spectra with exposure times of ~1,500 s to ~2,900 s, separated by ~40 min gaps. The data are acquired in time-tagged mode, which means that the arrival time of each photon hitting the detector is recorded by the far-ultraviolet multi-anode microchannel array (FUV-MAMA) of STIS. It is thus possible to split the exposures into several sub-exposures. We adjusted the sub-exposure time to obtain a good compromise between time sampling and signal-to-noise ratio. (The time sampling is important to assess systematic effects, as described later.) During visit 1, the total exposure time was 1,515 s (orbit 1) and 2,905 s (orbits 2 to 4). The first orbit in a visit always has less science time available before of the target acquisition. We used 4 × 380 s sub-exposures (orbit 1) and 5 × 581 sub-exposures (orbits 2 to 4). During visits 2 and 3, the total exposure time was 1,670 s (orbit 1) and 2,071 s (orbits 2 to 4). This was subdivided into 4 × 417 s sub-exposures (orbit 1) and 4 × 518 s sub-exposures (orbits 2 to 4), respectively. Extended Data Figs 3 to 5 show these time series, which are binned by a factor of 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> in the main text.</p><p>Variation of the temperatures in the optical telescope assembly and on the focal plan of HST during its revolution around the Earth is surmised to cause small changes of focus (for example, due to variation in the distance between the two M1 and M2 mirrors). For a given line of sight (hence for a given illumination pattern of the telescope), these variations depend on the HST orbital phase. They are consequently reproducible over several consecutive HST orbits, which means that their effect on the data, when present, can be corrected. This effect, known as the 'telescope breathing' effect, has been observed and corrected in STIS/CCD optical data <ref type="bibr">29</ref>  When a significant correlation is found (as in visits 2 and 3), a phase-dependent correcting coefficient is applied to the whole spectrum.</p><p>For visit 1 data, we do not notice any significant correlation and find that a constant (0th-order polynomial) provides a better fit to the data (χ 2 = 8.92 for 16 degrees of freedom with a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of 17.04) than any higher-order polynomials.</p><p>Consequently, we do not apply any breathing correction for this visit. For visit 2 data, we do 13 find an improvement (over a constant) in the fit of the phase-folded light curve with straight lines (χ 2 = 0.88 for 14 degrees of freedom, BIC = 7.12) and apply this correction to the raw data. For visit 3 data, we find a linear correlation in the phase-folded light curve. We correct the raw data with the best-fit straight lines (χ 2 = 2.23 for 14 degrees of freedom, BIC = 12.7). The amplitude of the correction of systematic effects performed as described earlier, either at the timescale of one HST orbit (breathing) or one HST visit (normalization), is small with respect to the absorption signal detected on the blue part of the Lyman-α line. The blue absorption would show up around the transit epoch almost unchanged, even in the absence of both corrections described earlier. Finally, the absorption signal by the exospheric cloud is so large that it can be measured directly in physical flux units. Our detection is thus independent of any normalization of the transit light curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of the velocity interval of the absorption signature</head><p>In each individual spectrum of a given HST visit, we searched for the most significant (best signal-to-noise ratio) absorption signature. We scanned the velocity range For visit 1, where the first orbit is already absorbed (since it is in the pre-transit phase), we could not rely on contemporaneous out-of-transit data for reference. We thus adopted the range used for visits 2 and 3.</p><p>On the basis of the assumption that observations obtained during the first HST orbit of visit 1 are not absorbed, ref. 6 measured a 22.9 ± 3.9% (1σ) absorption signal, with respect to this first HST orbit, over the range of [−215,−17] km s −1 . We verified that we would obtain a similar result (~24%) by making the same assumptions as in ref. 6. However, as we show here, the first exposures obtained during visit 1 already exhibit strong absorption by the exospheric cloud, and choosing the out-of-transit references of visits 2 and 3 leads to a much deeper absorption signal being measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transit ephemeris</head><p>Several ephemerides of GJ 436b transit have been published in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> and we list them in Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Visit 1 transit observation has been published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6</ref> , which reports the use of the following ephemeris values: P = 2.643850(90) days and <ref type="bibr">454,279.436714(15)</ref>, for the period and mid-transit time, respectively. They attribute the period value to a previous study <ref type="bibr">30</ref> , although the values eventually reported in these two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">30</ref> are different, as can be seen in Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T 0 = 2,</formula><p>We recalculate the transit phases of the visit 1 observation using one of the most recent available ephemerides <ref type="bibr">26</ref>  this substantial difference came from, we realized that we would obtain similar transit phases as ref. 6, offset by ~6 min, when using the T 0 value of ref. 30 and the period given by ref. 6, which does not correspond to any value previously reported in the literature. The remaining ~6 min difference presumably comes from our accounting for the delay between BJD and MJD UTC .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New interpretation of a previous analysis of the visit 1 data</head><p>The 42 min offset has two important consequences with respect to the visit 1 data interpretation by ref. 6. These authors indeed detected an absorption signature starting at the very end of the optical transit, with a maximum ultraviolet absorption depth of 22.9 ± 3.9% (1σ) occurring post-transit (~2 h after the end of the optical transit), according to their ephemeris. Shifting their data points 42 min earlier brings back the start of their absorption signal in-transit. The new phase of the first HST orbit in visit 1 is now −1.74 h before the optical mid-transit time, which corresponds to the pre-transit phases in visits 2 and 3. Since we observe a significant (3.4σ) absorption signal of 17.7 ± 5.2% in these visits, it means that the first HST orbit from visit 1, that ref. 6 used as an out-of-transit reference, is already partially absorbed by the exospheric cloud. In fact, the flux measured during the first HST orbits of visits 2 and 3 is significantly (3.4σ) higher than the flux measured in the second orbits of these visits (by the value of 17.7 ± 5.2% quoted earlier), and in good agreement with the flux measured ~30 h after transit, several years before in visit 0 (ref. 17), as can be seen in because of its different phasing). We did not apply any correction to this visit. We also did not find it necessary to trim out the first HST orbit in this visit (or in the subsequent ones) due to possible increased systematics, as described previously <ref type="bibr">18</ref> . These time series have a higher sampling (by a factor of ~2) than those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, which is made possible by exploiting the time-tag mode of data acquisition. The 1σ error bars have been propagated accordingly. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 | Evolution of the hydrogen Lyman-α emission line of GJ 436 .</head><label>1436</label><figDesc>Figure 1 | Evolution of the hydrogen Lyman-α emission line of GJ 436.

The programme consisted of three HST/STIS transit observations, with contemporaneous coverage of the pre-transit phases with Chandra/ACIS-S. During the first joint HST-Chandra visit, initially scheduled on 16 February 2013, we only obtained Chandra data as a last-minute mission scheduling change prevented the HST observation. It was rescheduled, together with a new Chandra observation, on 18 April 2013. However, no useful HST data could again be obtained on this date because of a target pointing problem. Meanwhile, the simultaneous Chandra observation was correctly performed. The remaining two HST-Chandra visits were smoothly carried out on 18 June 2013 and 23 June 2014. We complement our new data sets with archive HST/STIS observations of GJ 436: (1) a short observation of the star obtained ~30 h after the planetary transit on 5 January 2010 (HST programme GO/DD number 11817 entitled "Detecting the upper atmosphere of a transiting hot Neptune: a feasibility study"; principal investigator: D.E. 17 ); and (2) a transit observation obtained on 7 December 2012 (HST programme GTO number 12034 entitled "Brown dwarf activity part 2"; principal investigator: J.C. Green). The 7 December 2012 transit observation was previously published 6 and is discussed later. All HST and Chandra data are listed in Extended Data</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>as well as in STIS/FUV-MAMA Lyman-α data 18 . We use the red part of the Lyman-α line, within the velocity range [+20,+250] km s −1 , as a probe for the systematic effects in general, and for the breathing effect in particular. In fact, the red peak and wing of the line are the only part of the spectrum unaffected (a priori) by the planet absorption and where there is enough flux to detect time-correlated effects. For each HST visit, we generate a raw light curve by integrating the Lyman-α flux over the velocity range given earlier, using the time-tag split exposures. These light curves are plotted in Extended Data Figs 3a, 4a and 5a, for visits 1, 2 and 3, respectively. If present in the data, the breathing effect would appear as a correlation in the light curves phase-folded over the HST orbital period (96 min). The phase-folded light curves for the three visits are shown in Extended Data Figs 3b, 4b and 5b. We then attempt to fit a polynomial to each phase-folded light curve and examine the dispersion of the residuals in the observed minus calculated data.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The light curves corrected for breathing effect are shown in Extended Data Figs 4c and 5c for visits 2 and 3, respectively. After having corrected for HST orbital phase-dependent effects, we now look at instrumental effects occurring on the timescale of a full HST visit (four HST orbits). Such effects typically include 'ramps' linked with long-term thermal relaxation of HST instruments. Our starting point is the Lyman-α red-wing light curves corrected for the breathing effect. Visit 1 still does not show any time correlation. In contrast, the visit 2 and 3 data show hints for a flux linearly decreasing with time. We chose to correct for this trend, by fitting a straight line to the data. This procedure yields a time-dependent correction coefficient for each visit. The final light curves corrected for (divided by) these trends are shown in Extended Data Figs 4d and 5d. The correction coefficients are applied to all spectra in visits 2 and 3. The data analysis and interpretation presented in the main text is based on these corrected spectra. These spectra are plotted for each visit in Extended Data Fig. 1. They clearly show that the signal is reproduced at each epoch, which strengthens our detection. In the main text, Fig. 1 presents these spectra averaged over visits 1, 2 and 3.</figDesc></figure>

The signals are estimated from the difference between the spectrum and the 14 reference out-of-transit spectrum for each visit. For visits 2 and 3, we simply used the data collected during the first HST orbits. We indifferently searched for absorption or emission signals, but found only significant (&gt;3σ) absorption features. We found that the range [−120,−40] km s −1 captures most of the absorption features detected during these two visits.</figDesc></figure>

The absorbed flux measured in the second HST orbits of visits 2 and 3 is a close match to the flux measured during the first HST orbit of visit 1. Using updated and more accurate transit ephemerides thus allows us to conciliate all HST observations within a common picture, quite different from the one painted by ref. 6. Not only does this substantially change the timing of the ultraviolet transit, but it also changes the amplitude of the measured absorption by a factor of ~2.5. This is critical for understanding the hydrogen atom dynamics and the exospheric cloud structure.</figDesc></figure>
