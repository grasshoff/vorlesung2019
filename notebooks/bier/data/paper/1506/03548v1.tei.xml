				<p>In the present series of papers we propose a consistent description of the mass loss process. To study the effects of intrinsic magnetic field of a close-orbit giant exoplanet (so-called Hot Jupiter) on the atmospheric material escape and formation of planetary inner magnetosphere in a comprehensive way, we start with a hydrodynamic model of an upper atmosphere expansion presented in this paper. While considering a simple hydrogen atmosphere model, we focus on self-consistent inclusion of the effects of radiative heating and ionization of the atmospheric gas with its consequent expansion in the outer space. Primary attention is paid to investigation of the role of specific conditions at the inner and outer boundaries of the simulation domain, under which different regimes of material escape (free-and restricted-flow) are formed. Comparative study of different processes, such as XUV heating, material ionization and recombination,  3 H cooling, adiabatic and Lyman-alpha cooling, Lyman-alpha reabsorption is performed. We confirm basic consistence of the outcomes of our modeling with the results of other hydrodynamic models of expanding planetary atmospheres. In particular, we obtain that under the typical conditions of an orbital distance 0.05 AU around a Sun-type star a Hot Jupiter plasma envelope may reach maximum temperatures up to ~9000K with a hydrodynamic escape speed ~ 9 km/s resulting in the mass loss rates ~ s g 10) 7 4 (10  . In the range of considered stellar-planetary parameters and XUV fluxes that is close to mass loss in the energy limited case. The inclusion of planetary intrinsic magnetic fields in the model is a subject of the following up paper (Paper II).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Close orbit exoplanets in vicinity of their host stars are supposed to be exposed to intense XUV radiation which deposes significant amount of energy in the upper layers of planetary atmosphere. The fact of presence of Jupiter-type giant planets at orbital distances ≤ 0.1 AU (so called Hot Jupiters) opens questions regarding their upper atmosphere structure, its interaction with extreme stellar wind plasma flows ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kislyakova et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kislyakova et al. , 2014</ref>) and stability against escape of atmospheric gas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guillot et al. 1996</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lammer et al. (2003)</ref> were the first who showed that a hydrogen-rich thermosphere of a Hot Jupiter at close orbital distance will be heated to several thousand Kelvin so that hydrostatic conditions will not be valid anymore and the thermosphere will dynamically expand. The stellar XUV radiation energy deposition results in heating ionization and consequent expansion of the planetary atmosphere which appear as major driving factors for the mass loss of a planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lammer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Erkaev et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, García Muñoz 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Koskinen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref>.

(2010)</ref> indicate also that close-in exoplanets experience extreme heating by stellar XUV radiation, which results in atmospheric expansion and outflow up to their Roche lobes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Erkaev et al. 2007</ref>) with mass loss rates ~10 10 -10 11 g s -1 . These loss rates are also supported by HST/STIS observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, 2004</ref>) which detect a 15±4% intensity drop in the high velocity part of the stellar Lyman-alpha line during the planet (HD 209458b) transit which was interpreted as a signature of neutral H atoms in the expanding planetary atmosphere.</p><p>The problem of upper atmospheric erosion of close orbit exoplanets and their mass loss is closely connected with the study of the whole complex of stellar -planetary interactions, including consideration of influences of intensive stellar radiation and plasma flows (e.g., stellar winds and CMEs) on the planetary plasma and atmosphere environments. The following effects have to be considered in that respect.</p><p>1) XUV radiation of a host star affects the energy budget of the planetary thermosphere, resulting in the heating and expansion of the upper atmosphere, which under certain conditions could be so large that the majority of light atmospheric constituents overcome the gravitational binding and escape from the planet in the form of a hydrodynamic wind ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Koskinen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref>). This contributes to the so-called thermal mass-loss process of atmospheric material.</p><p>2) Simultaneously with the direct radiative heating of the upper atmosphere, the processes of ionization and recombination as well as production of energetic neutral atoms by sputtering and various photo-chemical and charge exchange reactions take place ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Lammer et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Shematovich 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref>. Such processes result in the formation of extended (in some cases) coronas around planets, filled with hot neutral atoms.</p><p>3) The expanding, XUV heated and photo-chemically energized, upper planetary atmospheres and hot neutral coronae may reach and even exceed the boundaries of the planetary magnetospheres. In this case they will be directly exposed to the plasma flows of the stellar wind and CMEs with the consequent loss due to ion pick-up mechanism. That contributes to the non-thermal massloss process of atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lichtenegger et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Khodachenko et al. 2007a</ref>). As a crucial parameter here appears the size of planetary magnetosphere, characterized by the magnetopause stand-off distance R S ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Khodachenko et al. 2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, 2007b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Kislyakova et al. 2013</ref>). Altogether, this makes the planetary magnetic field and the structure of magnetosphere, as well as the parameters of the stellar wind (e.g., density n sw and speed v sw ) to be very important for the processes of atmospheric erosion and mass-loss of a planet.</p><p>The background magnetic field of planetary magnetosphere not only forms a barrier for the upcoming plasma flow of stellar wind, but it influences also the outflow of the escaping planetary plasma wind formed in course of atmosphere heating and ionization by stellar XUV. For example, Adams (2011) considered outflows from close-in gas giants in the regime where the flow is most likely controlled by magnetic fields. In that respect it is important to note, that the processes of material escape and planetary magnetosphere formation have to be considered jointly in a selfconsistent way in their mutual relation and influence. The expanding partially ionized plasma of a Hot Jupiter atmosphere interacts with the planetary intrinsic magnetic field and appears a strong driver in formation and shaping of the planetary magnetosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Trammell et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>), which in its turn influences the overall mass loss of a planet.</p><p>The proposed so far different modeling approaches for simulation of planetary atmosphere expansion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Erkaev et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Koskinen et al. 2013</ref>), in spite of inclusion sometimes of a lot of details regarding atmospheric composition and photo-chemistry processes, quite often miss important basic processes or operate with their strong idealizations and simplifications (e.g. non-self-consistent prescription of the XUV heated region, or neglecting of gas ionization / recombination processes, etc.). Moreover, the effects of background planetary magnetic field are usually not considered at all, or again are included in a non-self-consistent way (e.g. by prescribing of specific magnetic configurations) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trammell et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The investigation of exoplanetary magnetospheres by means of numerical simulations requires an efficient and well organized model capable to support a comparative study of different physical effects and processes which contribute to the formation and shaping of the magnetosphere. To investigate all the relevant processes and the role of planetary intrinsic magnetic field in the process of atmospheric material escape and mass loss, as well as formation and structuring of planetary inner magnetosphere in a self-consistent way, we adopt a two-step modeling strategy, starting (as a first step) with a hydrodynamic (HD) model of atmosphere expansion, which is presented in this paper. After having developed a comprehensive model for an expanding upper atmosphere of a Hot Jupiter, we will perform, as a next step, the MHD modeling, with the inclusion of planetary intrinsic magnetic fields and study of their role in formation of the inner magnetosphere and atmosphere mass loss. This part of our investigation will be reported in the following up paper.</p><p>Therefore, the major purpose of this paper is to develop a general and simple (comprehensive) enough model of an expanding atmosphere of a Hot Jupiter which includes all the major effects and yields results, consistent with the study and findings reported by other research groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Erkaev et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Koskinen et al. 2013</ref>). Stellar XUV radiation absorbed in a self-consistently defined inner layer of the modeled atmosphere is a major energy deposition source and driver for the atmosphere expansion. The effects of radiation absorption and re-emission as well as atmospheric gas ionization and recombination and gravity of planet are included in the model. Special attention in the presented numerical modelling is paid to the analysis and deeper understanding of major drivers and physical effects which result in the expansion of atmospheres of close orbit exoplanets. While considering a simple hydrogen atmosphere model, we include the effects of radiative heating and ionization of the atmospheric gas, adiabatic and radiative cooling, as well as impose more general (compared to previous studies) boundary conditions and study their influence on the simulation results. Besides of that, the influence of additional inclusion of H3+ cooling on the model behavior has been tested.</p><p>Special attention in the present study is paid to investigation of different regimes of a Hot Jupiter atmosphere expansion which are related with two basic types of 1D HD solutions, characterized by the presence of a well-formed expanding plasma wind (free outflow regime), or by just an insignificant slow material escape (restricted flow regime). In our model such distinction is achieved in a natural way by choosing different types of the outer boundary condition. As typical parameters for the modelled Hot Jupiter planet we take those of HD209458b (i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J p R R 4 . 1  , J p M M 7 . 0 </formula><p>) orbiting a Sun-like star at a distance of 0.05 AU.</p><p>For a more clear separation of various active factors influencing the formation of an exoplanetary magnetosphere, our numerical study is aimed at simulation of only the expansion of plasma, without inclusion of the rotation effects. This can be justified for the case of tidally-locked closeorbit Hot Jupiters where the rotation angular velocity of the planet is equal to that of the orbital revolution and is relatively small. In this case the radial expansion of the hot planetary plasma will dominate the co-rotation effects in the inner magnetosphere.</p><p>The paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2 we address the issue of XUV heating and radiation transfer in the upper atmosphere which play a crucial role for the modelling of a Hot Jupiter mass loss. In Section 3 the modelling concept is presented, including the atmosphere expansion drivers and role of different types of boundary conditions in that respect. Section 4 is devoted to the major equation of the presented model and key assumptions. Section 5 presents the results of the numerical modelling and related basic regimes of atmosphere expansion of a Hot Jupiter connected with specific boundary conditions applied. A possible influence of an intrinsic planetary magnetic field on the expansion flow is addressed and investigated in a number of specific cases. A comparative study of the role of different physical effects included in the model, such as XUV heating, material ionization and recombination, infrared cooling, adiabatic and Lyman-alpha cooling, Lyman-alpha reabsorption is also presented in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the obtained results and their relevance for Hot Jupiters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">XUV heating and radiation diffusion in upper atmosphere</head><p>A crucial issue concerns the details of the XUV heating process. The deeper is a heated layer of thermosphere, the higher energy is needed for photons to be able to reach it as the XUV absorption cross section decreases with the increasing energy of a photon as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">  3 1 ~   h XUV .</formula><p>An energetic photoelectron created during photo-ionization of a hydrogen atom by a photon with energy</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">  h  carries the excess energy ion E h  </formula><p>, where ion E is the ionization energy. This excess energy may be lost by the photoelectron in different ways (briefly addressed below) before it will reach a thermal balance with the entire hydrogen atoms, ions, and background electrons.</p><p>For typical conditions realized in the modeled upper thermosphere the fastest way of energy loss by a photoelectron is due to Coulomb collisions with background ions and electrons. The efficiency of heating by this process is % 100  h  . However, deeper in atmosphere (i.e., closer to the planet surface) the degree of ionization and plasma density falls down, whereas density of neutrals sharply increases. At these conditions, when the density of neutrals is higher than ~ -3 10 cm 10</p><p>, the photoelectron cools down more efficiently through inelastic collisions with atoms (while its energy exceeds excitation or ionization potential of a hydrogen atom).</p><p>Only after having lost its energy down to the values below eV 10 </p></div>

Therefore, each absorbed XUV photon in the dense thermosphere transfers into direct thermal heating of gas a value not exceeding in average 10 eV. The excess energy is spent mostly on Lyman-alpha emission and cascading ionization. In course of the cascading ionization, the photo-electron shares with a newly released electron, in average, an <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. 2010</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">energy of about   ion E 5 . 0 2 . 0  (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>), the crosssection of excitation of hydrogen by electron impact and subsequent re-emission of Lyman-alpha photon is of about the same as that of ionization (see for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shah et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Sweeney et al. 2001</ref>. For this energy loss channel everything depends on how optically thick is the given layer of thermosphere for Lyman-alpha photons. In the case of sufficiently high optical thickness, all the energy of photo-electrons eventually returns to the background electrons due to impact deexcitation. In opposite case it is all lost and heating efficiency reduces. Therefore, the heating efficiency h values (up to ~(8-17)%) in the dense layers which are optically thin for Lyman-alpha, as well as to 100% in a fully ionized outer plasma envelope. Accordingly, a wide range of applied heating efficiencies h  ~(15-60) % can be found in related studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chassefière 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Koskinen et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Lammer et al. 2014</ref>. A saturation value of % 93 was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koskinen et al. (2013)</ref>. The most often used average value of the efficiency of XUV heating in the studies of exoplanet giants is % 50  h  . That is a value we apply in our mdelling. For an accurate calculation of the energy transport process a kinetic model of photoelectron diffusion is needed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cecchi-Pestellini et al 2009)</ref>. In that respect we note that there is an obvious distinction between the net efficiency of absorption net  which equally affects ionization and heating rates and the heating efficiency h  which concerns only heating.</p><p>At this point the reabsorption of Lyman-alpha emission should be also addressed. cm 2 . This is much larger than the XUV absorption cross-section. Therefore, the thermosphere regions of most intense XUV heating will be optically thick for Lyman-alpha, and cooling efficiency of the last will be diminished. It is important to evaluate how strong this effect may be, as it results in higher temperatures and higher densities in the "dead-zone" of a Hot Jupiter magnetosphere and influences also the separation between "wind-" and "dead-" zones. For that purpose in Subsection 4.2 we adopt a simple model of Lyman-alpha photons spatial diffusion with a coefficient</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">  L a n c ~</formula><p>as determined by distance and time intervals between consequent reabsorption events, but ignore the spectral diffusion of photon from the line center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modelling concept</head><p>As it was specified in the overall description of our two-step modeling strategy presented in Introduction, the major goal of the present work is to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of a Hot Jupiter expanding upper atmosphere without inclusion of the effects of background magnetic field of the planet. This goal may be achieved with a 1D HD model which takes into account most important physical processes which we discuss below. Even a simplified 1D HD model which deals with a one-gaseous-component (hydrogen) atmosphere and contains only the most important elements and physical processes such as heating by stellar XUV radiation, atmospheric gas ionization and recombination, as well as radiative and adiabatic cooling of the expanding planetary plasma wind, is not yet fully developed and understood due to the complex physics involved. In the present paper we propose our version of such a model. By this, as a widely used simplification we also disregard the fact that a star illuminates only one side of a planet and assume an azimuthally symmetric radiation flux, taking into account the reduced value of net  equal to 0.5. This approach is commonly accepted as a good approximation which enables to avoid of 2-D, or extremely complex 3-D, modelling without loss of essential physics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Atmosphere expansion drivers</head><p>In the first studies of the planetary atmosphere expansion aimed to estimate the material escape rate and related mass loss, the isothermal Parker-type solution was imposed with an a-priory prescribed boundary conditions at the planetary inner atmosphere (or surface) related to the XUV heating of a fixed predefined thin layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Watson et al 1981)</ref>. However, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tian at al. (2005)</ref> that in a thin-layer-heating approximation the expanding atmosphere mass loss rate strongly depends on the altitude of the layer where the radiation energy is deposed.</p><p>Moreover, as it was suggested already by Parker, the realistic solution which corresponds to an outflowing (expanding) wind regime requires an additional volume heating in order to compensate the adiabatic cooling of the expanding gaseous envelope. This was also confirmed in the follow-up numerical modeling studies. For example, in the case of the solar wind, an additional acceleration factor is called for to appear at few solar radii. This additional driver is attributed to the dissipation of Alfvén waves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Usmanov et al. 2011</ref>). For an outflowing atmosphere of a Hot Jupiter one of possible candidates for the role of such a distributed accelerator is absorption of XUV, which takes place everywhere where atomic or molecular hydrogen is present. However, it turns so that at distances of about several planetary radii where the additional forcing of the expanding planetary atmospheric material is needed to keep it in the outflowing regime (i.e. to escape the gravity tension), the gas is highly ionized, and the absorption of XUV decreases.</p><p>Nevertheless, the same fact of the increasing ionization degree, which reduces the efficiency of XUV heating, contributes the additional acceleration of the wind and appears as an additional booster of the planetary plasma wind. That is because the thermal pressure</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">  kT n n n p e i a   </formula><p>increases (up to two times) at certain interval of heights (in the ionization region), due to the contribution of the electron and ion pressure, whereas the density of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">material   i i a m n n  </formula><p>remains practically unchanged. The created pressure gradient provides an additional driving force for the expansion of ionized atmospheric material. Here we use the standard notations with a n , i n , e n , i m , k , and T staying for the number density of neutrals, ions, electrons, ion mass, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. In course of the ionization, the expanding atmospheric wind experiences in the ionization region an additional acceleration and reaches velocities which sustain the continuous outflow regime. Note, that the adiabatic cooling and the plasma pressure gradient mechanism caused by the ionization, act opposite each other, and the simple isothermal model which doesn't consider them properly produces an erroneously too strong planetary wind. To our knowledge, the role of the ionization layer and acceleration of atmospheric plasma by the pressure gradient were not elucidated so far regarding the problem of a Hot Jupiter plasma wind generation. At the same time this effect is implicitly included in several reported simulations (e.g., García <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Muñoz 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Koskinen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref>.</p></div>

These boundary conditions are usually associated with a deep layer of inner planetary atmosphere which we conventionally call as a planet surface.</p><p>Besides of the plasma outflow and the related adiabatic cooling, due to plasma expansion, another efficient energy drain which acts to compensate the XUV heating is an excitation of the second level of atomic hydrogen by electron impact and fast emission of Lyman-alpha photon <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Murray- Clay et al. 2009</ref>). At the same time, because of exponential decrease with temperature, this mechanism can fully compensate XUV heating of deep and cold layers of the thermosphere if the last decreases with height fast enough. However, due to wide spectrum of stellar XUV illuminating a planet, its heating rate decreases with height (i.e., with the increase of integrated column density) not exponentially, but more likely as a power law. Therefore, a model which is based only on the Lyman-alpha cooling requires a limiting inner boundary at the layer with a temperature of several thousand Kelvin. To admit this condition, one needs an additional justification (i.e., model) for the inner boundary at the lower thermosphere. An estimation of the overall energy budget shows that the inner "cold" thermosphere has to have a temperature of about 1000-2000 Kelvin. The cooling mechanism due to infrared emission which involves 2 H and  3 H species is usually addressed in that respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yelle 2004</ref>). Although the complex models which include the major photo-chemistry effects already exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, García Muñoz 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Koskinen et al 2007</ref>, in the present paper we adopt a bit different and more simple approach to take account of the infrared cooling effects.</p><p>While infrared cooling due to  3 H may dominate in the deep thermosphere at pressures larger than bar μ 1 ~ , it has been concluded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koskinen et al. (2013)</ref>, based on comparison of kinetic and hydrodynamic models, that this process doesn't affect formation of the expanding planetary wind. In that respect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koskinen et al. (2013)</ref> used a hydrodynamic model with an inner boundary fixed at the level of bar μ 1</p><p>pressure. On the other hand, regardless of Lyman-alpha or infrared cooling, the expanding plasma motion alone, due to the adiabatic cooling mechanism, can effectively remove heat from the deep layers of thermosphere affected by XUV radiation. In some models this effect is known to be so strong that it eventually overcomes the heating and leads to an unrealistic drop in the temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Watson et al. 1981)</ref>. However, in case when radiation (integral over spectrum) attenuates not exponentially, but more likely as inverse power of density column, the domination of adiabatic cooling effect is diminished. Below, using the results of an analytical solution which takes into account only adiabatic cooling and a proxy model of XUV heating at large integrated column densities, as well as by means of the numerical simulation, we show that the inner boundary can be extended down to the deeper layers with a much higher pressure of the order of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">μbar 10 ~ max 0   p P</formula><p>. To similar conclusion arrives also García Muñoz <ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref>.</p><p>The question of the inner boundary pressure appears to be a crucial one also because of the fact that according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Trammell et al 2011</ref>, the material escape at low pressures is practically proportional to it. This has to be avoided in a self-consistent model. Therefore, taking the inner boundary sufficiently deep in the atmosphere, where XUV energy deposition per particle becomes practically zero, seems to be a reasonable choice for a more realistic model which is independent on particular parameter values at the inner boundary, or in other words, independent on the size of the simulation box. Indeed, we found (see in subsection 5.2) that at pressures starting from bar</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">μ 1 ~ ~ 0 sat p P </formula><p>and higher, the obtained solution shows quite weak dependence on 0 ~ P .</p><p>Another important modeling parameter related to the inner boundary pressure, that has to be properly defined is the base (or the inner boundary) temperature o T ~ . General energy budget considerations constrain it to be at around K 1000 . The particular values of 750 K (Yelle 2004), 1200 K (García Muñoz 2007), and 1350 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koskinen et al. 2013</ref>) were used in the models of a Hot Jupiter. In the model presented in this paper the behavior of Hot Jupiter environment insignificantly depends on particular value of o T ~ . That is because of taking the inner boundary of the simulation box at sufficiently deep layers with high enough pressure which are unaffected by the stellar XUV. At such deep located inner boundary an extremely steep (exponential) density grow takes place, so that the condition of a constant mass flux supposes very small values for the velocity. Therefore, taking velocity equal zero at the inner boundary does not affect the numerical solution at all, if the boundary is sufficiently deep.</p><p>Inclusion in the model of deep thermosphere layers with pressures higher than bar μ 1 ~ , requires certain attention to the infrared cooling effect due to  3 H and understanding of how it affects the simulation results. To check this we performed calculations with a proxy model for the infrared cooling with volume rates about -1 3 7 s cm erg 10  reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, García Muñoz 2007</ref>. The obtained results enable us to conclude that temperature profile in the inner atmosphere regions (i.e., close to the planet surface) and the corresponding density distribution are somewhat sensitive to the additional energy loss mechanism related with the infrared cooling (besides of the adiabatic and Lyman-alpha cooling). But due to its local character and action first of all in deep layers of the inner thermosphere, the <ref type="bibr"> 3</ref> H cooling leads to the reduction of the simulated material escape rate approximately only by a factor of two. Such insignificant difference gives a reason for an essential simplification of the model of atmosphere expansion and mass loss by ignoring complex hydrogen chemistry at the base of cold thermosphere, or use of its simplified modeling approximations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Outer boundary conditions</head><p>An appropriate definition of conditions at the outer boundary also plays an important role for the modeling. Similarly to the case of inner boundary conditions discussed above, it would be reasonable to have outer boundary conditions also defined so, that the obtained numerical solutions are quantitatively independent on them in a sufficiently wide range of parameters.</p><p>Besides of that, it is necessary to distinguish between two different types of outer boundary conditions that are related to different external physical circumstances. One is an open (or free) outer boundary, when the expanding atmosphere material can leave the vicinity of a planet, i.e. when the escape of mass and energy takes place, and the escaping plasma can flow through the outer boundary unaffected. Another situation corresponds to the closed (or shut-up) conditions when the material flow is suppressed or restricted at certain distance from a planet by some external physical factors not included self-consistently in the model. As an example of such restricting factors, an encountering stellar wind or planetary magnetic field can be referred. The choice of particular type of outer boundary conditions finally depends on a goal of specific modeling and a region of application of the modeling results. In particular, in the case of a Hot Jupiter, modeling of different parts of the magnetized planetary extended thermosphere may require different sets of the external boundary conditions. For example, simulation of a so-called "wind zone" of a Hot Jupiter magnetosphere (Adams 2011, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trammell et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>) at sufficiently high latitudes where plasma leaves the planet along the open magnetic field lines needs the open outer boundary conditions, whereas modeling of the "dead zone" occupied by a stagnated plasma of inner magnetosphere locked in the region of closed magnetic field lines would requires the closed boundary.</p><p>Besides of that, the interaction of the magnetized Hot Jupiter with a stellar wind results in the formation of a magnetosphere obstacle located at several planetary radii from a planet. Depending on a character of the encountering stellar wind plasma flow (sub-, or super-sonic/Alfvénic) this magnetosphere obstacle can have a form of a paraboloidal shock or Alfvén wing system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ip et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Erkaev et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>) elongated in the direction of the plasma flow, which for the close-orbit planets has to take into account also the Keplerian velocity of orbital motion of the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grießmeier et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Cohen et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>). Namely because of these factors, the outer boundary conditions in the first numerical modelling of a hydrodynamic atmosphere escape on a Hot Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yelle 2004</ref>) were imposed at a relatively close distance of only p R 3 from the planet. Note, that a question regarding the interaction of an upcoming stellar wind with the expanding planetary plasma wind, and the role of planetary magnetic field in this process was not considered in Yelle (2004) as well as in the later modeling cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(García Muñoz 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Adams 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Trammell et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Koskinen et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>).

The protonhydrogen collisions are dominated by resonant charge-exchange with cross-section, at the typical velocity of 10 km/c, approximately 10 -14 cm -2 . The location of exobase for a Hot Jupiter which corresponds the region where Knudsen number   / l Kn reaches 1 is determined by the condition when the mean free path l is equal to a typical scale of flow  . In the regions far from the planet  may be taken to be of the order of the planetary radius, i.e. . That remains well above the height range ( p R 10 ) considered in the modelling simulations. Close to the planet surface, the barometric height H , which is smaller than p R , has to be taken as the typical scale  . However, due to much larger densities there, the mean free path l also becomes smaller and the condition 1  Kn holds true. Therefore, the fluid approach adopted in the present study is fairly valid.</p><p>Within the frame of made assumptions, taking into account the processes of hydrogen ionization (by XUV and electron collision) and recombination, the continuity, momentum, and energy balance equations of the model can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">  0 n n t      V (1)   ion e a rec e i XUV XUV a i i n n F n n n t             V (2)   r GM m kT n n nkT n m t m p e            1 1 V V V (3)           ion e ion a n a a e XUV XUV ion XUV a e E n n n E F E E n T T T t k n n      1 2 3 21 2 , 12 21                          V V (4)</formula><p>where the following notations are used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">i a n n n   , n x n n ion i e  <label>(5)</label></formula><p>Te e e V n   In the equations <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> where temperature is taken in energy units.

The question discussed in the literature is the position of exobase relative to the model outer boundary. For HD modeling of some particular Hot Jupiters (e.g., HD209458b) it was shown in several papers that the exobase is farther than p R 10 . Thus in our modeling we also take the location of outer boundary at p R 10 , where the numerical solution practically doesn't depend on the boundary exact position and use of hydrodynamic modeling approach is justified. More detailed (García Muñoz 2007) or partially kinetic conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koskinen et al. 2013</ref>) also lead to similar results and conclusions.</p><p>When the cooling mechanism due to Lyman-alpha radiation is taken into consideration, the model admits two general solutions related to the global energy balance. One of the solutions represents the already mentioned above case with an atmospheric material free outflow when the XUV heating is balanced by the advection and adiabatic cooling. Another solution corresponds to a restrictedflow regime, in which the XUV heating is balanced mostly by Lyman-alpha cooling. The particular values of physical quantities are also different for these two types of the solutions. By this, the restricted-flow solution is characterized by a hotter and about an order of magnitude denser stagnated plasma envelope. An important issue regarding the free outflow and the restricted-flow solutions consists in the fact, that their realization in our model is completely controlled by specific outer boundary conditions only. Note, that the free outflow and restricted-flow regimes are physically relevant (and may be attributed) for the "wind-" and "dead-" zones of a Hot Jupiter magnetosphere, respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trammell et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>As it has been mentioned above (see Subsection 3.2), the Lyman-alpha cooling is inefficient at temperatures below several thousand Kelvin. Therefore, a small outflow of material is needed to compensate the excessing XUV heating in such a dense deep thermosphere. In that respect, instead of a totally closed (shut-up) condition at the outer boundary we allow a small flow of material at a speed of the order of km/s 1 . <ref type="bibr">0</ref> . This in fact constitutes the matter of the restricted-flow regime. Such an assumption is relevant for the conditions in a "dead-zone" of Hot Jupiter's inner magnetospheres or in the front region of interaction with a stellar wind, as a small portion of the planetary plasma might still leave the planet there by convection to higher latitudes or to the tail.</p><p>To deal with the open outer boundary in practice, we assume spatial derivatives of physical values to be small, i.e. asymptotically approaching to zero with a decreasing mesh size and increasing distance.</p><p>Similar approach to the study of atmosphere expansion regimes has been adopted for the first time in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(García Muñoz 2007)</ref> where instead of velocity, a fixed pressure was imposed at the outer boundary, and the solutions with an escaping material flow varying from a super-sonic up to slow subsonic one were obtained. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> shows the result of modeling calculation with typical model parameters summarized in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref>.

Then, due to the adiabatic cooling the temperature quickly decreases with height because the XUV heating is not enough to compensate it once the ionization of the expanding gas takes place. The ionization degree n n x i ion  increases sharply near the temperature maximum, and the velocity of the expanding atmospheric plasma wind driven by the increase of pressure gradient, also increases mostly at the ionization front.

The fact that the increase of the mass-loss rate with decreasing distance is very close to R -2 enables to conclude on the proportionality between the mass loss rate and the XUV flux.

At the same time, since the main goal of this paper is to build a comprehensive (1D) self-consistent model of a HJ's upper atmosphere escape for its further generalization to the case of a magnetized planet, without inclusion of tidal force the role of other material escape drivers and their mutual relation becomes more clear and easily to understand. </p></div>

Due to that two areas can be distinguished depending on the radial distance r : 1) the area of increasing electron pressure (closer to the planet) where the pressure gradient acts as a decelerating factor on the plasma flow, and 2) the outer area of decreasing pressure where the electron pressure gradient accelerates the expanding plasma flow.</p><p>Since the total density n decreases exponentially fast with distance, and the location of maximum of electron pressure is spatially close to that of the maximum of temperature, the overall contribution of the electron pressure gradient term in the flow kinetic energy can be estimated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">max R e kT kT n n 1 p      (21)</formula><p>The effect of acceleration of the escaping wind by the additional pressure gradient of the ionized gas is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 7</ref>, where besides of the typical free outflow solution (the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref>), the calculations without ionization and with zero electron pressure are shown.

The resulting flow velocity in this case is essentially smaller than that in the true case and it never reaches the sound speed values, while the overall mass-loss is 1.5 times smaller. Contrary to these limiting cases, the true case, with the effects of ionization and the additional pressure gradient of the ionized gas (electron pressure) properly taken into account, is characterized by increase of outflow velocity which reaches a sonic point at the distance of p R 25 . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Restricted flow regime of a Hot Jupiter's atmosphere expansion</head><p>When the closed condition is applied at the outer boundary of the simulation box, the expanding atmospheric material flow gradually decays until a steady state with an almost zero flux through the outer boundary is achieved. This situation corresponds to the suppressed or restricted flow regime. Because of the absence of the adiabatic cooling in this case, the energy balance condition is provided due to Lyman-alpha emission. This is true everywhere except of cold, non-ionized and dense thermosphere with a temperature of several thousand K and less. In reality, in the case of complete absence of material escape, a solution with a temperature at the inner boundary of the order of 1000 K, provided only by Lyman-alpha cooling, is not possible. Therefore, in our numerical model we allow a small outflow velocity at the outer boundary, so that the corresponding small flow in the dense thermosphere can sustain energy balance with the XUV heating. Under these circumstances, the material escape rate is proportional to the allowed fixed outflow velocity at the outer boundary. It is worth, in that respect, to compare different temperature profiles realized for different outflow velocities.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">(14)</ref>) in the interval of heights</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">p p R r R 3  </formula><p>is about 9000 K. This leads to the formation around a planet of the gas envelope which is several times (up to an order of magnitude) denser and somewhat hotter, as compared to the case of free outflow regime.</p><p>As already pointed out, the temperature in the case of a restricted flow regime depends on the efficiency of Lyman-alpha cooling. In view of the fact that deep near the planet surface the atmospheric gas is optically thick for Lyman-alpha, it is important to check also possible influence of Lyman-alpha re-absorption (included in the equation <ref type="formula">(11)</ref>). It becomes important when the number of Lyman-alpha photons is sufficiently large:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">  1 R n ~ e N ~ 2 p L a 21 e 21 T E L 21         .</formula><p>This estimation follows from eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">(12)</ref> after approximation of spatial derivatives as 2 ~   p R . For the conditions of restricted flow the re-absorption affects Lyman-alpha cooling rate at heights below p R 2 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 9</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 9</ref> shows the result of model calculation with a relatively high Lyman-alpha absorption cross-section Temperature and density distributions in the case when Lymanalpha re-absorption is included in the model (thick solid lines) and without it (thin lines). Closed condition (i.e., restricted flow regime) is applied at the outer boundary in both cases. For comparison, the dotted line shows density distribution in the case of open (i.e., free outflow regime) outer boundary condition.</p><p>As expected, because of strong re-absorption and established balance between hydrogen excitation and de-excitation which diminishes the efficiency of cooling, the temperature visibly increases at distances below p R 2 . Maximum increase of temperature as compared to the case without Lymanalpha re-absorption is about 1500 K. Farther from the planet the effect of Lyman-alpha reabsorption decreases and for p R r 5 . 2  it becomes negligible. As to the influence of Lyman-alpha re-absorption on the gas density at distances up to several p R , i.e. inside the dead zone region which might be formed in the presence of magnetic field, as it can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 9</ref>, such influence is rather small and practically undistinguishable in the numerical calculation result. Therefore, depending on purpose of particular numerical simulation, in some cases the effect of Lyman-alpha re-absorption can be neglected, despite of its obvious influence on the temperature of gas close to the planet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 9</ref> allows also to compare the density distributions realized in the cases of open and closed outer boundary conditions, i.e. in the free outflow and restricted flow regimes, which may correspond, for example, the "wind-" and "dead-" zones of a Hot Jupiter magnetosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trammell et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Khodachenko et al. 2012</ref>). In particular, the plasma density in the case of restricted flow regime is up to an order of magnitude higher than in the case of free outflow. Based on the obtained numerical solutions, it is possible to estimate strength of a Hot Jupiter's magnetic field, needed to affect and confine the hot gaseous envelope around the planet, energized by the stellar XUV. For this purpose we check spatial behavior of plasma beta <ref type="bibr">2</ref> 8 B nT  in the equatorial plane for different values of magnetic field at p R r  , assuming for the definiteness sake an undisturbed magnetic dipole field geometry and a quasi-stationary restricted flow regime. The result is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>, which in particular shows, that the surface fields larger than 1 G should strongly affect the plasma outflow. The area of strongest magnetic control is located near p R 2 , whereas the overall size of the magnetic field dominated region may reach, depending on the field strength, up to several p R . Note that because of the steep density increase close to the planet surface, thermal pressure exceeds magnetic pressure even for very large surface fields.</p><p>Another interesting issue concerns the flow above the dipole poles. As it is well known, if plasma moves along the magnetic field lines in a strong dipole field, the divergence of material flux (guided by the magnetic field lines) at pole regions is larger than that in the case of the spherically isotropic expansion. Since the adiabatic cooling is crucial for sustaining the temperature of the expanding material, a certain reduction of the temperature and escape velocity in the polar regions, as compared to the isotropic expansion case, may be expected. This effect is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  11</ref> which shows the outcome of our 1D HD simulation with an artificially increased ("cubic") divergence term as</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">r V r V 3   </formula><p>(analogous to divergence of dipolar magnetic field in polar regions), taken instead of the true divergence term</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">r V r V div 2     V</formula><p>which corresponds to an isotropic spherically symmetric expansion. Justification for such substitution based on the dipole field geometry can be found, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trammell et al. (2011)</ref>. One can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 11</ref> that the outflow velocity and density in the case of increased divergence are significantly smaller. By this, the maximum temperature realized in the case of inflated flow is by ~1000 K lower than that for the spherically symmetric isotropic flow. The sonic point is reached at about p R 8</p><p>and father than in equatorial case contrary to expectations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>We investigated the formation and escape regimes of a hot plasma envelope of a Jupiter-type exoplanet created due to XUV heating of the planetary hydrogen atmosphere with taking into account the processes of radiation transfer (i.e. excitation/de-excitation), ionization/recombination, and adiabatic cooling of the atmospheric gas. Our study confirmed the results reported in a number of previous works dedicated, as well as the present paper, mostly to the exoplanet HD209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yelle 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, García Muñoz 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Guo 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Koskinen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, 2013</ref>  . By this, the escaping material flow becomes supersonic at distances of about 10 planetary radii.</p><p>Note that, being interested in a pure thermal escape of a Hot Jupiter upper atmosphere caused only by the stellar radiation factors (i.e. material XUV heating and ionization) we did not include the effects of the stellar-planetary gravitational interaction. On the other hand, from the dedicated studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Penz et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Erkaev et al. 2007</ref>) it is known that in a system like that of HD209458b the location of L1 point is at about</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">p R 3 , 4</formula><p>. This means that the effects of the gravitational material escape due to the gas expansion beyond the Hill sphere add to the pure thermal mass loss, and should be properly included in a more complete model. At the same time, preliminary estimates provided in the present paper (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>) reveal that the intrinsic magnetic field may strongly influence the motion of the escaping planetary plasma up to the distances comparable with L1 in the HD209458b system. In this case the role of the gravitational escape effects will be strongly diminished whereas the dominating magnetic field will control the process of the mass loss.</p><p>To evaluate the physical drivers of the escape and the parameters of the created hot plasma envelope around the planet, we checked the influence of various processes such as infrared cooling by  3 H molecules in deep and cold layers of the planetary thermosphere, emission and re-absorption of Lyman-alpha photons, boundary and geometry conditions which may reflect different kinds of interaction with the planetary magnetic field.</p><p>Having in mind the primary goal of the presented in this paper 1D HD numerical modeling, as a first step in our two-step modeling approach aimed at understanding first of hydrodynamic behavior of the expanding non magnetized upper atmosphere of a giant exoplanet, significant attention was paid to the investigation of different types of boundary conditions and their influence on the achieved material escape regimes. Based on this understanding the next step (MHD modelling) with the consequent inclusion of the planetary magnetic field and relevant effects can be done in a more comprehensive and justified way. Moreover, several general conclusions regarding the influence of magnetic field on the plasma distributions, flows and temperature regimes were possible already in the present HD simulations, based on the results obtained for different types of inner and outer boundary conditions. It was found that due to ability of the short wavelength photons to penetrate deeper in the atmosphere, the high energy part of the XUV spectrum, as a heater of the deep and dense layers of thermosphere, plays an important role in formation of a hot plasma envelope around the planet. This is directly related to the value of maximum pressure implied at the inner boundary of the planet. Using the proxy model of spectrally integrated solar XUV flux we derived a simple analytical estimate for the maximum pressure (see equation <ref type="formula">(18)</ref>) up to which XUV heating can be balanced by adiabatic cooling for the given base temperature of the atmosphere and mass loss rate. For the typical parameters of HD209458b this pressure is bar μ 10 ~ , i.e. higher than that used in previous models of the planet. Note, that the velocity of escaping gas at the height where this pressure is realized in the atmosphere is negligibly small as compared to the thermal speed, and the XUV spectral cut off is around the wavelength of about 2,5 nm. It was also demonstrated with a series of test simulations, that the inner boundary of the simulation box located at the heights of lower pressures produces proportionally smaller escape rates, whereas the boundary at larger pressures gives approximately the same results.</p><p>At the pressure values used at the inner boundary, the hydrogen is present mostly in a molecular form, and such species as  3 H may provide an efficient cooling effect by infrared radiation. By incorporation of these factors into the model we found that hydrogen chemistry at the base of the thermosphere might change the parameters of the formed hot extended plasma envelope and result in reduction of the material escape rate by a factor of about two.</p><p>In the present work we also made a deeper insight at the mechanism of formation of the escaping planetary wind. As it is known from the stellar wind studies, a supersonic flow of escaping material has to be supported by a mechanism of additional heating/energizing, which operates in the distance range where the flow gains its most velocity. Various mechanisms of wave heating are traditionally referred for the stellar winds in that regard, though the exact process remains unknown. In the case of a Hot Jupiter, it appears that the XUV heating of atmospheric gas alone is not enough to balance the adiabatic cooling at distances of several planetary radii, because gas becomes ionized and the radiation absorption decreases at heights p R 3  . However, the same effect of gas ionization, which reduces the efficiency of XUV heating, plays an important role of a booster of the escaping wind due to the buildup of an additional electron pressure gradient force. The thermal pressure almost doubles at the ionization front due to appearance of additional electron pressure which contributes the acceleration of the escaping partially ionized plasma flow. This effect means that part of absorbed stellar XUV energy is stored in thermal energy of electrons which then is converted into kinetic energy of the expanding plasma flow. In that respect, self-consistent account of the processes of gas ionization and recombination is crucial for the correct calculation of planetary atmospheric material escape. Simple use of the prescribed or fixed ionization ratios may lead to unrealistic and erroneous results in that respect.</p><p>We investigated two types of HD solutions which represent two basic regimes (restricted flow and free outflow) of the expanding gaseous envelope of a giant exoplanet heated by stellar XUV. In fact, both regimes can be realized in the same physical system depending only on type of the outer boundary conditions (closed or open), which may in their turn be a consequence of specific action of the planetary magnetic field.</p><p>In the free outflow regime the adiabatic cooling alone provides efficient balance to XUV heating. It dominates over the radiation cooling everywhere except of the base of dense and cold thermosphere where infrared radiation is more efficient. Lyman-alpha radiation cooling may compete with the adiabatic cooling only in a thin layer around temperature maximum and as we have found out, only if the mass loss rate is below s g 10 5 <ref type="bibr">10</ref>  . It was found that at orbital distances from (0.25 -0.1) AU where the effects of stellar gravitation may be still unimportant, the mass loss rate is mainly defined by the expansion and escape of the hot planetary atmospheric material and it is proportional to the stellar XUV flux.</p><p>The kinetic 2 2 mV and thermal 2 3kT energies per particle in a fully ionized escaping gas are an order of magnitude smaller than the stored ionization energy ion E . A comparable with ion E part in the energy budget is the energy of particles (E g = 8.6 eV) which exit the gravitation bounding of the planet. Since the energy deposed in the system by XUV flux illuminating the planet, is removed mainly by the expanding gas outflow (except of inessential part lost via Lyman-alpha photons), and this was confirmed to be true by the performed numerical calculations, the atmospheric mass loss can be estimated as s  is not included in these estimations, since the energy spent of the ionization of neutral atmospheric gas constitutes the major portion of the whole absorbed energy. This estimate indicates that in the range of considered stellar-planetary parameters and XUV fluxes the mass loss is indeed energy limited, as it was found in a number of other models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lammer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Erkaev et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>In the restricted flow regime, the XUV heating is balanced by gas excitation and radiation of infrared and Lyman-alpha photons. However, the infrared and Lyman-alpha cooling acts only at certain restricted not overlaping temperature ranges which correspond to particular regions in the atmosphere. As result, the layers with temperatures between 2000 K and 7000 K cannot be effectively cooled by radiation. Due to that a flow with a relatively small, of about s m 300 200  , velocities at the outer boundary is built up, that provides necessary additional adiabatic cooling. Mass conservation requires that the material is either removed through the outer boundary, or is settled in a kind of zonal convection.</p><p>Another specific detail of the restricted flow solution which we investigated is Lyman-alpha reabsorption. For the cross-section of about <ref type="bibr">14 15</ref> 10 10    2 cm the atmospheric gas of the considered giant planet HD209458b is everywhere optically thick for Lyman-alpha photons. By this, the reabsorption leads to increase of population of excited hydrogen atoms and results in the decrease of Lyman-alpha cooling. The numerical solution which treats Lyman-alpha radiation transfer in diffusion approximation shows that optical thickness of the gaseous envelope leads to the increase of temperature by about 1000 K at distances below p R 2 . At the same time, at larger distances the temperature and density remain nearly the same as in the case without inclusion of Lyman-alpha reabsorption.</p><p>Finally, based on the simulated escaping atmosphere of HD209458b, we find that the intrinsic planetary magnetic field which may have at the planetary surface a value higher than 1 G, may certainly affect the material flow and result in formation of the "dead" zone of stagnated plasma in the equatorial plane around the planet. As to the magnetic polar regions, the material escape rate there might be severely diminished due to faster than the spherically isotropic spatial divergence of the dipole magnetic field lines resulting in a stronger adiabatic cooling.            </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>cross-section of Lyman-alpha photon absorption   L by atomic hydrogen near the line center is in the range of 14 15 10 10   </figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>Figure 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3 shows a dependence of the simulated mass loss rate on a value of fixed pressure o P ~ at the inner boundary, or rather on the position of the inner boundary relative to fixed distribution (13). One can see that for o P ~ less than bar μ 1 ~ sat p the escaping flow is strongly affected by a particular value of the inner boundary pressure o P ~ . Such a dependence of the numerical solution on the inner boundary condition (i.e. on the location of the inner boundary of the simulation box) has been referred in several previous studies (e.g., Trammell et al. (2011), Adams (2011)), where proportionality of the mass loss rate to the boundary pressure was assumed as an input condition. As one can see from Figure 3, for o P ~ higher than μbar 1 ~ sat p , the influence of the inner boundary pressure on mass loss rate become to be less significant.</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, fixing of the thermosphere inner boundary (i.e., depth) at the level of bar μ 1 ~  o P means that photons with energy higher than ion E   20  which correspond approximately to wavelengths shorter than 5 nm will be excluded from the consideration. Such a restriction would limit the generality of the model. The discovered mass loss "saturation" effect for sufficiently large inner boundary pressures ( bar μ 1 ~  o P ) is related with a rather weak (for large o P ~ ) dependence of the obtained numerical solution on the base temperature o T ~ . In particular, variation of o T ~ from 750K to 1500K results in change of mass loss rate M  by only 14%.</figDesc></figure>
