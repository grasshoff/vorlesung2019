			<abstract>
				<p>Blind source separation techniques are used to reanalyse two exoplanetary transit lightcurves of the exoplanet HD189733b recorded with the IR camera IRAC on board the Spitzer Space Telescope at 3.6µm during the &quot;cold&quot; era. These observations, together with observations at other IR wavelengths, are crucial to characterise the atmosphere of the planet HD189733b. Previous analyses of the same datasets reported discrepant results, hence the necessity of the re-analyses. The method we used here is based on the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) statistical technique, which ensures a high degree of objectivity. The use of ICA to detrend single photometric observations in a self-consistent way is novel in the literature. The advantage of our reanalyses over previous work is that we do not have to make any assumptions on the structure of the unknown instrumental systematics. Such &quot;admission of ignorance&quot; may result in larger error bars than reported in the literature, up to a factor 1.6. This is a worthwhile trade-off for much higher objectivity, necessary for trustworthy claims. Our main results are (1) improved and robust values of orbital and stellar parameters, (2) new measurements of the transit depths at 3.6µm, (3) consistency between the parameters estimated from the two observations, (4) repeatability of the measurement within the photometric level of ∼ 2 × 10 −4 in the IR, (5) no evidence of stellar variability at the same photometric level within 1 year.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Observations of exoplanetary transits are a powerful tool to investigate the nature of planets around other stars. Transits are revealed through periodic drops in the apparent stellar brightness, due to the interposition of a planet between the star and the observer. The shape of an exoplanetary transit lightcurve depends on the geometry of the star-planet-observer system and the spatial distribution of the stellar emission at the wavelength at which observations are taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002)</ref>. By solving the inverse problem, it is possible to characterise fully the planet's orbit (Period, P ; semimajor axis, a;</p><p>inclination, i; eccentricity, e; and argument of periastron, ω), and to measure its radius, r p <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kipping 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mandel &amp; Agol 2002)</ref>. Knowledge of the inclination enables determination of the mass of the planet, m p , if m p sin i is known from radial-velocity measurements.</p><p>Multiwavelength transit observations can be used to characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets, through differences in the transit depths, typically at the level of one part in ∼ 10 4 in stellar flux for giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Seager &amp; Sasselov 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tinetti et al. 2007b</ref>). For this purpose, the diagnostic parameter is the wavelength-dependent factor p = r p /R s , i.e. the ratio between the planetary and the stellar radii (or its square, related to the transit depth).</p><p>The exoplanet HD189733b is one of the most extensively studied hot Jupiters: the brightness of its star allows spectroscopic characterisation of the planet's atmosphere.</p><p>The 3.6µm transit depth for the exoplanet HD189733b has been debated in the literature. Different analyses of the same dataset, including two simultaneous Spitzer/IRAC observations at 3.6µm and 5.8µm, have been used to infer the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere of HD189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beaulieu et al. 2008;</ref>, or to reject this hypothesis <ref type="bibr">(Désert et al. 2009</ref>). Another analysis of this dataset is reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ehrenreich et al. (2007)</ref>, but we do not comment further their results, as they were not conclusive, because of the very large error bars. <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2011)</ref> reported the analysis of a second Spitzer/IRAC dataset at 3.6µm using the same techniques. Their new estimates of the planet's parameters were significantly different from those reported previously by the same authors <ref type="bibr">(Désert et al. 2009)</ref>; the discrepancies were attributed by the authors to variations in the star.</p><p>Although stellar activity may significantly affect estimates of exoplanetary parameters from transit lightcurves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballerini et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berta et al. 2011</ref>), the method used to retrieve the signal of the planet also plays a critical role. The analyses mentioned above were all based on parametric corrections of the instrumental systematics, and are thus, to some degree, subjective. Recently, non-parametric methods have been proposed to decorrelate the transit signals from the astrophysical and instrumental noise, and ensure a higher degree of objectivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Waldmann (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Waldmann et al. (2013)</ref> suggested algorithms based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract information of an exoplanetary atmosphere from Hubble/NICMOS and Spitzer/IRS spectrophotometric datasets.</p><p>In this paper we adopt a similar approach to detrend the transit signal from photometric observations by using Point Spread Functions (PSFs) covering multiple pixels on the detector. We apply this technique to re-analyse the two observations of primary transits of HD189733b recorded with Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6µm (channel 1 of IRAC) in the "cold Spitzer" era. We present a series of tests to assess the robustness of the method and the error bars of the parameters estimated. Critically, by comparing the results obtained for the two measurements, we discuss the level of repeatibility of transit measurements in the IR, limited by the absolute photometric accuracy of the instrument and possible stellar activity effects. We discuss the reliability of our results for orbital and stellar parameters in the light of previous multiple 8µm observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Observations</head><p>The two Spitzer observations of HD189733 b discussed here were performed on 2006</p><p>October 31 (ID 30590), and 2007 November 25 (ID 40732).</p><p>The first observation consists of 1936 exposures using IRAC's stellar mode (full-array), taken over 4.5 hr; 1.8 hr on the primary transit of the planet, 1.6 hr before, and 1.1 hr after transit. The reset time is 8.4 s. During the observation, the centroid of the star HD189733 was stable to within one pixel.</p><p>The second observation was of 1920 exposures using IRAC's sub-array mode, over 4.5 hr; 1.8 hr were spent on the primary transit of the planet, 1.7 hr before, and 1 hr after transit. The interval between consecutive exposures is 8.4 s. Each exposure consists of 64 reads at high speed cadence of 0.1 s. Only for the observation ID 40732, we replaced the 64 reads of each exposure with their mean values, in order to have a manageable number of data points, to reduce the random scatter, and to have the same sampling of the observation ID 30590. During the observation, the centroid of the star HD189733 was again stable to within one pixel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Independent Component Analysis in the context of exoplanetary transits lightcurves</head><p>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) consists of a transformation from a set of recorded signals to an equivalent set of maximally independent components. The underlying assumptions are that:</p><p>1. each recorded signal is a linear combination of the same source signals; 2. the source signals are mutually independent.</p><p>We can express this model as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 = a 1,1 s 1 + a 1,2 s 2 + ... + a 1,n s n x 2 = a 2,1 s 1 + a 2,2 s 2 + ... + a 2,n s n . . .</formula><p>x n = a n,1 s 1 + a n,2 s 2 + ... + a n,n s n</p><p>where x i , i = 1 . . . n, are the recorded signals, s j , j = 1 . . . n, are the source signals, and a i,j are numerical coefficients. Eq. 1 can be written in matrix form as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x = As (2)</formula><p>where x is the column vector containing the recorded signals, s is the column vector containing the source signals, and A is the matrix of the coefficients, the so-called "mixing matrix".</p><p>The aim of ICA is the 'blind' separation of the source signals from the observations, i.e., without any additional information (except the assumed mutual independence of the source signals). In other words, the ICA algorithms search for the matrix W that transforms the recorded signals such that the mutual statistical independence is maximised:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Wx = WAs<label>(3)</label></formula><p>If the assumptions are valid, then WA = D, where D is a diagonal matrix, so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Wx = Ds<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The diagonal matrix D means that the extracted signals can be rescaled without changing the mutual independence.</p><p>To maximise said independence, several approaches and implementations have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hyvärinen et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tichavsk´yTichavsk´y et al. 2008</ref>). We used the MULTICOMBI algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Tichavsk´yTichavsk´y et al. 2008</ref>), which optimally mixes EFICA and WASOBI, based on maximising the nongaussianity of the extracted signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koldovsk´yKoldovsk´y et al. 2006</ref>), and their temporal decorrelations (Yeredor 2000), respectively.</p><p>In this work, the observed signals are lightcurves of a star, recorded for a time interval that includes an exoplanetary transit event. These lightcurves contain at least three independent contributing signals:</p><p>• the astrophysical signal;</p><p>• the signal of instrumental systematics;</p><p>• stochastic noise.</p><p>It is possible, in principle, to decompose further the astrophysical and instrumental systematics signals. The former is the sum of the transit signal, the astrophysical background, possible stellar activity signals, etc.; the latter is the sum of different effects from different parts of the instrumentation. All these signals are expected to be independent from each other as they have different origins. By contrast, their linear combinations (i.e. the observed lightcurves) are clearly not mutually independent. It is worth stressing that to disentangle effectively all these signals we need, at least, the number of available lightcurves to be equal to the number of signals. Therefore, we need lightcurves recorded with the same instrument (since lightcurves recorded with different instruments have different systematics plus the astrophysical signals, so that the number of source signals is greater than the number of lightcurves). In principle, using lightcurves recorded at different times with the same instruments should not work, since the systematics have the same origins; but the relevant signals are not necessarily in phase, and so may differ by more than a simple scaling factor. Additionally, further differences might be present due to stellar variability.</p><p>However, the transit signal, being common to all the lightcurves, is potentially detrendable.</p><p>A successful extraction of a transit signal from a time series spanning several exoplanetary transit events, conveniently split into sub-lightcurves, is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Waldmann (2012)</ref>.</p><p>The advantage of spectroscopic observations over photometry is the provision of simultaneous lightcurves at different wavelengths with largely common instrumental systematics. The transit signals at each wavelength can be obtained by subtracting proper systematics models from the lightcurves (an accurate direct extraction of the transit is impossible due to the limb darkening effect). By using this technique, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Waldmann et al. (2013)</ref> have extracted an infrared transmission spectrum of HD189733b between 1.51 µm and 2.43 µm, from a Hubble/NICMOS dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">ICA using pixel-lightcurves</head><p>The main novelty of the algorithms we use here is their ability to detrend the transit signal from a single photometric observation of just one primary transit. This is possible because, even if stars can be approximated by point sources, the instrument is purposely de-focused to spread the PSF over several detector pixels, and the position of the target star on the detectors is stable to within one pixel. During an observation, there are several pixels detecting the same astrophysical signals at any time, but with different scaling factors, depending on their received flux, their quantum efficiency, and the instrument PSF.</p><p>We performed an ICA decomposition over several pixel-lightcurves, i.e. the time series from individual pixels, in order to extract the transit signal and other independent signal components (stellar or instrumental in nature).</p><p>Once a set of independent components has been obtained from a selected set of pixel-lightcurves, different approaches to obtain the transit signal can be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method 1: direct identification of the transit component</head><p>In principle, if one of the independent components extracted has the morphology of the transit signal, we assume that one to be the transit signal, multiplied by an undetermined scaling factor. We renormalise the signal by the mean value calculated on the out-of-transit part, so that the out-of-transit level is unity.</p><p>Method 1 is not applicable to the extraction of accurate transit signals from spectroscopically resolved observations of a primary transit at different wavelengths, because of the wavelength dependence of stellar limb darkening. This is not a problem in our case, because all the pixels record the same wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method 2: non-transit-components subtraction</head><p>Another approach to estimating the transit signal is to remove all the other effects from an observed lightcurve, i.e. by subtracting all the components other than the transit one,</p><p>properly scaled. The scaling factors can be determined by fitting a linear combination of the components, plus a constant term, to the out-of-transit part of the lightcurve 1 . The coefficients of the linear combination and the constant are the free parameters to fit.</p><p>Instead of fitting the non-transit-components on the pixel-lightcurves, and then subtracting, we performed these processes on the spatially integrated lightcurves, obtained by summing all the individual pixel-lightcurves. The integrated lightcurves are much less noisy than the individual pixel-curves.</p><p>1 The out-of-transit limits do not have to be known exactly. They can be chosen in a way to be sure of not including part of the transit while fitting, relying on parameters reported in previous papers and on the lightcurves themselves. The results should not be affected by this choice, but it is worth checking this point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Transit lightcurve fitting and error bars</head><p>After the extractions of the detrended and normalised transit time series, we modelled them by using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> analytical formulae. We can compute the observed flux as a function F (p, z), where p = r p /R s is the ratio between the planetary and the stellar radii, and z = d/R s is the distance between the centres of their disks projected onto the sky divided by the stellar radius. The relative distance z is a function of time, determined by the orbital parameters.</p><p>We assumed the orbital period P , zero eccentricity, and a quadratic limb darkening model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Howarth 2011)</ref>. The values of the fixed parameters are reported in Tab. 1. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Values of the parameters fixed while generating the transit models. The limb darkening coefficients, γ 1 and γ 2 , were computed for a star with effective temperature T ef f = 5000K, gravity log g = 4.5, mixing-length parameter l/h = 1.25, solar abundances. We then performed a fit with three free parameters:</p><p>2. the orbital semimajor axis (in units of the stellar radius), a 0 = a/R s ;</p><p>3. the orbital inclination, i.</p><p>We chose these as free parameters, because:</p><p>• there is a large range of values published in the literature;</p><p>• they largely determine the shape of the transit signal;</p><p>• they do not show strong cross-correlations.</p><p>For completeness, and for comparisons with the literature, in the final results we report also the transit depth, p 2 , the impact parameter, b, and the duration of the transit, T , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">b = a 0 cos i (5) T = P √ 1 − b 2 πa 0 (6)</formula><p>We used a Nelder-Mead optimisation algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lagarias et al. 1998</ref>), to obtain first estimates of the parameters of a model. To confirm/improve these estimates and to determine error bars, we ran an Adaptive Metropolis algorithm with delayed rejection The variance of the likelihood function is initialised as the variance of the residuals obtained for the first model and then sampled together with the other free parameters (σ 2 0 ). In this way, we take into account both white and the autocorrelated noise present in the detrended time series, but we ignore possible systematic errors due to the preliminary ICA deconvolution. The ICA errors can be represented as an additional uncertainty, σ ICA , on each point in the time series. The likelihood's variance, σ 2 like , becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ 2 like = σ 2 0 + σ 2 ICA (7)</formula><p>We tested that resampling the parameters' chains with σ 2 like does not affect their best values, while the total error bars of the single parameters, σ par , increase with respect to the previous estimates (without the ICA errors), σ par,0 , as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">σ par = σ par,0 σ like σ 0 = σ par,0 σ 2 0 + σ 2 ICA σ 2 0 (8)</formula><p>A measure of the uncertainties on the independent components extracted by ICA is given by the Interference-to-Signal-Ratio matrix, ISR, i.e. a n × n matrix, where n is the number of signals. The ISR ij element estimates the relative remaining presence of the j th component in the i th one. Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ISR i = n j=1, j =i ISR ij (9)</formula><p>estimates the relative remaining presence of all the other components in the i th one.</p><p>If the i th component represents the transit signal, and if we estimate the transit signal through method 1, we can identify:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ 2 ICA = f 2 ISR i (10)</formula><p>f being the scaling factor used.</p><p>If the i th component represents the transit signal, but we estimate it through method 2, σ ICA has to contain a weighted sum of the ISRs of the non-transit components removed, plus the discrepancies of the fit to the out-of-transit phases:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">σ 2 ICA = f 2 m j=1 o 2 j ISR j + σ 2 ntc−f it (11)</formula><p>o j being the coefficients of the non-transit components, m the number of components considered, σ ntc−f it the standard deviation of the residuals from the reference lightcurve (out of the transit), and f the normalising factor for the model-subtracted lightcurve.</p><p>The MULTICOMBI code produces two Interference-to-Signal-Ratio matrices, ISR EF , associated with the algorithm EFICA, and the ISR W A , associated with the algorithm WASOBI. We estimated the global ISR as their average:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ISR = ISR EF + ISR W A 2 (12)</formula><p>This is a conservative estimate, given that, according to Tichavsk´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tichavsk´y et al. (2008)</ref>, the MULTICOMBI ISR slightly outperforms the best of ISR EF and ISR W A (then it could be smaller), but these estimates are entirely reliable only under certain assumptions on the signals which may be not satisfied in these cases. Here we take them as worst-case estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Application to observations</head><p>Here, we describe the main steps of the analyses performed on each of the two observations (ID 30590 and ID 40732), which include some tests of robustness. We now discuss only results obtained with method 2, as they are much more stable; results obtained with method 1 are reported in Appendix C, along with a critical comparison of the two methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Choice of the pixels</head><p>The first step in the analysis is the choice of the pixel-lightcurves to analyse. This is determined by:</p><p>• the instrument point response function (PRF), i.e. the measured intensity profile of the star on the detector 2 ;</p><p>• the noise level of the detector;</p><p>• the effective number of significant components to disentangle.</p><p>The number of significant components is not known a priori. The ICA code extracts a number of components equal to the number of lightcurves that it receives as input. Apart from the collective behaviour common to all the pixel-lightcurves, each pixel introduces an individual signature. Only if the individual signatures are negligible compared to the collective behaviour are we able to select enough lightcurves to disentangle the significant components. The PRF and the noise level of the detector limit the number of pixels containing potentially useful astrophysical information.</p><p>In practice, we considered several arrays of pixels with the stellar centroid at their centers, having dimensions 3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, 9 × 9, and 11 × 11 pixels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> shows the "integral lightcurves", obtained by summing the contributions from the various pixels.</p><p>We looked for outliers in the time series, i.e. points discrepant more than 5σ from a first transit-lightcurve model (fitted on the original data), and we replaced those outliers with the averages of the points immediately before and after. We found only one outlier in observation ID 30590, and nine in ID 40732. Although the observed lightcurves are two primary transits of the same exoplanet, observed at the same wavelength through the same instrument, they appear very different, mainly because of the different observing strategies.</p><p>In particular, observation ID 40732 seems to be much less affected by systematics, and less 2 Note that the PRF is, in principle, slightly different to the PSF: the PSF is the intensity profile incident on the detector, while the PRF is the measured intensity profile (including the detector response). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Choice of the components</head><p>In Sec. 2.5.1, we corrected the observed lightcurves by subtracting all the non-transit components (see Sec. 2.3). Here, we show how to identify the most significant components, and how many should be considered. We generally expect that some components are related to collective behaviours, common to all the pixels, and others to individual pixels' signatures and/or noisy mixtures of the sources. By inspection, a few of the components clearly present time structures, while others are random scattered time series.</p><p>We report results from the 5 × 5 array only, as it is the smallest array containing all the astrophysical and instrumental information.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of each component in the out-of-transit data, we found the best fits of the single components (plus additive constants) to that part of the integral lightcurve, and calculated the means and standard deviations of the residuals. In this way, we established a ranking of importance of the components, based on the minimisation of the discrepancies between their fits and the integral lightcurve, out of transit. We then computed other best fits by using the n most important components, according to that ranking, with n from 1 to 24. The best coefficients for the components and the additive constants were determined through the Nelder-Mead optimisation algorithm.    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Combining observations</head><p>The parameter estimates determined from observation ID 40732 are much more accurate than those from ID 30590.

In this way, we can make a direct comparison of p between the  i were badly determined, due to an inaccurate stellar model being assumed (e.g. wrong limb darkening coefficients, star spots, or faculae), they would introduce a systematic error on p that would be equal for both observations. Thus variations of p (or p 2 ), obtained while keeping all other parameters fixed, are a more objective measurement of the stellar variations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Comparison of the two observations</head><p>The planetary, orbital, and stellar parameters derived separately from the two observations are all consistent within 1σ. In particular, the duration of the transit is extremely stable between the two observations. This is not surprising, because its measure is almost insensitive to calibration errors and stellar activity; all the other parameters are much more affected by these sources of noise. Furthermore, these other parameters are strongly correlated; e.g. a non-optimal estimate of the impact parameter b will result in an imprecise transit depth p, etc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 10</ref> shows the differences between the transit signals extracted for the two observations. The standard deviation of the differences is The results of Sec. 3.1 reinforce our claim of non detectable stellar activity variations.

Given the number of primary transits and secondary eclipses they analysed, and the small impact of the limb darkening effect at 8µm, this is a robust confirmation of the validity of our results at 3.6µm. We suggest the use of these parameters for future observations at other wavelengths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al.

(2010)</ref>. Given that the second measurement was superior in quality, and given the agreement with observations at another wavelength, we conclude that the parameters presented in this paper are more robust than those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beaulieu et al. (2008)</ref>, or by <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref> using the same data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison with previous analyses of the same observations</head><p>We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beaulieu et al. (2008)</ref> used the same impact parameter at 3.6µm and 5.8µm, while <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref> used similar, but not identical, values. Given the conclusions obtained in this paper about the orbital parameters, we suggest that the transit depth at 5.8µm be recalculated accordingly. A re-analysis of the observation at 5.8µm, then the differences between the transit depths at the two wavelengths, which were used to infer about the atmosphere of the planet, should not be strongly affected by this bias, at least in the first case. However, because their conclusions were controversial, a re-analysis of the observation at 5.8µm, with more precise orbital parameters and possibly non parametric technique, as done here, is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced a blind signal-source separation method, based on ICA, to analyse photometric data of transiting exoplanets, with a high degree of objectivity; a novel aspect is the use of pixel-lightcurves, rather than multiple observations. We have applied the method to a reanalysis of two Spitzer/IRAC datasets at 3.6µm, which previous analyses found to give discrepant results, and obtained consistent transit parameters from the two observations. We suggest that the large scatter of results reported in the literature arises from:</p><p>• use of arbitrary parametric methods to detrend the transit signals, neglecting the relevant uncertainties;</p><p>• correlations between parameters in the lightcurve fit.</p><p>We found, for observation ID 40732, values for the orbital parameters that are in excellent agreement with those found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref>, based on Spitzer/IRAC observations at 8µm. By applying these values to observation ID 30590, we improved the accuracy of the inferred transit depth, and strengthened the consistency between the two observations.   Tab. 5 reports the best values of the parameters for the transit signals extracted from different arrays of pixels, the standard deviations of the residuals between the signals and the best transit models, and the standard deviations attributed to the ICA separation.   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 12</ref>.-From top to bottom: best values of the parameters p, a 0 , and i, respectively, for the transit signals extracted removing the n most significant components from the integral 5 × 5 lightcurve, binned by nine points (observation ID 30590).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Subdatasets</head><p>An important test to verify the robustness of the analyses is to apply the same techniques to subdatasets. They clearly share the same phenomena, but recorded for different time intervals, largely overlapping. If the technique is able to separate the source components, the detrended transit signals from different subdatasets should be essentially equivalent, otherwise there is a problem with at least one of them. A critical factor could be the time length of a subdataset compared to the timescales of the source signals; for this reason, the separation performed using longer subdatasets or the whole dataset, might be more reliable, unless they strengthen some trends or introduce bad data, for example if they are not well calibrated, or affected by spurious events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. Observation ID 30590</head><p>We considered twenty-eight subdatasets, obtained combining seven different starting and four ending times, disposed with regular cadence of ∼14 minutes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14)</ref>.

(2009) for ID 30590, and Désert et al. (2011) for ID 40732. However, our results afford a substantial agreement (within 1σ) between the transit parameters determined from the two observations, while previous analyses by Désert et al. (2009) and Désert et al. (2011) claimed significant variations of all parameters (e.g., discrepancy &gt; 4σ for transit depths). Désert et al.

Our results do not support such conclusions, and we find that any possible stellar-activity variations are within the error bars. Our error bars from the observation ID 40732 are of the same order (for transit depth) or even smaller (for orbital parameters) than in Désert et al. (2011), while those from the observation ID 30590 are larger by a factor ∼ 1.6 with respect to the error bars in Désert et al. (2009). The factor ∼ 1.6 comes from adding the ICA errors to the parameter error bars derived from the extracted signals.</figDesc></figure>
