			<abstract>
				<p>We present new astrometry for the young (12-21 Myr) exoplanet β Pictoris b taken with the Gemini/NICI and Magellan/MagAO instruments between 2009 and 2012. The high dynamic range of our observations allows us to measure the relative position of β Pic b with respect to its primary star with greater accuracy than previous observations. Based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we find the planet has an orbital semi-major axis of 9.1 +5.3 −0.5 AU and orbital eccentricity &lt; 0.15 at 68% confidence (with 95% confidence intervals of 8.2-48 AU and 0.00-0.82 for semi-major axis and eccentricity, respectively, due to a long narrow degenerate tail between the two). We find that the planet has reached its maximum projected elongation, enabling higher precision determination of the orbital parameters than previously possible, and that the planet&apos;s projected separation is currently decreasing. With unsaturated data of the entire β Pic system (primary star, planet, and disk) obtained thanks to NICI&apos;s semi-transparent focal plane mask, we are able to tightly constrain the relative orientation of the circumstellar components. We find the orbital plane of the planet lies between the inner and outer disks: the position angle (PA) of nodes for the planet&apos;s orbit (211.8±0.3 •) is 7.4σ greater than the PA of the spine of the outer disk and 3.2σ less than the warped inner disk PA, indicating the disk is not collisionally relaxed. Finally, for the first time we are able to dynamically constrain the mass of the primary star β Pic to 1.76 +0.18 −0.17 M ⊙ .</p>

The disk midplane is warped, with a 4 • offset between the inner warped disk and the outer main disk, suggesting a giant planet influencing the disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mouillet et al. 1997)</ref>. This planet β Pic b was first detected in data from 2003, and the planet reappeared on the other side of the star in 2009 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lagrange et al. , 2010</ref>. β Pic b is one of the first planets to be directly imaged and has the smallest projected physical separation of any imaged planet to date. With a contrast of 9 magnitudes at K S -band and a current projected separation of ∼0.4", the planet is challenging to detect even with state-of-the-art adaptive optics.</p><p>Orbital properties of directly imaged planets can encode clues to their formation. The eccentricities of these planets, for example, may trace migration or planet-planet interactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Takeda &amp; Rasio 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang &amp; Ford 2011)</ref>. β Pic b represents the longestperiod exoplanet whose full orbital parameters can be determined with present observations. The estimated orbital period of ∼20 years allows us the opportunity to determine the orbit of this planet, whereas most other directly imaged planets will require many more decades of observations for a robust orbit determination. The orbital parameters of β Pic b are of particular interest since they allow us to study the relationship between the planet and the debris disk.</p><p>The Gemini NICI Planet-Finding Campaign was a 4-year survey to detect extrasolar planets conducted between 2008 and 2012 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nielsen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wahhaj et al. 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Biller et al. 2013</ref>). In addition to detecting a number of brown dwarf companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Biller et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wahhaj et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nielsen et al. 2012</ref>), we detected the planet β Pic b at multiple epochs over the course of the Campaign. We combine these observations with new data from Magellan MagAO and previous work to determine the orbit of the planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>VLT/NACO: Chauvin et al. (2012) present 9 epochs of β Pic b astrometry from VLT NACO, between 2003 and 2011. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnefoy et al. (2013)</ref> present an additional epoch from January 2012, as well as an improved orbital fit. We use the 10 astrometric observations and errors as reported in these works.</p><p>Gemini-South/NICI: We observed β Pic b with NICI at Gemini-South at 4 epochs between 2009 and 2012 ( <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Reductions were performed with the Gemini NICI Planet-Finding Campaign pipeline, described in depth in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wahhaj et al. (2013a)</ref>. These data are discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Males et al. (2014)</ref>, which also includes a comparison to an independent analysis of some of the data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boccaletti et al. (2013)</ref>. We find that for overlapping epochs there is good agreement between the NICI and NACO astrometry, indicating that there is no significant astrometric offset between the two instruments. In addition, NICI measurements have smaller uncertainties compared to those from NACO: the median separation and PA uncertainties are 0.005" and 0.6 • for NICI and 0.011" and 1.81 • for NACO. This increased precision is due to the partially transparent focal plane mask of NICI, which allows for an accurate measurement of the location of the star relative to the planet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnefoy et al. (2013)</ref> note the primary source of error in their astrometry is the uncertainty in the position of the star.</p><p>Magellan/MagAO : β Pic b was observed on UT 2012 December 04 in the Y S (0.985 µm) filter of Magellan MagAO+VisAO, and on UT 2012 December 01, 02, 04, and 07 in the 3.1 µm, 3.3 µm, L ′ , and M ′ filters of Magellan MagAO+Clio2. The astrometry and photometry from MagAO+VisAO is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Males et al. (2014)</ref> and from MagAO+Clio2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morzinkski et al. (2014)</ref>. Similar to NICI, the Magellan MagAO+VisAO instrument has a partially transmissive focal plane mask so the primary star is unsaturated in the data. MagAO+Clio2 data in 3.1 µm, 3.3 µm, and L ′ were taken with long and short exposures of saturated and unsaturated data, while M ′ data were entirely short unsaturated exposures.</p><p>The VisAO astrometry calibration is tied to the wider field of view Clio2 camera, and the two cameras are mounted simultaneously on the same rotator so they will have some common systematics, but the observations of the planet by these two cameras are otherwise independent measurements. To calibrate the Clio2 astrometry, we observed the Trapezium Cluster in the Orion Nebula as a reference. Over the nights of 2012 Dec. 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th UT, we locked the AO loop on either θ 1 Ori B or C. Stars θ 1 Ori A and E were also in the fields, as were many fainter Trapezium stars (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morzinkski et al. 2014</ref> for details). We compared the positions of the stars to their positions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Close et al. (2012)</ref> to derive the platescale, instrument angle, and distortion solution. We applied these solutions to our β Pic data to calibrate them. The position of the planet was then measured in the Clio2 images by a grid search over (x,y) positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MCMC Orbit Fitting</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Methods</head><p>We use a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to fit orbital parameters to the astrometric motion of β Pic b from 2003 to 2012, following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ford (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ford (2006)</ref>. Such an approach has previously been applied to astrometric orbits by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dupuy et al. (2010)</ref> for substellar companions, as well as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnefoy et al. (2013)</ref> for β Pic b itself. We compute two types of fits: one with the total system mass fixed (as done by all previous published orbital fits) and another with the total mass as a free parameter. For the fixed-mass case, we have six free parameters: the semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination angle (i), argument of periastron (ω), position angle of nodes (Ω), and the epoch of periastron passage (T 0 ). The period (P ) is determined from the semi-major axis using Kepler's Third Law and adopting a total system mass of 1.75 M ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crifo et al. 1997</ref>). For the floating-mass fit, the orbital period is the seventh free parameter, so the total mass is allowed to take on any value.</p><p>At the start of the chain, initial values are chosen for each free parameter. A proposed trial step is taken by choosing a displacement in all parameters by randomly drawing from six (or seven) Gaussians centered on the current parameters with fixed standard deviations. The probability ratio between current and proposed orbit parameters is computed by determining the difference in the χ 2 statistic (∆χ 2 ) for all astrometric epochs for β Pic b between the initial and trial sets of parameters. The choice of whether to adopt the trial parameters as the new step or to retain the current set is made via the Metropolis Hastings algorithm with probability ratio ∝ e −∆χ 2 2 . Non-physical parameters (a ≤ 0, P ≤ 0, e &lt; 0, e ≥ 1) are assigned a χ 2 of 10 6 while the three viewing angles (i, ω, Ω) and epoch of periastron passage (T 0 ) are allowed to take any values without limits. To ensure the chains run efficiently, the standard deviations of the Gaussians for choosing trial steps are chosen initially via an iterative procedure where chains are run with different values of standard deviation for each parameter. The standard deviations corresponding to an acceptance rate of 0.25 are used for the final chains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dupuy et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>After we terminate the MCMC chain, the angles are then wrapped around between 0 • and 180 • for inclination angle, -180 • and 180 • for argument of periastron, and 0 • and 360 • for position angle of nodes. Epoch of periastron passage is wrapped around to give a value in the range <ref type="bibr">[2005,2005+period]</ref>. 2005 is chosen to provide a single distribution of epoch of periastron passage free of discontinuities. Without radial velocity measurements of the star's reflex motion there is an ambiguity between Ω and Ω + 180 • -that is, whether the south/eastern half of the orbit is closer to the Earth or the north/western half -so while our chains only explored parameter space near Ω=212 • , the results are equally valid for Ω=32 • . 1</p><p>Ten chains are run from the same starting parameters so that we may test for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin (GR) statistic, with 10 8 steps per chain and parameters saved every 1000 steps. The GR statistic is essentially the ratio of the variance in each parameter in individual chains to the total variance for all chains. If each chain is sampling the same region of parameter space then the GR metric will be very close to unity. If the chains are still exploring different regions of parameter space when the chains are terminated, then the GR statistic will be significantly larger than 1. A GR statistic less than 1.1 indicates the chains are converging, while less than 1.01 means excellent convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ford 2006</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Results</head><p>We present medians and confidence intervals for each parameter in the fixed-mass case in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>. The inclination angle, argument of periastron, position angle of nodes, and epoch of periastron passage have a GR statistic less than 1.01, and the other two parameters have a GR statistic less than 1.1, indicating that our posterior distributions for all parameters are reliable. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> displays the resulting marginalized posterior probability distributions for the orbital parameters and total system mass for both the fixed-mass and floating-mass cases. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows an example set of orbital parameters from the fixed-mass MCMC chains that has the lowest χ 2 within the 68% confidence region for all parameters (χ 2 ν =1.38).</p><p>Our results for the fixed-mass case show an orbit with semi-major axis of about 9 AU is favored, with inclination angle and position angle of nodes (the two angles that describe the orientation of the orbit on the sky) very tightly constrained and eccentricity mainly &lt;0.2. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows covariances between some orbital parameters for the fixed-mass fit. There is a strong correlation between eccentricity and semi-major axis, with larger values of semi-major axis corresponding to more eccentric orbits. Given the presence of the disk, it is unlikely that the orbit of the planet is significantly non-circular (e 0.2), and we expect future observations to be most consistent with the shorter-period circular orbits from our MCMC chain. With a uniform prior on eccentricity, we find e &lt; 0.15 at 68% confidence and e &lt; 0.72 at 95% confidence. If we were to impose a prior that eccentricity must be smaller than 0.2, we would obtain a=8.9 +0.8 −0.3 AU and P =20.1 +2.5 −1.2 yr, with the distributions for the other parameters about the same as in the uniform prior case. Our MCMC results find a median of time of maximum elongation (when the projected star-planet separation reaches a maximum) of 2012.63 and 68% (95%) confidence interval between 2012.55 (2012.48) and <ref type="bibr">2012.70 (2012.79)</ref>. Our Magellan epochs are after turn around time in 99% of all orbits. So while the Magellan data represent the largest separation between star and planet in our astrometric record, our orbit fitting results indicate that maximum elongation was reached prior to these data being taken.</p><p>Finally, we consider the floating-mass MCMC fit. Though generally less constrained than the fixed-mass fit, the posterior mass distribution (lower right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref> shows that the previous estimated mass of 1.75 M ⊙ is well within the 68% confidence interval. While additional astrometry is required to place a more precise limit on the mass of the star β Pic, this total mass distribution of 1.6±0.3 M ⊙ indicates that our orbital fit and existing astrometric measurements are reasonable. Semi-major axis and period are highly correlated in our floating-mass fit, and while the chains have not converged for semi-major axis and period individually (GR statistics of 1.2), the GR statistic for mass is 1.0012, indicating a reliable measurement of the mass. If we were to impose the prior that e &lt; 0.2 in the floating-mass case, our mass constraints for β Pic would slightly tighten to 1.7±0.2 M ⊙ . Similarly, the semi-major axis range would shrink from 24 +51 −15 AU to 9.0 +0.9 −0.4 AU. The minimum χ 2 reached in the floating-mass chain (41.64) is similar to that for the fixed-mass chain (41.67). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crifo et al. (1997)</ref> estimate the mass of β Pic by comparing the position of the star on the HR diagram to theoretical evolutionary tracks, finding a good fit for masses between 1.7 and 1.8 M ⊙ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blondel &amp; Djie (2006)</ref> derive a similar mass, between 1.65 and 1.87 M ⊙ , again from evolutionary models and the HR diagram. Our dynamical mass is independent of any evolutionary model and so provides independent confirmation of the mass of the star, and indicates these previous estimates were accurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Comparison to Previous Fits</head><p>We now compare our results to previously published MCMC orbital fits. Comparing our posteriors to the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref>, we have similar distributions for semi-major axis and eccentricity but tighter constraints on the viewing angles of the orbit. For inclination angle and position angle of nodes, we find 88.9±0.7 • and 211.8±0.3 • compared to 88.5±1.7 • and 212.6±1.5 • from Chauvin et al. We find similar distributions in semi-major axis and eccentricity, though with smoother posteriors indicating our MCMC chains are better converged. (Chauvin et al. do not provide GR values for their fit but state that their GR statistics are consistent with convergence.) Since the preferred orbits from our chains are close to circular (68% having eccentricity less than 0.15), the argument of periastron and epoch of periastron passage are poorly defined as they were for Chauvin et al., since it is difficult to determine periastron in a nearcircular orbit. Nevertheless, the two values are tightly correlated (bottom right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). While the location of periastron is not well-defined, the location of the planet at a particular epoch between ∼2000 and ∼2020 is. . The semi-major axis from this fit is reported to be within 8-10 AU at 80% confidence; we find a less constrained semi-major axis, with 80% confidence lying between 8 and 14 AU. We also find a wider range of eccentricities that fit the data, with 80% confidence e &lt; 0.35 compared to e &lt; 0.15 reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnefoy et al. (2013)</ref>. Conversely, we find tighter constraints on the orientation of the orbit on the sky. From their <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, we determine that their inclination angle distribution is centered on 88.  <ref type="formula">(2014)</ref> and still see the same long eccentricity tail. In fact, the lowest chi-square orbit reached in the chain is in this tail (χ 2 ν = 0.45), with semi-major axis 47.8 AU and eccentricity of 0.81. The cause of this discrepancy is most likely the choice of priors, as a non-uniform prior on eccentricity can make high eccentricity orbits sufficiently unlikely so that the chain never leaves the low-period, low-eccentricity region of parameter space. For other orbital parameters, including inclination angle (with a reflection about 90 • ) and position angle of nodes, we precisely reproduce the 68% confidence intervals given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Macintosh et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we combine our dataset with the additional GPI astrometry point and re-fit the orbit. We find similar parameters for the fixed-mass case as we present here, a = 9.4 +11.8 −0.6 and e = 0.09 +0.49 −0.06 , with the same degenerate tail toward long periods and large eccentricities as before. We find slightly smaller error bars for inclination angle and position angle of nodes, i = 89.1±0.6 • and Ω = 211.4±0.24 • . While the 68% confidence intervals are largely unchanged for these parameters, in the floating-mass case we significantly reduce the uncertainty on the mass of β Pic, M = 1.76 +0.18 −0.17 M ⊙ , reaching 10% precision on the mass of the star. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Disk-Planet Alignment</head><p>In order to compare the position angle of the orbit to the disk, we perform a custom reduction of our 2011 NICI data to recover the disk. We begin by removing the azimuthally averaged profile of the point spread function from the individual images, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wahhaj et al. (2013a)</ref> except that the running azimuthal average used here is taken over 90 pixels instead of 30 pixels. This process removes large scale (&gt;90 pixels or 1.62") azimuthal structure from both the stellar halo and the disk. Since the β Pic disk is known to be edge-on, this procedure does not alter the disk profile significantly. After this step the disk reduction then proceeds with our standard ADI 2 Using our MCMC fit to the dataset presented here (VLT, NICI, and Magellan data) we would predict astrometry on 18 November 2013 of 0.415±0.007" and 212.3±0.6 • , within 1.5 and 0.1 σ of the GPI measurements, respectively. For the floating mass case the predicted positions are 0.424±0.019" and 212.3±0.6 • . The uncertainty in our predictions and the GPI measurement errors are similar for the fixed mass case, though with a slight offset in separation, so it is not surprising that adding the GPI datapoint to this analysis does not produce substantially different results. For the floating mass case, however, the prediction uncertainty for separation is three times larger than the measurement error, so the new point does noticeably refine the fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>pipeline.</head><p>The signal-to-noise maps of the reduced images for the CH 4 L and K cont filters are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The North/East (NE) and the South/West (SW) extensions of the disk were considered separately. As a function of radius we fit two Gaussians to the azimuthal disk profile, taking a 20 AU width at each sampling and stepping by 1 AU. We compute the median position angles for the two sides of the outer disk (between 60 and 120 AU) of 209.21±0.05 • and 28.79±0.06 • . The inner disk is only visible within 90 AU, and we find median values of the position angle between 60 and 90 AU of 212.99±0.07 • and 32.28±0.07 • . These are errors in the fit only and do not include uncertainty in the position of north of 0.2 • , as we are concerned only with the relative offset between the orbital plane of the planet and the position angle of the disk. We present these values along with relative and absolute errors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>To ensure that our reduction process has not biased these measurements we simulate the disk as a series of rings given the fit to the data, and then create a simulated dataset with the same set of rotation angles in our ADI dataset (a total range of 42 degrees) to model self-subtraction. The offset between the initial model and the measurements of the self-subtracted simulation was much smaller than 0.1 • , and so this effect is not the dominant source of error. Rather it is residuals from the stellar point spread function that dominate the measurement of the disk position angle.  <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref> presented a preliminary orbit based on four astrometric points (the bare minimum needed for an orbit fit) and a non-MCMC method and found the position angle of nodes to be between the two disks. When we apply our MCMC method to their data we find generally larger uncertainties in orbital parameters than <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Currie et al. (2011)</ref> report. Using an MCMC fit to their data, we find the position angle of nodes to be 210.9±0.9 • , 1.8σ greater than the outer disk PA and 2.2σ less than the inner disk PA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bonnefoy et al. (2013)</ref> fit more data with a similar MCMC method to ours and find the orbital plane of the planet to be consistent with the inner disk (Ω=212.6±1.5 • and Ω=212.0±1.1 • , respectively, both within 1σ of the PA of the inner disk). By including our higher precision astrometric data and longer time baseline, we find the position angle of nodes to be between the two disks, though closer to the inner disk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>We now consider the implications of a misalignment between β Pic b and the two disks. Our observations recall a dynamical picture of the β Pic disk recently painted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dawson et al. (2011)</ref>. If a planet on an inclined orbit (inclination i p ) is introduced into a disk of non-interacting particles with zero initial inclination, the secular theory of Laplace-Lagrange (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray &amp; Dermott 1999)</ref> show us that the inclinations of the particles will oscillate about i p , creating a cuspy disk structure with apparent inclination 2i p in its inner regions. Our measurement that the planet's inclination is intermediate between the two observed disk planes seems to supports this picture. In contrast, earlier simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mouillet et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Augereau et al. (2001)</ref> yielded a disk coplanar with the planet.</p><p>One important assumption built into the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dawson et al. (2011)</ref> model and supported by our observations is that the planetesimals are not yet collisionally relaxed (collisional relaxation in debris disks is the gradual process by which planetesimals lose energy and exchange momentum via collisions so that the distribution of their orbits approaches a steady state), as models of structure in other debris disks have assumed (e.g. Quillen 2006, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rodigas et al. 2014</ref>). Another important assumption built into the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dawson et al. (2011)</ref> model is that the planet is introduced instantaneously, fully formed, at time zero. We infer that the β Pic disk is probably not collisionally relaxed; this inference should yield some interesting constraints on models of the collisional evolution of planetesimals in debris disks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nesvold et al. 2013</ref>). Moreover, if the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dawson et al. (2011)</ref> model is indeed correct, it appears that the β Pic planet was introduced to its current orbit suddenly compared to the secular time scale, perhaps scattered there by another planet. Finally, we consider the transit event noted by Lecavelier Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etangs et al. (1995)</ref> in November 1981 and find very loose constraints on a transit of the planet given the available data. We search for such a transit by finding the smallest projected distance between star and planet between 2015 and 2019 and then subtract one or two orbital period from the returned epoch for each step in our MCMC chains, choosing the epochs that are closest to 1981. We find the most recent closest approach to be at epoch 2007.44 +0.14 −0.17 (crossing behind the star), with the next closest approach to take place in 2017.59 +0.60 −0.18 , adopting the orientation of the orbit from the RV measurements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lagrange et al. (2012b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Snellen et al. (2014)</ref> (see footnote 1). The median value for the epoch of closest approach one or two orbital period earlier than <ref type="bibr">2017 is 1977.52, with a 68% confidence interval between 1971.07 and 1982.14 (95% confidence between 1768 and 1993</ref>, given the long tail of the posterior for orbital period). The smallest projected distance from star to planet is less than 31 times the radius of β Pic (1.8±0.2 R ⊙ ); Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Folco et al. 2004</ref>) at 68% confidence (&lt;51 times the radius at 95% confidence). Thus we cannot rule out a transit with the current orbital fit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref> speculate that the transit event may not be caused by the planet itself but rather by solid material entrained by the planet and carried in its Hill sphere. We cannot rule out this possibility either, and more data are required. We predict that the next transit will take place between 2017.41 and 2018.18 at 68% confidence <ref type="bibr">(2017.27- 2019.19</ref> at 95% confidence), with a median epoch of 2017.59. Additional astrometric observations in the next few years will provide a more precise transit window and transit probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We have examined the orbit of β Pic b given five new epochs of data taken with Gemini/NICI and Magellan/MagAO, finding a semi-major axis of 9.1 +5 −0.5 AU and a period of 21 +21 −2 years. The astrometric record of β Pic b is now long enough to be able to remove the assumption of the total system mass, which was needed by all previous fits to this orbit. When we solve for the mass of β Pic itself we find a value of 1.76 +0.18 −0.17 M ⊙ , consistent with the expected value of 1.75 M ⊙ . The position angle of nodes for our fixed-mass orbit is offset from the observed position angles of the inner warped disk (at 3.2σ significance) and from the outer disk (at 7.4σ significance), suggesting that the disk is not collisionally relaxed.</p><p>Numerous degenerate orbital solutions exist for astrometric data that show minimal acceleration during the timeframe of the observations, in particular between semi-major axis, period, and eccentricity. Observing significant acceleration, and in particular the reversal of direction at maximum elongation, greatly reduces these degeneracies. Our orbital fit indicates that the planet has reached maximum elongation and is currently moving back toward the star, crossing to the other side of the star by ≈2018. β Pic b has been observed extensively since its reappearance in 2009 and the current window for studying the planet will remain open for just a few more years before the planet is undetectable behind the star again. Advanced planet-finding instruments such as GPI and SPHERE will likely allow for orbital monitoring of the planet closer to the star, so the time of lost contact is likely to be significantly shorter than it was between 2003 and 2009. The window for the next transit is between 2017.41 and 2018.18 at 68% confidence, and future astrometric monitoring will provide a more precise prediction to guide photometric monitoring.</p><p>We thank Jessica Lu and Adam Kraus for helpful discussions.

(2012b) present HARPS radial velocity data of β Pic between 2003 and 2010. The RV induced by the activity of the star dominates the expected reflex motion: the measured RV varies between −1.0 and 0.66 km/s with a standard deviation of 0.28 km/s, while the expected RV variation between 2003 and 2011 for the reflex motion of a 10 MJup planet with the median orbital parameters from the MCMC fit is 0.13 km/s. The linear fit to the RV computed by Lagrange et al. (2012b) indicates an increasing RV between 2003 and 2010, consistent with Ω near 212. This orientation is confirmed by the recent measurement of the RV of the planet by Snellen et al.

They fit this new datapoint along with the VLT astrometry presented in Chauvin et al. (2012). Their astrometric coverage thus has a 3-year gap between early 2011 and late 2013, and a datapoint one year later than the orbital coverage we present here. They find generally similar results for orientation of the orbit, Ω = 211.6±0.45 • and i = 90.69±0.68 • compared to 211.8±0.3 • and 88.9±0.7 • we present here. The peaks of their distributions for semi-major axis and eccentricity are similar to ours, but their posteriors do not reveal the same narrow degenerate tail toward large eccentricity and large semi-major axis.

(2012a), where the posi- tion of the center of the star is uncertain, the partially transmissive focal plane mask of NICI allows us to precisely measure the star position in images of the disk. Using our position angle for the SW disk of 209.21±0.05 • , our measurement of the position angle of nodes of the orbit of 211.8±0.3 • is 7.4σ discrepant with the position angle of the outer disk.
