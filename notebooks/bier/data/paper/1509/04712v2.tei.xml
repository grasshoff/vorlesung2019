			<abstract>
				<p>The NASA Kepler mission has revolutionised time-domain astronomy and has massively expanded the number of known extrasolar planets. However, the effect of wide multiplicity on exoplanet occurrence has not been tested with this dataset. We present a sample of 401 wide multiple systems containing at least one Kepler target star. Our method uses Pan-STARRS 1 and archival data to produce an accurate proper motion catalogue of the Kepler field. Combined with Pan-STARRS 1 SED fits and archival proper motions for bright stars, we use a newly developed probabilistic algorithm to identify likely wide binary pairs which are not chance associations. As by-products of this we present stellar SED templates in the Pan-STARRS 1 photometric system and conversions from this system to Kepler magnitudes. We find that Kepler target stars in our binary sample with separations above 6 ′′ are no more or less likely to be identified as confirmed or candidate planet hosts than a weighted comparison sample of Kepler targets of similar brightness and spectral type. Therefore we find no evidence that binaries with projected c 2015 RAS 2 N.R. Deacon et al. separations greater than 3,000 AU affect the occurrence rate of planets with P&lt;300 days around FGK stars.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler Mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) has to date identified 3697 exoplanet candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rowe et al. 2015</ref> and references therein). The confirmed candidates and inferred false positive rates have been used to determine the faction of stars with shorter period planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Howard et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>) with particular attention paid to the number of Earth-like planets around M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Morton &amp; Swift 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The determination of the parameters of transits exoplanets dependents heavily on the observed properties of the host star. Hence the study of exoplanet hosts' metallicity, radius and temperature has been a fruitful endeavour for several groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mann et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mann et al. , 2013b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Muirhead et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Newton et al. 2015</ref>). One key problem with late-type stars is the significant pollution of the dwarf sequence by background giants. While these can be readily identified through spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mann et al. 2012</ref>) this is hard to do for large numbers of stars. Because planets are difficult to impossible to find around giant stars using transit searches (and because evolved stars can cause errors in planet property determinations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bastien et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wang et al. 2015</ref>), planet occurrence calculations require an estimate of the number of evolved stars in the survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mann et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, calculating the planet fraction requires an accurate characterisation of the tens of thousands of Kepler target stars with no detected planet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mann et al. (2013a)</ref> showed that reduced proper motion is an efficient dwarf/giant discriminator for late K and M dwarfs which can be used on much larger samples of stars.</p><p>The quality of proper motions in the Kepler field varies with the magnitude of the target star. For the brightest objects either Hipparcos (to V ≈ 9) and Tycho (to V ≈ 11.5) provide</p><p>proper motion measurements with uncertainties of the order of a few millarcseconds per year. Astrographic observations in the UCAC 4 catalogue provide proper motion errors below 10 milliarcseconds per year for stars down to R ≈ 16. This covers the majority of the Kepler targets but will miss any faint common proper motion companions to these Kepler ⋆ E-mail:n.deacon2@herts.ac.uk Wide binarity and planet occurrence in the Kepler field 3 targets. Digitised archival photometric surveys such as SuperCOSMOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hambly et al. 2001)</ref> and USNO-B ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Monet et al. 2003</ref>) provide proper motions for these fainter stars. While these surveys have the advantage of long time baselines, their photographic nature means that each individual epoch is of poorer astrometric quality than modern CCD surveys. Additionally the most extensive proper motion survey based on photographic plates, the Superblink survey (with errors of approximately 8 milliarcseconds per year) only has a few subsets of data which are publicly available: high proper motion stars in the Northern hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lépine &amp; Shara 2005</ref>) and bright M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lépine &amp; Gaidos 2011</ref>).</p><p>Wide stellar companions are common in the field, with &gt;25% of nearby solar type stars having companions wider than 100 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raghavan et al. 2010</ref>). Among young stars, disk frequency ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kraus et al. 2012</ref>) and disk mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pascucci et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Harris et al. 2012</ref>) are suppressed for close binaries but the components of systems wider than 100 AU have similar disk properties to single stars. This suggests that wide binaries play a minor role in the initial sculpting of planetary systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Raghavan et al. (2006)</ref> found 24 companions wider than 100 AU amongst a sample of 131 radial velocity exoplanet hosts. This equates to a wide companion fraction of 18.3±3.7%, slightly lower than the ∼25% of solar-type stars in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref> which have companions wider than 100 AU. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wang et al. (2014</ref>) studied binary systems closer than 1500 AU finding a significant deficit of planets around the closest binaries with the effect dropping significantly becoming very small for systems wider than 100 AU. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kaib et al. (2013)</ref> suggests a different mechanism by which binaries with semi major axes of 1,000 AU or so can affect planetary systems. While orbiting through the Milky Way's gravitational potential, the orbital parameters of wide binary companions can be modified by gravitational interactions with passing stars driving them to more elliptical orbits and sending the companions close to their primary at periastron. Such close passage can disrupt the outer planets in such systems and induce planetary migration and/or ejection. The magnitude of this effect can be tested by comparing the planet occurrence rate around wide binary components with that around field stars. However this is complicated by coincident alignments of unrelated pairs of stars often mimicking true wide binaries. Accurate kinematic measurements and statistical models are required to separate true wide binaries from coincident pairings.</p><p>Wide binaries are also useful astrophysical probes, ideal for calibrating and testing empirical stellar property estimators. Gyrochronology, the process of estimating a star's age 4 N.R. <ref type="bibr">Deacon et al.</ref> from its rotation period, is one of the most valuable techniques in stellar astronomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnes 2007</ref>). This can be used to derive ages for exoplanet host stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Walkowicz &amp; Basri 2013)</ref> or ultracool companions to intermediate mass stars (e.g. ). These relations are often calibrated using open clusters of stars as anchor points. Each cluster provides a few hundred stars of different types, all of the same age. These discrete anchor points have the disadvantage that there are relatively few well studied, older open clusters with well determined rotation periods for their stellar members. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Meibom et al. (2015)</ref> recently provided rotation periods for the 2.5 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6819. More field-age tests of gyrochronology relations will improve stellar age estimates even further, but each cluster still only represents a single age. Wide binary systems, however, cover a wide range of ages.</p><p>While their age is not known independently as with clusters, they can still be used as a powerful test of gyrochonology at ages outside the range of known clusters. Wide binary systems are coeval systems and thus their components should have similar ages measured from gyrochronology. Kepler provides excellent photometry for rotation period calculation so any wide binaries of two Kepler target stars can be used to test gyrochronology relations.</p><p>Conversely, gyrochronology relations can be used to test if wide binary systems are true physical pairs. In this paper we present a proper motion survey of the Kepler field. We combine archival datasets from wide-field public surveys and target UKIRT observations with new Pan-STARRS 1 astrometry to produce accurate proper motions for Kepler target stars. This enables us to combine the excellent astrometric accuracy of a modern CCD-based survey with the long time baseline of archival plate data. We then use our Pan-STARRS 1 plus archival data proper motion catalogue, along with SED fits using Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS photometry, to select a population of wide binary pairs where at least one component is a Kepler target star. We then use these binaries to test whether wide binarity has an effect on exoplanet occurrence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DATASETS</head><p>2.1 Pan-STARRS 1 data A 1.8 m high etendue survey telescope, Pan-STARRS 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kaiser et al. 2002)</ref> recently completed its full three and a half year survey operations on Haleakala on Maui in the Hawaiian</p><p>Islands. This consisted of a suite of surveys of different cadences and depths. The Kepler field was included in the 3π survey which covers the full sky north of δ = −30 • in five filters (g P 1 , r P 1 , i P 1 , z P 1 and y P 1 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tonry et al. 2012</ref>). Each filter has approximately six pairs of observations each separated by roughly half an hour over the course of the survey for any one point on the sky, therefore a typical object will have 30 pairs of observations. The data from Pan-STARRS 1 are astrometrically and photometrically reduced and calibrated using the processes outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Magnier (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Magnier (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schlafly et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Magnier et al. (2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Astrometric accuracy</head><p>There are three separate uncertainties in our Pan-STARRS 1 astrometric uncertainty model: centroiding errors caused by photon noise, the Pan-STARRS 1 internal systematic floor and the systematic floor caused by comparing Pan-STARRS 1 with other surveys.</p><p>The astrometric centroiding error typically takes the form σ pos = a 2 + b 2 σ 2 mag where σ pos is our positional error in arcseconds, σ mag is the photometric error in magnitudes, a is our systematic floor and b is some conversion factor which depends on the PSF shape and whether the object lies in the source or background dominated noise regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(King 1983</ref>). The Pan-STARRS 1 PSF takes a form which includes a free parameter <ref type="bibr">(Magnier et al., in prep.</ref>).</p><p>Thus we cannot know b without knowing the exact PSF shape for every object. As this would be cumbersome and computationally impractical to implement, we take an empirical approach. We extracted all r P 1 detections in a 1×1 degree patch centred on R.A. = 18 h 42 m Dec. = 46 • 30 m and measured the scatter in each object's position about the mean position.</p><p>We then plotted this as a function of the mean photometric error for the detections of that object (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. We found that a model of the form σ pos = 0.015 2 + σ 2 mag was a good fit to the data. Hence we adopt 15 milliarcseconds as our Pan-STARRS 1 internal systematic floor and set our photon-noise positional errors to be the same as the magnitude error (i.e. b = 1).</p><p>To estimate the systematic error added by comparing Pan-STARRS 1 data with other surveys we again took another 1×1 degree test area (this time centred on R.A. = 19 h 14 m Dec. = 38 • 30 m as our first field has no SDSS data) and examined the positional scatter between Pan-STARRS 1 and three external surveys (SDSS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aihara et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref> and P.I. UKIRT data of the Kepler field processed using the same pipeline as UKIDSS data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lawrence et al. 2007</ref>). Selecting only bright objects which lay <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Astrometric scatter of r P 1 detections about mean object positions as a function of mean photometric error for the object's r P 1 detections. The red line shows a least squares fit of the form σpos = a 2 + b 2 σ 2 mag and the blue line shows our assumed astrometric model with a=15mas and b=1. Green dots are the median scatter in each 0.01 mag bin.</p><p>in the magnitude range of each of the surveys where the astrometric uncertainty is dominated by systematic errors (15 &lt; r &lt; 16 for SDSS and Pan-STARRS 1, 11 &lt; J &lt; 15 for 2MASS and UKIRT) we examined what the scatter about zero was for each pair of surveys.</p><p>This provided us with six linear combinations of the systematic variances of the surveys.</p><p>We solved these as a set of equations by singular value decomposition finding that the systematic variance of Pan-STARRS 1 data compared to external datasets is approximately 38 milliarcseconds (including our internal systematic floor of 15 milliarcseconds). Once the internal systematic floor is subtracted in quadrature, we find a systematic error going from the Pan-STARRS 1 reference frame to some external reference of 35 milliarcseconds. Both external floor and internal floor are used later in our calculation of proper motions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">UKIRT data</head><p>We made use of observations which were made of the Kepler field using WFCAM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Casali et al. 2007</ref>) on the UK Infrared telescope which are now public. These data came from program  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Public survey data</head><p>We included astrometry from multiple public surveys in our work. We drew data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR8; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aihara et al. 2011</ref>), the USNO-B digitisation of photographic plate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Monet et al. 2003</ref>) and the WISE All-Sky Survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Wright et al. 2010</ref>). The astrometry and photometry from these surveys were all extracted from the Vizier online archive service with the exception of WISE dataset which was downloaded from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive. To avoid spurious faint photographic plate detections affecting our proper motion fits we ignored any detections in USNO-B fainter than B J = 19, R=19 and I N =18.</p><p>This last cut is similar to that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deacon et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deacon &amp; Hambly (2007)</ref>.</p><p>For archival surveys we used the astrometric error estimates provided by the relevant survey archives with the exception of SDSS. For this survey we used the error model used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref> which features a 40 milliarcsecond systematic floor (similar to that found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pier et al. 2002)</ref> and photon noise term that scales as the quoted magnitude uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CALCULATION OF PROPER MOTIONS</head><p>We divided the Kepler field into 1×1 degrees chunks and in each of these areas extracted Pan-STARRS 1 data from the second large-scale reprocessing of the data (PV2) using scripts written in the Desktop Virtual Observatory shell language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Magnier et al. 2008</ref>). We extracted as our base catalogue the average catalog objects in the target area. This average object catalogue consists of photometric and astrometric properties derived from all observations of each individual object and includes initial Pan-STARRS 1-only proper motions.</p><p>As some objects will have proper motions that will take their archival detections outside our pairing radius of 1 ′′ , we used the calculated Pan-STARRS 1-only proper motions to find the likely position of each object at the epochs of each archival non-Pan-STARRS observation.</p><p>We then searched around these positions with a pairing radius of 1 ′′ to identify the objects' detection in each survey. This procedure is vulnerable to spurious proper motions in the Pan-STARRS 1 database so we do not applying the proper motion "rewind" procedure for any object with a Pan-STARRS 1 proper motion χ 2 ν &gt; 10. To calculate our proper motions we constructed a covariance matrix taking into account that the Pan-STARRS 1 measurements will have three errors associated with them, photon 8 N.R. <ref type="bibr">Deacon et al.</ref> noise, the systematic floor of relative Pan-STARRS 1 astrometry and the systematic error between Pan-STARRS 1 and other surveys. The Pan-STARRS 1 measurements will have errors correlated with each other with a covariance of the square of the Pan-STARRS 1 to other surveys systematic floor. No other survey data was given off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix. We then calculated the proper motion for each object based on the measurements and our covariance matrix.</p><p>We performed our fit in three stages. Having examined a number of preliminary fits we found that these were often offset by one or two Pan-STARRS data points which were significant outliers. Performing a 3σ clip around our initial fit would be the most obvious solution. However this initial fit would be strongly affected by the outlier points and hence may exclude many valid datapoints which were outliers to this erroneous initial proper motion fit. Hence we performed an initial clipping removing any Pan-STARRS 1 data point which was more than a 10σ outlier (i.e. a 10σ outlier in the quadrature sum of the number of standard deviations the object was an outlier from the fit in R.A. and Dec.). After this, we refitted our data and applied a more stringent 3σ cut again only on the Pan-STARRS 1 data.</p><p>This was followed by a final refitting of our proper motions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows and example of the clipping and fitting process on one Kepler target.</p></div>

In our remaining analysis we define significant proper motions as being more significant than 5σ and good quality proper motions as being calculated from 10 or more measurements, having a USNO object within 6 ′′ and one PS1 object within 3 ′′ , being fainter than r P 1 = 14.5 mag. (i.e. not saturated), brighter than r P 1 = 19 mag and having a reduced χ 2 less than 4. This results in proper motions which are not confused by crowding, saturation or outliers and likely involving a time baseline of over 50 years. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of all objects in our sample with unsaturated photometry (left) and photometry for unsaturated Kepler targets (right) in a r P 1 − i P 1  vs.g P 1 − r P 1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Probabilistic binary selection</head><p>Stars in wide binary systems are typically found due to their common proper motion. Identification of such pairings is complicated by the presence of nearby stars, which by chance, have the same proper motion as each other despite having no physical connection. These coincident pairings are often removed with hard cuts or using by-eye judgements. Two better defined processes for binary star selection come from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lépine &amp; Bongiorno (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dhital et al. (2010)</ref>. The former empirically defines a region of proper motion and separation space where coincident pairings are unlikely. The latter method uses a model of the Galaxy to define the probability that an unrelated star would have a particular proper motion and position difference from the target primary star. Here we define a hybrid of these two systems which calculates the probability that an object is a true binary based on a estimate of the background star population, but unlike Dhital (2010), our coincident pairing estimates are purely empirical. However unlike the two previously mentioned methods, we take the likely distribution of the wide binary population into account as well.</p><p>Similar methods of separating objects from a background population have been used to c identify members of open clusters using their proper motion such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Deacon &amp; Hambly (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sanders (1971</ref> with similar proper motions, positions, distances and masses to the candidate secondary.</p><p>Appendix A outlines the mathematics used in our probability calculations.</p></div>

These were KIC 9085834 and KIC 11017620, which both produced a double-peaked correlation function or showed pairs of stellar lines. Nine of the pairs we classify as having p bin &gt; 0.6 have radial velocity differences less than 4 km/s. One of these contains spectroscopic binary while another three objects in the same probability range have radial velocities which are discrepant (excluding spectroscopic binaries). Of the five low probability objects we observed all but one have discrepant radial velocities. This suggests that our method can reliably select true co-moving systems.  This process is outlined in Appendix C. We performed our SED fits using the same process as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref> fitting a reduced χ 2 for all good data points, removing the most discrepant data point around the best fit (the fit with the lowest reduced χ 2 ) if it is more discrepant than 3σ, refitting, redoing our clipping of the most discrepant point with the same conditions as before and finally refitting. We do not clip if it would leave fewer than four good data points and we not do an initial fit if we have fewer than this number. Note that for the Pan-STARRS 1 photometry we exclude filters where the object is marked as extended and has fewer than four detections. We also exclude data from filters above the following saturation magnitude limits: g P 1 = 14.5, r P 1 = 14.5, i P 1 = 14.5, c <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. A comparison between the measured spectral types and effective temperatures for our calibration stars and those derived from fitting. Note the objects shown here have at least four photometric measurement and exclude out M9.5 and L0 calibration objects as we do not have an L0 template to fit these against. In the upper plot a positive y-axis value indicates that our spectral type estimate from SED fitting is earlier than that derived from spectroscopy. Many of the M dwarfs have effective temperatures derived from their spectral types, hence the discrete temperatures in this region of the plot z P 1 = 14.5, y P 1 = 14.5 and J M KO = 10.5. This last saturation limit is the same as that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deacon et al. (2009)</ref>. It should be stated that our SED templates (like those used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kraus et al. 2014b</ref>) assume the target is a dwarf. Hence this method may miss or incorrectly match binaries containing one or more evolved stars. To test the accuracy of our SED fitting method, we ran our calibration sample SEDs (as defined in Appendix B) through our fitting procedure. The results of these fits are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. This plot only includes astronomical objects with actual Pan-STARRS 1 measurement used for calibration not the synthetic Pan-STARRS 1 magnitudes used to model hot stars. types which are typically quoted in discrete steps of half a subclass. For example our F and G calibration stars which are mostly drawn from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Huber et al. (2014)</ref> have typical errors on their measured effective temperatures of about 110 K equating to 1.5 subclasses. This means that our quoted scatter in our measurements is likely to be around 180 K or 2.0 subclasses for F and G stars. We choose not to alter our scatter on K and M stars as we do not have a formal error on spectral type (and hence effective temperature) for many of these calibration objects. Our SED fitting procedure produces error estimates based on the calculated reduced χ 2 distribution. However these are often extremely small confidence ranges compared to the scatter we have derived here. Hence when an object has a confidence range in spectral type that falls below our calculated empirical scatter, we substitute our empirical scatter measurements to estimate one sigma confidence regions for our calculated distance moduli and bolometric magnitude. This results in a typical uncertainty in bolometric magnitude of 0.4 mag.</p></div>

To remove giants from our binary sample we set two cuts, one using g, r and D 51 photometry from the Kepler Input Catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) and one using 2MASS photometry.</p><p>Both these use the separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mann et al.

We restricted our sample to Kepler targets with 10 &lt; K p &lt; 16 and 0.5M ⊙ &lt; M &lt; 1.5M ⊙ as there are few Kepler target stars outside these ranges (where we assume a mass from our SED fitting). Our separation greater than 6 ′′ cut meant we largely sample binaries with projected separations above 3,000 AU (see <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). After our restrictions on mass and K p magnitude we were left with 419 objects from which we identified 10 KOI candidate planet hosts and 3 KOI confirmed planet hosts 3 (with two additional candidate planet hosts with masses outside our 0.5M ⊙ &lt; M &lt; 1.5M ⊙ range). Hence 3.1±0.9% of our likely binary primaries are candidate or confirmed planet hosts. No binary system where both components were KOIs was identified.</p><p>We also constructed a comparison sample of Kepler targets. These were 159152 objects which passed our giant exclusion criteria and had 10 &lt; K p &lt; 16 and 0.5M ⊙ &lt; M &lt;</p><p>1.5M ⊙ . We found that our binary primaries were generally brighter and lower mass than the comparison sample of Kepler targets in general. This is likely due to our method selecting low-mass, nearby, high proper motion binaries preferentially as the number of coincident pairings with low-mass, nearby, high proper motion stars will be very low. To remedy this, we constructed 2D histograms for both our binary primaries and our comparison stars with bin sizes of 1 mag in K p and 0.2M ⊙ in mass. We then used these to construct a weighting factor for each comparison star based on its K p magnitude and mass,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W (K p , m) = N bin (K p , m) N comp (K p , m)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where W is our weighting factor, N comp is the number of comparison stars in that bin and N bin is the number of binary primaries in that bin. The median bin in N bin contained 12 objects while the median bin in N comp contained 1804 objects. To estimate the number of planet hosts in our sample we crossmatched our comparison sample with the list of KOIs and then summed the weighting factors to calculate how many planet hosts would be expected in a sample of comparison stars of identical size, magnitude distribution and mass distribution.</p><p>This led us to a comparison KOI rate of 2.4±0.5%. Hence we find no evidence for suppression or enhancement of the number of wide binary components which host exoplanets detectable by Kepler. We found that 1.0±0.5% of our binaries had more than one Kepler confirmed or candidate planet while 0.5±0.1% of our weighted sample did. This is again a statistically insignificant difference. We also examined the distributions of orbital period and planetary radius (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 12</ref>) finding no statistically significant differences between the candidate and confirmed exoplanets around our binary components and around a similar sample of</p><p>Kepler targets. Wide binarity and planet occurrence in the Kepler field 27</p><p>Our work finds no statistically significant difference between the fraction of wide binary components which are identified as being Kepler Objects of Interest and a sample of Kepler targets of similar brightness and spectral type. While these KOIs are not all confirmed planet hosts, the fact that there is no significant difference indicates that in the regime where both our binary and comparison sample have detect planets (P&lt;300 days) there is no evidence that a wide stellar companion with a separation wider than 3,000 AU will have a large effect on planet occurrence. Note that we do not claim that our comparison sample only contains single stars as many will have unresolved companions or companions which are too faint.</p><p>This sample relies on a small number of binaries containing 419 Kepler targets. The ongoing</p><p>Kepler K2 mission will drastically increase the number of stars in wide binaries probed for transiting exoplanets. This will increase the accuracy of the measurement of any possible effect from wide binarity. Additionally K2 will focus more on M dwarfs, objects largely excluded from our analysis here. Finally it should be noted that our study does not disprove the theoretical hypothesis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kaib et al. (2013)</ref> that wide binaries can affect the orbits of planets. This effect could still be extremely significant for planets in wider orbits similar to the gas giants in our own Solar System.</p></div>

Objects were only incorporated into the fit in a particular PS1 band if they had a magnitude error less than 0.05, more than 2 detections, were not saturated in that band, were not extended in that band and had been subject to the "ubercal" calibration process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schlafly et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>We note that there are few objects in the Huber et al.

For spectral type we used ten subclasses per spectral classification.This is a departure from the traditional picture where there are no K6, K8 and K9 dwarfs. However we use the effective temperature scale of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pecaut &amp; Mamajek (2013)</ref> who include these missing spectral types in their temperature scale. Our g P 1 − i P 1 to spectral type fit is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure B1</ref>. We then produced splines for relations between g P 1 −i P 1 and other colours; r P 1 −i P 1 , i P 1 −z P 1 , z P 1 −y P 1 and y P 1 −J 2M ASS .</p><p>These fits are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure B2</ref>. We then used these colours at each g P 1 − i P 1 (and hence spectral type) to produce colours relative to the 2MASS J-band magnitude.</p><p>These were then combined with the bolometric magnitudes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref>  magnitude relations for spectral types M7 and later.

These had proper motions from UCAC4 (Zacharias et al. 2013) or PPMXL (Roeser et al. 2010) and photometric dis- tances and mass estimates calculated using the methods of Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007) and Kraus et al. (2014b). We assumed a log-flat separation distribution (Opik 1924) 1 , a flat mass ratio distribution (Raghavan et al. 2010) and set the binary fraction wider than 100 AU to be 25%. This latter number is similar to the number of binaries wider than this limit found around nearby solar-type stars by Raghavan et al. (2010). We did not set a lower proper motion limit and considered only pairs with observed separations below five arcminutes and projected separations below 10,000 AU. We used this technique to calculate companionship probabilities for these pairs and then flagged a subsample of these pairs for follow-up observations. A total of 26 wide binary candidate systems (52 stars) were observed with the Tull Coude spectrograph (Tull et al. 1995) at the Harlan J. Smith 2.7m Telescope at McDonald Obser- vatory on the nights of August 8, 9, 10, and 11, 2014. Exposure times varied from 120s to 1200s, which was sufficient to achieve a median SNR (per resolving element) of &gt; 30. The resulting spectra cover 3800Å3800Å to 10500Å10500Å, with a gap from 4550Å4550Å to 4750Å4750Å due to internal reflection, and at a resolution of R ≃ 60, 000. Pair components were always observed within minutes of each other to reduce systematic sources of error (e.g., atmospheric changes, tele- scope flexure, Earths motion). Data were reduced using standard IRAF reduction tools, including bias and flat field correction, extraction of the 1 dimensional spectrum, and wave- length calibration. An additional wavelength correction was applied by cross correlating the observed telluric lines to a model atmosphere as described in Gullikson et al. (2014). We cross-correlated the observations of our target pair components with each other to deter- mine the radial velocity difference. These values for our observed pairs (along with their binarity probability p bin ) are listed in Table 3. The errors in radial velocity difference come 1 This is flatter than the typical log-normal separation distribution used for binaries closer than 100 AU but is appropriate as the binaries we identify in this work are typical a few thousand AU in separation c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-39</figDesc></figure>

There are no empirical SEDs in the Pan-STARRS 1 photometric system defined by Tonry et al. (2012) over the required range of spectral types (A-M). Dupuy &amp; Liu (2009) present synthetic colours for a range of spectral types based on initial characterisation of the throughput of the Pan-STARRS 1 photometric system. Aller et al. (2013) present a series of different SED templates for M dwarfs. These include templates for M and early L dwarfs in the star forming region Upper Sco and early M dwarfs based on members of the Praesepe and Coma Ber clusters. Finally Aller et al. (2013) presents individual M9 and L0 dwarfs to be used templates for field stars. Note that Aller et al. (2013) used photometry from a previous processing version to our work so there may be subtle differences between the photometric systems. We began by taking the large collection of known dwarfs in the Kepler field with spec- trally determined effective temperature from Huber et al. (2014) and references therein. We converted their effective temperatures to spectral type using the dwarf effective temperature scale of Pecaut &amp; Mamajek (2013). For M dwarfs from the work of Martin et al. (2013) cwe note that the effective temperatures in this work are derived from SED fitting so in- stead we convert the objects' determined spectral types to effective temperatures using the Pecaut &amp; Mamajek (2013) scale. We supplement the objects from the Huber et al. (2014) collection with late M dwarfs drawn from the compilation of Faherty et al. (2009) as these objects typically have high proper motions we corrected their positions to an epoch 2010.0 for comparing to Pan-STARRS 1 data. We also added M dwarfs from the sample of West et al.</figDesc></figure>

calculation of Kepler magnitudes from Pan-STARRS 1 data we synthesised Kepler magni-

tudes for a series of stars using the dwarf spectral sequence of Pickles (1998) for types B9 

to M6. We supplemented these with seven late M dwarfs from the Dwarf Archives spectral 

library 4 with sufficient spectral coverage and three L and T dwarfs from the compilation 

of Leggett et al. (2010). Note for the Leggett et al. (2010) spectra we included objects with 

wavelength coverage until 4000Å4000Å. This leaves the 3800-4000Å4000Å region with no data in the
