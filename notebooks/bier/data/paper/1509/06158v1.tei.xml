				<p>Context. Small inner working angle coronagraphs, like the vortex phase mask, are essential to exploit the full potential of ground-based telescopes in the context of exoplanet detection and characterization. However, the drawback of this attractive feature is a high sensitivity to pointing errors, which degrades the performance of the coronagraph. Aims. We propose a tip-tilt retrieval technique based on the analysis of the final coronagraphic image, hereafter called Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS). Methods. Under the assumption of small phase aberrations, we show that the behaviour of the vortex phase mask can be simply described from the entrance pupil to the Lyot stop plane by Zernike polynomials. This convenient formalism is used to establish the theoretical basis of the QACITS technique. Simulations have been performed to demonstrate the validity and limits of the technique, including the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. Results. The QACITS technique principle is validated by experimental results in the case of an unobstructed circular aperture, and by simulations in presence of a central obstruction. The typical configuration of the Keck telescope (24% central obstruction) has been simulated with additional high order aberrations. In these conditions, our simulations show that the QACITS technique is still adapted to centrally obstructed pupils and performs tip-tilt retrieval with a precision of 5 × 10 −2 λ/D when wavefront errors amount to λ/14 rms and 10 −2 λ/D for λ/70 rms errors (with λ the wavelength and D the pupil diameter). Conclusions. We have developed and demonstrated a tip-tilt sensing technique for vortex coronagraphs. The implementation of the QACITS technique is based on the analysis of the scientific image and does not require any modification of the original setup. Current facilities equipped with a vortex phase mask can thus directly benefit from this technique to improve the contrast performance close to the axis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Vortex coronagraphs <ref type="bibr">(VC, Mawet et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Foo et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mawet et al. 2009</ref>) stand amongst the most promising focal plane phase masks envisioned for the next generation instruments of future very large telescopes (e.g. METIS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandl et al. 2014</ref>). Theoretically, this coronagraphic solution provides a perfect star light rejection and other valuable features for direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets: achromaticity, continuous 360 • discovery space and small inner working angle (angular distance where the off-axis transmission reaches 50%). For these reasons, vortex phase masks already equip several infrared instruments on 10 m class ground-based telescopes, namely VLT/NACO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mawet et al. 2013</ref>), VLT/VISIR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Delacroix et al. 2012</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kerber et al. 2014</ref>), LBT/LMIRCam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Defrère et al. 2014</ref>), Subaru/SCExAO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jovanovic et al. 2015</ref>) and very recently Keck/NIRC2. Scientific results have been obtained using the coronagraphic mode of these facilities, leading to the detection of exoplanets and circumstellar disks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Absil et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Milli et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reggiani et al. 2014</ref>). The off-axis well-corrected subaperture on the Palomar Hale tele-⋆ F.R.S.-FNRS Research Associate scope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Serabyn et al. 2007</ref>) also provides a VC mode, which has led to impressive results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Serabyn et al. 2010</ref>), including the detection of a companion very close to its host star (ǫ Cephei), at an angular separation of 1.1 λ/D ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mawet et al. 2011</ref>, λ and D being the wavelength of observation and the telescope diameter respectively).</p><p>However, a small inner working angle comes inevitably at a cost. Vortex phase masks, and in particular vortices of topological charge l p = 2 like the Annular Groove Phase Masks (AGPM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mawet et al. 2005</ref>), are amongst the focal plane masks that offer the narrowest inner working angle (down to 1 λ/D), but it also means that they are highly sensitive to the centering of the star on the mask. Accurate tracking systems are therefore required to limit the contrast loss due to pointing errors. A variety of low-order aberration sensing techniques exists and is used in current instruments, as reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mawet et al. (2012)</ref>. In order to avoid non-common path errors, the sensor must be placed as close as possible to the coronagraphic phase mask. Solutions include sensors built just before the coronagraphic mask, like the Differential Tip-Tilt Sensor (DTTS) of SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baudoz et al. 2010</ref>, where part of the light is diverted thanks to a dichroic plate), or the Cal low-order wavefront sensor of GPI Article number, page 1 of 12 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. Huby_2015_QACITS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wallace et al. 2010</ref>, which uses the light rejected by the central spot of the occulting mask). For focal-plane phase masks, the later solution cannot be implemented, but a comparable solution has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Singh et al. (2014)</ref>, making use of the light rejected by the coronagraph thanks to a reflective Lyot stop. Finally, phase retrieval techniques can also be applied directly from the image acquired by the scientific detector, like the COFFEE sensor implemented in the SPHERE instrument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sauvage et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a solution belonging to the latter category. It is based on the analysis of the final image produced by a VC to retrieve the tip-tilt affecting the beam incident on the phase mask. The principle of this technique, referred to as Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS) has first been introduced by <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. (2012)</ref> for the four quadrant phase mask (FQPM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rouan et al. 2000)</ref>. It consists of quantifying the asymmetry observed in the coronagraphic point spread function (PSF), using the same principle as a quadrant cell detector. The differential intensities, or intensity gradients, are related to the pointing error and allow the estimation of the tip-tilt aberration affecting the beam. The simplicity of this technique makes it very easy to implement on current instruments working with a vortex phase mask, as there is no need for any modification of the optical setup.</p><p>In the next section, we describe the QACITS technique applied to the perfect VC with an unobstructed pupil, and in particular the mathematical model linking the asymmetry in the image and the tip-tilt, followed in Sect. 3 by an experimental validation of the model. For the sake of clarity, the details of the analytical computation are given in the appendices, where we introduce a formalism based on Zernike polynomials. In Sect. 4, we detail the implications of a central obstruction on the PSF shape, and thus on the model used in QACITS. Additionally, we propose a slightly modified QACITS using two distinct image areas independently. In Sect. 5, we report on simulation results of the QACITS performance in presence of higher order aberrations affecting the wavefront. In the final section, we draw the conclusions of our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">QACITS: Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing</head><p>In this section, we introduce the QACITS post-coronagraphic technique to retrieve the tip-tilt affecting the beam upstream a vortex phase mask. The demonstration by <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. (2012)</ref> in the case of the FQPM is based on simulations and experimental data but an analytical model could also be derived (P. Baudoz, private communication). In the present section, we derive the analytical model for the VC of charge l p = 2, based on the typical coronagraph layout illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. For that purpose, we use the Zernike formalism described in detail in Appendix A.</p><p>2.1. The quadrant analysis principle <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. (2012)</ref> have shown that the amount of tip-tilt aberration that affects the wavefront upstream the coronagraphic mask can be retrieved by analysing the residuals of the attenuated on-axis image acquired by the scientific detector. Indeed, this aberration induces an asymmetry in the pattern, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The asymmetry is quantified by two flux measurements, ∆I x and ∆I y , corresponding to the flux gradient along two orthogonal directions in the image, which can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆I x = (I 2 + I 4 ) − (I 1 + I 3 ) I 0 and ∆I y = (I 1 + I 2 ) − (I 3 + I 4 ) I 0 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with <ref type="formula">I</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Empirically, <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. (2012)</ref> found that in the small aberration approximation, these quantities are directly linked to the amount of tip-tilt in the x and y directions, T x and T y respectively, following the model</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆I x = β T 3 x + αT x T 2 y and ∆I y = β T 3 y + αT y T 2 x ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>β being a normalization coefficient. In the case of the FQPM, they found α FQPM = 4 and managed to find an approximate solution of the system. In the following section, we show that for the vortex phase mask, the model can be derived analytically using the Zernike-based analysis.</p></div>

In the small aberration approximation, the exponential function describing the wavefront can be expanded and approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E pup = e iφ ≈ 1 + iφ − φ 2 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The second order expansion is needed in order to make the nonsymmetrical terms appear in the final PSF expression.

Indeed, when propagating through the vortex focal plane mask to the Lyot plane, these Zernike modes translate into complex linear combinations of Zernike polynomials inside the geometrical pupil (the components outside the pupil are discarded here, as they are blocked by the Lyot stop).</p><p>Using the conversion table that gives the field inside the reimaged geometrical pupil after a VC of charge l p = 2 (Table A.1), we can thus directly express the electric field after the Lyot stop as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E Lyot = iT x − T y 2 Z 2 (r) + −T x − iT y 2 Z 3 (r) − (T x + iT y ) 2 2 √ 3 Z 4 (r) −i T 2 x + T 2 y 2 √ 6 Z 5 (r) − T 2 x + T 2 y 2 √ 6 Z 6 (r).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>2.3. Final image analysis</p><p>The electric field in the detector plane is obtained by the Fourier transform of Eq. 7 (the Fourier transform of the Zernike polynomials is reminded in Eq. A.3), which leads to with (α, ψ) = α the polar coordinates in the image plane. The final image measured by the detector is the squared modulus of the previous expression and is thus given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E det = π 2 (T x + iT y ) 2 2J 3 (2πα) 2πα + π(T x + iT y ) 2J 2 (2πα) 2πα e iψ + π 2 (T 2 x + T 2 y ) 2J 3 (2πα) 2πα e 2iψ ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">I det = π 2 T 2 x + T 2 y A 2 (α) 2 + 1 2 T 2 x + T 2 y 2 A 3 (α) 2 + (T 4 x − T 4 y ) cos(2ψ) + 2(T 3 x T y + T 3 y T x ) sin(2ψ) A 2 3 (α) + 2 (T 3 x + T x T 2 y ) cos(ψ) + (T 3 y + T 2 x T y ) sin(ψ) A 2 (α)A 3 (α) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A i (α) = 2J i (2πα) 2πα .</formula><p>The final image consists of several terms, but only the last two contribute to the axial asymmetry in the image, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>. As a consequence, the relation between tip-tilt and the asymmetry simply writes</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆I x = β T 3 x + T x T 2 y , ∆I y = β T 3 y + T y T 2 x .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Here, β is a normalization constant, corresponding to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">β = 8π 2 I 0 α 0 0 A 2 (α)A 3 (α)αdα,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with α 0 the maximal value allowed for α when integrating over the finite size quadrants (typically of few λ/D). For the sake of simplicity, the integral has been expressed using polar coordinates, but rigorously it should be rewritten in order to consider the square shape of the quadrants. This result is fully consistent with the model found empirically by <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. (2012)</ref> for the FQPM. The only difference lies in the value of the α parameter of the model given by Eq. 2: α FQPM = 4 while α vortex = 1. In the vortex case, the system admits a unique solution, which can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">T x = ∆I x β 1 3       ∆I 2 x ∆I 2 x + ∆I 2 y       1 3 , T y = ∆I y β 1 3        ∆I 2 y ∆I 2 x + ∆I 2 y        1 3 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The particular value of α vortex reflects the fact that a vortex phase mask is perfectly centro-symmetric, which is not the case for the A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. Huby_2015_QACITS FQPM. Indeed, from this system of equations, it can be shown that the simple law</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∆I θ = βT 3 θ (13)</formula><p>is sufficient to describe the relation between the tip-tilt and the asymmetry, as soon as the differential intensity ∆I θ is measured along the axis of the applied tip-tilt T θ . In this case, the differential intensity measured in the orthogonal direction, ∆I θ+π/2 , is indeed zero. The direction of the tip-tilt can be inferred from the ∆I x and ∆I y measurements: tan θ = ∆I y /∆I x , implying that ∆I θ = (∆I 2 x + ∆I 2 y ) 1/2 . In other words, it means that the crossterms T x T 2 y and T y T 2 x in Eq. 10 are not due to a cross-talk between the two axes, like in the case of the FQPM, but are rather due to a change of reference axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental validation</head><p>The model describing the relation between the tip-tilt amount and the asymmetry in the VC image has been validated thanks to experimental data. Test campaigns were indeed carried out for characterizing new-generation L-band AGPMs recently manufactured at Uppsala Universitet (Vargas Catalan et al., in prep).</p><p>These campaigns have been conducted on the YACADIRE bench at LESIA (Observatoire de Paris). This bench was used to characterize the coronagraphic masks for SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boccaletti et al. 2008</ref>) and thus mimics its optical layout ( f /40 converging beam at the focal plane). We used a circular nonobstructed pupil and a circular Lyot stop (radius downsized by 80% with respect to the entrance pupil radius). For the testing of the AGPMs, a cold L-band spectral filter was installed in the camera enclosure. The source is a Tungsten lamp, feeding a single-mode fibre. The bench layout is detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Delacroix et al. (2013)</ref>, who report on the first laboratory characterization of L-band AGPMs.</p><p>The AGPM was first centred in x and y with respect to the beam by minimizing the flux integrated by the camera. The position along the optical axis was also optimized. Sets of 50 images were taken for different positions of the AGPM along the x axis. The ∆I x and ∆I y values are measured for every image. One has to note that translating the AGPM in the focal plane has not the same effect on the coronagraphic image as a tilted wavefront hitting the mask. Its shape will be affected in the same way, but it remains centred on the same position, while a tilted wavefront induces an additional translation of the image. This has been taken into account in the data processing (the quadrants were shifted by the number of pixels expected for the corresponding tip-tilt).</p><p>The T x and T y are estimated for each image using Eq. 12. For one position, the final tip-tilt estimates result from the mean of the 50 estimates, and the error bar from their standard deviation.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>. The T x estimates are in agreement with the true tip-tilt for a range of around ±0.5 λ/D from the center, where the estimations start to diverge from the expected value by more than their error bar. While T y = 0 was expected for the other axis, it seems that the position in that direction was not optimal and that the AGPM was probably off by about −0.07 λ/D, corresponding to a shift of 10 µm in the focal plane. The data set has also been processed to estimate the transmission efficiency as a function of tip-tilt along the x direction. These results are detailed in the Appendix B.2 and show that the highest extinction rate was obtained at 0.02 λ/D from the position that was thought to be optimal during the experiment. This corresponds to a shift of 3.5 µm in the focal plane.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that the model derived to retrieve the tip-tilt is valid for a circular non-obstructed pupil. The post-processing of the images has also shown that the manual optimization of the x and y position of the AGPM might not be optimal (for this particular experiment, the best manual alignment of the AGPM was off by 0.02λ/D and 0.07λ/D in x and y, respectively), showing the limit of a manual positioning, as it is currently performed at the telescope. An automated method of tip-tilt retrieval based on the QACITS post-coronagraphic analysis will thus significantly improve the vortex phase mask centering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">QACITS on a centrally obstructed pupil</head><p>All the considerations from the previous sections are valid for a circular non-obstructed pupil. However, ground-based telescopes are usually centrally obstructed by the shadow of the secondary mirror. In the case of a central obstruction, the field distribution at the Lyot plane is affected by an additional contribution that falls inside the geometrical pupil, even for an on-axis source, thus preventing from a perfect on-axis starlight rejection. This significantly impacts the final image shape, and in particular the asymmetry of the image. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>, the flux gradient changes sign for small tip-tilt in comparison with the image produced by an unobstructed pupil, implying that the model linking the differential intensity and the tip-tilt is different and more complex. In the following section, we analyse the theoretical model and adapt our QACITS tip-tilt estimator.</p></div>

As a consequence, the electric field at the Lyot plane (after the Lyot stop) will be composed of all the terms already mentioned in Eq. 7 and of the additional following terms arising from the presence of the central obstruction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E obsc Lyot = τ 2 τ(T 2 x + T 2 y ) − 1 e 2iθ r 2 − τ 4 T y + iT x e 3iθ r 3 +τ 6        T 2 x − T 2 y 4 − iT x T y        e 4iθ r 4 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Basically, these terms correspond to the decaying exponential terms that appear outside the geometrical pupil (see Appendix A.3 and in particular Eq. A.18) of radius ρ, since the components inside the obstruction are blocked by the Lyot stop. As a consequence, these terms are defined for r &gt; τ and r &lt; 1 (inner and outer diameter of the Lyot stop). The Fourier transform of a function of the general form e ikθ /r k , restrained to this domain can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">F e ikθ r k = πi k e ikψ [A k−1 (α) − A k−1 (ατ)] ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>so that the electric field on the detector due to the central obstruction can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E obsc det = π 1 − τ(T 2 x + T 2 y ) e 2iψ τ 2 ∆A 1 (α) + π(iT y − T x )e 3iψ τ 4 ∆A 2 (α) + π T 2 x −T 2 y −4iT x T y 4 e 4iψ τ 6 ∆A 3 (α),<label>(18)</label></formula><p>with ∆A k (α) = A k (α)−A k (ατ)/τ k−1 . Numerical estimations show that the ∆A 1 τ 2 component is the dominant term, the two other ones being significantly smaller in absolute values due to the factor τ 2k (because τ &lt; 1). Since it would be uselessly painful to derive the complete expression of the intensity recorded by the detector, we choose to neglect the two weaker terms in the following computation. In addition, we can approximate the factor 1 − τ(T 2 x + T 2 y ) ≈ 1, thus assuming that the tip-tilt has a negligible effect on the light diffracted by the central obstruction. As a consequence, the intensity on the detector consists of the expression given in Eq. 9 augmented by the following terms (calculated from the modulus of the first term of Eq. 18 and cross-terms between the terms of Eq. 8 and first term of Eq. 18):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">I obsc det = π 2 τ 2 τ 2 × ∆A 1 (α) 2 + (T 2 x + T 2 y ) × ∆A 1 (α)A 3 (α) + (T 2 x − T 2 y ) cos(2ψ) + 2T x T y sin(2ψ) × ∆A 1 (α)A 3 (α) + 2T x cos(ψ) + 2T y sin(ψ) × ∆A 1 (α)A 2 (α) .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Only the last term of Eq. 19 produces an asymmetric pattern with respect to the x and y axes. It has to be noted that the principal lobe of ∆A 1 (α)A 2 (α) has negative values, so that this term will be in competition with the asymmetric term arising from the circular unobstructed pupil (last term of Eq. 9). This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>, showing the horizontal profiles for each contribution. In addition, the contribution of the central obstruction is weighted by a coefficient directly proportional to the amount of tip-tilt, while the contribution of the circular pupil is lessen by the cube of the amount of tip-tilt. This explains why, for very small tiptilt, the asymmetry in the images simulated with an annular pupil appears with a gradient of opposite sign compared with images simulated for an unobstructed pupil <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Therefore, the relation between the tip-tilt and the asymmetry in the image can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">∆I x = β T 3 x + T x T 2 y + γT x , ∆I y = β T 3 y + T y T 2 x + γT y ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>with β and γ two real parameters of opposite signs. As it will be illustrated in the following section, the main issue with this model is that it will necessarily limit the range where the standard QACITS method can be applied, because the competition between the two terms leads to a possible ambiguity to retrieve the tip-tilt from a single intensity measurement. It also reduces the sensitivity, as the two contributions partially cancel each other. That is why a dual area QACITS method is proposed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">QACITS in dual areas</head><p>As illustrated in corresponds to the zero of the A 2 (α) function. Two areas can thus be defined in the image: the inner area (r &lt; 1.6 λ/D) and the outer area (r &gt; 1.6 λ/D). Note that when the outer diameter of the Lyot stop is downsized, this 1.6 λ/D boundary has to be scaled proportionally (for instance, a Lyot stop downsized by 80% has for effect to push the boundary to 2 λ/D). These areas are shown on a simulated image in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7a</ref>, highlighting the fact that the intensity gradient has opposite sign depending on the considered region. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7b</ref> shows the flux repartition between these areas for an unobstructed circular pupil and an obstructed pupil. While in the ideal unobstructed case, the flux is mostly concentrated in the central lobe (∼ 80% of the total flux), a significant portion of the flux spreads outwards in presence of a central obstruction, making this dual measurement legit.</p><p>The differential intensities corresponding to the standard QACITS, and to the QACITS split down into inner and outer areas are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> for the case of an annular pupil (24% obstruction in diameter). While the differential intensities computed in the standard way show a degeneracy and a limited amplitude, the intensities restricted to the inner and outer areas reach higher absolute values. An interesting feature appearing in these plots is the fact that for small tip-tilt (&lt; 0.2λ/D), the model can be approximated by the linear part of the model, which dominates over the cubic term. For the sake of simplicity, we will use this approximation thereafter, especially since the system of equations (Eq. 20) does not lead to simple analytical solutions.</p><p>The β and γ parameters defining the model given in Eq. 20 have been estimated thanks to simulations for different pupil configurations, and in particular different Lyot stop parameter values: the inner and outer diameter, L in and L out , defined as a fraction of the entrance pupil diameter D. The β and γ parameters correspond to the cubic and linear components respectively and are computed by fitting the simulated points in the leastsquares sense. The values are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. These results show that the γ parameter weighing the linear part of the model increases with the reduction of the outer diameter of the Lyot stop mask. This is expected since the flux due to the diffraction   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">16</ref>), while the tip-tilt energy coming from the whole pupil is spread over the whole pupil. As a consequence, cropping part of the outer rim of the pupil implies that the central obstruction contribution, which is the source of the linear dependency, becomes relatively stronger. The parameters have also been estimated for measurements restricted to the inner and outer areas. In both cases, the γ parameter reaches higher values, and thus provides a better dynamic, in comparison with the values obtained by integrating the flux in the whole image (standard method). The final estimator is therefore taken as the average of the inner and outer estimators based on the linear approximation of the model, and can thus be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">L out L in Stand. In. area Out. area (%) (%) β γ β in γ in β out γ out 100 / 1.08</formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">T est = 1 2 ∆I in γ in + ∆I out γ out ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>with T est and ∆I defined as vectors with the x and y components of the tip-tilt estimate and differential intensity measurements respectively. The exponents "in" and "out" refer to the area of the image used to integrate the flux, namely inner or outer part. This average estimator has been applied to simulated images affected by a tip-tilt ranging from 0 to 0. reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref>. The mismatch between the model and the linear approximation induces a bias in the inner and outer estimators. These biases happen to be of opposite sign, and thus compensate each other at least partially when taking the average. In practice, this offset is not critical since the QACITS algorithm is supposed to be used in closed loop control. The results show that for large tip-tilt amounts, the combined estimator under-estimates the amplitude, which means that the convergence might be slower at first.</p><p>To conclude, we have derived the theoretical model and modified the QACITS estimator to make it applicable to the case of a centrally obstructed aperture. Because the contribution of the obstruction counterbalances the contribution of the circular pupil, the validity range is reduced to small tip-tilt amounts (for tip-tilt &lt; 0.2λ/D, the bias is smaller than 3%). However, the presence of the central obstruction is responsible for a higher starlight leakage (at least 5% for a central obstruction of 24% in diameter), providing a better sensitivity, but also a better dynamic due to the linearity of the model, as opposed to the cubic model in the non obstructed case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Performance in presence of higher order aberrations</head><p>In practice, real wavefronts are affected not only by tip-tilt but also by higher order aberrations. Static aberrations due to imperfect optics surfaces can be handled by subtracting a reference image. However, quasi-static speckle patterns may corrupt the ∆I x and ∆I y measurements. Such aberrations may be caused by temperature and mechanical drifts, that slowly evolve with time, and are not sensed by the adaptive optics system. In order to quantify the effect of higher order aberrations, simulations were conducted with phase screens generated from a power spectral density defined as the inverse power law of exponent 2. This kind of model is typical for fractal finish surface quality (Church 1988), like the high quality optics of the SPHERE instrument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dohlen et al. 2011</ref>). The simulated coronagraph is based on a circular entrance pupil obstructed by 24% of its diameter and a Lyot stop with an oversized central obstruction of 35% and outer diameter of 80% of the initial entrance pupil (this corresponds to the typical obstruction and Lyot configuration of the NIRC2 instrument at the Keck telescope). Every phase screen is drawn randomly. The tip-tilt component is estimated by a projection onto the base of Zernike polynomials and subtracted. A hundred tip-tilt values ranging from 0 to 0.4 λ/D are uniformly drawn and applied to the wavefront in the horizontal direction (orientation angle θ = 0). The tip-tilt amplitude and orientation angle are then estimated from the image with the dual QACITS method. The final estimate is computed from the average of both estimators using the inner (&lt;2 λ/D) and the outer part of the image (2 λ/D&lt;α&lt;3 λ/D). As shown in the previous section, for small tip-tilt values (&lt;0.2 λ/D), the relation between the asymmetry in the image and the tip-tilt amount can be approximated by a linear function, whose proportionality factors, γ, are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, i.e. γ in = −0.11 and γ out = 0.06 in the configuration used in our simulations.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. Different aberration levels have been simulated, from δ rms = λ/10 4 to δ rms = λ/10. As expected, for large tip-tilt amounts (&gt;0.2 λ/D), the model is not valid any more and a bias appears, in the amplitude estimation in particular. The root mean square (rms) values of the tip-tilt amplitude residuals reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> have therefore been computed on the reduced range of tip-tilt &lt; 0.2λ/D. These results show that in the small tip-tilt regime and for very low aberration levels (δ rms &lt; λ/300), the bias due to the linear approximation dominates the speckle noise, and limits the accuracy of the estimation to 2.2 × 10 −3 λ/D. For higher aberration levels, the accuracy is dominated by the effect of the aberration, and the tip-tilt residual rms increases linearly with the wavefront error rms, expressed as a fraction of wavelength. This is observed for the amplitude as well as for the orientation angle (the slope of the best fit models drawn in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> in log-log scale is 1.0 for both cases).</p><p>These results illustrate the stability level we can expect from a control loop based on the QACITS technique when higher order aberrations affect the PSF shape. The tip-tilt affecting the beam can be estimated with a precision better than 10 −2 λ/D and 5 × 10 −2 λ/D in presence of wavefront errors up to δ rms = λ/70 and δ rms = λ/14 respectively (corresponding to ∼ 50 nm rms and ∼ 270 nm rms at 3.75µm). However, quasi-static speckles tend to evolve slowly with time (i.e. on minute time scales). Therefore, in practice, two consecutive images are not completely decorrelated, unlike our set of simulated phase screens, and in this case part of the high order aberration impact can be avoided by subtracting a reference image, obtained for the best centering of the coronagraphic mask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and prospects</head><p>We have described the QACITS technique for the vortex coronagraph, a method originally introduced in the case of the fourquadrant phase mask ( <ref type="bibr">Mas et al. 2012</ref>) and a circular non obstructed aperture. We have derived the analytical model for the VC and found a cubic power law, validated by simulations and experimental results. However, the presence of a central circular obstruction adds a linear component that induces an intensity gradient in the opposite direction. In order to tackle this more complex model, we have introduced the QACITS method in dual zones (distinguishing the inner lobe from the external region), which allows the disentanglement of the cubic and linear components.</p><p>Simulations of a typical telescope configuration carried out in the presence of higher order aberrations show that the QAC-ITS method provides an estimation of the tip-tilt with a precision of 10 −2 λ/D for wavefront errors amounting to λ/70 rms. For very low level of aberrations (&lt; λ/300), systematic errors arising from the linear approximation of the model limit the accuracy of the estimation to 2.2 × 10 −3 λ/D. The practical implementation may also be limited by other factors, such as the brightness of A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. Huby_2015_QACITS It can also be emphasized that the Zernike-based analysis reported in the Appendices highlights a remarkable feature of the vortex coronagraph: at first order, small aberrations expressed as Zernike polynomials simply translate into a complex linear combination of other Zernike polynomials in the Lyot plane. We are currently investigating other wavefront sensing techniques exploiting this characteristic.</p><p>To conclude, the QACITS technique offers an easy way to control the centering of the vortex phase mask directly from the scientific image, thus avoiding non-common path errors that an additional wavefront sensor fails to measure. Its simplicity of implementation makes QACITS a valuable and directly available tool for all the instruments equipped with a vortex phase mask.</p><p>Under the small aberration hypothesis, the wavefront at the entrance pupil (amplitude of 1, phase φ) can be directly approximated at first order as a combination of Zernike polynomials:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">E pup = exp(iφ) ≈ 1 + iφ = Z 1 (r) + i ∞ j=2 a j Z j (r), (A.4)</formula><p>where r = (r, θ) are the polar coordinates in the pupil plane and a j a set of real coefficients describing the aberrations. The Fourier transform of Eq A.4 leads to the field distribution in the focal plane and thus consists of a linear combination of Zernike polynomial Fourier transforms, Z j . We can thus write</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">E foc = Z 1 (α) + i ∞ j=2 a j Z j (α) (A.5)</formula><p>At the focal plane, the vortex phase mask induces a phase shift depending on the azimuthal angle ψ. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mawet et al.

The coronagraphic effect will occur for any value of l p that is even.</p><p>To ease the comparison between the field in entrance pupil (E pup ) and Lyot plane (E Lyot ), an inverse Fourier transform, noted F −1 , is finally applied, leading to</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">E Lyot = F −1 Z 1 (α)e il p ψ +i ∞ i=2 a j F −1 Z j (α)e il p ψ = ζ 1 (r) +i ∞ j=2 a j ζ j (r) (A.6) with ζ j = F −1 Z j (α)e il p ψ</formula><p>denoting the field distribution in the Lyot plane when the input pupil amplitude is defined by the Zernike polynomial Z j .</p><p>The first term ζ 1 (r) results from the perfect plane component (piston mode) that is completely diffracted outside the geometric pupil in the Lyot plane as long as the charge l p is even <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mawet et al. 2005</ref>).

(A.13)</formula><p>According to the Eq. 9 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Noll (1976)</ref>, the integral can be linked to the R m n (r) function (recalled in Eq. A.2), that we rewrite here in a more general manner (not restricted to the conditions k ≤ n and k and n with the same parity):</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">I k n = i k e ikθ                  for |k| ≤ n      1 2π (−1) k−n 2 R |k| n (r) for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 0 for r &gt; 1 for |k| &gt; n        0 for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 − 1 2πr (−1) n−k 2 R n+1 |k|−1 (1/r) for r &gt; 1 (A.14)</formula><p>One can note that this integral is discontinuous. The general form of ζ j (r) can thus be considered as two components that are nonzero exclusively inside or outside the geometrical pupil, depending on the comparison of |l p ± m| with n. We can thus write</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">ζ j = ζ in j + ζ out j , (A.15)</formula><p>where ζ in j and ζ out j represent the contributions of the field inside and outside the pupil respectively. This field distribution is visually illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. A.1</ref> for a VC of charge l p = 2 and l p = 4. Note that ζ in j or ζ out j can be zero. Indeed, if m = 0, there is only one term <ref type="bibr">(Eq. A.12)</ref>, which is defined either for r &gt; 1 or 0 ≤ r ≤ 1. In particular for the piston term (plane wavefront), there is no component inside the geometrical pupil, confirming the theoretical perfect extinction of the VC. Another interesting example is the case of the defocus and tip-tilt modes: in the case of the VC of charge l p = 4, both of them fall outside the geometrical pupil, while there is a non zero contribution inside the pupil for the VC of charge l p = 2. This result confirms that, for circular unobstructed pupils, charge 4 vortices are less sensitive to tip-tilt and defocus aberrations than charge 2 vortices, since at first order, these modes are completely rejected outside the pupil.</p><p>The final expression of ζ j (r) thus depends on the value of m and the parity of j. As a summary, we can write:</p><p>-when m = 0, it implies that n is even and hence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">ζ j (r) =        √ n + 1e il p θ R |l p | n (r) for |l p | ≤ n, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, − √ n + 1 1 r e il p θ R n+1 |l p |−1 (1/r) for |l p | &gt; n, r &gt; 1.

As a consequence, a conversion table can be established, that gives the coefficients of the Zernike polynomials defining the field after the Lyot stop (i.e. ζ in j , since the ζ out j is blocked by the aperture stop) for a given input Zernike polynomial, Z j , passing through the VC. These tables are given for the charge l p = 2 and l p = 4 vortices (Table A.1 and A.2).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jenkins (2008)</ref>, and the solid line shows the model derived in this work.

The azimuthal functions, C m (θ) = cos mθ and C m (θ) = sin mθ, are defined for even and odd j respectively, thus corresponding to real symmetric and antisymmetric modes respectively. The index j is a usual numbering system for the different modes, that will be used in the following developments. There is no equation linking the index j and the (n, m) integer pairs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1: Analytical function</head><p>The Zernike analysis that has been carried for a tilted wavefront (Eq. 7) allows the estimation of the transmission efficiency for an off-axis source close to the center. Because of the central symmetry, only one axis is needed to describe the transmission as a function of the distance from the axis, noted T in rad rms. At the first order, the total transmission is estimated from Eq. 7 by</p><p>For convenience, the tip-tilt rms in radian, T , can be converted into an amplitude S in unit of λ/D by means of the relation</p><p>This result is slightly different from the formula given by Jenkins (2008), who derived it empirically. His result is also based on a square law but the multiplicative factor is different (π 2 /6 instead of π 2 /8). Simulations have been performed in order to compare the two models. The parameters of the simulations are: a grid size of 1024 points in width, entrance pupil covering 102 pixels and a Lyot stop of the same size as the entrance pupil. Particular care has to be given to numerical errors: the main part of them can be avoided by computing the entrance pupil profile that leads to perfect attenuation of an on-axis source. This is performed by simulating the propagation of a perfect circular wavefront up to the Lyot plane, cancelling out the residuals inside the geometrical pupil (relying on the argument that this is true analytically), and finally propagating the result backwards, down to the entrance pupil ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Krist et al. 2012</ref>). The complex profile of the entrance pupil obtained in this way is used as the perfect wavefront. The results of the tip-tilt simulations are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. B.1</ref> and confirm that for small tip-tilt values, the transmission efficiency follows the function given in Eq. B.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B.2: Experimental results</head><p>The experimental data described in Sect. 3 have been processed in order to estimate the transmission efficiency as a function of tip-tilt. The flux has been integrated for each position of tip-tilt in a square of width 10 λ/D centred on the PSF, and divided by the value obtained for the AGPM translated by 7 λ/D, a distance at which the beam is barely affected by the vortex phase mask. The transmission curve is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. B.2</ref>. A polynomial function (composed only of even orders up to the 6 th , because of the obvious and expected symmetry) has been fitted to the data points. The best fit model leads to a position of the minimal transmission around −0.02 λ/D, meaning that the position that was thought to be the optimal was actually off by 3.5 µm in the focal plane. The inner-working angle, defined as the distance where the off-axis transmission reaches 50%, is estimated to be 0.9 λ/D (with D the diameter of the entrance pupil). The results were also compared to the theoretical model as derived in Eq. B.2, but the sampling was obviously not sufficient at very small tip-tilt to perform a useful comparison.</p></div>			</div>
