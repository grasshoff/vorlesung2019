			<abstract>
				<p>Several celestial bodies in co-orbital configurations exist in the solar system. However , co-orbital exoplanets have not yet been discovered. This lack may result from a degeneracy between the signal induced by co-orbital planets and other orbital configurations. Here we determine a criterion for the detectability of quasi-circular co-orbital planets and develop a demodulation method to bring out their signature from the observational data. We show that the precision required to identify a pair of co-orbital planets depends only on the libration amplitude and on the planet&apos;s mass ratio. We apply our method to synthetic radial velocity data, and show that for tadpole orbits we are able to determine the inclination of the system to the line of sight. Our method is also valid for planets detected through the transit and astrometry techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Lagrange (1772) found an equilibrium configuration for the three-body problem where the bodies are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. For relatively small eccentricities, the libration around the stable Lagrangian equilibrium points L 4 and L 5 is one of the two possible configurations of a stable co-orbital system, called a tadpole orbit (by analogy with the restricted three-body problem, we define L 4 as the equilibrium point when the less massive planet is 60 • ahead of the more massive one and L 5 when it is behind). The first object of this kind was observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wolf (1906)</ref>, the asteroid Achilles, which shares its orbit with Jupiter around L 4 . At present, more than 6000 bodies in tadpole orbits are known in the solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(MPC 2014</ref>). For objects in the second configuration, called a horseshoe orbit after the shape the trajectories of the bodies in the corotating frame, the libration encompasses the equilibrium points L 4 , L 5 , and L 3 . A single example is known, for a pair of satellites of Saturn (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dermott &amp; Murray 1981b</ref>).</p><p>The Lagrangian equilibria points are stable if the masses of the planets are low enough. In the quasi-circular case, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gascheau (1843)</ref> showed that there is a stability condition for the Lagrangian equilibrium </p><p>where m 0 is the mass of the star, and m 1 and m 2 the mass of the co-orbital planets. The mass repartition between the two co-orbitals has a small impact on the stability. Within this limit, Gascheau's criterion guarantees the stability of the linearized equations in the vicinity of L 4 or L 5 . The lower the masses of the co-orbitals with respect to the total mass, the larger is the possible libration amplitude. The horseshoe domain is stable when the planets have a Saturn-mass or less <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Laughlin &amp; Chambers 2002)</ref>. For eccentric orbits, the range of stable mass ratios between the co-orbital and the central body decreases as the eccentricity increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roberts 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nauenberg 2002)</ref>. Moreover, an additional co-orbital configuration exists in the eccentric case, called quasi-satellite, as the co-orbitals seem to gravitate around each other in the rotating frame. For high eccentricities, co-orbitals have a much larger stable domain for quasi-satellites than for tadpole or horseshoe configurations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giuppone et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Since the discovery of the first exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wolszczan &amp; Frail 1992)</ref>, a great diversity of systems has been found, some of them in mean motion resonances (MMR). A few of these resonant systems are highly populated (like the 2/1 MMR), but so far no system has been identified in a co-orbital configuration (1/1 MMR). However, many theoretical works suggest that co-orbital exoplanets may also exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref> introduced two possible processes that form these systems: (i) planet-planet gravitational scattering and (ii) accretion in situ at the L4-L5 points of a primary.</p><p>The assumptions made on the gas disc density profile in scenario (i) can either lead to systems with a high diversity of mass ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cresswell &amp; Nelson 2008</ref>) or to equal mass co-orbitals when a density jump is present ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Giuppone et al. 2012</ref>). In their model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cresswell &amp; Nelson (2008)</ref> form co-orbitals in over 30% of the runs. Initially in horseshoe configurations, the co-orbital systems are generally damped into tadpole configurations. The co-orbitals formed by this process usually have very low inclinations and eccentricities (e &lt; 0.02). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lyra et al. (2009)</ref> showed that in scenario (ii), up to 5-20 Earth-mass planets may form in the tadpole of a Jupiter-mass primary. For existing co-orbitals, the gas accretion seems to increase the mass difference between co-orbitals, the more massive of the two reaching Jovian mass while the starving one stays below 70M ⊕ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cresswell &amp; Nelson 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Models that produce co-orbital planets due to dissipation within a disc may also experience significant inward migration. Such migration increases the libration amplitude of trojan planets for late migrating stages with low gas friction. This may lead to instability, but the damping of the disc usually forces the libration to remain small. Equal mass co-orbitals (from super-Earths to Saturns) are heavily disturbed during large scale orbital migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pierens &amp; Raymond 2014</ref>). In some cases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rodríguez et al. (2013)</ref> have shown as well that long-lasting tidal evolution may perturb equal mass close-in systems. Overall, significantly different mass trojans may thus be more common, especially in close-in configurations.</p><p>Co-orbital planets can also be disturbed in the presence of additional planetary companions, in particular by a significantly massive planet in another MMR with the co-orbitals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Morbidelli et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Robutel &amp; Bodossian 2009)</ref>. Moreover, horseshoe orbits are more easily disturbed than tadpole orbits owing to the higher variation of frequencies in the system with respect to the libration amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Detecting co-orbital planets is not an easy task because the signatures of each body are usually superimposed. The transit method can solve this degeneracy, either by observing both co-orbitals transiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Janson 2013)</ref>, or when only one co-orbital is transiting by coupling with another detection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ford &amp; Gaudi 2006</ref>). When the libration amplitude is large enough, the transit timing variation (TTV) method can also find co-orbital candidates even when only one body is transiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Janson 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vokrouhlick´yVokrouhlick´y &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2014)</ref>.</p><p>If the bodies are exactly at the Lagrangian equilibrium point (with no libration), the radial velocity (RV) signal is the same as for a single planet, overestimating the mass of the system by ≈ 13% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dobrovolskis 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref> showed that the libration of co-orbitals modulates the RV signal from the star, allowing them to determine a co-orbital system from a simulated RV signal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cresswell &amp; Nelson (2009)</ref> estimated that for the co-orbitals obtained in their simulation, this modulation is 10% − 20% of the total amplitude of the signal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Giuppone et al. (2012)</ref> showed that a short-term RV signal (duration inferior to the period of libration) did not allow co-orbitals to be distinguished from an eccentric planet or from two planets in 2/1 MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski &amp; Konacki 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anglada-Escudé et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Theoretical and numerical studies seem to agree that tadpole and horseshoe coorbitals tend to have low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. In addition, in the solar system we observe among the moons of Saturn <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dermott &amp; Murray 1981b</ref>, and references therein) three co-orbital systems, all with inclinations &lt; 1 • and eccentricities &lt; 0.01. Jupiter's trojans have a mean inclination of about ≈ 12 • and eccentricities bellow 0.3. We thus conclude that quasi-circular orbits are a good approximation for many co-orbital systems. As the study of quasi-circular and coplanar orbits is easier than the full case, in this paper we restrict our analysis to this simpler situation. We first give a brief overview of the co-orbital dynamics and an analytical approximation of the co-orbital motion valid for small eccentricities. In section 3 we derive an analytical method that can be used to extract the signature of co-orbitals from the motion of the host star. In section 4 we exemplify our method with the radial velocity technique using synthetic data, and we conclude in the last section.</p><p>2 Co-orbital dynamics <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Reference angles represented for the circular co-orbital system with respect to an inertial frame (x, y). m 0 is the mass of the central star, m 1 and m 2 the masses of the co-orbitals. r i is the distance of the co-orbital i to the central star, and λ i its true longitude.

Finally, the variable ζ = λ 1 − λ 2 satisfies the second-order differential equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">¨ ζ = −3µn 2 1 − (2 − 2 cos ζ) −3/2 sin ζ ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which is one of the most common representations of the co-orbital motion (see Morais 1999, and references therein). For small eccentricities, it describes the relative motion of the two bodies and is valid as long as the co-orbital bodies are not too close to the collision (ζ = 0). Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> is invariant under the symmetry ζ −→ 2π−ζ, so the study of its phase portrait can be reduced to the domain (ζ, ˙ ζ) ∈ [0, π]×R (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>) (this symmetry will be developed later on). The equilibrium point located at (ζ, ˙ ζ) = (π/3, 0) corresponds to one of the two Lagrangian equilateral configurations 1 , which are linearly stable for sufficiently small planetary masses (see below). Another equilibrium point, whose coordinates are (π, 0), corresponds to the unstable Eulerian collinear configuration of the type L 3 . The separatrices emanating from this last unstable point split the phase space in three different regions: two corresponding to the tadpole trajectories surrounding one of the two Lagrangian equilibria (in red in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>), and another one corresponding to the horseshoe orbits that surround the three above-mentioned fixed points (in blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, any trajectory given by a solution of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> can be entirely determined by the initial conditions (t 0 , ζ 0 ) such that ζ(t 0 ) = ζ 0 and ˙ ζ(t 0 ) = 0, where ζ 0 is the minimum value of ζ along the trajectory, and t 0 the first positive instant for which the value ζ 0 is reached. The possible values of ζ 0 , represented by the purple horizontal line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, are included in the interval ]0 • , 60 • ]; ζ 0 = 60 • corresponds to the equilateral configuration where m 1 is the leading body and m 2 is the trailing one 2 . The tadpole orbits are associated with ζ 0 ∈]ζ s , 60 • [, ζ s ≈ 23.9 • being associated with the separatrix, while ζ 0 ranges from ζ s to 0 for horseshoe orbits. As a result, the shape of the trajectory of the relative motion (as the libration amplitude of the resonant angle ζ) is entirely determined by the quantity ζ 0 .</p><p>In contrast, t 0 and n √ µ are necessary to know the exact position on the trajectory, and in particular, the amplitude of the variations of the semi-major axes.

The associated frequency, denoted by ν (respectively˜νrespectively˜ respectively˜ν), depends on the considered trajectory. However, the time-normalized frequency associated with equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˜ ν = ν/(n √ µ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>depends only on ζ 0 (˜ ν is plotted versus ζ 0 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). In tadpole configurations, this dimensionless frequency remains almost constant in the vicinity of the Lagrangian equilibrium ν ≈ ν 0 (Eq. 7) and tends to 0 as the separatrix is reached at ζ 0 = ζ s . In horseshoe configurations, ν can take any value. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, one can see that far from the separatrix, ˜ ν is always of order unity. This imposes that the variations of the difference of the longitudes, ζ, are slow with respect to the orbital time scale, i.e. ν n. It turns out that ˙ ζ(t)/n 1 and as a consequence, the quantities a j can be approximated by a (Eq. 3). Thus, in the circular planar case, at order 0 in ν, the position of m 1 and m 2 in the heliocentric system r = (x + iy) are given by r 1 = ae iδζ e i(nt+λ0) , and r 2 = ae −i(1−δ)ζ e i(nt+λ0) .</p><p>Within the same approximation, we can also write the derivative of previous equation, which gives us the heliocentric velocity of the co-orbitals</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">˙ r 1 = inae iδζ e i(nt+λ0) , and ˙ r 2 = inae −i(1−δ)ζ e i(nt+λ0) .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>While searching for co-orbital bodies, the stability of each configuration also needs to be taken into account. In order to determine the influence of the planetary masses on the global stability of planar co-orbital systems, we show the results of two numerical simulations indicating the width of the stable co-orbital region in different directions. In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, we consider two planets orbiting around a star of mass m 0 = 1 M , with fixed initial elements a 1 = a 2 = 1 au, e 1 = e 2 = 0.05, and λ 1 = 1 = 0, and we vary the initial element λ 2 = 2 = −ζ 0 in [0 • , 60 • ] and their masses m 1 = m 2 = µm 0 /2, with µ/2 ∈ [10 −8 , 10 −1 ]. For each set of initial conditions, the system is integrated over 5 Myr using the symplectic integrator SABA4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Laskar &amp; Robutel 2001</ref>) with a time-step of 0.0101 year.</p><p>Strongly chaotic systems or systems that quit the co-orbital resonance before the integration stops are removed from the computation.

The stability criteria of Gascheau (1843), corresponding to ν/n = 1/ √ 2, has been indicated. We also show the vicinity of two of the main resonances between ν and n : the 1/2 resonance (see Roberts 2000) and the 1/3. The colour code indicates the value of the libration frequency, i.e. log 10 (ν/n).</p><p>dots are assigned to their initial parameters (ζ 0 , µ). This strong short-term instability is mainly due to the overlapping of low-order secondary resonances <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Páez &amp; Efthymiopoulos 2015)</ref>. After the elimination of these initial conditions, long-term diffusion along secondary resonances may also destabilize the co-orbital systems on a much longer time scale. Measuring the temporal variation of the libration frequency identifies this diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Laskar 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Laskar , 1999</ref>). The black dots indicate a relative variation of over 10 −6 between the first and second half of the 5 million years integration (to compare with ≈ 10 −10 for the long-term stable configurations). They are mainly located in the vicinity of the separatrix and near the ejection boundary. In the remaining regions, the small variation of the frequency ν guarantees, in most cases, the stability for a billion years <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Robutel &amp; Gabern 2006</ref>). For long-term stable systems, a colour depending on its libration frequency ν is assigned to regular resonant co-orbital systems (see the colour code at the bottom of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). We observe that for large planetary masses, slightly lower than the limit value µ ≈ 0.037 (Gascheau 1843), the stability region is extremely small and strongly perturbed by low-order secondary resonances. The chaos generated by the main secondary resonances, namely the ν = n/2,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">log 10 (µ)</formula><p>Δa/a  The dots follow a curve ∆a ∝ µ 1/3 , delimiting the stability region of the horseshoe domain. The colour code indicates the value of the libration frequency, i.e. log 10 (ν/n) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> for the scale). ν = n/3, and ν = n/4 , shrink the stability region significantly, reducing it to a small region near the equilateral configuration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Roberts 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nauenberg 2002)</ref>. As µ decreases, the width of the stable tadpole region increases, and the destabilizing influence of the secondary resonances becomes dominant only on the boundary of the stability region (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Páez &amp; Efthymiopoulos 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robutel &amp; Gabern 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">´ Erdi et al. 2007</ref>, for the restricted problem). When µ ≈ 3 × 10 −4 ≈ 2M Saturn /M , the whole tadpole domain becomes stable, except for a small region around the separatrix (ζ 0 = ζ s ≈ 23.9 • ). On the other side of the separatrix, for ζ 0 &lt; ζ s , stable horseshoe orbits start to appear (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laughlin &amp; Chambers 2002</ref>). For lower planetary masses, the size of the horseshoe orbital domain increases as µ decreases, to reach the outer boundary of the Hill sphere at a distance to the separatrix of the order of µ 1/3 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> we show another section of the co-orbital region. Instead of varying the angle ζ 0 , we change the initial value of the difference of the semi-major axes from the equilateral equilibrium L 4 towards the outside of the co-orbital region (vertical purple line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). More precisely, the initial conditions of the planetary systems are e 1 = e 2 = 0.05, λ 1 = 1 = 0, λ 2 = 2 = π/3, and a j = 1 − (−1) j ∆a with ∆a ∈ [0 : 0.06]. As they do in <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>, the planetary masses vary as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">m 1 = m 2 = µm 0 /2, with µ/2 ∈ [10 −8 , 10 −1 ].</formula><p>The tadpole domaine lies above the solid black line corresponding to the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">&amp; Pousse 2013)</ref>. In this case, contrarily to the ζ 0 direction where the width of the stable tadpole region is a monotonous function of µ, the extent of the stability region reaches a maximum for ∆a/a ≈ 0.052 at µ = 3.5×10 −3 and then tends to zero with µ as indicated by the above-mentioned curve. For lower values of µ, the size of this region decreases until µ reaches the value for which horseshoe orbits begins to be stable. After these critical masses, the two domains shrink together but at a different rate. The asymptotical estimates of the tadpole's width in this direction is of the order of µ 1/2 (black solid line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>), while an estimation for the horseshoe region is of the order of µ 1/3 (black dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>, corresponding to the equation ∆a = 0.47µ 1/3 ) has been fitted to the lower bound of the stable horseshoe region (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013</ref>, for more details). As a consequence, the stability domain of the horseshoe configurations becomes larger than the tadpole domain when the planetary masses tend to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dermott &amp; Murray 1981a</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∆a = 2 √ 2/ √ 3 √ µ (Robutel</formula><p>3 One planet or two co-orbitals?</p><p>In some particular situations, co-orbital planets can be identified independently from the orbital libration: when both planets are transiting (Janson 2013) or when we combine data from transits with radial velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ford &amp; Gaudi 2006</ref>).

However, the libration period is always longer than the orbital period of the bodies (see the colour code in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). The faster ζ librates, the higher the chances of detecting the co-orbital bodies, because this reduces the time span needed to detect the libration. We write P ν the period associated to the libration frequency ν. The value of P ν decreases when µ and n increase (see equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Therefore, high mass ratios and the proximity to the star maximize the detectability of co-orbitals, although high mass ratios also lead to the instability of most of the co-orbital configurations ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Signals induced by co-orbital planets</head><p>Most important observational techniques used to detect exoplanets (transits, radialvelocity, astrometry) are indirect, i.e. we do not directly observe the planets, but rather their effect on the host star. In order to get an idea of the effect of the libration of co-orbital planets on the star, we take two examples of co-orbital configurations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>) with the following initial conditions: λ 1 = 0 • , a 1 = a 2 = 1 AU , e 1 = e 2 = 0, m 1 = 0.8 10 −4 M (red), and m 2 = 1.2 10 −4 M (blue). In the left graph, ζ 0 = 25 • , leading to a large amplitude tadpole orbit, and in the right graph, ζ 0 = 23 • , leading to a horseshoe orbit. The position of the barycentre of the system composed of the two planets is represented in purple. With µ = 2 × 10 −4 and ζ 0 near the separatrix, these two examples are at the limit of the stability domain, but give a clear idea of what we can expect.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> we show the projection of the stellar orbit on the x−axis for these two configurations. We observe that the signal induced by the Keplerian motion of the  co-orbitals is indeed modulated over a period of libration of the resonant angle ζ. This phenomenon was described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref> in the case of a radial velocity signal. It is due to the oscillation, with a frequency ν, of the distance between the barycentre of the two planets and the star, clearly visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. The larger the amplitude of variation of ζ, the larger the amplitude of modulation. For a given ζ 0 value, the maximum oscillation amplitude is achieved when δ = 1/2, that is, for m 1 = m 2 . In the horseshoe configuration, δ = 1/2 leads the barycentre of m 1 and m 2 to pass by the position of m 0 , periodically cancelling the signal. The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows the spectrum of those signals. The features of the spectrum of a modulated signal appear clearly: one peak located at the high frequency n and harmonics located on both sides n + pν, where p is an integer and ν is the frequency of the modulation. In general, the peaks located in n and n ± ν are the ones with the largest amplitude. However, there is an exception when the signal is at the limit of the over-modulation, that is, when the peak located in n disappears. This can happen only in the horseshoe configuration when m 1 ≈ m 2 . In this case, the main components of the spectrum would be two peaks separated by 2ν and the system would then be easier to identify. In this paper we focus on the possibility of detecting the main three peaks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Demodulation</head><p>We assume that the Keplerian part of the signal is well determined (S 0 and ¯ S terms in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref>), otherwise it would be impossible to look for something else. However, the modulating signal (S 1 and S −1 ) can be hidden in the noise. In order to isolate the effect of the modulation, we suggest using a frequency mixing method similar to the one used in the demodulation of radio signals. This method is called "superheterodyne" and was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Armstrong (1914)</ref>. It consists in multiplying the modulated signal by a signal that has the same frequency as the carrier. As a result, we obtain a peak at the modulating signal's period in the spectrum.

However, ¯ φ is a priori unknown, so we propose computing the˜sthe˜ the˜s k for two values of φ dephased by π/2, for example φ = φ 0 and φ = φ 0 + π/2. By proceeding in this way, in the worst case we get ¯ φ − φ = π/4, corresponding to a minimum amplitude of S 1 / √ 2. Moreover, by taking the ratio of the fitted amplitudes with the two φ values, we can additionally estimate ¯ φ, and thus φ ±1 = ¯ φ ∆φ. The initial determination of n using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> always has an error n , which leads to the splitting of the libration term in ν into two terms in ν ± n . Since these two frequencies are very close to each other, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) usually shows a widened peak around ν, preventing an optimal determination of ν, S 1 , and ∆φ. Therefore, once we have some estimations for these parameters, in the last step of the demodulation process, we return to the original data set s k , and directly fit it with the full equation S(t) (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>), using the previously determined ¯ S, S 0 , S 1 , S −1 = S 1 , n, ν, φ 0 , φ 1 , and φ −1 as initial values for the fit.</p></div>

One can see from equation (58) that Ψ = π in the horseshoe configuration, while Ψ ∈ [−2, 2] in the tadpole configuration <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9)</ref>. Since the domains for Ψ are exclusive in the different configurations, by computing Ψ we can immediately distinguish between a horseshoe and a tadpole configuration.</p><p>When the detected signal is at the limit of the instrumental precision, the phases can be improperly determined. In this case, one can always compute A m using expression (28). As shown in Appendix A.2, A m ranges within [0, +∞[ in the horseshoe configuration. In the tadpole configuration, A m reaches its maximum value for δ = 1/2 and ζ 0 near the separatrix. We can see in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> that this quantity remains below 1/3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Horseshoe orbits</head><p>Our horseshoe system is composed of a Neptune-mass and a 3 Earth-mass planet at 0.1 au. It is at the limit of detection, since the individual RV amplitudes of each planet are K = 4.85 m/s and K = 0.85 m/s, respectively. With this example we intend to show the limitations of our method. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> (a), we show a generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the RV data. As for the tadpole example in the previous section <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 12)</ref>, the Keplerian component  of the signal can clearly be identified for a period P n ≈ 11 days. We thus fit the raw data with a Keplerian function (Eq. 18) obtaining an initial estimation for P n ≈ 11.55 days, ¯ S ≈ 6.5 km/s, S 0 ≈ 4.9 m/s, and φ 0 ≈ 23 • , subtract its contribution to the data, and obtain a modified data set s k (Eq. 20). However, unlike the tadpole case, in the new periodogram of the residual data, there is no clear peak above the noise <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 13 b)</ref>. Therefore, such a system can easily be mistaken with a system hosting a single planet at 11 days.</p><p>We can nevertheless apply our method to search for the traces of a co-orbital companion.

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 13 (c) and 13 (d)</ref> we show the periodograms corresponding to these transformations, respectively. For φ = φ 0 the periodogram is very similar to the one with the residual data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 13 b)</ref>, so we conclude there is nothing else above the noise in the data. However, for φ = φ 0 +π/2 the scenario is completely different as a significant peak appears around 1500 days, corresponding to the libration frequency <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 13 d)</ref>. Indeed, for horseshoe orbits we have Ψ = π (Eq. 58), which means that ¯ φ = φ 0 + π/2 (Eq. 41).

Comparing these results to the tadpole case, we observe that the uncertainty associated with the S p and φ p terms is larger, but still near 1 m/s, which corresponds to the considered precision of the instrument. Our method is therefore able to extract any information on the existence of a co-orbital companion, provided that the information on the libration terms is accessible in the data.</p><p>Once the existence of a co-orbital companion is confirmed, we can determine the corresponding orbital parameters. The parameter ζ 0 (which gives the departure of the semi-major axis and the mean longitudes from their mean value) has a low impact on the orbital parameters and cannot be easily determined in horseshoe configuration (see section 4.2.3). However, its value is constrained by the stability of the system: in the horseshoe configuration, it ranges between its lowest stable value for µ min = µ sin I, in our case ≈ 6 × 10 −5 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>), and the separatrix. We therefore have ζ 0 ∈ [13 <ref type="bibr">• , 24 • ]</ref>. We take ζ 0 = 18.5 • (average value on this interval) and compute the corresponding orbital parameters. We obtain a system close to the original one (Tab. 3).</p><p>In the horseshoe case, we cannot determine either the eccentricities and the longitudes of the pericentre, because we used a Keplerian circular orbit approximation (Eq. 18), or the inclination to the line of sight, because we only fit the first three harmonics <ref type="bibr">(Eq. 27)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have revisited the dynamics of quasi-circular co-orbital planets. By computing their gravitational effect on the parent star, we have found a simple method for detecting this kind of planets, provided that the orbital libration can be seen in the observational data. Indeed, when the star is accompanied by co-orbital planets, in addition to the Keplerian orbital motion, there is a modulation at a longer period, corresponding to the libration frequency. Therefore, commonly used methods for signal demodulation (see section 3.3) can also be applied to co-orbital systems, allowing the amplitude and the frequency of the modulation to be identified more accurately.</p><p>Every time a modulation is observed in the motion of a single planet, an inquiry should be made to check if it can correspond to the libration induced by another co-orbital planet. In this paper, we explain a way to quantify which co-orbital configurations can be expected: for stability reasons, we can put boundaries for pairs of the parameters (µ, ζ 0 ); for data span duration reasons, we can estimate the frequency of libration ν, depending on (n, µ, ζ 0 ); for measurement precision reasons, we can estimate the amplitude of the modulating peaks, which depends on the parameters (µ, n, δ, ζ 0 ). For reasons of clarity, we exemplify our method in the case of a radial velocity signal. However, our results are valid for any other method that measures a projection of the stellar motion. We have shown that the relative amplitude of the modulation signal depends only on the distance to the Lagrangian equilibrium, ζ 0 , and mass ratio, δ. Therefore, the detection of co-orbital planets is enhanced for large libration amplitudes around the Lagrangian equilibrium (i.e. small ζ 0 values), and for planetary masses equally distributed between the two co-orbitals (δ ≈ 1/2).</p><p>In order to reduce the data, we proposed a direct inversion from the periodograms of the signal to the osculating elements of the system. For systems in the tadpole configuration we are able to determine the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky and hence the true masses of the planets (and not only the minimum masses). In the horseshoe case this is not possible without considering higher harmonics for the modulation. acknowledgements: We acknowledge support from CIDMA strategic project UID/MAT/04106/2013.
