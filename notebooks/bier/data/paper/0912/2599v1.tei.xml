			<abstract>
				<p>We present precision radial velocity (RV) data that reveal a multiple exo-planet system orbiting the bright nearby G5V star 61 Virginis. Our 4.6 years of combined Keck/HIRES and Anglo-Australian Telescope precision RVs indicate the hitherto unknown presence of at least three planets orbiting this well-studied star. These planets are all on low-eccentricity orbits with periods of 4.2, 38.0, and 124.0 days, and projected masses (M sin i) of 5.1, 18.2, and 24.0 M ⊕ , respectively. Test integrations of systems consistent with the RV data suggest that the configuration is dynamically stable. Depending on the effectiveness of tidal dis-sipation within the inner planet, the inner two planets may have evolved into an eccentricity fixed-point configuration in which the apsidal lines of all three planets corotate. This conjecture can be tested with additional observations. We present a 16-year time series of photometric observations of 61 Virginis, which comprise 1194 individual measurements, and indicate that it has excellent photometric stability. No significant photometric variations at the periods of the proposed planets have been detected. This new system is the first known example of a G-type Sun-like star hosting a Super-Earth mass planet. It joins HD 75732 (55 Cnc), HD 69830, GJ 581, HD 40307, and GJ 876 as a growing group of exoplanet systems that have multiple planets orbiting with periods less than an Earth-year. The ubiquity of such systems portends that space-based transit-search missions such as KEPLER and COROT will find many multi-transiting systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over 400 extrasolar planets are now known. The majority have been discovered by using precision radial velocities (RVs) to detect the reflex barycentric motion of the host star. We have had a large sample of over 1000 nearby stars under precision RV survey for the past 13 years at Keck and for the past 11 years by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Of particular interest are the nearest brightest stars, as they allow one to achieve the highest precision on stars worthy of follow-up with space-based missions such as Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Spitzer, and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Of equal importance to stellar apparent brightness in RV precision is observing cadence. Keplerian signatures are mostly strictly periodic, and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the detection can be enhanced in the presence of a random noise background through increased cadence. However, obtaining adequate cadence on large telescopes like the Keck and the AAT is quite difficult, as observing time is limited for any group.</p><p>Our groups have been combining observations from both the Keck and AAT on select stars in the declination overlap region. One of the target stars is 61 Virginis (61 Vir), a very nearby G5V star, only 8.5 parsecs away. This star was put on the Keck program in 2004 December and added to the AAPS target list about four months later. Over the past five years, we have accumulated a total of 206 precision RVs that indicate a system of at least three planets orbiting this star. In this paper, we present all of these RV data and discuss the planetary system that they imply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Basic properties of the host star 61 Vir</head><p>61 Vir (=HD 115617, HR 5019, HIP 64924) is a very bright (V =4.74) and very well-studied star. It has a spectral type of G5V and lies at a distance of only 8.52±0.05 pc <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Perryman et al. 1997)</ref>. This star has been characterized by a number of studies, with properties of interest to planetary system characterization listed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sousa et al. (2008)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> summarizes recent determinations of the fundamental stellar parameters for 61 Vir. Taken together, the properties of 61 Vir indicate that it is an old, inactive star ideally suited for precision RV planet searches. Using Ca H+K measurements taken between 1994 and 2006, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hall et al. (2007)</ref> found that 61 Vir is one of 13 targets for which the observed variability is zero within the uncertainties. In 29 observations over 7 seasons, they measure a mean log R ′ HK of −4.93. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Henry et al. (1996)</ref> also measured activity in this star, and they found log R ′ HK = −4.96, which is consistent with Hall et al. above. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wittenmyer et al. (2006</ref>) derived a mean log R ′ HK = −5.03 from five years (N = 18) of observations at McDonald Observatory. Our measurement of log R ′ HK = −4.95 leads to an estimate (Wright 2005) of 1.5 m s −1 for the expected RV jitter due to stellar surface activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baliunas et al. (1996)</ref> measured a rotation period of P = 29 days for 61 Vir. The age of 61 Vir was estimated as 6.3 +3.3 −3.1 Gyr by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> and 8.96 +2.76 −3.08 Gyr by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Takeda et al. (2007)</ref>. In summary, 61 Vir is a nearby, bright, solar-type star with physical properties quite similar to our own Sun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observations</head><p>The HIRES spectrometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vogt et al. 1994</ref>) of the Keck I telescope and the UCLES spectrometer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Diego et al. 1990)</ref>  Doppler shifts were measured ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Butler et al. 1996</ref>) by placing an Iodine absorption cell just ahead of the spectrometer slit in the converging beam from the telescope. This gaseous Iodine absorption cell superimposes a rich forest of Iodine lines on the stellar spectrum, providing a wavelength calibration and proxy for the point spread function (PSF) of the spectrometer. The Iodine cell is sealed and temperature-controlled to 50 ± 0.1 • C (at Keck) and 60 ± 0.1 • C (at the AAT) so that the column density of Iodine remains constant. For the Keck planet search program, we operate the HIRES spectrometer at a spectral resolving power R ≈ 70, 000 and wavelength range of 3700-8000Å8000Å, though only the region 5000-6200Å6200Å (with Iodine lines) is used in the present Doppler analysis. For the AAT program, we typically achieve a spectral resolving power of R ≈ 50, 000. Doppler shifts from the spectra are determined with the spectral synthesis technique described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">O'Toole et al. (2008)</ref>. The Iodine region is divided into ∼700 chunks of 2 ˚ A each. Each chunk produces an independent measure of the wavelength, PSF, and Doppler shift. The final measured velocity is the weighted mean of the velocities of the individual chunks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> lists the complete set of 206 RVs for 61 Vir, corrected to the solar system barycenter. The table lists the JD of observation center, RV, and internal uncertainty. No offset has been applied between the AAT and Keck in this table. The internal uncertainty reflects only one term in the overall error budget and results from a host of systematic errors from characterizing and determining the PSF, detector imperfections, optical aberrations, effects of under-sampling the Iodine lines, etc. Two additional major sources of error are photon statistics and stellar jitter. The latter varies widely from star to star, and can be mitigated to some degree by selecting magnetically inactive older stars and by time-averaging over the star's unresolved dominant asteroseismological p-mode oscillations.</p><p>Since the single exposures required to reach a required S/N for bright stars like 61 Vir are much shorter than the characteristic time scale of low-degree surface p-modes, short exposures (ie., &lt;5 minutes) will add an additional noise (or "jitter") component. This latter effect was recognized as a potential noise source by the AAPS some time ago, and so, since 2005 July, AAPS observations of bright targets like 61 Vir have been extended to the 10 -15 minutes periods required to average over these p-mode oscillations (O' <ref type="bibr">Toole et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Toole et al. , 2009</ref>. For most of the past four years, only single exposures of ∼7 s at Keck were taken of 61 Vir at each epoch, though in 2008 July we began p-mode averaging by combining multiple shots of 61 Vir over a 5 -10 minutes dwell at each epoch. All observations are then further binned on two-hour timescales after being precision Doppler processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Photometry</head><p>In addition to our RV observations from Keck I and AAPS, we have acquired high-precision photometric observations of 61 Vir during 17 consecutive observing seasons from 1993 April to 2009 April with the T4 0.75 m automatic photometric telescope (APT) at Fairborn Observatory. Our APTs can detect short-term, low-amplitude brightness variability in solar-type stars due to rotational modulation of the visibility of surface magnetic activity (spots and plages), as well as longer term variations associated with the growth and decay of individual active regions and the occurence of stellar magnetic cycles (Henry 1999). The photometric observations help to establish whether observed RV variations are caused by stellar activity or planetary reflex motion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henry et al. 2000a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Queloz et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paulson et al. (2004)</ref> have presented several examples of periodic RV variations in solar-type stars caused by photospheric spots and plages. The photometric observations are also useful to search for transits of the planetary companions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Henry et al. 2000b</ref>).</p><p>The T4 APT is equipped with a precision photometer based on an electromagnetic interference (EMI) 9924B bi-alkali photomultiplier tube that measures photon count rates successively through Strömgren b and y filters. The APT measures the difference in brightness between a program star and nearby constant comparison stars. Our automatic telescopes, photometers, observing procedures, and data reduction techniques are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Henry (1999)</ref>. Further details on the development and operation of the automated telescopes can be found in Henry (1995a,b) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Eaton et al. (2003)</ref>. nightly extinction coefficients and transformed to the Strömgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients. Since 61 Vir lies at a declination of −18 • , the photometric observations from Fairborn were made at air mass 1.6 -1.8. Therefore, to maximize the precision of the measurements, we combined the Strömgren b and y differential magnitudes into a single (b + y)/2 passband. We also computed the differential magnitudes of 61 Vir with respect to the mean brightness of the two comparison stars. Because we are interested only in variability timescales of days to weeks, we have normalized the final differential magnitudes so that the mean brightness of each observing season is equal to zero. This effectively removes any long-term brightness variability in the two comparison stars as well as in 61 Vir. (However, the standard deviation of the seasonal mean differential magnitudes was only 0.00033 mag before normalization.)</p><p>A total of 1194 normalized differential magnitudes from 17 observing seasons are plotted in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>. The data scatter about their mean with a standard deviation σ = 0.00196 mag, which provides an upper limit to possible brightness variation in 61 Vir. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the photometric measurements is shown in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> and reveals no significant periodicities within the data. We computed least-squares sine fits for the three RV planet candidates described below; the semi-amplitudes of the lightcurve fits were 0.00016 ± 0.00007, 0.00011 ± 0.00008, and 0.00014 ± 0.00007 mag for the three periods 4.215, 38.012, and 123.98 days, respectively.</p><p>We conclude that the photometric constancy of 61 Vir supports planetary reflex motion as the cause of the RV variations described in the next section.</p></div>

Power at each sampled period is proportional to the relative improvement in the fit quality for a circular model versus a constant velocity model -that is, the relative drop in χ 2 ν . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> (bottom panel) shows the spectral window or power spectrum due to the sampling times <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deeming 1975)</ref>.

Based on the periodogram, we then fit a planet of mass    Given the three-planet model, we can look either for solutions in which the planetary orbits are circular or solutions where the eccentricities are allowed to float. Inclusion of eccentricities provides only a modest improvement to the orbital fit, and we conclude that a significant amount of additional Doppler velocity monitoring will be required to improve measurement of the eccentricities. For a detailed discussion of how additional measurements can reduce uncertainties in orbital elements, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ford (2005)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Tables 3 and 4</ref>, we present our best-fit versions of the system under the assumption of circular orbits <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref> and with the additional degrees of freedom provided by fully Keplerian trajectories <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>). For the orbital fits, we assume i = 90 • and Ω = 0 • .</p><p>We have verified that the inclusion of planet-planet gravitational interactions in the fit are unnecessary. Most of our modeling involves simply adding Keplerians. However, for cases where we expect significant gravitational interactions between companions, we carry out a more detailed modeling that involves using Hermite fourth order approximations to the planets' trajectories, accurately characterizing such gravitational interactions. If the Hermite fourth order calculations do not differ significantly from simple summed Keplerians, as is the case here, we conclude that planet-planet interactions are not necessary.   To summarize up to this point, we have shown that the combined Keck and AAT RV data show strong evidence for a three-planet system in orbit about the G5V star 61 Vir. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 6</ref> shows the barycentric RV of the star computed with the eccentric three-planet model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 7</ref> shows the barycentric RV of the star computed with the eccentric model due to each individual companion in the system. In each panel, the velocities are folded at the period of each corresponding planet. Points marked as open symbols denote observations that are suspect due to poor observing conditions that led to low S/N in the spectra. All such points were previously noted in the observing logs before any analysis occurred. Regardless of such suspicions, all observations were used in all the analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Dynamical Analysis</head><p>For any multiple-planet system, long-term orbital stability is a matter of both interest and concern. Even precisely characterized, seemingly stable configurations such as the Solar System are subject to chaotic planet-planet interactions that can lead to orbit-crossing, collisions, and ejections on time scales shorter than the stellar lifetime (for recent treatments see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Laskar (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batygin &amp; Laughlin (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Laskar &amp; Gastineau (2009)</ref>). Given the uncertainties that adhere to the orbital elements, the effort of generating a dynamical characterization of a system such as 61 Vir b-c-d, is somewhat akin to producing detailed maps of sand dunes. Nonetheless, it is useful to verify, via numerical integration, whether the planetary configurations listed in <ref type="table">Tables 3 and 4</ref>  If we assume the three orbits are initially circular, with periods, masses, and mean anomalies given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we find that the system is stable for at least 365 Myr.</p><p>Additionally, assuming the system to be coplanar, if we set the inclination to the sky plane to various values from i = 90 • all the way down to i = 1 • and perform a Newtonian fit for  Open symbols represent observations that may be suspect due to low S/N based on observing log notes. the other 11 parameters (three parameters per planet plus the two velocity offsets), χ 2 ν does not change significantly from the nominal i = 90 • fit. We also find the i = 1 • fit to result in a system that is stable for at least 50 Myr. For this inclination, the fitted masses exceed 1.0, 3.3, and 4.5 M Jup . This system is stable because of the small eccentricities. Thus, under the assumption that the system is coplanar and the orbits are (nearly) circular, we cannot place a lower bound on the inclination of the system.</p><p>The parameters of the floating-eccentricity version of the 61 Vir system given in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> were also used as the initial input conditions for a 10 7 yr simulation. The three-planet configuration remained stable for the full duration of this simulation. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the evolution of the planets' semi-major axes and eccentricities over the first 250,000 years of the simulation. The planets interact with each other on secular timescales, and the inner planet experiences a large excursion in eccentricity (up to e ∼0.5) but is never disrupted.</p><p>With its period of 4.215 days, the innermost planet in the system is likely subject to significant tidal dissipation in its interior. Tidal damping, in fact, may have played an important role in the evolutionary history of this multi-planet system. An investigation of this process requires a dynamical theory that couples dissipative orbital evolution with planet-planet gravitational perturbations among the individual system members. While the coupling between dissipative and secular processes can be complex, there exists an avenue toward insight regarding the overall dynamical state of the system. In particular, it may be possible that the dissipative properties of the innermost planet can be inferred.</p><p>The key idea is that, under the influence of tidal dissipation, multiple-planet systems approach stationary configurations. These so-called tidal fixed points are discussed in the context of extrasolar planets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wu &amp; Goldreich (2002)</ref> and more generally by Mardling  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> as starting conditions. Bottom panel: eccentricities vs. time for the same simulation.</p><p>For both panels, planet b is in red, c is in blue, and d is in green. eccentricities of such systems are well determined and are not subject to significant time variations.</p><p>Participation by the system in a fixed-point configuration hinges on the tidal quality factor, Q, of planet b. Assuming that the system did not form in a stationary configuration, and that the dissipation of planetary orbital energy has been dominated during the past by tides raised on the innermost planet, it can be shown that it takes ∼ 3 circularization timescales, τ , given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yoder &amp; Peale (1981)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">τ = 2 21n Q k m M ⋆ a R 5 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k is the planetary Love number and R is the inner planet's radius, for the system to become stationary <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mardling 2007)</ref>. Therefore, assuming R = 2.45R ⊕ and k = 0.34, we expect that it would take ∼ 700, 000 × Q years for the system to arrive at the fixed point.</p><p>We have confirmed this, by performing a numerical integration, using the tidal friction formalism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eggleton et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mardling &amp; Lin (2002)</ref>, and the eccentric fit listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> as initial conditions. Indeed, libration of planet b around the fixed point begins after ∼ 850, 000 × Q years, in rough agreement with theory. It is further interesting to note that the best-fit eccentricities for planets c and d are in fact already very close to the fixed-point values, and their perihelia are already set in a librating mode at the beginning of the integration.</p><p>Thus, given the star's multi-billion year age, we can make the following claim: if planet b has a Neptune-like Q (∼ 30, 000), then the system is probably not stationary. However, if the planet has a characteristic terrestrial Q (∼ 100), then we can expect the system to be at a fixed point. If the system is at a fixed point, and the eccentricities are modest, we can use modified Laplace-Lagrange secular theory to relate the planets' eccentricities to each-other. The three-planet fixed point equations presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batygin et al. (2009)</ref>, yield the relationships: e c ≈ 5.11e b , and e d ≈ 7.27e b . Thus, by a precise determination of fixed-point eccentricities, we can not only determine the dynamical state of the system, but also begin to characterize the nature of planet b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>We have detected three low-mass planets orbiting the nearby star 61 Vir. With a RV Neptune or super-Earth class objects on orbits that would be ascribed to the inner zone of the terrestrial region were they in our own solar system.</p><p>Given the observed multiplicity, negligible jitter, and extraordinary photometric stability associated with the 61 Vir planetary system, it is natural to speculate on the existence and detectability of additional planets. As 61 Vir is a naked-eye visible solar-type star observable from both hemispheres, it has been the target of many planet-search efforts in the past 25 years. One of the first precision RV searches for planets, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Walker et al. (1995)</ref>, observed 61 Vir for approximately 12 years. They present a figure indicating rough upper limits of 1 -2 Jupiter masses in the period range between one and ten years. 3 AU and 1.69 M Jup at 5.2 AU. From these studies, and the lack of any significant trends in the RV data, it would appear that there are no planets in the 61 Vir system with masses substantially greater than that of Jupiter. Undetected sub-Jovian mass planets may be present in orbits with periods longer than the extant high-precision velocity data.</p><p>A further interesting clue to the nature of the 61 Vir system was recently provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tanner et al. (2009)</ref>, who detected an infrared excess at 160µ using Spitzer observations.</p><p>The excess 160µ flux implies the presence of a dust disk that is continuously replenished by collisions within a cold Kuiper-Belt-like disk of planetesimals surrounding the star. ). This is of course a selection effect, since late-type stars have lower masses and hence a planet of a given mass would produce a larger RV signal. 61 Vir, therefore, is a unique new system in that not only does it host multiple low-mass planets, but also it is the first G-type Sun-like star found through the RV technique to host a planet with M sin i &lt; 10M ⊕ .</p><p>The detection of the three low-K planets reported here around this previously well-studied, bright, nearby star was made possible by the combined cadence and high precision of the AAPS and Keck surveys. As cadence and time bases grow in the RV monitoring of chromospherically quiet, nearby stars, complex planetary systems, like 55 Cnc, and now 61 Vir, are becoming increasingly common. This is only our first reconnaissance of this fascinating and quite nearby system. As more RV data are collected, the orbital ephemerides of the planets will become better determined, and more planets will probably be revealed. Freeman, S. Lee, J. Pogson, S. James, J. Stevenson, K.

Bryden et al. 2009, in preparation). Assuming that the emitting grains are black bodies, the disk spans an annulus from R inner = 96±5 AU to R outer = 195±10 AU, with the dust temperature at 55-45 K (inner to outer). An improved model of the disk, however, can be achieved by assuming the emission arises from silicate grains with size 0.25µ. In this case, the disk spans R inner = 120±20 AU to R outer = 220±10 AU with a dust temperature of 24-19 K. An excess at 70µ was also detected with Spitzer by Trilling et al. (2008). The 61 Vir system is consistent with the population of planets postulated by Mayor et al. (2009a), who inferred that fully one-third of solar-type stars in the immediate galactic neighborhood are accompanied by Neptune-(or lower) mass planets having orbital periods of 50 days or less. This putative population was largely unexpected, and has spurred a good deal of recent theoretical work geared to explain its existence. We note that the habitable zone of 61 Vir is located in the vicinity of a 300-day orbit. At this separation from the parent star, a 2 M ⊕ planet induces a RV semi-amplitude K = 0.2 m s −1 . Assuming a combined stellar jitter and median internal uncertainty of 1.5 m s −1 , this is a factor of about 30 greater than the 0.05 m s −1 precision required to make a 4σ measurement of a such a small signal. If precision scales as the square root of the total number of Doppler measurements, a total of 30 2 or 900 velocities (an additional 700 more) would allow for the detection of such a planet with a S/N of 4. With a period of only 4.215 days (a = 0.05 AU), 61 Vir b may transit its star. The a priori transit probability is ∼ 9% (assuming R ⋆ = 1 R ⊙ ). Due to the low mass of 61 Vir b, a successful transit observation would allow a detailed physical probe of a fundamentally new class of planet. Currently, the lowest mass transiting planet is CoRoT-7b, with a radius of 1.68 ± 0.09 R ⊕ (Leger et al. 2009). CoRoT-7b orbits a G9V star and has a transit depth of only ∆F/F = 3.4 × 10 −4 . Its mass is estimated by Queloz et al. (2009) to be 4.8 ± 0.8M ⊕ . By comparison, if 61 Vir b is transiting, sin i ∼ 1, and hence it would have a mass of 5.10 M ⊕ . Assuming that the planet migrated inward from beyond the ice line of 61 Vir's protoplanetary disk, it is likely made mostly of water. The models of Fortney et al. (2007) indicate a 2.45 R ⊕ radius for such a planet, leading to a central transit depth of ∼ 0.54 millimagnitudes. Such a transit could be detected from space using, for example, the Warm Spitzer platform. Of the currently known planets discovered by the RV technique with M sin i &lt; 10M ⊕ (10 planets; 6 host stars), half orbit M dwarf stars. Those are GJ 581c,d,e (Mayor et al. 2009b), GJ 876d (Rivera et al. 2005), and GJ 176b (Forveille et al. 2009). The rest of those planets orbit K stars: HD 7924b (Howard et al. 2009), HD 181433b (Bouchy et al. 2009), and HD 40307b,c,d (Mayor et al. 2009a</figDesc></figure>
