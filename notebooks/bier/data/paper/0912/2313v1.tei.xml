				<p>Asynchronous rotation and orbital eccentricity lead to time-dependent irradiation of the close-in gas giant exoplanets-the hot Jupiters. This time-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate throughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this &quot;thermal tide&quot; to produce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal force. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces, here we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with small cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the perturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to thermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat the forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the &quot;equilibrium tide&quot; limit of zero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole moment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the equilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which torques the planet away from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve the boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a planet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope. The numerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic non-resonant result at sufficiently long forcing period. Surprisingly, in the range of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be far larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves which propagate in the radiative envelope. We discuss the relevance of our results for the spin, eccentricity and thermal evolution of hot Jupiters.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many of the gas giant exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars -the hot Jupiters -are observed to have radii far larger than the radius of Jupiter, R J , implying high temperatures deep in the planetary interior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Burrows et al. 2000)</ref>. A powerful internal heat source must be present in order to prevent their rapid contraction. Tidal heating is a possible solution. However, the gravitational tide synchronization and circularization timescales are much shorter than the age of the system if the tidal quality factor is comparable to that of Jupiter. Tidal heating could then power the observed radii only for a brief period, far shorter than the age of observed systems.</p><p>We propose that time-dependent thermal forcing of hot Jupiters leads to a "thermal tide" torque pushing the planet away from synchronous rotation, and possibly circular orbits. The equilibrium spin state is set by the competition between the opposing thermal and gravitational tide torques. Gravitational tide dissipation continues to operate in this torque equilibrium, implying a steady state heat source to power the large radii. The thermal tide torque mechanism was initially proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gold and Soter (1969,</ref> GS from here on) in order to explain Venus' slow, retrograde spin. Here, we generalize their analysis for fluid planets in which the central solid core is either non-existent or dynamically unimportant.</p><p>The existence of dynamically important thermal tide torques in fluid planets has recently been cast in doubt <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Goodman 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gu &amp; Ogilvie 2009)</ref>. These authors argue that at forcing frequencies smaller than the planet's dynamical frequency, the quadrupole moment will be negligible due to isostatic adjustment. Furthermore, the former author asserts that the torque will push the planet toward synchronous rotation, rather than away. A careful study of the fluid motion induced by surface thermal forcing in fluid gas giant planets is needed to address the following questions: What is the direction and depth dependence of the resulting flow? What is the relevance of the concept of "isostatic adjustment" to this inherently time-dependent problem? What sets the "dynamical frequency below which the quadrupole moments become small? What is the sense of the torque (synchronous versus asynchronous)? What is the magnitude of the torque? Once these questions have been answered, the ability of thermal tide torques to promote asynchronous rotation and tidally inflated radii can then be assessed.</p><p>Here, we study the fluid flow and resulting quadrupole moments induced by thermal forcing at the surface of a gas giant planet. To isolate what we believe to be the relevant physical mechanisms, we ignore thermal diffusion, the Coriolis force and self-gravity of the perturbations, while utilizing a simplified model for the planetary structure.</p><p>The plan of this paper is as follows. In §2 we provide motivation for performing the ensuing calculations. We then describe the problem set-up and details of the background model for the fluid planet in §3. §4 reviews the relation between density perturbation and quadrupole moment, and the torque on the planet and orbit in terms of the quadrupole moment. The linearized fluid equations are presented in §5. In §5.1 and 5.2 we develop analytic solutions in the zero and small, but finite, frequency limit. Numerical results to the linearized boundary value problem are presented in §5.3. In §6, the numerical results are explained in terms of the response of envelope gravity waves that are excited thermal forcing. We summarize in §8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MOTIVATION</head><p>We begin with a brief discussion of the possible role of thermal tides for the rotation rates and radii of hot Jupiters.</p><p>Thermal forcing may induce a "bulge" which is misaligned with star-planet line (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>). The misalignment is a result of thermal inertia, the tendency of maximum temperature to lag maximum heating. Since insolation is finite on the day side and zero on the night side, thermal forcing is spread over a range of harmonics. In particular, the semi-diurnal (m = 2) component of the thermal forcing may induce a quadrupole moment in the fluid, which can then couple to stellar gravitational field. Therefore, this "thermal tidal torque" can, in principle, push the planet away from a synchronous spin state. The equilibrium spin rate is then set by a balance of the thermal tide torque, promoting asynchronous spin, and the gravitational tide torque, which acts to push the spin back toward the synchronous state. The two bulges are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>.</p><p>In the asynchronous spin state set by torque equilibrium, the gravitational tide generates heat in a steady state manner. If the dissipation occurs sufficiently deep within the convective core of the planet, a thermal equilibrium will be established between (gravitational) tide heating of the core and heat loss at the radiativeconvective boundary. To explain the large observed radii, the equilibrium core entropy must be much larger than that of a passively cooling planet at the same age.</p><p>The thermal tide torque is expected to deposit angular momentum mainly in the surface radiative layer. Were there no sink of angular momentum, the total angular momentum of the planet would increase indefinitely. If we again assume that gravitational tide dissipation occurs deep in the convective core, then angular momentum must be transported between the thermal tide source region and the gravitational tide sink region. Presumably this angular momentum transport would be accomplished through (turbulent) viscous forces between neighboring fluid layers.</p><p>We estimate the importance of thermal tides in hot Jupiters by comparing the quadrupole moment induced by the thermal tide to that from dissipation acting on the gravitational tide. For the purposes of a fiducial estimate, we use the thermal tide quadrupole formula relevant for Venus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gold &amp; Soter (1969)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q (th) ∼ ∆M R 2 p σt th .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here ∆M is the mass down to the photospheric layer for the starlight, R p is the planet's radius, σ is the tidal forcing frequency and the thermal time of the absorbing layer is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t th ∼ ∆M c p T R 2 p F * ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c p is the specific heat at constant pressure, T is the temperature, and F ⋆ is the stellar flux. The frequency dependence in eq.1 reflects that the temperature and density perturbations in the atmosphere become small when the forcing period is short. The accuracy with which eq.1 represents a fluid atmosphere is the subject of the remainder of the paper. The quadrupole moment induced by the stellar gravitational tide which leads to secular evolution is given by (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q (grav) ∼ h t R p σ n M p R 2 p Q p (3)</formula><p>where the height of the tidal bulge is h t ∼ R p (M ⋆ /M p )(R p /a) 3 , the orbital frequency is n ≃ (GM ⋆ /a 3 ) 1/2 , the semi-major axis is a, the stellar mass is M ⋆ , and the tidal quality factor of the planet is Q p . Here σ ∝ n − Ω is proportional to the departure of the rotation rate Ω from synchronous rotation, Ω = n. As a fiducial value, the tidal quality factor of Jupiter is constrained to be Q p ∼ 10 5 − 10 6 <ref type="bibr">(Goldreich &amp; Soter 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoder &amp; Peale 1981)</ref>.</p><p>The ratio between the thermal tide and gravitational tide quadrupole is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Q (th) Q (grav) ∼ n σ 2 ∆M M p M p M ⋆ a 3 R 3 p Q p nt th ≃ n σ 2 ∆M 10 −8 M p M p 10 −3 M ⋆ × a 10 2 R p 3 Q p 10 5 1 nt th .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The fiducial estimate in eq.4 shows that thermal and gravitational tidal effects are competitive for hot Jupiters, with large departures from synchronous spin σ ∼ n expected.

If this tidal heating is deposited sufficiently deep in the core, it may then prevent these planets from contracting, explaining the inflated radii of some hot Jupiters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROBLEM SET UP</head><p>In this section we expand the thermal and gravitational forcing terms in terms of a Fourier expansion, define the co-ordinate system used, and discuss the background planetary structure model.</p><p>3.1. description of time-dependent thermal and gravitational forcing We seek solutions to the boundary value problem describing linear response of a gaseous planet to a gravitational tidal acceleration −∇U (x, t) and an imposed entropy perturbation, ∆s <ref type="bibr">(x, t)</ref>, that results from timedependent insolation.</p><p>Consider a planet of mass M p and radius R p in a circular orbit of separation a around a solar-type star of mass M ⋆ = M ⊙ , radius R ⋆ = R ⊙ and effective temperature T ⋆ = 5800 K.

We note that while the longitude-dependent stellar irradiation is zero on the night side and nonzero on the day side, the individual Fourier components are nonzero on both day and night sides. By adding together many Fourier components one recovers the true positiondependent flux. Lagrangian and Eulerian variations are denoted by ∆ and δ, respectively. The Lagrangian entropy perturbation, ∆s, is a convenient variable to use as it varies solely due to non-adiabatic processes, here the time-dependent heating due to insolation. By contrast, the Eulerian entropy perturbations can vary due to motion parallel to a background entropy gradient, and the temperature can vary due to pressure perturbations. Unfortunately, the governing equations are not separable when the Coriolis force is included. Due to this complication, for simplicity, we neglect the Coriolis force. By doing so, the response for each individual spherical harmonic can studied separately. We will suppress the subscripts (ℓ, m) where no confusion will arise.</p><p>Scalar quantities are represented as f (x, t) = f (r)Y ℓm (θ, φ)e −iσt , and the Lagrangian displacement vector, ξ(x, t) is expanded in the poloidal harmonics</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ξ(x, t) = [ξ r (r) e r + ξ h (r)r∇] Y ℓm (θ, φ)e −iσt .

Background Model Hot Jupiters possess a convective core, blanketed by a thin radiative envelope at the surface(e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006</ref>). Rather than construct a model with a detailed equation of state and radiative transfer, we use a simple parametrized equation of state which enforces neutral stratification in the core and stable stratification with roughly constant scale height in the envelope. The equation of hydrostatic balance is integrated using</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ρ(p) = e −p/p b p a 2 + 1 − e −p/p b p K c .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The constants p b , K c and a = (p b K c ) 1/4 are the pressure at the base of the radiative envelope, parameter setting the entropy of the core and the isothermal sound speed of the envelope, respectively.

The propagation diagram for a model with p b = 100 bar is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref>. The mass and radius are M p = 0.7M J and R p = 1.27R J . The mass of the radiative envelope is roughly p b /p(r = 0) = 10 −5 of the planet's total mass.

First we develop equations that can be solved as a boundary value problem. We then show that planet's response can be represented as a sum of eigenmodes. The governing equations below are standard and can be found in, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Unno et al.

(37), since the terms with N 2 go to zero while the ∆s term is nonzero. It follows that the concept of an equilibrium tide breaks down in regions that are neutrally stratified and therefore, the forcing frequency cannot be safely set to zero. That is, the fluid response in neutrally stratified regions is inherently a "non-equilibrium tide." Finally, substitution of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">(35)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(36)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_40">(38)</ref> into eq.

Clearly, the equilibrium tide density perturbation in eq. (36), and thus the equilibrium tide quadrupole moment, has no contribution from time-dependent surface heating. Inspection of eq. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> show that the terms ∝ ∆s cancel out one another. The last term in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(29)</ref> represents a density decrease due to heating, which is precisely compensated by the N 2 ξ r /g term that results from moving across surfaces of constant pressure. In other words, denser fluid is brought up from below, exactly canceling the local density decrease due to heating.</p><p>Time-dependent insolation heats the surface and initiates horizontal motion. Consider subsynchronous rotation (n−Ω &gt; 0) so that an observer at rest with respect to the planet sees the star rotate with angle Φ(t) = (n − Ω)t in the positive φ direction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>). For m = 2, the heating function δǫ ∝ cos[2(φ − Φ)], and maxima in the heating function occur at φ − Φ = 0, π.

It varies mainly as as p exp(−κ ⋆ p/g), which has a sharp maximum near the base of the heating layer at p = g/κ ⋆ . Above the base, this derivative is negative and ξ φ (φ) ∝ cos[2(φ − Φ)] describes motion away from regions of high entropy, and toward regions of low entropy. Were there no return flow, mass would accumulate at φ − Φ = π/4, −3π/4, leading the star. For mass "bumps" leading the star, the quadrupole moment would act to decrease the planet's spin, pushing it further from synchronous spin. However, there is a return flow, since below the base the direction of ξ φ reverses (see sign of df /dr in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>). As a result, there is no mass accumulation, the density perturbation is identically zero, and there is no net quadrupole. What is required to drive asychronous spin is a net flow, integrated over depth, away from the the hottest points in the atmosphere.</p></div>

To solve these equations, we finite difference in radius with second order accuracy, and write the resulting inhomogeneous equation in matrix form as M x = B, where M , x and B denote the differential operators, solution vector (δp, δρ and ξ r as a function of radius), and forcing vector (involving U and ∆s). We find the solution of this linear system using a band-diagonal solver. The quadrupole moment is then evaluated using eq.

The peaks are due to resonances with normal modes of oscillations, with g-modes at long period and f-p modes at short period. The base of the heating layer is at pressure g/κ⋆ = 1 bar, and the base of the radiative zone is at p b = 100 bar. The solid red lines imply a torque pushing the planet away from synchronous spin, and visa versa for the short-dashed blue lines.</p><p>zone at p b = 100 bar. The absolute value of the imaginary part is plotted. The sign is shown by the line type, solid red line for Im(Q 22 (σ)) &lt; 0, and dashed blue for Im(Q 22 (σ)) &gt; 0. The positive forcing frequencies used imply sub-synchronous rotation. Torque has the same sign as Im(Q 22 ), so that Im(Q 22 ) &lt; 0 drives the planet further from the synchronous state, and vice versa. It is immediately apparent that the response to thermal forcing is dominated by the low order g-modes at periods 2π/σ ≃ 1 − 30 days. This is in contrast to the gravitational tide, which has the largest response for the f-mode at 2π/σ ≃ 0.1 days. Consequently, the equilibrium tide limit does not apply until the frequency is well below the periods of low order g-modes. In other words, the low frequency limit of §5.2 is not a good approximation until periods 2π/σ &gt; 30 days for the model shown, rather than 2π/σ ∼ 0.1 days, as one would suspect for the gravitational tide.</p><p>For comparison, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref> shows the GS approximation in eq.46 and the finite frequency correction to the equilibrium tide given by eq. (45). The amplitude at the resonances is set by the frequency spacing used to make the plot; for finer frequency spacing the peaks would be larger. The solution asymptotes to eq. (45) for forcing periods much longer than the low order g-modes. In the range 1-30 days, the quadrupole moment is much larger than the value given by eq. (45), even midway between resonances. The torque alternates sign across some resonances, but not others. For short forcing periods ∼ 0.1−1 day, the torque acts to synchronize the spin, reinforcing the dissipative gravitational tide torque. However, in between the two lowest order g-modes, at periods ≃ 1 − 2 days, the thermal tide torque is large and acts to torque the planet away from a synchronous spin state.</p><p>The sharp peaks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref> are due to resonant response. In the absence of damping, the energy of a standing wave diverges (in linear theory) as the resonance is approached. This is due to the fact that waves can reflect back and forth in the resonant cavity, continually being pumped by the forcing. A second limit one can imagine is that waves with sufficiently short wavelengths at the top of the atmosphere (above the photosphere) propagate upward, carrying away their energy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the results for the same parameters as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>, the only modification being the upper boundary condition. Again, there is no forcing by the gravitational tide (U = 0). The outgoing wave boundary condition has eliminated the sharp resonances for high order g-modes.</p><p>The exact numerical response agrees well with the analytic formula in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(45)</ref> beyond a forcing period of 1 month. For the important period range 1 day-1 month, the quadrupole moment is again 1-3 orders of magnitude larger than expected from the analytic formula, due to the response of low order g-modes -even for the leaky upper boundary. As we show in the next section, this enhanced response is due to the good overlap of gravity waves with the thermal forcing.</p></div>

In this section we comment on how our results might be changed, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by relaxing these assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">the Coriolis force</head><p>Consider the effect of uniform rotation, with spin frequency Ω. When σ Ω, the Coriolis force becomes important for the fluid response and we anticipate several additional effects due its presence. First, the gravity wave dispersion relation and fluid motions are altered. For σ ∼ Ω, we expect the change in the quadrupole to be at the factor of a few level in the "bump" between 1-30 days. Second, new wave families arise, mainly restored by the Coriolis force -the Rossby waves, or inertial waves. These waves can propagate throughout both the radiative envelope and the convective core. We expect that, for sufficiently rapid supersynchronous rotation, Rossby resonances may give rise to a larger quadrupole moment. In the perturbation theory calculation of §5.2, we expect larger quadrupole moment when the spin is nearly synchronous, since the Coriolis terms ∝ σΩ will be larger than the inertia terms ∝ σ 2 . In figures 4 and 5 this will lead to the "analytic" line becoming flat, instead of decreasing to longer forcing period.</p><p>For sufficiently large quadrupole moment, the equilibrium spin will be asychronous enough that σ Ω, and we expect our results to be approximately quantitatively correct. Substitution of the quadrupole moment in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure  5</ref> into eq. 4, for Q p = 10 6 we find σ ∼ n in the period range of ∼ a few days, implying the spin frequency, orbital frequency and forcing frequency are all comparable in torque equilibrium. In this event, the Coriolis force is important, but will only change the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the gravity waves at the order unity level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">thermal diffusion</head><p>The heating function in eq.11 describes the law of exponential attenuation of stellar radiation. By setting this to occur at a pressure ∼ 1 bar, we are assuming there are no absorbers high in the atmosphere. Until recently, this assumption was standard, but there may now be evidence of an inversion layer due to such absorbers in a fraction of observed hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fortney et al. 2008)</ref>. In that case, incorporating thermal forcing by the boundary condition used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gu &amp; Ogilvie (2009)</ref> may be more appropriate. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The entropy perturbation in eq.10 assumes that the forcing period is much shorter than the thermal time in the heated layer, so that radiation diffusion may be ignored. In fact, thermal diffusion and damping of downward propagating waves is expected, as in the solutions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gu &amp; Ogilvie (2009)</ref>. Furthermore, a shorter diffusion time may partially "erase" temperature perturbations, reducing the buoyancy force upon which gravity waves rely. This may cause wave damping or reflection near the optical or infrared photospheres. By choosing the "perfect reflector" and "leaky" upper boundary conditions in section 5.3 we attempted to simulate two extreme limits of the effects of radiative diffusion. While thermal diffusion may decrease the amplitude of gravity waves near the photosphere, deeper in the envelope the thermal time becomes sufficiently long so that damping can be ignored.</p><p>For forcing period of order a few days, the thermal time at the base of the heating layer is of order the forcing period. Therefore, the approximation that the layer possesses a large thermal inertia is only approximately valid. Another effect we have ignored is that nonlinear effects become important when the forcing period is longer than the thermal time.</p><p>7.3. fluid flow in the background state We now comment on the possible role of fluid motion such as zonal flows in the background state. Fluid motion in the background state does not preclude the existence of the gravity (or inertial) wave response as described in this paper. Ignoring shearing of the velocity field, such a flow would simulate uniform rotation, so that the Coriolis force becomes important. However, when there is velocity shear in the background state, we expect the wave motions to be significantly modified when the shear rate is comparable to the wave frequency. Since inertial wave response relies on angular momentum gradients, we expect these waves to persist in the presence of velocity shear. Most atmospheric circulation simulations for the hot Jupiters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Lin 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Showman et al. 2009</ref>) assume synchronous rotation, and find powerful advective flows. Relatively few simulations with asychronous rotation have been performed, but the recently results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Showman et al. (2009)</ref> are useful in this context. They found that when the degree of asynchronous spin was increased, the flow velocities were decreased. It remains to be seen what winds are induced for rotation rates appropriate for the torque equilibrium described in section 2. All current studies of atmospheric circulation in hot Jupiters ignore the thermal tide torques. From the analysis presented in this work, it seems likely that the qualitative and quantitative outcome of these simulations will change once thermal tidal torques are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">SUMMARY</head><p>We considered the ability of a planet, subjected to time-dependent stellar irradiation, to develop net quadrupole moments. The existence of such quadrupole moments allows the stellar tidal field to exert torques on the planet, possibly creating asynchronous spin. Such asynchronous spin could lead to large tidal heating rates, through the dissipative gravitational tide, perhaps sufficient to power the large observed radii.</p><p>In §5.1 and 5.2, the fluid equations are solved treating inertia as a small parameter. At zeroth order in the forcing frequency, a circulation pattern is found from hot to cold at small depths p g/κ ⋆ , and a return flow from cold to hot at larger depth p g/κ ⋆ . There is no density perturbation associated with this flow and therefore, zero quadrupole moment. The inclusion of finite inertia as a small perturbation gives rise to a finite density perturbation and therefore, quadrupole moment. In the assumed limit of small fluid inertia, the phase of the quadrupole is found to have the correct sign to induce asynchronous rotation in the planet, similar to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gold &amp; Soter (1969)</ref>. However, the magnitude of this quadrupole is reduced by a factor ∼ 4(σ/N ) 2 . A propagating wave-like response of any form is eliminated in this "near-equilibrium tide" approximation. The value of the resulting quadrupole moment is insensitive to boundary conditions and depends solely on the local forcing in the atmosphere. Numerical calculations presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure  4</ref> and 5 confirm that the quadrupole moment approaches this analytic limit at long forcing periods.</p><p>In §5.3, the fluid equations are solved as a boundary value problem. Two different upper boundary conditions are used, which effectively treat the radiative envelope as a perfect resonant cavity, or as a cavity with an open upper lid, allowing waves to be radiated upward. Using both boundary conditions, which may bracket the true result including radiative transfer effects, it is found that the quadrupole moments in the period range 1 day -1 month are far larger than the non-resonant nearequilibrium tide calculation in eq. 45 by 1-3 orders of magnitude. The reason for this enhanced response is discussed in §6. Unlike the gravitational tidal forcing, time-dependent thermal forcing and low order envelope g-modes couple well due a favorable spatial overlap.</p><p>In section 2, we argued that the magnitude of the thermal tide torques using the formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gold &amp; Soter (1969)</ref> is sufficient to generate large deviations from synchronous rotation as well as large tidal heating rates, easily sufficient to power the observed planet radii. Our numerical results in §5.3 show that the full numerical solutions for the torque can indeed have the correct sign to generate asynchronous spin for some ranges of forcing (rotation) frequency. The magnitude of the torques is smaller than the <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gold &amp; Soter (1969)</ref> result by a factor of a few, but still large enough to be interesting. We expect that the inclusion of the Coriolis force will increase the torque at long forcing periods, since the Coriolis force is larger than fluid inertia in that limit.</p><p>In future investigations, we plan on including the effects of the Coriolis force and thermal diffusion in the calculation of the quadrupole moments. We expect that both physical effects could lead to qualitative and quantitative changes to the non-resonant and resonant thermal tidal response. The resulting torques will then be used to solve for the equilibrium values of the planet's spin, radius and eccentricity.</p><p>We thank Peter Goldreich for helpful discussions. Also, we thank Jeremy Goodman, Gordan Ogilvie and PinGao Gu for raising the issue of isostatic adjustment as well as Yanqin Wu for discussions of the upper boundary condition. We also thank the referee for comments that improved the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACCURATE EVALUATION OF THE QUADRUPOLE MOMENT: INTEGRATION BY PARTS</head><p>As discussed in section 5.2, direct integration of r ℓ δρ to find the quadrupole moment is subject to large cancellation errors. This behavior is somewhat surprising, and does not occur for the gravitational tide quadrupole moment. The origin of the problem is that δρ is proportional to the second derivative of a certain quantity, resulting in large cancellations during the integration. We noticed this cancellation error during numerical resolution studies in which the results did not converge rapidly with increasing resolution.</p><p>Here, we show that this cancellation error can be ameliorated through successive integration by parts, and use of the equations of motion. By using the exact equations of motion, this method does not introduce approximations. Integration by parts leads to an integrand that is much more monatonic, leading to better convergence.</p><p>The quadrupole moment is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">Q = R 0 drr 2+ℓ δρ.<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>By substituting for δρ from eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">Q = R 0 drr 2+ℓ ρ g σ 2 ξ r − 1 ρ dδp dr − dU dr .<label>(A2)</label></formula><p>Integrating the pressure gradient term by parts, discarding the (small) boundary terms, and solving eq.28 for δp, we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">Q = R 0 drr 2+ℓ ρ g σ 2 ξ r − dU dr + σ 2 ℓ(ℓ + 1) R 0 dr d dr r 2+ℓ g r 2 δρ + d dr r 2 ρξ r − ℓ(ℓ + 1) σ 2 ρU .</formula><p>Integrating the d/dr(r 2 ρξ r ) term by parts and simplifying gives the final result</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">Q = R 0 drr 2+ℓ δρ (eq) + σ 2 R 0 dr ρξ r r 2+ℓ g − r 2 ℓ(ℓ + 1) d 2 dr 2 r 2+ℓ g + r 2 ℓ(ℓ + 1) d dr r 2+ℓ g δρ .<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>The first term in eq. (A3) is just the equilibrium σ 2 = 0 quadrupole from gravitational forcing alone -see eq. (36). Although the δρ term in eq. (A3) may be subject to cancellation error, this term should be smaller by a factor σ 2 r/g compared to the other terms after integration. Since the equilibrium tide component of ξ r is monatonic, the terms involving ξ r do not suffer cancellation error. We find numerically that integrand is far more monotonic than r 2+ℓ δρ, and is less subject to cancellation error. Throughout, we use eq. (A3) when numerically evaluating the quadrupole moment that results from thermal forcing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Geometry of the semi-diurnal (m = 2) thermal and gravitational tidal density perturbations.
