				<p>Using Georgia State University&apos;s CHARA Array interferometer, we measured angular diameters for 25 giant stars, six of which host exoplanets. The combination of these measurements and Hipparcos parallaxes produce physical linear radii for the sample. Except for two outliers, our values match angular diameters and physical radii estimated using photometric methods to within the associated errors with the advantage that our uncertainties are significantly lower. We also calculated the effective temperatures for the stars using the newly-measured diameters. Our values do not match those derived from spectroscopic observations as well, perhaps due to the inherent properties of the methods used or because of a missing source of extinction in the stellar models that would affect the spectroscopic temperatures. † Some of the observations described here was completed while with</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Giant star radii have been measured in the past using various interferometers, including the Mark III (85 giants and supergiants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mozurkewich et al. 2003</ref>), the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (69 giants and supergiants, van <ref type="bibr">Belle et al. 1999</ref>), the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (50 giants and supergiants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nordgren et al. 1999</ref>), and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array (4 Hyades giants, <ref type="bibr">Boyajian et al. 2009</ref>). These measurements are valuable because these are the stars populating the coolest, most luminous part of the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram <ref type="bibr">(van Belle et al. 1999</ref>). What makes the sample of giant stars under consideration here particularly interesting is that they are potential exoplanet hosts, and planetary candidates have been discovered around six of the stars already.</p><p>Two important characteristics of a star are its mass and radius. For giant stars, the determination of these parameters is indirect and heavily model dependent. In practice, spectroscopic observations to measure the surface gravities (log g), effective temperatures (T eff ), and iron abundances ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>) can be combined with a distance measurement to derive the stellar radius. Fitting evolutionary tracks to the position of the star in the H-R diagram then yields the mass. The reliability of these measurements depend both on the validity of the model atmospheres and the stellar evolution code. Unfortunately this is an uncertain process because the evolutionary tracks of stars with a wide range of masses all converge to near the same region of the H-R diagram as they evolve up the giant branch. In particular the mass estimates derived from evolutionary tracks depend critically on several parameters hidden in the tracks, such as the mixing length parameter and its assumed constancy for all stars, the unknown helium content in the core, and uncertainties about the nature of the convection zone. As a result, using different tracks can produce different masses, and in the absence of good calibrating objects no set of tracks can be claimed to provide the best results. On the other hand, if one can test and calibrate these evolutionary tracks by comparing the theoretically-determined mass and radius to observed values, then one can have some faith in applying these tracks to stars for which direct measurements of these stellar parameters is not possible.</p><p>A star's mass is not only important for its evolution, but it should play an important role in the type of planetary system a star will form. There are a number of Doppler surveys searching for planets around evolved giant stars with stellar masses of 1 to 2 M ⊙ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Niedzielski et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Döllinger et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Setiawan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sato et al. 2005</ref>). All are plagued by the same problem in that they rely on evolutionary tracks to determine the stellar mass. Until these are calibrated both the mass of the host star and the planet are uncertain.</p><p>A more reliable means of calculating the stellar mass independent of evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres is using stellar oscillation observations, as the frequency of stellar oscillations is related to the mean density of the star. If one has an accurate stellar radius it is simple to compute a stellar mass from the oscillation frequencies that is model independent. Depending on the accuracy of the diameter measurements, the masses can be measured to an accuracy of ∼2% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Teixeira et al. 2009</ref>) to ∼15% <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hatzes &amp; Zechmeister 2007)</ref>.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that most and possibly all giant stars show stellar oscillations (e.g., de <ref type="bibr">Ridder et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frandsen, et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hatzes &amp; Cochran 1994)</ref>, which are due to pmode oscillations where pressure is the restoring force. Thus giant stars are an ideal class of objects for deriving fundamental stellar parameters. They are abundant, they have large angular diameters suitable for interferometric measurements, and they exhibit stellar oscillations with radial velocity amplitudes of a few to several tens of m/s, which are easily measurable by state-of-theart techniques. The observed oscillation frequencies constrain the internal structure of the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bedding et al. 2006</ref>) and interferometry measures the star's size, and the combination leads to the mass of the star. Once stellar isochrones have been refined and calibrated for these evolved stars, they can be used to determine the masses of all planet-hosting giant stars. Because collecting data on the oscillation frequencies requires considerable telescope resources and can only be done for relatively few stars, we first present our results on interferometric measurements on a larger sample of giant stars.</p><p>The advantage interferometry provides is the ability to directly measure stellar angular diameters. Once the angular diameters are known for these giant stars, physical radii and effective temperatures can be calculated when combined with other parameters, such as the parallax, bolometric flux, interstellar absorption, and bolometric corrections. The radii and effective temperatures are important values that characterize the parent star as well as the environment in which the exoplanet resides for those stars hosting planets. Section 2 describes the spectroscopic measurements of T eff and log g for the sample, §3 discusses the interferometric observations, §4 explains how the angular diameters, linear radii, and T eff were determined, and §5 explores the physical implications of the interferometric observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Spectroscopic observations</head><p>Our sample of K giant stars were obtained from the planet search survey of <ref type="bibr">Döllinger et al. (2007)</ref>. As part of this program the T eff and log g were measured, which allowed us to estimate the stellar radii and masses. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists the 25 stars observed here, and planets have already been found orbiting HD 73108 <ref type="bibr">(Döllinger et al. 2007</ref>), HD 139357 and HD 170693 <ref type="bibr">(Döllinger et al. 2009a</ref>), HD 32518 and HD <ref type="bibr">136726 (Döllinger et al. 2009b</ref>), and HD 167042 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Johnson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sato et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Döllinger et al. 2009c</ref>). Three additional stars show long-period variations in their radial velocity measurements: HD 106574, <ref type="bibr">HD 157681, and HD 200205 (Döllinger et al. 2009d</ref>). The targets chosen for our observing list are bright (V &lt; 6.5) giant stars that showed significant short-term variability indicative of stellar pulsations, which made them excellent candidates for both stellar oscillation observations and interferometric measurements.</p><p>The spectroscopic observations were carried out using the CoudéCoudé´CoudéÉchelle spectrograph of the 2-m-Alfred Jensch telescope of the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg. The spectrograph has a resolving power of ∆λ/λ = 67000 and the wavelength range used was 4700 to 7400Å7400Å. Standard IRAF routines were used for subtracting the bias offset, flat-fielding, subtracting the scattered light, extracting the spectra, and for the wavelength calibration 1 .</p><p>In order to determine the stellar parameters from the spectra, a grid of model atmospheres from <ref type="bibr">Gustafsson et al. (1975)</ref> was used in which a plane-parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium was assumed. We selected 144 unblended Fe I and 8 Fe II lines in the wavelength range 5806 and 6858Å6858Å using the line list of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pasquini et al. (2004)</ref>. The iron abundance <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> was determined by assuming that Fe I lines of different equivalent widths have to give the same relative abundance of iron. For the effective temperature, an excitation equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II for lines of different excitation potentials was used, and the surface gravity was determined from the ionization balance of Fe I to Fe II lines <ref type="bibr">(Döllinger 2008</ref>). The resulting <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, T eff , and log g values are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Interferometric observations</head><p>Interferometric observations were obtained using the CHARA Array, a six element opticalinfrared interferometer located on Mount Wilson, California (ten <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Brummelaar et al. 2005</ref>). All observations used the pupil-plane "CHARA Classic" beam combiner in the K ′ -band at 2.15 µm while visible wavelengths (470-800 nm) were used for tracking and tip/tilt corrections. The observing procedure and data reduction process employed here are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">McAlister et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>We interleaved calibrator and target star observations so that every target was flanked by calibrator observations made as close in time as possible, which allowed us to convert instrumental target and calibrator visibilities to calibrated visibilities for the target. Reliable calibrators were chosen to be single stars with expected visibility amplitudes &gt;85% so they were nearly unresolved on the baselines used, which meant uncertainties in the calibrator's diameter did not affect the target's diameter calculation as much as if the calibrator star had a significant angular size. In a few cases, a calibrator had a stellar companion but at such a distance that light from the secondary star would not contaminate our interferometric measurements and the calibrator could therefore be treated as a single star.</p><p>To check for possible unseen close companions that would contaminate our observations, we created spectral energy distribution (SED) fits based on published U BV RIJHK photometric values obtained from the literature for each calibrator to establish diameter estimates. This also allowed us to see if there was any excess emission associated with a low-mass stellar companion or circumstellar disk. Calibrator candidates showing displaying variable radial velocities or any other indication of companions were discarded.</p><p>We used Kurucz model atmospheres 2 based on T eff and log g values to calculate limb-darkened angular diameters for the calibrators. The stellar models were fit to observed photometry after converting magnitudes to fluxes using <ref type="bibr">Colina et al. (1996)</ref> for U BV RI values and <ref type="bibr">Cohen et al. (2003)</ref> for JHK values. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for the T eff and log g used and the resulting limb-darkened angular diameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Determination of angular diameter and T eff</head><p>The observed quantity of an interferometer is defined as the visibility (V ), which is fit to a model of a uniformly-illuminated disk (UD) that represents the observed face of the star. Diameter fits to V were based upon the UD approximation given by V = [2J 1 (x)]/x, where J 1 is the first-order Bessel function and x = πBθ UD λ −1 , where B is the projected baseline at the star's position, θ UD is the apparent UD angular diameter of the star, and λ is the effective wavelength of the observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shao &amp; Colavita 1992)</ref>. A more realistic model of a star's disk involves limb-darkening (LD), and relationship incorporating the linear limb darkening coefficient µ λ (Hanbury- <ref type="bibr">Brown et al. 1974</ref>) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = 1 − µ λ 2 + µ λ 3 −1 × (1 − µ λ ) J 1 (x) x + µ λ π 2 1/2 J 3/2 (x) x 3/2 .</formula><p>(1) <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> lists the Modified Julian Date (MJD), projected baseline (B) at the time of observation, projected baseline position angle (Θ), calibrated visibility (V c ), and error in V c (σV c ) for each giant star observed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1 through 3</ref> show the LD diameter fits for all the stars.</p><p>The limb-darkening coefficient was obtained from <ref type="bibr">Claret et al. (1995)</ref> after adopting the T eff and log g values required for each star observed. The resulting LD angular diameters are listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. The average difference between the UD and LD diameters are on the order of a few percent, and the final angular diameters are little affected by the choice of µ λ . All but four stars have θ LD errors of 2% or less, three of the four have errors of only 3%, and the final star has a 5% error. Additionally, the combination of the interferometric measurement of the star's angular diameter plus the Hipparcos parallax (van Leeuwen 2007) allowed us to determine the star's physical radius. The results are also listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. In principle, one can calculate the mass of each star from the physical radius and log g values. However, the formal errors in log g lead to errors in such mass estimates near the 50% level, thereby significantly decreasing their usefulness to this analysis.</p><p>For each θ LD fit, the errors were derived via the reduced χ 2 minimization method ( <ref type="bibr">Wall &amp; Jenkins 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Press et al. 1992</ref>): the diameter fit with the lowest χ 2 was found and the corresponding diam-eter was the final θ LD for the star. The errors were calculated by finding the diameter at χ 2 + 1 on either side of the minimum χ 2 and determining the difference between the χ 2 diameter and χ 2 + 1 diameter. In calculating the diameter errors in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we adjusted the estimated visibility errors to force the reduced χ 2 to unity because when this is omitted, the reduced χ 2 is well under 1.0, indicating we are overestimating the errors in our calibrated visibilities.</p><p>Limb-darkened angular diameters were estimated using the relationship described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kervella et al. (2004)</ref> between the (V −K) color and log θ LD (see θ estimate in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The table also lists R estimate , which were derived using θ estimate and the stars' parallaxes. The major weakness of this method lies in the uncertainties surrounding the K-magnitudes, which were taken from two sources: The TwoMicron Sky Survey (TMSS, Neugebauer &amp; Leighton 1969, errors ∼2-5%) and The 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (2MASS, <ref type="bibr">Cutri et al. 2003</ref>, errors ∼6-12%). Preference was given to the former because 2MASS measurements saturate at magnitudes brighter than ∼3.5 in the K-band even when using the shortest exposure time <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The large errors associated with 2MASS magnitudes for these bright stars led to large errors in angular diameter and physical radii estimates.</p><p>Once θ LD was determined interferometrically, the T eff was calculated using the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F BOL = 1 4 θ 2 LD σT 4 eff ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where F BOL is the bolometric flux and σ is the Stefan-Bolzmann constant. The stars' V and K magnitudes were dereddened using the extinction curve described in <ref type="bibr">Cardelli et al. (1989)</ref> and interstellar absorption (A V ) values were from Famaey et al. (2005) except for HD 113049 and HD 176408, which had no A V in the literature. A V values for these two stars were estimated through a non-linear, least squares fit and a reddening prescription from Fitzpatrick (1999), who presented a wavelength-dependent extinction curve. The intrinsic broad-band color (V − K) was calculated and bolometric corrections (BCs) were determined by interpolating between the [Fe/H] = +0.2, 0.0, and -1.0 tables found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. (1999)</ref>. They point out that in the range of 6000 K ≥ T eff ≥ 4000 K, their BC calibration is symmetrically distributed around a ±0.10 magnitude band when compared to other calibrations. The average BC used here is 0.55, and because 0.10 is 18% of 0.55, we assigned a 18% error bar to our BC values. The bolometric flux was determined by applying the BC for each star and the T eff was calculated (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). All T eff errors are ≤ 4%, 11 stars have errors of ≤ 2%, and the major source of error in calculating T eff stemmed, again, from uncertainties in K-magnitudes.</p><p>Giant star masses were estimated using the PARAM stellar model 4 from Girardi et al. (2000) with a modified version of the method described in da <ref type="bibr">Silva et al. (2006)</ref>. The input parameters for each star were its interferometrically-measured T eff , its spectroscopically-derived <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, its V magnitude from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mermilliod (1991)</ref>, and its Hipparcos parallax <ref type="bibr">(van Leeuwen 2007)</ref> along with the corresponding error for each value. The model used these inputs to estimate each star's age, mass, radius, (B − V ) 0 , and log g using the isochrones and a Bayesian estimating method, calculating the probability density function separately for each property in question. da Silva et al. qualify mass estimates as "more uncertain" than other properties, so the resulting masses listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> should be viewed as a rough estimates only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussion</head><p>In order to check how well the estimated and measured angular diameters agreed, we plotted photometrically-estimated versus interferometrically-measured angular diameters in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> shows a similar plot for physical radii. The angular diameters determined using K-band photometry from 2MASS show generally higher errors in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> than the diameters determined using TMSS photometry. This plot clearly shows the advantage of measuring angular diameters interferometrically, as the errors are significantly smaller than the photometric estimates in all cases. There is an even scatter around the 1:1 ratio line, and all but two stars are within 1σ of the line.</p><p>The outliers in both Figures 4 and 5 are HD 118904 and HD 157681. Neither star shows any sign of binarity in the literature, and the SEDs created using the T eff and log g based on their spectral type and <ref type="bibr">Cox (2000)</ref> do not show any excess in the infrared wavelengths that would suggest a low-mass stellar companion or a circumstellar disk. In both cases, the problem may lie with the calibrator stars chosen. HD 157681 was observed using the calibrator HD 158460, and though the latter has a small estimated diameter (0.268±0.016 mas) and its SED shows no excess flux in the infrared that would indicate a low-mass stellar companion or circumstellar disk, HD 157681 was the only star observed with that calibrator and there could be an unseen companion that is not taken into account when estimating the star's diameter. Future observations of HD 157681 with different calibrators will make the situation clearer. HD 118904 was observed using HD 124063 as a calibrator, and the same calibrator was used to observe the target star HD 113049 along with the second calibrator HD 107193. When the data were calibrated separately for HD 113049, the diameters showed a 0.08 mas difference, which is on the order of an 8% change. If HD 118904's diameter is reduced by 8%, the data point is within errors on the 1:1 ratio line for both plots in Figures 4 and 5. Because this is the case, only HD 107193 was used in the calibration of HD 113049's data, and the angular diameter, radius, and T eff listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> are based on those data alone. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> shows that while a fair number of photometric and interferometric radii agree very well, there are some that show slight discrepancies, notwithstanding the error bars. This could be due to a few different effects. First, the photometrically-determined radii depend on temperature estimates that may not be correct. If the star is highly active or there is a very faint companion, these could affect the temperature and therefore radii estimates 5 . Second, the limb-darkening law used to determine interferometric diameters and radii may not take certain stellar features into account, such as starspots or extremely active regions. This would not be a large effect because even altering the limb-darkening coefficient µ λ by 20% changes the limb-darkened angular diameter by an average of 0.7%. Third, the differences may be due to changes in the stars' convections zones, because as the star evolves the convection zone gets deeper. Convection is not well modeled, which may lead to errors in the photometric radii estimates.</p><p>We also plotted the interferometrically-measured T eff versus those derived spectroscopically in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. There is some scatter off the 1:1 ratio line, particularly for the cooler stars. The errors in T eff do not show a trend with log g, diameter, radius, (V − K) color, distance, spectral type, metallicity, or bolometric correction. The discrepancies may be due to the inherent properties of the methods used to measure T eff . Spectroscopic values are based on Fe I and Fe II lines and measure the T eff in the part of the atmosphere where those lines are present, while interferometry calculates the overall T eff of the star using the measured diameter. It has been surmised that atmospheric models of K giant stars in the near-ultraviolet band are missing a source of thermal extinction, which would also affect the T eff measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Short &amp; Hauschildt 2009</ref>).</p><p>Our next step will be to determine the oscillation frequencies of these stars so that we can compare the true masses of these stars with those estimated using evolutionary models.</p><p>van <ref type="bibr">Belle, G.

The solid line represents the theoretical visibility curve for a star with the best fit θ LD , the dashed lines are the 1σ error limits of the diameter fit, the solid symbols are the calibrated visibilities, and the vertical lines are the measured errors. Some of the stars' visibilities were shifted as indicated by "(V ± #)" so they would not overlap other data points. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-LD disk diameter fits for all the stars observed with two calibrators except HD 150010. The symbols are the same as listed in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. For the sake of clarity, the data points for one calibrator only are shown.  The squares and circles represent diameters estimated using K magnitudes from TMSS and 2MASS, respectively, and the diagonal solid line indicates a 1:1 ratio for the diameters. Note the significantly larger error bars associated with the photometric diameters, particularly those using 2MASS data. The outliers above and below the line are HD 118904 and HD 157681, respectively, and the discrepancies may be due to the calibrator used (see §5 for more details). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.-LD disk diameter fits for HD 150010 (top panel) and HD 214868 (bottom panel).
