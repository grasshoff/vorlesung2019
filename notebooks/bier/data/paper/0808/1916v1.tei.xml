<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over 250 extrasolar planets are known to orbit nearby main sequence stars. Among these include over a dozen exoplanets with minimum masses below 22 M ⊕ and several with minimum masses less than 10 M ⊕ . Of key interest are transiting planets with measured masses and radii, which can be used to constrain the planet's interior bulk composition. The relationship between mass and radius for solid exoplanets has hence received much attention in the last few years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Valencia et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Fortney et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Seager et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Selsis et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Sotin et al. 2007</ref>). The recent activity builds on much earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Stevenson 1982)</ref>, with improvements on the equations of state and treatment of different mantle and core compositions to varying degrees of complexity.</p><p>Unlike for the solar system planets, we have no access to the gravitational moments of exoplanets. Hence the density distribution in the interior is unknown and this leads to an ambiguity, or degeneracy, in the interior composition for an exoplanet of a fixed mass and radius. One way to capture the degeneracies of exoplanet interior composition is using ternary diagrams (introduced to exoplanet interiors by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Valencia et al. (2007)</ref>).</p><p>We adopt the idea of using ternary diagrams to quantify the compositional uncertainty in exoplanets. The planet mass and radius are the observed quantities and therefore we focus solely on on ternary diagrams for a planet of fixed mass and fixed radius (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Valencia et al. 2007</ref>). We compute ternary diagrams for solid exoplanets ranging in mass from 0.5 to 20 M ⊕ . We furthermore explain the behavior of the mass-radius curves in two and three dimensions. We also present a description of our publically available computer code to compute fixed mass-radius ternary diagrams, including the observational uncertainties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Background and Equations</head><p>We begin by assuming the major components of a solid exoplanet are limited to an iron core, a silicate mantle, and a water ice outer layer. In other words, we assume the interior of the planet is differentiated with the denser materials interior to the less dense materials. We further assume each layer to be homogeneous in its composition.</p><p>We can then model the interior of a solid exoplanet by using:</p><p>(1) the equation for mass of a spherical shell dm(r) dr = 4πr 2 ρ(r),</p><p>where m(r) is the mass included in radius r, ρ(r) is the density at radius r;</p><p>(2) the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium dP (r) dr = −Gm(r)ρ(r) r 2 ,</p><p>where P (r) is the pressure at radius r; and (3) the equation of state (EOS) that relates P and ρ.</p><p>The EOS is different for each different material. We used Fe (ǫ) for the planet core, MgSiO 3 perovskite for the silicate mantle, and water ice VII, VIII, and X for the water-ice outer layer. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> for a detailed discussion of the EOSs including their source. The temperature has little effect on the EOS especially in the high pressure regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Seager et al. 2007)</ref>; we ignore the temperature dependence of the EOS. This simplifies the equations and their solution, while enabling a relatively accurate analysis.</p><p>In this problem, we have five variables:</p><p>1. the iron mass fraction (α);</p><p>2. the silicate mass fraction (β);</p><p>3. the water-ice mass fraction (γ); 4. the total mass of the planet (M p ); 5. and the mean radius of the planet (R p ).</p><p>The variables α, β, and γ are not independent of each other. Based on the assumption that the planet only consists of iron, silicate, and water we have: α + β + γ = 1, which can also be expressed as γ = 1 − α − β. We therefore have four variables: α, β, M p and R p . Given any three of these variables, we can determine the fourth variable uniquely. We can also see that given an M p and R p , there is a relationship between α and β. There is not a single value of α and β that produces a given M p and R p . Instead, there are infinite pairs of α and β which give the same M p and R p , and we call this a degeneracy in the interior composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Algorithm for Solving the Differential Equations</head><p>Our program integrates from the surface r = R p inward to the center of the planet. The outer boundary condition is m(R p ) = M p and P (R p ) = 0. That is, at the surface, the mass is the specified total planet mass and the pressure is approximately 0.</p><p>We aim to interpret observations of a planet of a given mass and radius. We therefore choose to intergrate inwards instead of outwards based upon the known parameters of the planet (M p , R p , and P (R p )). The independent variable is r, decreasing from r = R p to r = 0. The interior boundary condition is m(r) = 0 at r = 0. Typically, when integrating m(r), m does not equal zero at r = 0. We therefore must iterate, tuning the mass fraction of each layer until m = 0 and r = 0 is reached.</p><p>Given a single M p and R p the computer program finds all possible combinations of (α, β, γ(= 1 − α − β)) that give the same planet mass and radius. The program begins with a chosen value of α, and then takes a guess of β. Next, the computer program integrates the differential equations (1) and (2) using the above boundary conditions to find the value of the planet radius. By comparing this radius to the desired R p , the computer program tunes the value for β, by using the bisection method. This process is repeated several times, until β is found to a satisfactory accuracy of 1/1000. By varying α within the range of 0 to 1, we can get all possible combinations of α and β which produce a specific M p and R p .</p><p>2.3. Algorithm for Generating a Database of M p = 0.5-20M ⊕ M p and R p are observed parameters and one usually wants to find the corresponding allowed α and β. For a range of M p and R p -corresponding to observational uncertainties-it can be very time consuming to use the first algorithm described in §2.2. We therefore generate a database that is a discrete representation of the relation R p = R p (α, β, M p ). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the 4D database.</p><p>This database is a 3-D array which contains the data of R p corresponding to each combination of α and β (0 to 1 with 1% spacing) and M ⊕ (ranging from 0.5 to 20 M ⊕ with 0.25M ⊕ spacing). The database can be used via linear interpolation to find R p for any given M p , α and β. A conservative estimate of the fractional error in the database interpolation is 1/1000. For the same range of M p and R p , interpolation in the database is about 45 times faster than solving the differential equations.</p><p>To generate a database of all values of α, β, and R p for M p ranging from 0.5 to 20 M ⊕ . Given M p , α, and β, this algorithm also integrates from the surface inward to r = 0 and m(r) = 0 to find R p . In contrast to the first algorithm (which solves for a given M p and R p ), a single integration in radius results in the desired solution of R p , for a given M p , α, and β. In other words is there is no iteration required, making this algorithm much more efficient.</p></div>

(2007)</ref>.</p><p>We have made two different codes available. The codes have the same output, but the first is based on a differential equation solver ( §2.2) and the second code is based on interpolation of the large database ( §2.3). For the codes, the planet mass must be in the range 0.5-20 M ⊕ . The inputs to the codes are: the planet mass in Earth masses (M p ), the planet mass uncertainty in Earth masses (σ Mp ), the planet radius in Earth radii (R p ), and the planet radius uncertainty in Earth radii (σ Rp ). The values σ Mp = 0 and σ Rp = 0 are allowed. If the combination of input values M p and R p are unphysical, the code will return an error.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ExoterDE(M p , σ Mp , R p , σ Rp )</formula><p>. This code solves the two differential equations described in §2.1. This code consists of three subroutines (each of which must be downloaded) that are automatically called by the above command. The first subroutine is the differential equation solver, which also reads the equations of state. The second subroutine contains the actual differential equations. The third subroutine plots the ternary diagrams; this subroutine calls a ternary diagram plotting routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Theune 2005)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> which plots a single line for each of the 1-, 2-, and 3-σ contour lines. See §4.1. An example from this code is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ExoterDB(M p , σ Mp , R p , σ Rp )</formula><p>. This code reads in the database of M p , R p and fractional composition (α and β). The output is a ternary diagram, shaded throughout the 1-, 2-, and 3-σ contour curves. This subroutine uses the same ternary diagram plotting routine as described above.</p><p>The differential equation solver ExoterDE is much slower than the database extracter ExoterDB. In principle, ExoterDB is more accurate than ExoterDB.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">2-D Cartesian Diagram</head><p>For a given M p and R p we want to know the interior composition of the relative mass fraction of the three components. There are three variables we have solved for (α, β, γ), but only two of them are independent (since γ = 1 − α − β). Therefore points on a 2-D diagram can describe all the possible combinations of α, β, γ for a given M p and R p . We show such a solution in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. We note that 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, α + β ≤ 1, and therefore not every point in the 2-D plane will correspond to a set of α, β, γ. Only the points which are in a right-angled triangular region will respresent the set of allowed solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Ternary Diagram</head><p>Ternary diagrams to describe the interior composition of exoplanets were introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Valencia et al. (2007)</ref>. In a ternary diagram, α, β, and γ are each one axis of an equilateral triangle. Although γ is extraneous, the ternary diagram is useful because it is more intuitive to see the three components of the planet interior (in a symmetric way) compared to a 2D Cartesian diagram with only two of the components. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows how to read a ternary diagram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Relationship Between the 3D and 2D Cartesian Diagrams and the Ternary Diagram</head><p>To explain the full origin of a curve on the ternary diagram we start with the 3D Cartesian diagram with all solutions of M p , R p and composition (in terms of α and β), as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We take an isoradius and isomass surface as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. As an example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> the red surface is the iso-radius surface of R p = 1.7R ⊕ and one of the blue colored planess is the iso-mass surface of M p = 4M ⊕ . These two surfaces intersect each other and result in a curve. This curve can be projected vertically to the x-y plane which is the iso-mass plane. We therefore have a (iso-radius and isomass) curve on the isomass plane. This curve is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> in a Cartesian diagram.</p><p>The Cartesian and ternary diagrams are two different ways to represent the same information. There exists a linear coordinate transformation between the two. That means if a function is a straight line appearing in the 2-D Cartesian diagram, it will still be a straight line in the ternary diagram.</p><p>The transformation from 2-D Cartesian coordinates to the ternary diagram coordinates is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x ternary = 1 2 (1 + x − y)<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">y ternary = √ 3 2 (1 − x − y).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here x and y are the coordinates of a point in a 2D Cartesian diagram, the x ternary and y ternary are the coordinates of the point in ternary diagram in the Cartesian grid variables. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the same R p = 1.7R ⊕ , M p = 4M ⊕ curve represented by a ternary diagram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Observational Uncertainties</head><p>Real planet mass and radius measurements have uncertainties. The planet mass and radius uncertainties are typically 5 to 10 percent (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Selsis et al. 2007)</ref>, and even smaller for the most favorable targets. We now present examples of ternary diagrams that include the mass and radius uncertainties.</p><p>We consider uncertainties of 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations (σ) from the measured value. See Figures 4 and 5. In more detail, the uncertainty in composition on the ternary diagram is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ comp = (σ compM ) 2 + (σ compR ) 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where comp refers to composition and compM and compR refer to composition uncertainties caused by the planet mass and radius uncertainty respectively. Here we have assumed that the uncertainties in mass and radius are independent from each other and have assumed the linearity of the superposition of small uncertainties. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a planet with M p = 10 ± 0.5M ⊕ and R p = 2 ± 0.1M ⊕ . We see that taking the 3-σ limit, almost the entire ternary diagram is filled. In other words, for a 5% 3-σ (i.e., 15%) uncertainty on the planet mass and radius, the interior composition in terms of fractional composition of iron, silicates and water cannot be determined. The reason this example fills the almost the whole ternary diagram is that a planet with 10M ⊕ and 2R ⊕ has an average density in between two extreme cases (purely iron or purely water). Therefore, a large variety of different combinations of iron, silicate and water can result in a similar M p and R p . Even taking a 1-σ uncertainty of the planet mass and radius, the uncertainty in internal composition is large.</p><p>We note that an uncertainty in R p has more of an effect on the uncertainty in the interior composition than an uncertainty in M p . This is because the planet's average density ρ ∼ M p /R 3 . Considering error propagation, the uncertainty in radius has a three times larger effect on the uncertainty in average density than does the mass uncertainty.</p><p>We show ternary diagrams for planets with various masses, radii, and 5% fractional uncertainty in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Only solutions in part of the ternary diagram are allowed, despite considering the 3-σ range. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5b</ref>, the upper 3-σ boundary is absent because it goes below the lowest allowed density of the 2M ⊕ and 1.5R ⊕ planet and is thus unphysical. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5c</ref> we see the opposite case, where the lower 3-σ boundary is absent because it goes above the highest planet density allowed and is thus unphysical.</p><p>A ternary diagram for a fixed planet mass and radius that includes observational uncertainties is one of the primary outcomes of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model Uncertainties</head><p>The model and computer code we present assumes a differentiated planet composed of an iron core, a silicate mantle, and a water ice outer layer. The division into three major materials is based on the point that the densities of iron, silicate, and water are much more different from each other than any minor compositional variant of each individual material. The model neglects phase variation and temperatures which, as argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>, have little effect on the total planet radius (to an uncertainty of about ∼1 to 3 percent uncertainty in planet radius, decreasing with increasing planet mass.).</p><p>Low-pressure phase changes (at &lt; 10 GPa) are not important for a planet's radius because for plausible planet compositions most of the mass is at high pressure. For high pressure phase changes we expect the associated correction to the equation of state (and hence derived planet radii) to be small because at high pressure the importance of chemical bonding patterns to the equation of state drops.</p><p>Regarding temperature, at low pressures ( 10 GPa) in the outer planetary layers, the crystal lattice structure dominates the material's density and the thermal vibration contribution to the density are small in comparison. At high pressures the thermal pressure contribution to the EOS is small because the close-packed nature of the materials prevents structural changes from thermal pressure contributions.</p><p>Although the code can model radii for planets in the mass range 0.5 to 20 M ⊕ , the model is more accurate for planets above a few Earth masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>The model also neglects variation in composition, such as a light element in the iron core as Earth and Mercury are believed to have. The model also omits other impurities in the mantle and water layer, including iron in the mantle. Molten cores have also been omitted. At the present time, these model uncertainties are expected to have an effect on the planet radius much less than the ∼5 percent radius observational uncertainty.</p><p>For all of the above reasons, we therefore argue that for the present time the observational uncertainties dominate the model uncertainties; the model presented here is adequate for an estimate of planet bulk composition. In any event, the main results of our work described in the following subsections despite any model uncertainties.</p><p>It is possible to rule out parts of the ternary diagram as being physically unplausible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Valencia et al. 2007</ref>). This is based on the initial composition of the protoplanetary nebula and on planet differentiation. For example, a pure iron planet is unlikely to exist, because removing all of the mantle would be difficult. A pure water planet is also unlikely to exist. Where water ice forms, so do silicate-rich and iron-rich materials, making planet accretion of pure water unlikely. We prefer to leave the omission of parts of the ternary diagram to users of the code, because in exoplanets surprising exceptions to the "rules" of planet characteristics are not uncommon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Spacing, Shape, Direction, and Rotation of Curves on the Ternary Diagram.</head><p>We now turn to a discussion of the spacing, direction, and shape of the curves in the ternary diagrams. A quantitative and qualitative description of these is a main point of this paper. We emphasize that each curve shown in our <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> diagrams represents a different mass and radius. The curves to the lower right are more dense, as they have a higher mass and lower radius than the curves moving to the upper left.</p><p>All behavior results from the equations of state of the materials, and, in some cases, how they behave differently under pressure.</p><p>We begin with an equation that we use repeatedly in this section. We consider the simplified case that the planet core has a uniform density, where ¯ ρ F e is the average density of Fe in the core, ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 is the average density of silicate in the mantle, and ¯ ρ H 2 O is the average density of water in the outer water layer. We then have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">4 3 πR 3 p = αM p ¯ ρ F e + βM p ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 + γM p ¯ ρ H 2 O ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where α + β + γ = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Spacing</head><p>The iso-mass iso-radius curves for adjacent curves with equal differences of mass and radius have uneven spacing on a ternary diagram. This spacing is generally smaller in the lower right part of the ternary diagram (high iron fraction region) than in the upper left part (high silicate or water fraction region). The curves in the lower right part of the diagram have a higher density (higher mass and smaller radius) than the curves found on the upper left part of the diagram. The density is not a linear function of both mass and radius hence we do not expect equal spacing on the ternary diagram. We can, however, give both a quantitative and qualitative explanation of the uneven spacing.</p><p>We can provide a quantitative description, beginning with equation (6), but using α = 1−β −γ to get 4 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">πR 3 p = M p (1 − β − γ) ¯ ρ F e + β ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 + γ ¯ ρ H 2 O<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We use the fact that the curves on the ternary diagram are almost perpendicular to the water side of the ternary diagram, and therefore set the silicate mass fraction β = 0 for our discussion.

The lower right part (Fe-rich) of the ternary diagram is where the average density (¯ ρ) of a planet is high. This implies (for the same d¯ ρ) dγ is small (since ¯ ρ is in the denominator). In the upper left region of the ternary diagram (water-rich) the average planet density is smaller than a planet located in the lower right part of the diagram, and therefore dγ is larger.</p><p>Qualitatively, to have wider spacing an increasing water fraction is needed. In other words, towards the upper right part of the ternary diagram, for the same density difference more water than iron must be replaced.</p><p>We note that the spacing is predominantly the result of the nonlinearity of equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> and the average density of each compositional layer, not of any P -ρ properties of the EOS (i.e., how materials condense under high pressure). This statement is correct under the assumption of a single material for each layer in the planet (in our case for iron, silicate, and water). The assumption that the average density within each layer does not change significantly from curve to curve (for example, from the 1-σ curve to the 3-σ curve for the case M p = 2M ⊕ and R p = 1.5R ⊕ ) is reasonable for a ternary diagram that spans only a small mass and radius range.</p></div>

Using the the equations that convert the Cartesian coordinates to coordinates on the ternary diagram (equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(3)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(4)</ref>) we find that</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">dβ ternary dα ternary = √ 3 dβ dα − 1 dβ dα + 1 .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>We can now go on to describe the direction, shape, and rotation in the Cartesian diagram based on equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>, with the knowledge that the same qualitative behavior will appear in the ternary diagrams. We first emphasize that the slope of an isomass, isoradius curve on the ternary diagram describes adding and removing mass of the different species.</p><p>We begin with a qualitative explanation of the direction of the curves on the ternary diagramwhy each curve goes from the lower left to the upper right. This is largely a coincidence in the different values of ¯ ρ H 2 O , ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 , and ¯ ρ F e . The coincidence lies in the fact that iron is more dense and water less dense than silicate-and for zero-pressure densities, an equal mass of iron and water combined densities are roughly similar to the silicate density. At the lower left of the ternary diagram in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, the silicate mass fraction is 80 percent, the iron mass fraction is zero and the water mass fraction is 20 percent. As the silicate fraction decreases, a combination of equal parts iron and water must be added to maintain the same overall planet mass and radius. This description is consistent with the direction of the curves in the ternary diagrams.</p><p>More quantitatively, from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>, we can take the zero-pressure densities of Fe, H 2 O, and MgSiO 3 to find the slope of the curve on the cartesian diagram</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">dβ dα = 2,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>and from equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(3)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(4)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">dβ ternary dα ternary = 1 √ 3 .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>We can consider removing a fixed amount of iron mass, e.g., 1 gram. According to equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref>, 2 grams of silicate must be added. For mass balance (because each curve on the ternary diagram represents a planet of fixed mass and fixed radius), 1 gram of water must be removed. The direction of the curves on the ternary diagram do correspond to removing roughly equal masses of iron and water for every mass of silicate added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rotation</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref>-d (where a through d are in order of increasing mass), we see that for more massive planets, the isomass-isoradius curves are rotated. In other words, the slope of the curve on the ternary diagram increases for increasing mass.</p><p>We again return to equation <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. With increasing planet mass, each of ¯ ρ H 2 O , ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 , and ¯ ρ F e changes. Because iron is in the core, it suffers more compression than the silicate mantle or water icy layer. In other words, ¯ ρ F e must increase more than ¯ ρ H 2 O and ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 as the planet mass increases. Therefore, the numerator of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> gets larger and thus the slope of the curve increases. The rotation is counter clockwise with increase of mass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Slope of the Curves</head><p>We now turn to discuss the slope of each isomass-isoradius curve. We see from Figures 4 and 5 that the slope of each isomass-isoradius curve for a fixed mass and radius is greater in the lower left part of the curve than in the upper right part of the curve.</p><p>The slope is due to the differential compression of water, silicate and iron under pressure. This slope is again explained by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>. At the lower left the slope is smaller; this is the silicate-rich region of the ternary diagram. There is more silicate and less iron and water. The ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 will increase as it gets compressed in the inner part of the planet. This causes the slope in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> to get smaller. In contrast, at the upper right, there is little silicate, but more water and more iron. The silicate and water are less compressed, but the iron is more compressed, making the slope increase.</p><p>For a conceptual explanation, first recall the idea described above that removing 2 grams of silicate can be compensated by adding approximately 1 gram of water and 1 gram of iron. In a silicate-rich planet (lower left of the ternary diagram), silicate is compressed. For a massive planet, this compression makes the silicate density closer to iron's density than in the uncompressed case. Therefore, removing a fixed mass of silicate requires much more iron than water to be added, for a fixed mass and radius.</p><p>In contrast, along the upper right part of the ternary diagram, the planet is iron-rich or waterrich. The slope of an isomass-isoradius curve is steeper than a curve in the lower left part of the ternary diagram. For an isomass-isoradius curve in the upper part of the ternary diagram, the planet has more iron, the iron is very compressed (There is less silicate and the silicate is overall less compressed compared to a planet in the lower left of the ternary diagram). If a fixed mass of silicate is removed, more water than iron must be added to compensate for the density of compressed iron. The density of water does not change much, because water is always the outer layer and thus the least compressed.</p><p>As a qualitative explanation, if the average density of each of the three layers remains constant, then an isomass-isoradius curve should always be a straight line in either the Cartesian or ternary representation. The curvature in a given isomass-isoradius curve appears because of the compression of material under pressure, which is a property of the EOS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Shape and Direction of an Isoradius Surface in our 3D Representation</head><p>We return to the 3D representation of the relationship between mass, radius and composition shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. An isoradius surface (red oblique surface) is shown for R p = 1.7R ⊕ . An isomass surface (one of the blue flat planes) is shown for M p = 4M ⊕ . At the bottom tip of the isoradius surface, the silicate mass fraction = iron mass fraction = 0, and the planet is composed of 100% water. This is the minimum mass for this radius. The isoradius surface also has a maximum mass, reached by a composition of 100 percent iron.</p><p>For the same radius, if either the silicate or iron mass fraction is increased, the planet mass must also increase. This is because iron and silicate are denser than water ice. We further note that for an increase in iron mass fraction, the mass of the planet must increase more steeply than for an increase in the silicate mass fraction. This is seen by the different length and shape "edges" of the isomass surface in the iron-mass plane and silicate-mass plane in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>We now show that the shape of the isoradius surface is concave. The isoradius surface can be considered as the isovolume surface, where the volume is the sum of the core, the silicate mantle, and the water crust. To calculate the total mass of a point on the isoradius curve, we use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(6)</ref>, and since R p is constant on this surface we can rewrite this equation (with C a constant) as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">M p = C α ¯ ρ F e + β ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 + (1 − α − β) ¯ ρ H 2 O −1 .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>The term in brackets is a linear function and its inverse is hyperbolic. For example, if we let α = 0 (no iron), then we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">M p = C 1 ¯ ρ H 2 O − β 1 ¯ ρ H 2 O − 1 ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 −1 ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">C = 4 3 πR 3 p .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>Both terms in the square brackets are positive and 0 ≤ β ≤ 1. This is in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">M p = C C 1 − C 2 β ,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">C 1 = 1 ¯ ρ H 2 O<label>(26)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">C 2 = 1 ¯ ρ H 2 O − 1 ¯ ρ M gSiO 3<label>(27)</label></formula><p>We have C 1 &gt; C 2 &gt; 0. This is the form of a concave hyperbola, because, taking the first derivative we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">dM p dβ = CC 2 (C 1 − C 2 β) 2<label>(28)</label></formula><p>The slope increases as β increases because C 1 − C 2 β decreases but is always greater than zero.</p><p>Although we have made the simplification that the average densities of each layer remain constant, our qualitative description holds because ¯ ρ H 2 O &lt; ¯ ρ M gSiO 3 &lt; ¯ ρ F e as long as the planet is differentiated into layers of increasing density towards the planet center.</p><p>A similar argument shows that the total iron fraction vs. total mass is also a hyperbola, making the whole isoradius surface concave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Conclusion</head><p>An ambiguity in an exoplanet interior composition remains for any planet with a measured mass and radius, no matter how precisely measured. We can accept this ambiguity and quantify it with the aid of ternary diagrams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Valencia et al. 2007</ref>). We have presented ternary diagrams for a single planet of fixed mass and radius, for a planet composed of an iron core, a silicate mantle, and a water ice outer layer. Our ternary diagram presentation includes observational uncertainties. We have provided a publically available computer code to generate a ternary diagram for a given input mass, radius, and observational uncertainties.</p><p>In addition to presenting ternary diagrams for fixed mass and radius, we showed their origin from a 4D database (M p , R p , iron mass-fraction α, and the silicate mass fraction β; recall that the water-ice mass fraction γ = 1 − α − β). We further described the shape and direction of the composition curves on a ternary diagram .</p><p>We conclude with the sentiment that in order to fully understand the interior structure of an exoplanet, a third measurement beyond planet mass and radius is required. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-The 3D representation of planet mass, planet radius, and composition expressed as mass fractions of iron (α) and silicate (β). The x-axis is the iron mass fraction and the y-axis is the silicate mass fraction. The water mass fraction comes from α + β + γ = 1. The z-axis is the total planet mass in Earth masses. The planet radius is not indicated, except by three separate surfaces of constant radius. An isomass and isoradius surface intersect with a curve in a 2D iron mass-fraction vs. silicate mass fraction Cartesian diagram <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-The Cartesian diagram for silicate mass fraction (β) vs. iron mass fraction (α) for a planet with M p = 4M ⊕ , R p = 1.7R ⊕ (Note that the water mass fraction γ = 0.4 since γ = 1 − α − β.) A planet of a fixed internal composition is represented as a point in the grey shaded region (only compositions in the grey shaded region are allowed.) With a given planet mass and radius there is not a unique interior composition; the allowed compositions are described by the curve. The curve originates from the intersection of the isomass surface and the isoradius surface in the 3D representation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.-A ternary diagram for a planet of the same mass and radius as shown in the corresponding Cartesian diagram in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The light grey x and y axes are shown to illustrate how this ternary diagram relates to a Cartesian diagram; x ternary and y ternary are the coordinates transformed from the Cartesian coordinates. (See § 3.3 for the conversion equations.) Any point on the curve is a possible combination of iron, silicate, and water that will result in a planet with with M p = 4M ⊕ and R p = 1.7R ⊕ . This Figure also illustrates how to read a ternary diagram. Consider a triangle oriented such that the value 1 (of a given material) is at the triangle's apex. The mass fraction of that given material can be read off of a horizontal line that is perpendicular to the line connecting the triangle's apex with the triangle base. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.-A ternary diagram including the mass and radius uncertainties for a planet of a fixed mass and radius. This example is for a planet with M p = 10 ± 0.5M ⊕ and R p = 2 ± 0.1M ⊕ , showing the 1-, 2-and 3-σ uncertainty curves. This Figure shows the continuous distribution of possible combinations of iron, silicate, and water with increasing uncertainties according to the color bar. Notice that considering the 3-σ uncertainties almost the entire ternary diagram is covered-in other words there is no constraint on the planet internal composition. See text for a discussion of the direction and spacing of the curves. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.-Ternary diagrams including 5% mass and radius uncertainties for planets of fixed mass and radius. Panel a) M p = 1 ± 0.05M ⊕ and R p = 1 ± 0.05M ⊕ . Panel b) M p = 2 ± 0.1M ⊕ and R p = 1.5±0.075M ⊕ . Panel c) M p = 8±0.4M ⊕ and R p = 1.5±0.075M ⊕ . Panel d) M p = 16±0.8M ⊕ and R p = 2.5 ± 0.125M ⊕ . See text for a discussion of the direction and spacing of the curves.</p></div>
