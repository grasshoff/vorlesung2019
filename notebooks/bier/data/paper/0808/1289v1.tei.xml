				<p>Observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope provided the first detections of pho-tons from extrasolar planets. Spitzer observations are allowing us to infer the temperature structure , composition, and dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres. The Spitzer studies extend from many hot Jupiters, to the hot Neptune orbiting GJ 436. Here I review the current status of Spitzer secondary eclipse observations, and summarize the results from the viewpoint of what is robust, what needs more work, and what the observations are telling us about the physical nature of exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The powerful astrophysical leverage provided by transits enables us to study extrasolar planets directly, i.e., by detection of their emergent radiation. The Spitzer Space Telescope has provided the bulk of these detections. The first Spitzer measurements of exoplanet secondary eclipses were announced in 2005. Two independent groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Deming et al. 2005</ref>) measured eclipses for two different planets, using two different Spitzer instruments, and obtained very similar results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Since each eclipse was independently measured to ∼ 6σ significance, exoplanet thermal emission was securely detected. The discovery of transits in HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bouchy et al. 2005</ref>) provided an opportunity to measure exoplanet thermal emission at higher signalto-noise ratio. Initial observations of HD 189733b at 16 µm ( ) showed an eclipse of the planet at 32σ significance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>), and subsequent work using the IRAC instrument has detetcted the planet's flux to 60σ precision at 8 µm ( ). This extraordinary level of precision in measuring exoplanet thermal emission allows many intersting studies that could hardly have been imagined when the first extrasolar planets were detected by radial velocity studies.</p><p>In this review I summarize highlights from Spitzer secondary eclipse measurements, with some discussion of transmission spectroscopy during transit. The quality of work in this field has been uniformly high, but I will summarize the results from the viewpoint of what is robust, and what I believe needs more work and clarification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Spectral Energy Distributions from Photometry</head><p>The depth of a planetary eclipse measures the brightness of the planet at that wavelength, in units of the stellar brightness. Combining results from multiple eclipses at different wavelengths allows us to reconstruct the spectral energy distribution of the planet at photometric spectral resolution (typically, λ/δλ ∼ 3). The results are usually shown in 'contrast' units, i.e., planet divided by star, since that is what we actually measure. The contrast amplitude of exoplanet eclipses is greatest at the longest wavelengths.  Eclipse of HD 189733b at 16 µm ( ) .</p><p>In the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, the eclipse amplitude (A λ ) is (Charbonneau 2003):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A λ = (R 2 p /R 2 s )(T p /T s ), (2.1)</formula><p>where (R 2 p /R 2 s ) is the ratio of planet-to-star area, and (T p /T s ) is the ratio of planet-tostar brightness temperature. Assuming that the planet and star resemble blackbodies (a reasonable approximation at the longest wavelengths), then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T p = αT s θ 1/2 , (2.2) Emergent Exoplanet Flux 3</formula><p>where θ is the angular diameter of the star as seen from the planet, and α is a constant that contains the planet's albedo, circulation properties, etc. An important corollary of Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2 is the effect of smaller parent stars (e.g., M-dwarfs). As we proceed down the main sequence, R s and θ decrease, but the exponents imply that the (R 2 p /R 2 s ) term dominates over θ 1/2 . Hence planets orbiting small stars will generally exhibit deeper eclipses, and their emergent flux will be more detectable for that reason. Moreover, the habitable zone moves closer to lower main sequence stars, and the transit probability increases inversely as the planet's orbit radius. This circumstance is a major impetus for finding terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of M-dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charbonneau and Deming, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The time of the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to the eccentricity of the orbit, specifically to e cos ω (Charbonneau 2003). For example, the eclipse of GJ 436b occurs at phase 0.585 ± 0.005 ), more than five hours after the mid-point between transits. Since the eclipse duration is ∼1-hour, the sensitivity of the eclipse time to moderately small eccentricity (e = 0.15 for GJ 436b) is obvious.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Molecular Absorption</head><p>The actual flux from close-in planets will peak near 2 to 5 µm, not at the wavelengths of greatest contrast. Moreover, the shorter infrared (IR) wavelengths are key to inferring the composition and temperature structure of the planet's atmosphere. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the spectrum of HD 189733b, in flux (not contrast) units, from . The IR spectra of hot Jupiters are believed to be shaped predominantly by water absorption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. 2005</ref>), but other molecules such as methane also play a role (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Swain et al. 2008a</ref>), and methane in particular could become more important for cooler planets like GJ 436b. For close-in planets orbiting luminous stars, strong irradiation could flatten the temperature gradient and weaken absorption features in the spectrum at the time of eclipse ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fortney et al. 2006</ref>). Spitzer results from spectroscopy initially suggested that water absorption might not be a prominent feature in eclipse spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grillmair et al. 2007</ref>, see discussion below). However, the HD 189733b results from IRAC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>) are in good accord with Barman's standard model, and provide convincing evidence that water absorption shapes the 2-to 5 µm spectra of at least one hot Jupiter.</p><p>Important observations of transits have also been made using Spitzer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Nutzman et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Agol et al. 2008</ref>), including evidence for water absorption during transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tinetti et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Beaulieu et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ehrenreich et al. (2007)</ref> have suggested that better correction for instrument systematics is needed before we can conclude that water absorption is detected via IRAC photometry during transit. While I believe there is good evidence for water absorption in transit, additional work to better understand Spitzer's instrumental systematics is certainly warranted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Circulation and Dynamics</head><p>Hot Jupiters are believed to rotate synchronously with their orbital period, keeping one side perpetually pointed toward the star. An important question is the degree to which they transport heat to the anti-stellar hemisphere via strong atmospheric circulation. Models of this circulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Showman &amp; Guillot 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Cho et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Cooper and Showman 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Langton and Laughlin 2008</ref> can be checked using Spitzer aroundthe-orbit observations, either made continuously ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>), or via periodic sampling ( ). Observations of two non-transiting hot Jupiters, Ups And b at 24 µm ( ) and HD 179949b at 8 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cowan et al. 2007</ref>) suggested large day-to-night temperature contrasts. Other planets 4 Drake Deming give much lower day-night contrast ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>). One possibility is that the difference for Ups And b is related to the greater formation height of 24 µm radiation. But note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Knutson et al. (2008a)</ref> have observed HD 189733b at 24 µm, and find a result commensurate with their 8 µm results. Another possibility is that these type of phased observations could be affected by a temporary 'hot spot', and would not typically show such a large day-night difference. However, in that case we would also expect greater-than-predicted variability at secondary eclipse for some transiting planets, and even low-level variability has not yet been observed. Spitzer will re-observe Ups And b at 24 µm (B. Hansen, private communication) if the cryogen lasts long enough.</p><p>In addition to close-in planets on circular orbits, Spitzer has great potential to observe the time-dependent heating <ref type="bibr">(Iro &amp; Deming 2008</ref>) for planets on very elliptic orbits. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Laughlin et al. (2008)</ref> observed the flash-heating of HD 80606b at periastron, and Spitzer may be able to make more observations of this type during the warm mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Inverted Temperature Gradients</head><p>Although HD 189733b shows water absorption, and agrees well with standard models, there is evidence that other exoplanets show different atmospheric structures. HD 209458b exhibits an atmospheric temperature inversion (i.e., temperature rises with increasing height). The first hint of this inversion was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. (2007)</ref>, who derived emission features in their eclipse spectrum at relatively 'high' spectral resolution λ/δλ ∼ 100, albeit at low signal-to-noise. Definitive evidence of the inversion comes from the IRAC eclipse measurements by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Knutson et al. (2008b)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the IRAC measurements for both HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref> and HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Knutson et al. 2008b</ref>), compared with models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. (2008)</ref>. In comparing the observations and models on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, I've scaled the models by an arbitrary contrast factor to produce the best fit by eye. This serves to illustrate the nature of these two different exoplanet spectra, but I caution that for the quantitative fits, readers should consult the original papers.</p><p>In addition to IRAC, Spitzer eclipse observations of both planets have been obtained at 16 µm and 24 µm (not plotted). These longer wavelengths are also sensitive to water absorption and atmospheric temperature gradients, but less so than at IRAC wavelengths. When comparing spectral energy distributions for different planets, remember that all four IRAC wavelengths were observed simultaneously only for HD 189733b and HD 209458b. More commonly, due to the nature of the instrument ( <ref type="bibr">Fazio et al. 2005</ref>), eclipses are measured at 3.6 and 5.8 µm simultaneously, and then in another eclipse at 4.5 and 8 µm simultaneously. In principle, variability of the planet's thermal emission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rauscher et al. 2007</ref>) could contaminate the measured spectrum. To date, there is no evidence for variability large enough to produce significant spectrum errors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>The hallmark of an inverted spectrum can be seen by comparing 5.8 and 8.0 µm measurements, as well as comparing 3.6 and 4.5 µm. The inverted atmosphere has a higher 5.8 µm flux than 8.0 µm, because 5.8 µm has high opacity due to water vapor, and the water bands are present in emission. In the non-inverted atmosphere the 3.6 µm flux is elevated because the lesser opacity at this wavelength allows planet flux to well up from the deeper atmosphere, where temperatures are higher. The non-inverted 4.5 µm band shows lower flux because water and CO opacity cause the radiation to be emitted from higher layers of the atmosphere, where the temperature is lower. The inverted atmosphere may have a high altitude absorbing layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. 2008)</ref>, and this raises the temperature at the 4.5 µm height, and lowers it at the 3.6 µm height, reversing the relative magnitudes of the emergent fluxes.</p><p>An open question is the physical cause of the inversion, and whether this is a common phenomenon in hot Jupiter atmospheres. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burrows et al. (2008)</ref> attribute the inversion to the presence of a high altitude optical absorbing layer, but the composition and origin of this layer are unknown. Doubtless the high level of stellar irradiation that hot Jupiters experience plays a major role in inverting the temperature gradient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> define two classes of hot Jupiters depending on whether the stellar irradiation drives the formation of a hot stratosphere (i.e., region of higher temperature) via TiO/VO absorption. TiO and VO have bands in the optical where stellar fluxes are high, and have been implicated in perturbations to exoplanet atmospheric temperature structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hubeny et al. 2003</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows many of the known exoplanets in mass vs. irradiance space, with the predicted boundary between the pM class (stratospheres) and pL class (no stratospheres) indicated. I have circled the three planets that are known or strongly suspected to have inverted temperature gradients. Besides HD 209458b, HD 149026b is believed to have a hot stratosphere on the basis of the very high brightness temperature at 8 µm ( . Recently, XO-1b was found to have an inverted gradient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Machalek et al. 2008</ref>). Although XO-1b is predicted to be pL class, it is at the upper range of that class, so there is no firm counterexample to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2008</ref>) and TrES-4 ( <ref type="bibr">Knutson et al. 2008c</ref>), and Spitzer data for several other planets are under analysis. Hence we should soon learn how well the curent pM/pL classification theory corresponds to reality. </p><note type="other">theory at this point. During this conference, new information is becoming available on TrES-2 (O'</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">A Hot Neptune</head><p>Spitzer secondary eclipse observations extend down to the hot Neptune orbiting GJ 436 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Deming et al. 2007a</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows this eclipse at 8 µm. The inferred brightness temperature (712 ± 36K) is modestly above the predicted brightness temperature for thermal equilibrium with the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Deming et al. 2007a</ref>), but the uncertainties are relatively large. Additional Spitzer eclipse observations were recently made at at 8-and 24 µm (J. Harrington, private communication) and 'around-the-orbit' observations (by <ref type="bibr">Knutson et al.)</ref> are pending. The totality of Spitzer observations may be sufficient to define the total luminosity of the planet, and thereby determine whether it emits significant energy due to tidal dissipation in its moderately eccentric orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Spectroscopy</head><p>Spitzer secondary eclipse observations have been extended to spectroscopy as well as photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grillmair et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Swain et al. 2008b</ref>). The principle of these measurements is simple. Suppose that an absorption (emission) feature occurs in the planets atmosphere at a given wavelength. Then the depth of the eclipse at that wavelength will be smaller (larger) than at other wavelengths. Hence the emergent Emergent Exoplanet Flux spectrum of the planet can be constructed from the wavelength dependence of the eclipse depth. In practice, this is a much more difficult observation than Spitzer photometry, for two reasons. First, there are many fewer photons per wavelength channel because the light is dispersed, so the signal-to-noise ratio is lower than for photometry. Second, spectroscopy is more affected by instrument systematic effects, as discussed below. In spite of these difficulties, the results are of great interest. Two exoplanets are sufficiently bright to make Spitzer spectroscopy practical: HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grillmair et al. 2007)</ref>, and HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Swain et al. 2008b</ref>). The initial results indicated that these spectra were remarkably flat from ∼ 7 to ∼ 13 µm, not showing absorption due to water vapor that was expected shortward of ∼ 8 µm. However, additional spectroscopy of HD 189733b (Grillmair, private communication) agrees very well with Spitzer photometry and with model atmosphere predictions. HD 209468b having an inverted temperature gradient is consistent with the flatness observed in the spectrum by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. (2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grillmair et al. (2007)</ref> did not find evidence for discrete spectral absorption/emission features in the spectrum of HD 189733b, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. (2007)</ref> concluded that the spectrum of HD 209458b contained two discrete features, both present in emission. Near 9.8 µm they found evidence for a relatively broad emission bump that they attributed to the Si-O stretching resonance, and at 7.78 µm they find a sharp emission feature that may be due to a C-C stretching resonance. To illustrate these results, I've re-analyzed the Richardson et al. data, using a similar method, and this result is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. These data have also been analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Swain et al. (2008b)</ref>, using an entirely different method. Swain et al. find emission near 7.8 µm, but not at 9.8 µm. This difference in 8 Drake Deming <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Spectrum of HD 209458b, derived using an analysis very similar to , based on two eclipses (different symbols). The two emission features evident in the spectrum are a broad bump near 9.8 µm that Richardson et al. attribute to silicate clouds, and a sharp emission feature at 7.78 µm possibly due to a C-C stretching resonance.</p><p>results seems consistent with the nature of the systematic effects in the IRS instrument: broad features (9.8 µm) are more sensitive to the way the instrument systematics are treated in the analysis, whereas sharp features (7.8 µm) are insensitive to the analysis method. It is important to optimize the spectroscopic eclipse technique, so that we can use it with JWST to measure the spectra of potentially habitable planets transiting M-dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charbonneau and Deming, 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Spitzer Instrument Systematics</head><p>Spitzer observations have proven to be a remarkably stable and sensitive way to measure exoplanet thermal emission. Spitzer exoplanet aperture photometry (for λ 8 µm) achieves noise levels closely approaching the photon noise limit, and the errors average down as the inverse square root of exposure time. For the longer Spitzer wavelengths, where the zodiacal thermal background is significant, the most precise photometry often requires PSF-weighted optimal photometry, depending on the brightness of the star. Unlike ground-based photometry, it is generally not necessary to use 'comparison stars' with Spitzer. In fact, it can even be detrimental to rely on comparison stars, because Spitzer does have instrument systematic effects that could vary with position on the detector. There are several effects that are currently recognized and accounted for in Spitzer analyses, and most of them are now described in the Spitzer instrument documentation. The ones most relevant to exoplanet eclipses are:</p><p>The Ramp. Photometry at 8-and 16 µm exhibits a gradually increasing intensity, equivalent to an increasing gain in the instrument response. This apparent gain increase is flux-dependent: bright sources reach maxmium intensity more rapidly than faint sources. This so-called 'ramp' ) is obvious in the top panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref> hypothesize that it is due to charge-trapping, which is (so far) the most promising hypothesis. Note that the ramp is not simply due to build-up of a latent image, since none is present when the telescope is nodded ( ). In the charge-trapping hypothesis, the first electrons generated by photons are captured by ionized impurites in the detector material, and do not contribute to the signal on Emergent Exoplanet Flux 9 the observed time scale. As the detector is exposed to additional radiation, the charge traps saturate, and the signal readout reaches an asymptotic level. This explanation is broadly consistent with the known characteristics of the ramp, with some exceptions. Observations at 5.8 µm can exhibit a 'negative' ramp, i.e. a decreasing intensity with time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Machalek et al. 2008)</ref>, and no ramp is seen in 24 µm photometry (Knutson and Charbonneau, private communication). The existence of decreasing, as well as increasing, ramps suggests a complex phenomenon that may depend on the gate and bias voltages applied to the detector. The lack of a ramp at 24 µm may be due to the fact that the relatively large zodiacal background at this wavelength keeps the ramp perpetually at its maximum value, but the zodiacal background is also strong for 16 µm photometry, which does exhibit a prominent ramp ( ). Spectroscopy using IRS also exhibits a ramp, at least when obtaining spectroscopy at 7-14 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The ramp is a relatively benign effect for eclipse photometry of bright and high-contrast systems. The time scale for the ramp to reach its maximum value is significantly longer than the duration of an eclipse, so it's essentially a baseline effect that is included when fitting to the eclipse depth. But the ramp is more problematic for fainter and low-contrast systems because small uncertainties in the ramp curvature become significant relative to the eclipse depth. The ramp is also problematic for 'around-the-orbit' observations where the planet signal will vary on a longer time scale. One promising approach for this type of observation is to 'pre-flash' the detector by exposing it to a bright source immediately prior to the exoplanet observations. This saturates the ramp before the exoplanet is observed; preliminary examination of observations using a pre-flash (H. <ref type="bibr">Knutson, private communication)</ref> suggest that the technique is largely successful.</p><p>Pixel Phase. The pixels in the IRAC detectors are more responsive when stellar images are centered on the pixels than when they lie near the edges, and this is called the pixel phase effect. One exception to this is very bright stars that are near saturation. Detector non-linearity can produce a lower signal when very bright stars are centered on a given pixel, but this circumstance is normally avoided by using shorter integration times. The pixel phase effect is ubiquitous in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm channels of IRAC, and may be present to a much lesser degree at 5.8-and 8 µm. Because there is pointing jitter in the telescope (∼ tens of milli-arcsec), the pixel phase effect leads to a variable intensity when performing aperture photometry. This is corrected in eclipse data by decorrelating the intensity versus distance from pixel center (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Charbonneau et al. , 2008</ref>. Pixel phase is also normally decorrelated from photometry performed for other Spitzer research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Morales-Calderon et al. 2006</ref>), not just exoplanet photometry.</p><p>Spectroscopic Slit Losses. The IRS spectrometer <ref type="bibr">(Houck et al. 2005</ref>) has light losses at its entrance slit, like most astronomical slit spectrometers. Diffraction causes stellar images at the slit to increase in size proportional to wavelength, so the slit losses increase with wavelength also. Because there is telescope pointing jitter on a time scale of ∼ 1 hour, and possibly on longer times scales, the intensity in a stellar spectrum will vary slightly with both wavelength and time. Even a slight variation in the measured stellar spectrum distorts the spectra that are inferred for exoplanets using the eclipse technique. There is no robust and independent method to ascertain the exact telescope pointing for a given spectrum. Hence exoplanet observers correct for this distortion in different ways ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Swain et al. 2008b</ref>). Because the effect varies slowly with wavelength, it primarily affects broad features in exoplanet spectra, not sharp features like the 7.8 µm emission inferred in HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Richardson et al. 2007</ref>, and <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. Hence the appearance of broad features (like the 9.8 µm peak on <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>), and indeed their reality in exoplanet spectra, can depend on the method used to analyze the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Tabular Summary of the Spitzer Results</head><p>The legacy of exoplanet science from cryogenic Spitzer has already revolutionized exoplanet science, but has not yet reached full fruition. The results are of uniformly high quality, but the observations are not easy. The table in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> summarizes my personal opinion as to which of the Spitzer results are already robust, and which aspects need clarification by additional work.  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Tabular summary of the Spitzer results, categorized by results that are already robust, and those where more work is needed.
