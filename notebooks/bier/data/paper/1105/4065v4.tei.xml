				<p>Improving upon our purely dynamical work, we present three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheric circulation on Earth-like (exo)planets and hot Jupiters using the GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS). As the first steps away from the dynamical benchmarks of Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011), we add dual-band radiative transfer and dry convective adjustment schemes to our computational setup. Our treatment of radiative transfer assumes stellar irradiation to peak at a wavelength shorter than and distinct from that at which the exoplanet re-emits radiation (&quot;shortwave&quot; versus &quot;longwave&quot;), and also uses a two-stream approximation. Convection is mimicked by adjusting unstable lapse rates to the dry adiabat. The bottom of the atmosphere is bounded by a uniform slab with a finite thermal inertia. For our models of hot Jupiters, we include an analytical formalism for calculating temperature-pressure profiles, in radiative equilibrium, which accounts for the effect of collision-induced absorption via a single parameter. We discuss our results within the context of: the predicted temperature-pressure profiles and the absence/presence of a temperature inversion; the possible maintenance, via atmospheric circulation, of the putative high-altitude, shortwave ab-sorber expected to produce these inversions; the angular/temporal offset of the hot spot from the substellar point, its robustness to our ignorance of hyperviscosity and hence its utility in distinguishing between different hot Jovian atmospheres; and various zonal-mean flow quantities. Our work bridges the gap between three-dimensional simulations which are purely dy-namical and those which incorporate multi-band radiative transfer, thus contributing to the construction of a required hierarchy of three-dimensional theoretical models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Much of the previous research on three-dimensional simulations of exoplanetary atmospheric circulation has focused on the atmospheric dynamics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cooper &amp; Showman 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Koskinen et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Showman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dobbs-Dixon, Cumming &amp; Lin 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thrastarson &amp; Cho 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011</ref>), while others ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Selsis, Wordsworth &amp; Forget 2011</ref>) have developed sophisticated schemes which combine dynamics with multi-band radiative transfer. Despite making progress, our understanding of atmospheric circulation on extrasolar planets (or "exoplanets") remains incomplete. To move forward, we need to construct a hierarchy of three-dimensional simulations of varying sophistication, so as to elucidate the isolated effects of various pieces of physics as well as the complex interplay between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Peixóto &amp; Oort 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Held 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pierrehumbert 2010</ref>). The purpose of the present study is to bridge the gap between these two bodies of work by elucidating the details of a computational setup of intermediate sophistication, so as to serve as a foundation for future work. Our work may be partially regarded as the three-dimensional generalizations of Hubeny, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Burrows &amp; Sudarsky (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hansen (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guillot (2010)</ref>.</p><p>As natural extensions to purely dynamical simulation work, the effects of radiative transfer and convection need to be considered. As a first step in adding radiative transfer, we simplify the treatment by assuming that most of the stellar emission peaks at a wavelength which is shorter than and distinct from that at which the exoplanet re-radiates the absorbed heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hansen 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Langton &amp; Laughlin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guillot 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pierrehumbert 2010)</ref>. For example, the Sun-like host star of an exoplanet has an emission spectrum which peaks in the optical, since λ⋆,max ≈ 0.5 µm T⋆ 6000 K −1 (1) using Wien's law, where T⋆ is the effective temperature of the star. For M stars (red dwarfs), the stellar spectrum instead peaks at λ⋆,max 0.8 µm (3700 K/T⋆). The equilibrium or effective temperature of the exoplanet is 1</p><p>Teq ∼ 1300</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K T⋆ 6000 K R⋆ R⊙ 1/2 a 0.05 AU −1/2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R⋆ is the stellar radius and a denotes the spatial separation between the star and the exoplanet. As the stellar photons travel downward into the atmosphere, they are eventually absorbed and re-emitted. The emission spectrum of an exoplanet is expected to peak in the infrared, since λp,max ∼ 2.2 µm T⋆ 6000</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K −1 R⋆ R⊙ −1/2 a 0.05 AU 1/2 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Thus, to a first approximation one can regard the star as emitting "shortwave" radiation onto the exoplanet, which then re-emits in the infrared ("longwave"). The conversion of a shortwave photon into multiple longwave photons serves to increase entropy. Our treatment of the radiative transfer then requires the specification of the shortwave (τS) and longwave (τL) optical depths, as well as the flux associated with stellar irradiation (F ↓ S ). Also as a first step, we mimic convection by adjusting unstable atmospheric lapse rates to the stable dry adiabat <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Manabe, Smagorinsky &amp; Strickler 1965)</ref>. The key advantages of our simpler setup, compared to simulations with multi-band radiative transfer, are that it allows for a more efficient sampling of parameter space and clean comparisons to analytical models. In §2, we describe our computational setup, including our schemes for stellar irradiation, shortwave/longwave absorption, radiative transfer and convection. Prior to simulating the atmospheric circulation on hot Jupiters, we test our computational setup using Earth-like models ( §3). In §4, we describe our method for simulating hot Jovian atmospheres -including an analytical formalism for calculating temperature-pressure profiles which includes the effect of collision-induced absorption -and examine results from several models based on the values of parameters appropriate to HD 209458b. The implications of our results, as well as a concise summary of the present study, are discussed in §5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the list of adopted parameter values as well as the commonly-used symbols. Appendix A contains the technical details of the atmospheric boundary layer scheme used only for our Earth-like models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE GFDL-PRINCETON FLEXIBLE MODELING SYSTEM</head><p>In this section, we describe our computational setup, which is based on the Lima release of the FMS, developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) at Princeton University <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gordon &amp; Stern 1982)</ref>. As the FMS is set up to work in MKS (metres, kilogrammes and seconds) units, most of the discussion will follow suit. Unless specified otherwise, the term "day" refers to an Earth day (exactly 86400 s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dynamics</head><p>We implement the spectral dynamical core, which solves the three-dimensional primitive equations of meteorology -these equations assume hydrostatic equilibrium and other consistent approximations such as a small aspect ratio for the atmosphere (e.g., see Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011 and references therein). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Held &amp; Suarez (1994)</ref> originally proposed the comparison of purely dynamical simulations with simplified thermal forcing and performed via different methods of solutions, known as the "Held-Suarez benchmark" for Earth. Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref> extended the Held-Suarez benchmark to tidally-locked exoplanets by examining three additional cases: a hypothetical exo-Earth, a shallow model for hot Jupiters and a deep model of HD 209458b. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The spectral and finite difference (B-grid) dynamical cores of the FMS were both subjected to these tests. In the case of the deep model of HD 209458b, the predictions for the wind speeds are found to depend upon the chosen magnitude of the hyperviscosity, although the qualitative features of the simulated wind and temperature maps remain largely invariant.</p><p>Within the spectral dynamical core, the (linear) fluid dynamical quantities are expressed as a truncated sum N h of spherical harmonics -the larger the value of N h , the higher the horizontal resolution. The fiducial resolution we will adopt in the present study is T63LNv (N h = 63), which corresponds to a horizontal grid of 192 by 96 points in longitude versus latitude. (See <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> of Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Φ latitude degrees -90 • -90 • -90 • -90 • Θ longitude degrees 0-360 • 0-360 • Γ 0 ≡ gp/c P dry adiabatic lapse rate K km −1 ≈ 9.8 ≈ 0.7 θ T potential temperature K ≈ 300-500 ∼ 10 3 -10 5 Ψ</formula><p>Eulerian mean streamfunction kg s −1 ∼ 10 8 -10 10 ∼ 10 13 -10 15 †: expressed in terms of a (exo)planetary day (i.e., rotational period). ‡: we term κ the "adiabatic coefficient", following <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pierrehumbert (2010)</ref>, and avoid calling it the "adiabatic index" in order to not confuse it with the ratio of specific heat capacities. Note: one "Earth day" is exactly 86400 s (as used in the text and simulation/analysis codes).</p><p>2011 for a list of N h and their corresponding horizontal resolutions.) A finite difference solver with Nv grid points is used for the vertical coordinate, which is cast in terms of the "σ-coordinate" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Phillips 1957)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">σ ≡ P Ps ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P denotes the vertical pressure and Ps is the time-dependent pressure at the surface. By contrast, the reference pressure at the bottom of the simulation domain, P0, is a constant. Analogous to σ, we define σ0 ≡ P/P0. For Earth-like simulations, the reference pressure is usually set to P0 = 1 bar = 10 5 Pa = 10 6 dyn cm −2 .</p><p>Numerical noise accumulates at the grid scale and has to be damped via a "hyperviscous" term with a damping order of nν = 4, such that the operator ∇ 2nν acts on the relative vorticity (see §3.1 of Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011). The pragmatic aim is to apply horizontal dissipation on a time scale tν that is a small fraction of an exoplanetary day. For example, in the Held-Suarez benchmark for Earth, the adopted time scale is tν ≈ 0.1 Earth day. For our hot Jupiter simulations, we use tν ≈ 10 −5 HD 209458b day, consistent with the value used in Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>; this is also, to within an order of magnitude, the highest value needed. It is important to keep in mind that the application of hyperviscosity and the specification of tν is unsupported by any fundamental theory -horizontal dissipation is solely a numerical tool meant to prevent a simulation from failing due to spectral blocking.</p><p>As in Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>, the simulations are started from an initial state of windless isothermality with Tinit denoting the initial temperature, in contrast to using initial temperature-pressure profiles obtained from one-dimensional radiative-convective calculations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dobbs-Dixon, Cumming &amp; Lin 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis et al. 2010</ref>). The possible dependence of our results on more exotic initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Thrastarson &amp; Cho 2010</ref>) is deferred to a future study. There is an initialization period for each simulation which we disregard, during which the temperatures and velocities, averaged over the entire (exo)planet, are decreasing/increasing from some initial values to their quasi-steady values. For Earth-like simulations, we find the initialization period to be 200 days. For hot Jupiters, a longer initialization period of 500 days is needed. After quasi-equilibrium is attained, we execute the simulations for a further 1000 days and 4 Heng, Frierson &amp; Phillipps temporally average the ouput. Minor asymmetries in the physical quantities between the northern and southern hemispheres are artifacts of averaging over a finite period of time (i.e., in this case, 1000 days).</p></div>

Since hot Jupiters orbit at distances a ∼ 10 R⋆ from their host stars, we have F0 ≈ 6.4 × 10 5 W m −2 for R⋆ = R⊙. By contrast, we have F0 ≈ 51 W m −2 for Jupiter, which is a factor ∼ 10 4 less than for hot Jupiters. In the case of HD 209458b, we use the values of R⋆, a and T⋆ measured or inferred by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mazeh et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown et al. (2001)</ref> to obtain the value shown in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref>; we note that a/R⋆ ≈ 9. In general, the influence of the stellar irradiation on a (exo)planet and its dependence on geometry (through G) is known as the "thermal forcing". The shortwave optical depth τS determines how the stellar irradiation is absorbed as it travels downward into the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frierson 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">O'Gorman &amp; Schneider 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τS = τS 0 σ n S 0 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Specifying the power law index as nS = 1 is equivalent to having a uniformly mixed shortwave absorber, since <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guillot 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heng et al. 2011b</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">τS = κSP gp = 10 3 κS 0.01 cm 2 g −1 P 100 bar gp 10 m s −1 −1 (8)</formula><p>where κS is the shortwave opacity and gp is the surface gravity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Radiative transfer and longwave absorption</head><p>The radiative transfer scheme is based on the two-stream approximation <ref type="bibr">(Mihalas 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hansen 2008)</ref>, which assumes that the radiation can be separated into longwave, upward-(F ↑ L ) and downward-propagating (F ↓ L ) fluxes (see §4.2 of Pierrehumbert 2010),</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">dF ↑ L dτL = F ↑ L − F bb , dF ↓ L dτL = −F ↓ L + F bb ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where F bb = σSBT 4 is the blackbody flux.

The shortwave, upwardpropagating flux is assumed to be zero, i.e., F ↑ S = 0. Furthermore, substituting the Newtonian relaxation scheme for the dual-band radiative transfer scheme alleviates the need to rely on one-dimensional radiative-convective models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Iro, Bézard &amp; Guillot 2005</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ramanathan &amp; Coakley 1978</ref>) for calculations of the equilibrium temperature-pressure profile, thereby allowing self-consistency to be achieved. From the perspective of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(10)</ref> alone, the radiative transfer scheme is strictly speaking grey (as already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006</ref>) -the shortwave, downward-propagating flux is merely diluted on its way down into the atmosphere via equation (9) -but we term it "dual-band" to emphasize the dual-wavelength nature of our treatment. The effects of scattering are neglected.</p><p>The bottom of the atmosphere (or the "surface") is an idealized slab with a specifiable heat capacity, described by a single temperature Ts governed by the equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Cint ∂Ts ∂t = F ↓ S + F ↓ L − F ↑ L ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where Cint is the (areal) heat capacity of the slab. Horizontal transport of fluid within the slab is not modelled. In the (terrestrial) atmospheric sciences literature, this idealized slab mimics the "mixed layer ocean", which is the ∼ 100 m-thick layer of ocean intermediate between the atmosphere and the deep ocean, characterized by rigorous mixing induced by wave motion and turbulence. For simplicity, we do not implement an internal heat flux, typically parametrized by the equivalent blackbody temperature Tint. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Iro, Bézard &amp; Guillot (2005)</ref> and Guillot (2010) use Tint = 100, 300 K in their models of HD 209458b, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref> adopt 5.7 W m −2 as the internal heat flux in their simulation of Jupiter (which is equivalent to Tint ≈ 100 K).</p><p>As the radiation is absorbed and re-emitted, the (infrared) photons encounter a longwave optical depth near the surface, described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">τL 0 = τL eq + τL pole − τL eq sin 2 Φ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where the longwave optical depths at the equator and the poles are given by τL eq and τL poles , respectively. As already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Merlis &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref>, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(13)</ref> ignores the longitudinal dependence of τL 0 introduced by water vapour feedback and is thus inadequate for treating tidally locked, Earth-like aquaplanets. Throughout the vertical extent of the atmosphere, the longwave optical depth is a linear combination of well-mixed and segregated atmospheric absorbers,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">τL = τL w σ0 + τL s σ n L 0 ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where τL w and τL s generally depend on geometry (i.e., Φ and Θ) as well as atmospheric chemistry. The second term in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref> represents species of absorbers where the associated pressure scale height is 1/nL that of the well-mixed species. For example, the linear term may represent well-mixed species like carbon dioxide, while setting nL = 4 approximates the structure of water vapour in the terrestrial atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">τL w = τL 0 f l , τL s = τL 0 (1 − f l ) ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>with f l being a dimensionless parameter that controls the strength of the well-mixed longwave absorber. In Frierson, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor (2006</ref>, Frierson (2007a) and O <ref type="bibr">'Gorman &amp; Schneider (2008)</ref>, a key assumption is that the (water) moisture content does not affect radiative transfer, such that the dynamical effects of the latent heat release associated with the condensation of water vapour can be isolated from its radiative effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Merlis &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref> improved upon this treatment by allowing the optical depth associated with water vapour (τL s ; nL = 4) to depend on the instantaneous column density, thereby providing a simple treatment of water vapour feedback. Since we are concerned only with dry atmospheres in the present study, we will ignore this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Convection</head><p>In simulations of atmospheric circulation, convection is typically mimicked using simplified parametrizations known as "convective adjustment" schemes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Manabe, Smagorinsky &amp; Strickler 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">§3.6.9 of Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005)</ref>. For a dry atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium, the change in temperature of a parcel of atmosphere resulting from vertical motion is (e.g., §2.7.2 of Holton 2004) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> 1 θT</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">∂θT ∂z = 1 T (Γ0 − Γ) ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where the lapse rate is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Γ ≡ − ∂T ∂z ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>with z being the vertical spatial coordinate, and the dry adiabatic lapse rate is Γ0 ≡ gp/cP , which has a value of about 9.8 K km −1 for the terrestrial atmosphere. The potential temperature,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">θT ≡ T σ −κ 0 ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where κ ≡ R/cP and R is the ideal gas constant, is the temperature a parcel of atmosphere would have if it was compressed or expanded adiabatically from the pressure P to the reference pressure P0 at the bottom of the simulation domain. The adiabatic coefficient κ is related to the number of degrees of freedom of the atmospheric gas n dof : κ = 2/(n dof +2) (see §2.3.3 of Pierrehumbert 2010). For example, molecular hydrogen is experimentally found to have n dof ≈ 5.2, close to the theoretical value for a diatomic gas (n dof = 5). The atmosphere is unstable if Γ &gt; Γ0 (i.e., super-adiabatic lapse rates). 5 When the lapse rate is adjusted to a state of stability -subjected to the constraint of total energy conservation -convective adjustment is said to be performed. In other words, the tendency of convection is to minimize the magnitude of the potential temperature gradient ∂θT/∂z and convective adjustment is an approximate way to mimic this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ramanathan &amp; Coakley 1978)</ref>. Within the FMS, the dry convective adjustment scheme follows the prescription of Manabe, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smagorinsky &amp; Strickler (1965)</ref>. At a given time, the temperature difference δT resulting from departures from the adiabatic lapse rate is computed,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">∂θT ∂P = 0, cP gp δT dP = 0,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where the integral is taken over the vertical extent of the unstable, model atmosphere layer. An implicit assumption made is that when the lapse rate of a layer is super-adiabatic, convection is rigorous enough to maintain a neutral lapse rate of potential temperature. The kinetic energy created by convection is then dissipated and instantly converted into heat, such that the total potential energy is invariant to convective adjustment. Within each model layer, the temperature is then adjusted by δT . It is worth noting that there exists a body of work on moist convective adjustment schemes, largely motivated by the pioneering work of Manabe, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smagorinsky &amp; Strickler (1965)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Betts (1986)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Betts &amp; Miller (1986)</ref>, who proposed the convective adjustment to reference temperature and humidity profiles instead of Γ0. Frierson (2007a) adopted a simplified version of the Betts-Miller scheme, where the reference humidity profile is held at a constant threshold value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Atmospheric boundary layer</head><p>The boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere where the flow is strongly influenced by interaction with the surface. It can be thought of as enforcing a "no slip" boundary condition, such that large velocity gradients -and hence shears -exist across a small vertical height, which induces turbulent mixing (e.g., §5 of Holton 2004). The boundary layer may become convectively unstable, which induces mixing. The end result is the same: eddies are produced which are smaller in size than those resulting from large-scale rotational flows, are typically unresolved in global simulations of atmospheric circulation and thus need to be accounted for using sub-grid models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Troen &amp; Mahrt 1986)</ref>. In other words, turbulence within the boundary layer may be driven mechanically or via buoyancy. The eddies tend to have comparable horizontal and vertical length scales -i.e., they are effectively three-dimensional -and are responsible for heat and momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface. Consequently, the boundary layer affects the dynamics and thermodynamics of the terrestrial atmosphere and is responsible for a non-negligible fraction of kinetic energy loss by the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Garratt 1994)</ref>. On Earth, the height of the boundary layer is ∼ 30-3000 m and contains ∼ 10% of the mass of the terrestrial atmosphere.</p><p>We find that the boundary layer scheme is needed if the bottom of the simulation domain is placed within the active part of the atmosphere, such as in an Earth-like simulation. However, this scheme is not required to successfully execute hot Jupiter simulations. Moreover, it is not entirely clear if the analogy with a terrestrial boundary layer can be carried over to mimic drag in the deep, inert layers of a hot Jupiter. As such, although we include a description of our boundary layer scheme for completeness (since it is used for our Earthlike simulations), we relegate the technical details to Appendix A. As described therein, our atmospheric boundary layer scheme requires the specification of four additional parameters: the roughness length z rough , the critical bulk Richardson number Ri,crit, the von Kármán constant κvK and the surface layer fraction f b .</p></div>

It is worth noting that the presence of vertical motions due to atmospheric circulation does not violate the assumption of hydrostatic balance provided the vertical accelerations are small compared to the acceleration due to gravity (see §2.5 of Pierrehumbert 2010).</p><p>In Figures 6, 8, 12 and 14, we opt to split up the Eulerian mean streamfunction into the day and night sides of the exoplanet. Strictly speaking, this implies that our use of the word "streamfunction" to describe the relevant panels in these figures becomes invalid, since streamfunctions are normally associated with circulations which are non-divergent in the plane being considered -an integration over all longitudes is strictly required. However, our intention is to capture the differences between the atmospheric circulation on the day and night sides of a tidally locked exoplanet. The reader should therefore be mindful of the way we use the term "streamfunction" in these figures. </p></div>

The seasonal cycle of insolation 6 is not considered, meaning the exoplanet is implicitly assumed to reside on an orbit with zero eccentricity and obliquity. As an aside, we note that solar irradiation has been inferred to vary over much longer time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berger &amp; Loutre 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crowley 2000)</ref>. Other parameter values are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and are largely adopted from Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor (2006) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frierson (2007a)</ref>.</p><p>A key difference between the Held-Suarez model and our dry Earth-like model is that the radiative equilibrium of the latter is strongly unstable to convection. Preliminary simulations without the boundary layer scheme ( §2.5) implemented fail, suggesting that models in which the surface is located within the active -as opposed to inert -part of the atmosphere require a scheme to establish heat and momentum equilibrium between the atmosphere and the surface. This expectation is borne out in our hot Jupiter simulations ( §4) -where the surface is located at P ∼ 100 bar, well into the inert part of the atmosphere -which do not require the boundary layer scheme to run to completion. We therefore include the boundary layer schemes only in our Earth-like models.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, we show the temporally-and zonally-averaged profiles of zonal wind and temperature as functions of the vertical pressure P and the latitude Φ, which we term the "Held-Suarez mean flow quantities" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Held &amp; Suarez 1994)</ref>. For comparison, we include the HeldSuarez dynamical benchmark, as computed by Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>. In the trio of simulations, the jet streams in the upper troposphere (P ≈ 0.3-0.4 bar), at mid-latitudes, are clearly evident. There are quantitative differences between each of the temperature profiles, but the general trends are that the temperature decreases away from the equator and also with increasing altitude.</p><p>More insight on the convective stability of the model atmospheres may be gleaned by examining the temporally-and zonally-averaged potential temperature profiles, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The potential temperature may be regarded as the "height-adjusted" temperature <ref type="bibr">( §III of Peixóto &amp; Oort 1984)</ref>. If it monotonically increases with height and does not depend on latitude, its structure is termed "barotropic". In this case, no convection occurs. If there is a gradient in the potential temperature across latitude, then its structure is said to be "baroclinic". In such situations, horizontal or "slanted" convective motions occur. Tapping into the available potential energy of the atmosphere (Lorenz 1955), the baroclinic eddies resulting from these motions are responsible for transporting sensible heat from the equator to the poles <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pierrehumbert &amp; Swanson 1995)</ref>. The stratosphere and troposphere are thus regions of the atmosphere where the potential temperature structure is (largely) barotropic and baroclinic, respectively, at least within the temporally-and zonally-averaged context of our models. In reality, the terrestrial stratosphere is not strictly barotropic -along isobars, there are distinctly non-zero variations of temperature with latitude which are dynamically important. The height or vertical pressure at which the troposphere transitions into the stratosphere is the tropopause (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> of Frierson 2007a), located at P ≈ 0.2 bar near the equator (the tropics) and P ≈ 0.3-0.4 bar otherwise (the temperate and polar regions).</p><p>The middle row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the simulation with radiative transfer but without convective adjustment. Unlike in the Held-Suarez benchmark, the existence of a surface with a finite heat capacity (see §2.3) and its heating by solar irradiation (see §2.2) results in convectively unstable vertical columns, thus necessitating the treatment of convection. The bottom row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> demonstrates how the dry convective adjustment scheme (see §2.4) brings the model atmosphere to convective stability in the vertical direction, while preserving the baroclinic instabilities (i.e., horizontal convection) produced in the simulation. Essentially, the role of convective adjustment is to straighten the isentropes such that they are vertically stable. Atmospheric circulation of the terrestrial atmosphere can be generally regarded as having a three-cell structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Peixóto &amp; Oort 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">§2.1.5 of Washington &amp; Parkinson 2005)</ref>. The Hadley and polar cells, located near the equator and poles, respectively, are direct circulation cells because they are driven by heating and cooling patterns of the Earth's surface. Both cells are characterized by rising air in their warmer branches. By contrast, the mid-latitudinal Ferrel cells are indirect because they are driven by the presence of baroclinic eddies; cooler air is forced to rise. The presence of these cells may be revealed by examining the Eulerian mean streamfunction Ψ (e.g., Frierson 2007a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Merlis &amp; Schneider 2010)</ref>, as defined in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21)</ref>. The Held-Suarez benchmark, which mimics heating and cooling patterns by forcing the temperature field to relax to an ad hoc "equilibrium temperature" profile on a specified "cooling" time scale, manages to produce the Hadley, Ferrel and polar circulation cells, although the circulation associated with the Ferrel cells is too strong by a factor of two (top right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). As observed on Earth, the polar cells are relatively weak with Ψ having values about an order of magnitude lower than for the other two cells. The simulations with dual-band radiation (middle right and bottom right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) manage to only produce the Hadley and Ferrel cells; there is a pair of cells near the poles, but they reside only at low altitudes (P ≈ 0.9-1 bar). The absence of the polar cells in our simulations and also those of Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor (2006) is unsurprising since the details concerning the polar temperatures (e.g., sea ice, the presence of Antarctica) are not modelled. The Hadley cell is significantly too strong in the dual-band simulation due to the near-neutral convective stability in the tropics, while the Ferrel cell is confined to only high altitudes due to the presence of convective momentum fluxes in the lower troposphere (see Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006 for more details) -these issues are ameliorated in simulations with moisture. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the globally-averaged temperature-pressure profiles for the trio of simulations. By construction, the Held-Suarez benchmark does not produce the temperature inversion empirically observed in the stratosphere, since the stratospheric temperature is set to be constant in this model. There are slight differences between the T -P profiles for the simulations with and without convective adjustment, where the latter model produces a small temperature inversion in the stratosphere.</p><p>Our dry model neglects the fact that the terrestrial tropospheric temperature profile is strongly influenced by latent heat release from the condensation of water vapour. In the tropics, the temperatures are approximately moist adiabatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Xu &amp; Emanuel 1989)</ref>, while in the extratropics they are determined by a coupling between latent heat release and baroclinic eddies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006</ref>) with additional contributions from the land-sea contrast. On average, these factors assure that the tropospheric lapse rate on Earth is less than the dry adiabatic value.</p><p>In summary, we have generalized our Earth-like model away from the purely dynamical Held-Suarez benchmark and demonstrated the utility of examining profiles of the potential temperature and Eulerian mean streamfunction. We have also demonstrated the necessity of including the treatment of convection alongside radiative transfer, at least for our Earth-like models. We next extend the same simulation and analysis techniques to a hypothetical tidally-locked Earth.</p></div>

However, since our intention is to implement a simplistic, dry model for a tidally locked exo-Earth merely as a sanity check, we ignore this refinement while acknowledging its need if the intention is to model tidally locked, Earth-like aquaplanets. The Held-Suarez mean flow quantities for zonal wind, temperature and potential temperature are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Our results for the zonal-mean zonal wind profile are similar to the top-left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Merlis &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref>, who noted that the profile contains weak residuals of opposing contributions from various longitudes. It is therefore unsurprisingly that the simulations with and without convective adjustment have zonal-mean zonal wind profiles which are somewhat different. This phenomenon can be seen more clearly in the zonal and meridional wind maps as functions of longitude and latitude ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5)</ref>, which indicate the presence of large circulation cells. The potential temperature profile shows that the atmosphere is, on average, approximately barotropic down to P ≈ 0.5 bar, implying that the tropopause is located farther down. We show the zonal-mean potential temperatures without separating them into day and night side profiles as they are fairly similar; we will examine this issue in greater detail for the hot Jupiter simulations ( §4). Rather, our main intention is to demonstrate the effect of convective adjustment.</p><p>The Eulerian mean streamfunction in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> reveals the presence of multiple circulation cells on the day and night sides. On the day side, a pair of cells exist in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The cells are able to extend from the equator to the poles, because the reduced rate of rotation of the exoplanet weakens the Coriolis deflection. On Earth, the relatively rapid rotation limits the Hadley cells to about Φ ±30 • . On the night side, a pair of large, direct cells reside at higher altitudes (P 0.6 bar); a collection of four smaller circulation cells is evident at lower altitudes. These features are robust to the application of convective adjustment.</p><p>The hemispherically-averaged temperature-pressure profiles for the day and night sides of the tidally-locked Earth are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  7</ref>. On average, the temperature differences between the two sides are barely 10 K and are only evident at P 0.6 bar.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Previous work: purely dynamical model</head><p>As a prelude to our results, we re-analyze the simulation output from the purely dynamical, deep model of HD 209458b as computed by Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> shows the Held-Suarez mean flow quantities for the potential temperature (using equation [18]) and Eulerian mean streamfunction (using equation <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>) separated into the day and night sides of the hot Jupiter. Near the top of the atmosphere (P ≈ 1-10 mbar) on the day side, the atmosphere is slightly baroclinic but with flow converging towards the equator (unlike in the case of the terrestrial troposphere). On the night side, the atmosphere is noticeably more baroclinic. On both the day and night sides, the atmosphere becomes barotropic for P 10 bar by construction, since the Newtonian relaxation time is defined to be infinite at these pressures. The relative weakness of Coriolis deflection again allows for a pair of circulation cell extending from the equator to the poles, as indicated by the Eulerian mean streamfunction. Unlike in the Earth-like ( §3.1) and tidally-locked Earth ( §3.2) simulations, the atmosphere sinks at the equator and rises at the poles on the day side; the reverse happens on the night side. As demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Showman &amp; Polvani (2010</ref>) using a hierarchy of analytical models and simulations, there is downward transport of eddy momentum at the equators of hot Jovian atmospheres, which causes counter-rotating, equatorial flow. However, the horizontal convergence of eddy momentum yields super-rotating, equatorial flow and tends to dominate the net flow (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> of Showman &amp; Polvani 2011). Our simulations are consistent with this picture. It is somewhat counter-intuitive that the circulation is stronger on the night side (i.e., higher values of Ψ). There is virtually no meridional circulation in the inert (P 10 bar) part of the atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Setup</head><p>A number of conceptual challenges exist when generalizing our setup to simulate hot Jovian atmospheres. Firstly, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al. (2009)</ref>, it is presently unclear how to physically describe the frictional dissipation resulting from the differences in flow structures between the atmosphere and its deeper counterparts within a hot Jupiter. Therefore, while the boundary layer scheme described in §2.5 offers a tempting option to simulate frictional dissipation, we choose to switch it off for our hot Jupiter simulations. Essentially, our models assumes "free slip" lower boundary conditions. A different approach is adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu &amp; Schneider (2010)</ref>, who simulated the zonal wind structures of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune by varying the (Rayleigh) drag at the lower boundary in order to better fit observations, with the justification that such a formulation mimics the Ohmic dissipation caused by the induced magnetic fields opposing the zonal flows.

The isotropic profile is obtained from a simulation where the stellar irradiation is uniform everywhere on the surface. This is equivalent to assuming f = 1 in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(29)</ref> of Guillot <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2010)</ref> which corresponds to the situation where the exoplanet is uniformly irradiated with the substellar intensity everywhere -and accounts for the higher temperature (T∞ ≈ 2129 K) at depth. For the profiles labelled "global", the stellar irradiation is described by equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(23)</ref> and the resulting temperature-pressure profiles are averaged over the entire globe, thus resulting in a lower temperature (T∞ ≈ 1539 K) at depth. The temperatures become isothermal at depths at which the stellar irradiation becomes completely absorbed (τS 1). We have extracted temperature-pressure profiles only from the first Earth day of integration, such that the zonal winds in the simulations have not had time to increase to their quasi-equilibrium values (labelled "Simulated"). Recall that our simulations are initiated with a constant temperature Tinit and not from a T -P profile in radiative equilibrium (see §4.3). Thus, the reasonable agreement between the dotted and solid curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> demonstrates that the code is implementing the initial radiative condition correctly -it is not a rigourous test of the radiative transfer scheme. The agreement is imperfect because the analytical expressions of Guillot (2010) use approximate closure conditions (i.e., the Eddington approximations) and also because the vertical grid points in the simulated profiles are taken to be the larger of the pressure half levels in a Simmons-Burridge scheme (see §3.1 of Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011</ref>). The dashed curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> (labelled "Simulated (full)") is the globally-averaged temperature-pressure profile where the simulation is executed for 1500 days with the first 500 days being disregarded. Its general agreement with the analytical profile constitutes a weak test of the radiative transfer scheme at lower pressures: at P 10 bar, the radiative time scale is t rad 20 days, which is more than an order of magnitude shorter than our nominal initialization period of 500 days, implying that radiative equilibrium has been attained at these pressures. At higher altitudes (P 10 bar), the fact that the simulated profile (dashed curve) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> is generally ∼ 50-100 K cooler than the analytical one (solid curve) suggests that thermal energy has been converted to mechanical energy in the form of winds, predominantly in the zonal and meridional directions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows the temperature, zonal wind velocity and meridional wind velocity, averaged over the entire simulation domain, as functions of the simulation time. The zonal wind is absent during the first few Earth days of simulation, but gradually builds up as the simulation attains quasi-equilibrium (sometimes termed "spin up" in the literature). When the zonal wind is accelerated from rest, its equilibrium value is reached when the accelerations due to vertical and horizontal eddy momentum convergence attain steady values, which is expected to happen within 100 Earth days <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Showman &amp; Polvani 2011</ref>). 8 It is apparent that 500 days is a reasonable period for the initialization phase. The mean temperature plateaus at about 1430 K, which is approximately the equilibrium temperature of the exoplanet. It is possible that the very deepest atmospheric layers (P 100 bar) have not completely "spun up" yet, but in simulations which we executed for longer than 1500 days we witness that the qualitative trends in our Held-Suarez mean flow quantities are invariant, although the associated quantitative details may change slightly.</p><p>An uncertainty of our technique is the value of Cint to adopt: for kcon = 0.1-10 3 W K −1 m −1 , we have Cint ∼ 10 5 -10 7 J K −1 m −2 . We thus executed simulations with Cint = 10 5 , 10 6 and 10 7 J K −1 m −2 . The resulting mean temperature-pressure profiles are virtually identical with differences of at most ∼ 1 K. We further verified that simulated profiles associated with Cint = 10 4 J K −1 m −2 and Cint = 10 10 J K −1 m −2 deviate substantially ( 50 K) from the analytical ones at depth.</p><p>The zonal-mean zonal wind, temperature, potential temperature and Eulerian mean streamfunction are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>. It is reassuring that the zonal wind profile resembles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al.

The super-rotating and counter-rotating jets have maximum speeds of about 5.9 km s −1 and -0.6 km s −1 , respectively. From examining the potential temperature profiles, one can infer that the atmosphere is baroclinic for P &lt; 10 bar (and barotropic at greater pressures), in agreement with the purely dynamical results presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>. A difference from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> is that there are now two pairs of circulation cells in each hemisphere (as is evident from examining the Eulerian mean streamfunction). We note that convective adjustment is negligibly invoked, which is unsurprising given the deep radiative zone -which encompasses both the baroclinic and barotropic atmospheric components -of hot Jupiters.</p></div>

We have executed simulations with Cint = 10 5 , 10 6 and 10 7 J K −1 m −2 and witnessed differences of at most 1 K in the globally-averaged temperature-pressure profiles, again demonstrating that uncertainties in the value of Cint do not significantly affect our results.</p><p>The Held-Suarez mean flow quantities from the full simulation are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref>, where it is apparent that they are qualitatively similar to those from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>.

An equatorial, super-rotating jet with a maximum speed of about 6.1 km s −1 is again flanked by slower, counter-rotating jets (−0.8 km s −1 ) at mid-latitudes. At P 10 bar, the zonal wind structure becomes uniform across latitude, which is consistent with the uniform temperature and barotropic structure present. Two pairs of circulation cells extend from the equator to the poles on both the day and night sides, in disagreement with the purely dynamical results, presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, where only a single pair of cells exists. Unlike in the terrestrial atmosphere, our baseline model shows a baroclinic upper atmosphere sitting atop a barotropic lower atmosphere. It is thus somewhat awkward to prescribe the terms "stratosphere" and "troposphere" to the upper and lower atmospheres, respectively. The analogue of the tropopause sits at P ≈ 10 bar. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15</ref> shows temperature maps as functions of latitude and longitude at P = 2.13 mbar, 216 mbar, 4.69 bar and 21.9 bar.

At P = 2.13 mbar, the location where the temperature is at its maximum -which we term the "hot spot" -is shifted away from the substellar point, which is somewhat different from the top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> of Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref> and the second panel (from the top) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 16</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al.

We see that for a fixed value of γ0 = 0.6, the models with ǫ = 1-1000 essentially have the same temperature-pressure profiles, both on the day and night sides, at and above the longwave photosphere. The maximum zonal and meridional wind speeds are virtually unchanged: 5.9 km s −1 and from −0.6 to −0.7 km s −1 , respectively (at least for the fiducial magnitude of the hyperviscosity adopted in this study). The day-night temperature contrasts are almost indiscernible, even though the temperatures at depth are modified differently due to the effect of collision-induced absorption. The day-night temperature contrasts from the purely dynamical model of Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref> are somewhat different, but we should keep in mind that this simulation employs Newtonian relaxation via an equilibrium temperature-pressure profile, which in turn contains a parameter ∆Teq that sets the (initial) daynight temperature contrast as a function of pressure (i.e., ∆Teq = 530-1000 K from P = 10 bar to P 1 mbar). In our improved simulations, the day-night temperature contrasts are computed self-consistently.</p><p>The model with γ0 = 2 (τS 0 = 4670, τ0 = 2335) exhibits temperature inversions on both the day and night sides, consistent with the finding by Hubeny, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Burrows &amp; Sudarsky (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hansen (2008)</ref> and Guillot (2010) that γ0 &gt; 1 models should produce temperature inversions. (See Burrows &amp; Orton 2010 for a review of the observational evidence for temperature inversions in hot Jovian atmospheres.) Curiously, the temperature at depth is T∞ ≈ 1400 K, which is lower than Teq ≈ 1432 K. Thus, this model makes a prediction that infrared observations which are able to probe the deep, barotropic layers of a hot Jupiter should infer a equivalent-blackbody temperature which is lower than the equilibrium temperature of the exoplanet.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Observational consequences</head><p>A direct consequence of our results concerns the vertical mixing of atmospheric fluid. As explained in equation §2.6, the strength of atmospheric circulation is quantified by the Eulerian mean streamfunction. On Jupiter, we have Ψ ∼ 10 10 kg s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu &amp; Schneider 2010)</ref>. As shown by our results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 8, 12</ref> and 14, the circulation in hot Jovian atmospheres has a strength of Ψ ∼ 10 14 kg s −1 , which is ∼ 10 4 times stronger than on Jupiter. Since the circulation cells extend from ∼ 1 mbar to ∼ 10 bar in our models, the relevant length scale is ∼ 10H, where H = kBT / ¯ mgp is the pressure scale height. If we pretend that we may prescribe a "diffusion coefficient" to the atmospheric circulation, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">Kzz ∼ 10H 1 σ 0 ¯ vΦ (Φ, ˜ σ0) d˜σ0d˜σ0 ∼ 10HΨgp RpP0 ∼ 10 10 cm 2 s −1 T 1500 K Ψ 10 14 kg s −1 ¯ m 2mH Rp 9.44 × 10 4 km P0 220 bar −1 , (47)</formula><p>which is consistent with the required value of Kzz ∼ 10 9 -10 11 cm 2 s −1 , estimated by Spiegel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Silverio &amp; Burrows (2009)</ref> for HD 209458b, in order to keep particles associated with TiO, with sizes of 0.1-10 µm, aloft such that they may act as shortwave absorbers capable of producing a temperature inversion. Unfortunately, the Eulerian mean streamfunction is not a good representation of the vertical or horizontal mixing of particles embedded in the flow (termed "tracers" in the atmospheric science community; see §12 of Vallis 2006). So while the enhanced vertical mixing (relative to Jupiter), via large-scale circulation cells present in hot Jovian atmospheres, may be a tempting and plausible mechanism for TiO to be maintained at high altitudes, a more detailed study of the interaction of tracers with the atmospheric circulation is required. (See Youdin &amp; Mitchell 2010 for toy models of vertical, turbulent mixing in hot Jovian atmospheres and their implications for the exoplanetary radii.) An observational way of distinguishing between different hot Jovian atmospheres is to examine their thermal phase curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cowan &amp; Agol 2008</ref>). The flux associated with the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), denoted by FOLR = FOLR(Θ, Φ), is the emergent flux from the longwave photosphere. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 17</ref>, we show maps of FOLR for two models (nL = 2, ǫ = 2000; γ0 = 0.6 versus 2), where it is apparent that the chevron-shaped feature seen at P ∼ 0.1 bar resides near the longwave photosphere. The OLR flux may be used to construct the thermal phase curves, as was done for exo-Earths by Selsis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wordsworth &amp; Forget (2011)</ref>.

As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cowan &amp; Agol (2008)</ref>, the odd sinusoidal modes do not contribute to the thermal phase curve: we set Cj = Dj = 0 when j is odd except for j = 1. This implies that information is lost when the latitudinally-averaged OLR flux is converted to the thermal phase curve. For example, for the γ0 = 0.6 model, we have do not contribute to the thermal phase curve only when the following assumptions are valid: the exoplanet rotates edge-on; there is no limb darkening associated with the exoplanet; and there is no temporal variability associated with the OLR. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 18</ref>, we calculate FOLR and F phase for the γ0 = 0.6 and γ0 = 2 models previously shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 17</ref>. For the latitudinallyaveraged OLR flux (top panel), the angular offsets of the peaks from the substellar point (Θ = 180 • ) are 33.8 • and 26.3 • for the γ0 = 0.6 and γ0 = 2 models, respectively. As realized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref>, the corresponding offsets in the thermal phase curve (bottom panel) are somewhat larger: 39.4 • and 31.9 • , which correspond to temporal offsets of 9.3 and 7.5 hours, respectively, easily discernible with current technology. Notice that the phase angle ψ is defined in such a manner that the peaks of the thermal phase curves occur before superior conjunction (i.e., secondary eclipse).</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">[(A2/A0) 2 + (B2/A0) 2 ] 1/2 ≈ 0.08 while [(A3/A0) 2 + (B3/A0) 2 ] 1/2 ≈ 0.04. For the γ0 = 2 model, we have [(A2/A0) 2 + (B2/A0) 2 ] 1/2 ≈ 0.15 while [(A3/A0) 2 + (B3/A0) 2 ] 1</formula><p>We may be concerned that drag within the atmospheres may alter the location of the hot spot, as implied by the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Showman &amp; Polvani (2011)</ref>. Within the context of the simulations, drag may manifest itself in two forms: physical (e.g., Ohmic) versus numerical (i.e., horizontal dissipation; see §3.3 of Heng, Menou &amp; Phillipps 2011). We restrict our discussion to the uncertainties associated with numerical drag, which takes the form of hyperviscosity in our spectral simulations. To illustrate the effects of numerical drag, we execute two more simulations with γ0 = 0.6 and ǫ = 2000 (our default model), but with the time scale associated with hyperviscosity (tν ) decreased by factors of 10 and 100. The corresponding latitudinally-averaged OLR flux and thermal phase curves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 19</ref>. As already demonstrated in Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>, changing the hyperviscosity alters the zonal wind speeds: the maximum and minimum speeds of 6.1 km s −1 and −0.8 km s −1 , respectively, from our default model now become 5.8 km s −1 and −1.2 km s −1 for tν = 10 −6 HD 209458b day and 5.5 km s −1 and −1.1 km s −1 for tν = 10 −7 HD 209458b day. Since hyperviscosity is a numerical tool and it is difficult to specify its magnitude from first principles, zonal wind speeds in hot Jovian atmospheres are not robust predictions of general circulation models, at least at the 10% level. However, the hot spot offset appears to be a somewhat robust prediction of the models: for tν = 10 −5 , 10 −6 and 10 −7 HD 209458b day, the temporal offsets are 9.3, 9.7 and 9.7 hours, respectively. Therefore, despite our ignorance of tν the hot spot offsets measured from thermal phase curves offer an opportunity to distinguish between hot Jovian atmospheres characterized by different values of γ0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Summary</head><p>The salient points of our study can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We have successfully implemented a simple (dual-band, two-stream) radiative transfer scheme in conjunction with the FMS spectral dynamical core previously described in Heng, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Menou &amp; Phillipps (2011)</ref>. We have tested our computational setup by simulating the atmospheres of Earth-like (exo)planets and hot Jupiters. Our models possess an intermediate degree of sophistication in a required hierarchy of three-dimensional models of atmospheric circulation.</p><p>• We have generalized the analytical formalism of Guillot <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2010)</ref> to calculate temperature-pressure profiles of hot Jovian atmospheres, in radiative equilibrium, which include the effect of collision-induced absorption via a single parameter ǫ.</p><p>• Atmospheric circulation on hot Jupiters is characterized by the presence of large circulation cells extending from the equator to the poles, due to the effect of Coriolis deflection being weakened by slower rotation. While a transitional layer ("tropopause") may exist between the baroclinic and barotropic components of the atmosphere, the former is generally located at greater altitudes while the latter resides deeper in the atmosphere. This is the opposite from the situation on Earth (and a hypothetical, tidally-locked Earth), where the stratosphere sits on top of the troposphere.</p><p>• Large-scale circulation cells in hot Jovian atmospheres offer a plausible mechanism for maintaining TiO at high altitudes, such that it may act as a shortwave absorber capable of producing a temperature inversion. However, a more detailed study of the interaction between particles embedded in the flow ("tracers") and the atmospheric circulation is required before any robust conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>• The absence or presence of a temperature inversion in the baroclinic component of a hot Jovian atmosphere, as well as the temperature contrast between the day versus night sides, is determined by the ratio of shortwave to longwave opacity normalizations (γ0), at least in a cloud-or haze-free scenario.</p><p>• The angular offset between the hot spot -associated with the equatorial, super-rotating wind expected to be present in hot Jovian atmospheres -and the substellar point may help us distinguish between hot Jovian atmospheres characterized by different values of γ0, and appears to be robust to our ignorance of hyperviscosity. and velocity fields, which are calculated using the "Monin-Obukhov" drag laws, considered standard in the atmospheric science community (see §2c of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">CMO =        κ 2 vK ζ −2 , Ri 0 &lt; 0, κ 2 vK ζ −2 1 − R i 0 R i,crit 2 , 0 &lt; Ri 0 &lt; Ri,crit, 0 Ri 0 &gt; Ri,crit,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>where ζ ≡ ln z0 z rough (A2) and z0 is the height of the lowest model layer. It should be noted that equation (A1) is considered a simplified Monin-Obukhov formulation -more sophisticated functions exist to describe CMO. The key physics is captured in three numbers: z rough , Ri and κvK. The first of these is the roughness length z rough , which parametrizes the macroscopic effects of the surface type on the drag. Within the Monin-Obukhov framework, it is the vertical height at which the horizontal winds go to zero. </p><p>which quantifies the effects of shear versus vertical stability. When the bulk Richardson number falls below a critical value Ri,crit ∼ 1-10, the atmosphere is turbulent. Above this critical value, the drag coefficients are set to zero. Again following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor (2006)</ref>, we set Ri,crit = 1 for our Earth-like model. In equation (A1), the quantity Ri 0 is the bulk Richardson number evaluated at the lowest model layer.</p><p>The third of these numbers is the von Kármán constant, which from laboratory experiments and terrestrial atmospheric observations is estimated to be κvK ≈ 0.4 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreas et al. 2006</ref> and references therein). We thus adopt κvK = 0.4 in our Earth-like simulations.</p><p>To treat turbulent diffusion, we first determine the boundary layer depth h by calculating the height where Ri = Ri,crit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The turbulent diffusion coefficient is computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Troen &amp; Mahrt 1986)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_57">K =    K0 (z) z &lt; z ′ , K0 (z ′ ) 1 − z−z ′ h−z ′ 2 z z ′ , z ′ &lt; z &lt; h,<label>(A4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">z ′ ≡ f b h. (A5)</formula><p>The boundary layer fraction f b defines a "surface layer" of height z ′ which is assumed to be in heat and momentum equilibrium with the surface -this formulation is made in the interest of computational efficiency, so as to avoid an iterative calculation to establish equilibrium. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frierson, Held &amp; Zurita-Gotor (2006)</ref>, we adopt f b = 0.1. Above the surface layer, the diffusion coefficient smoothly goes to zero at the top of the boundary layer (z = h). The surface layer diffusion coefficient is</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">K (z) =      κvK v0z C 1/2 MO , Ri 0 &lt; 0, κvK v0z C 1/2 MO 1 + R i ln(z/z rough ) R i,crit −R i −1 , Ri 0 &gt; 0,<label>(A6)</label></formula><p>where v0 represents the horizontal velocity in the lowest model layer. The diffusion coefficients act on the velocity field and the dry static (specific) energy, the later of which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">E dry ≡ cP T + gpz.<label>(A7)</label></formula><p>The Monin-Obukhov framework describes mixing induced via both shear and convection, and allows for a smooth transition between the two regimes. A key difference between it and the convective adjustment scheme ( §2.4) is that the former mixes momentum while the latter does not. An obstacle to applying the Monin-Obukhov scheme to the atmospheres of hot Jupiters is that the four parameters are considered to be free.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6 . 1</head><label>61</label><figDesc>of Vallis 2006, equation [3.7] of Peixóto &amp; Oort 1984)</figDesc></figure>
