			<abstract>
				<p>Spurred by the discovery of more than 60 exoplanets in multiple systems, binaries have become in recent years one of the main topics in planet formation research. Numerous studies have investigated to what extent the presence of a stellar companion can affect the planet formation process. Such studies have implications that can reach beyond the sole context of binaries, as they allow to test certain aspects of the planet formation scenario by submitting them to extreme environments. We review here the current understanding on this complex problem. We show in particular how each of the different stages of the planet-formation process is affected differently by binary perturbations. We focus especially on the intermediate stage of kilometre-sized planetesimal accretion, which has proven to be the most sensitive to binarity and for which the presence of some exoplanets observed in tight binaries is difficult to explain by in-situ formation following the &quot;standard&quot; planet-formation scenario. Some tentative solutions to this apparent paradox are presented. The last part of our review presents a thorough description of the problem of planet habit-ability, for which the binary environment creates a complex situation because of the presence of two irradiation sources of varying distance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Observational constraints: Planets in binaries</head><p>Exoplanet search surveys were initially strongly biased against binary systems of separation 200 AU <ref type="bibr">(Eggenberger &amp; Udry, 2010)</ref>, in great part because these searches were focusing on stellar environments as similar as possible to the solar system. In 2003, however, the first exoplanet in a close binary was detected in the γ Cephei system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hatzes et al., 2003)</ref>, and today more than 60 exoplanets are known to inhabit multiple star systems ( <ref type="bibr">Roell et al., 2012)</ref>. Note that, in many cases, these exoplanets were detected be f ore the presence of a stellar companion was later established by imaging campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mugrauer &amp; Neuhäuser, 2009)</ref>. As a result, for most of these systems, the separation of the binary is indeed relatively large, often in excess of 500 AU ( <ref type="bibr">Roell et al., 2012</ref>). However, ∼ 10 of these planet-bearing binaries have a separation of less than 100 AU, with 5 exoplanets in close binaries with separations of ∼ 20 AU ( <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref>): Gl86 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Queloz et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lagrange et al., 2006</ref>), HD 41004 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Zucker et al., 2004</ref>), γ Cephei ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hatzes et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Neuhäuser et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Endl et al., 2011</ref>), HD196885 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Correia et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al., 2011</ref>) and α Centauri B ( <ref type="bibr">Dumusque et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>As soon as their number became statistically significant, the characteristics of these planets in binaries have been investigated in order to derive possible specificities as compared to planets around single stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Desidera &amp; Barbieri (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Roell et al. (2012)</ref> have shown that, while the distribution of planets in wide (≥ 100 AU) systems is identical to that of planets around single stars, the characteristics of exoplanets in close binaries are significantly different. The main trend seems to be that planetary masses increase with decreasing stellar separation. According to <ref type="bibr">Roell et al. (2012)</ref>, the minimum planet mass scales approximately as (10AU/a bin )M Jup . However, these trends should be taken with caution, as the number of planets in tight binaries is still very limited. Furthermore, the tentative detection of the Earth-sized planet around α Cen B in late 2012 might significantly weaken this result. As for the global occurrence of planets in binaries, <ref type="bibr">Roell et al. (2012)</ref> have found that multiplicity rate among planet-hosting stars is ∼ 12%, approximately four times smaller than for main field solar type stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Raghavan et al., 2010)</ref>. But as pointed out by Duchêne (2010): "...the small sample size, adverse selection biases, and incompleteness of current multiplicity surveys are such that it is premature to reach definitive conclusions". As a consequence, future surveys should probably increase both the number of exoplanets in close-binaries, and the number of stellar companions in known exoplanet systems.</p><p>Besides these statistical exploration, another crucial issue that has been investigated early on is that of the long term orbital stability of these planets in binaries. The reference work on this issue remains probably that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">1</ref> , who derived empirical expressions for orbital stability as a function of binary semi-major axis a B , eccentricity e B and mass ratio µ. Later studies have shown that, reassuringly, all known exoplanets in multiple systems are on stable orbits (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Dvorak et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Haghighipour et al., 2010)</ref>, although the case for HD41004 is not fully settled yet, as it depends on the yet unconstrained eccentricity of the binary orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Haghighipour et al., 2010</ref>).</p><p>An important recent development in terms of observations is the discovery of several exoplanets in P-type orbits. The first confirmed such planet orbits around the cataclysmic binary DP <ref type="bibr">Leonis (Quian et al., 2010</ref>), but most circumbinary planets around binaries with main sequence stars have been detected by the Kepler space telescope <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Doyle et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orosz et al., 2012a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Schwamb et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">kostov et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2014a</ref>. Here again, dynamical studies have shown that all known circumbinary planets are on long term stable orbits.</p><p>However, even if the question of long term stability seems to be settled for all know exoplanets in binaries, the question of their formation is a much more complex issue. It is true that, for many S-type planets, the stellar separation is so large, often exceeding 100 times the radial distance of the exoplanet to the primary, binarity should have had a very limited effect in the planet-forming regions. The situation should, however, be radically different for the handful of planets in ∼ 20 AU binaries, notably for γ Cephei Ab, HD196885 Ab and HD 41004 Ab, where the planet is located close to the orbital stability limit <ref type="figure">(Fig.1)</ref>. It is unlikely that planet formation in these highly perturbed environments could proceed unaffected by the presence of the companion star.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Protoplanetary Disc Truncation</head><p>The planet formation process can be affected by binarity right from the start, during the formation of the initial massive gaseous protoplanetary disc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artymowicz &amp; Lubow (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Savonije et al. (1994)</ref> have shown that such a disc can be tidally truncated by a stellar companion. This truncation distance depends on several parameters, such as the disc's viscosity, but is in most cases roughly comparable to the outer limit for dynamical stability (see previous section), i.e., typically at 1/3 to 1/4 of the binary's separation for non-extreme value of the orbital eccentricity.</p><p>Surveys of discs around young stellar objects (YSOs) have given observational confirmation that discs in close binaries indeed tend to be both less frequent and less massive than around single stars. For the 2Myr old Taurus-Auriga association, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kraus et al. (2012)</ref> have shown that, while the disc frequency in wide binaries remains comparable to that of single stars (∼ 80%), it significantly drops for separations 40 AU and is as low as ∼ 35% for binaries tighter than 10 AU <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.2a)</ref>. Moreover, the millimetre-wave dust continuum imaging survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harris et al. (2012)</ref> for discs in the same Taurus-Auriga cluster have shown that the estimated dust mass contained in these discs strongly decreases with decreasing binary separation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.2b)</ref>. This agrees very well with the theoretical prediction of more compact, and thus less massive discs in tight binaries.</p><p>This less-frequent and more-tenuous discs trend leads to two major problems when considering planet formation. This first one is that truncated discs might not contain enough mass to form planets, especially Jovian objects such as those that have been observed for the three most "extreme" systems: HD196885, HD 41004 and γ Cephei. This issue has been numerically investigated for the specific case of γ Ceph., for which Jang- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Condell et al. (2008)</ref> have found that, for the most reasonable assumptions regarding the disc's viscosity and accretion rate, there is just enough mass left in the truncated disc to form the observed giant planet. This encouraging result has been later confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Müller &amp; Kley (2012)</ref> using a different numerical approach. Note, however, that there might not be enough mass left in the truncated γ Ceph disc to form another Jovian planet.</p><p>There is, however, a potentially bigger problem that is inherent to truncated discs, i.e., that they should be short-lived. The viscous evolution of a compact disc is indeed much faster than that of an extended system, and its mass gets drained, by accretion onto the central star, on shorter timescales. This reduces the timespan within which gaseous planet can form. As an example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Müller &amp; Kley (2012)</ref> have shown that, for γ Cephei type systems, only for unrealistically low disc viscosities do they obtain disc lifetimes that are long enough to allow for in-situ giant planet formation by coreaccretion. Observational confirmation of this shortlived-discs trend has been obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kraus et al. (2012)</ref>, who compared the disc frequency as a function of age for close (≤ 40 AU) binaries in several nearby young associations. They found that the majority of such systems lose their disc in less than 1 Myr, even if a small fraction is able to retain discs to ages close to 10Myr. Their preliminary conclusion is that "∼ 2/3 of all close binary systems clear their disks extremely quickly, within 1 Myr of the end of envelope accretion. The other ∼ 1/3 of close binary systems evolve on a timescale similar to that of single stars". There seems thus to exist a disc-in-binary category for which the theoretically-expected faster mass drain does not occur, and which could thus be more friendly to planet formation. A good example for this category could be the young L1551 system, harboring two resolved ∼ 10 AU wide circumstellar disks in a binary of 45 AU separation ( <ref type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 1998</ref>). Note, however, that even for this population of long-lived binary discs, most estimated disc masses are much lower than for single star cases (with, however, some important exceptions, such as L1551).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Grain Condensation and Growth</head><p>The next stage of planet formation, the condensation of small grains and their growth into larger pebbles and eventually kilometre-sized planetesimals, has not been extensively studied in the context of binary systems. One main reason is probably that this stage is the one that is currently the least understood even in the "normal" context of single stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blum &amp; Wurm, 2008)</ref>, so that extrapolating it to perturbed binaries might seem premature. A noteworthy exception is the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Nelson (2000)</ref> showing that for an equal-mass binary of separation 50 AU, temperatures in the disc might stay too high to allow grains to condense. These results were recently confirmed by the sophisticated 3-D modelling of radiative discs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Picogna &amp; Marzari (2013)</ref>, who found strong disc heating, due of spiral chocks and mass streaming between the circumprimary and circumsecondary discs, in binaries of separation 30 and 50 AU. On a related note, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Zsom et al. (2011)</ref> showed that, even if grains can condense, binary perturbations might impend their growth by mutual sticking because of too high impact velocities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Planetesimal Accumulation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Context</head><p>The next stage of planet formation starts once "planetesimals", i.e., objects large enough (typically sub-kilometre to kilometre-sized) to decouple from the gas, have formed. Within the standard planet-formation scenario, this stage leads, by mutual accretion among these km-sized planetesimals, to the formation of large planetary embryos. This stage is the one that has been by far the most extensively studied within the context of binary systems. The main reason is that the accretion of planetesimals and their growth to planetary embryos is potentially extremely sensitive to dynamical perturbations, since it does not take much to hamper or even halt the mutual accretion of kilometre-sized objects. Indeed, in the standard simulations of planet-formation around single stars, this stage proceeds through fast runaway and oligarchic growth that require very low impact velocities between colliding bodies, typically smaller than their escape velocity, i.e., just a few m.s −1 for kilometre-sized objects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lissauer , 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kokubo &amp; Ida, 2000</ref>). These values are less than ∼ 10 −4 that of typical orbital velocities, so that even moderate dynamical perturbations can have a dramatic effect by increasing impact velocities beyond an accretion-hostile threshold.</p><p>The crucial parameter sealing the fate of the planetesimal swarm is thus their impact velocities. As a consequence, most studies exploring this stage have numerically investigated how encounter velocities evolve under the coupled effect of stellar perturbations, gas drag and physical collisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Differential Orbital Phasing: the negative effect of gas drag</head><p>In a co-planar system, when neglecting all other effects, the response of a planetesimal disc to the pure gravitational perturbations of a stellar companion are secular perturbations that lead to oscillations of their eccentricity and longitude of periastron ω <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heppenheimer, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thebault et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Giuppone et al., 2011</ref>). These secular oscillations are strongly phased in ω, so that they initially do not lead to large impact velocities ∆v for planetesimal encounters. However, as these oscillations get narrower with time, at some point they are narrow enough for orbital crossing to occur, leading to a sudden increase of ∆v (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thebault et al., 2006</ref>, for a detailed discussion on this issue).</p><p>The presence of a gas disc radically alters this simple picture. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marzari &amp; Scholl (2000)</ref>, gas drag progressively damps the secular oscillations and planetesimals converge towards an asymptotic equilibrium orbit e g and ω g (Paardekooper et al., 2008). However, this gas-induced evolution is size dependent, so that planetesimals of different sizes end up on different orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Thebault et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Thebault et al., , 2006</ref>). This is clearly illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.3</ref>, which also shows how small bodies reach their equilibrium orbits faster than larger objects (in the present example, 1 km objects are already at e g and ω g , while 10 km ones still undergo residual secular oscillations). As a consequence, ∆v are small between equal-sized objects but can reach very high values for bodies of different sizes. For most "reasonable" size distributions within the planetesimal population, the differential phasing effect is expected to be the dominant one, and the dynamical environment can thus be strongly hostile to planetesimal accretion in vast regions of the circumstellar disc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thebault et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Thebault, 2011</ref>). These accretion-hostile regions are in general much more extended than the region of orbital stability. Furthermore, even in the regions where planetesimal accretion is possible, it can often not proceed in the same way as around a single star, because the ∆v increase is still enough to slow down and impede the runaway growth mode. A worrying result is that, for the emblematic γ Cephei and HD196885 cases, the locations at which the planets are observed are probably too perturbed to allow for this planetesimal accretion stage to proceed <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Paardekooper et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Thebault, 2011)</ref>. As for the arguably most famous binary system, α Centauri, simulations have shown that plan- etesimal accretion is very difficult in the habitable zone . See for instance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.4</ref>, showing that in the disc around α Cen B the whole region beyond ∼ 0.5 AU is globally hostile to km-sized planetesimal accretion. Note, however, that the innermost regions, where the planet α Cen Bb has possibly been detected, are almost unaffected by binary perturbations.</p><p>Xie &amp; Zhou (2009) and <ref type="bibr">Xie et al. (2010a)</ref> showed that a small inclination of a few degrees between the circumprimary gas disc and the binary orbital plane can help accretion. This is because planetesimal orbital inclinations are segregated by size, thus favouring low-∆v impacts between equal-sized bodies over high-∆v impacts between differently-sized objects. This reduction of high-velocity impacts comes, however, at a price, which is that the collision rate strongly decreases, so that accretion can only proceed very slowly. Moreover, the results of Fragner et al. (2011) seem to indicate that taking into account the effect of the gas disc's gravity could offset this positive effect of orbital inclination, leading to high ∆v dynamical environments (see below) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">More sophisticated models: gas is still a problem</head><p>This globally negative effect of the gas on planetesimal-accretion had been identified in studies considering fiducial static and axisymmetric gas discs, and one could not rule out that this result could be an artifact due to the simplified gas disc prescription. In recent years, new studies have investigated this issue by considering increasingly sophisticated gas-disc models. For the most part, these studies have confirmed the accretion-hostile effect of the gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Paardekooper et al. (2008)</ref> have considered a system with an evolving gas disc that also feels the pull of the binary. They have shown that the situation gets even worse for planetesimal accretion: gas streamlines follow paths that are very different from the planetesimal orbits, so that gas drag is enhanced, and so is the accretion-hostile differential phasing effect (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.5</ref>).</p><p>Another important mechanism that had been neglected in most early planetesimal+gas studies is that of the gas disc's gravity. Due to the difficulty of incorporating this effect in numerical codes, there have only been two attempts at numerically investigating the role of disc self-gravity in circumprimary discs, and only for very limited populations of test planetesimals. The pioneering study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kley &amp; Nelson (2007)</ref> has shown that, for a large fraction of the set-ups they explored, the effect of gas-disc gravity can dominate that of gas drag in controlling planetesimal dynamics. A later study by the same team <ref type="bibr">(Fragner et al., 2011)</ref> found that the net effect of disc gravity is to further increase impact speeds between planetesimals, and this even between equal-sized bodies. The recent analytical exploration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rafikov (2013)</ref> has nevertheless shown that, if the gas disc is very massive and almost axisymmetric, then its gravity could in fact reduce encounter velocities amongst planetesimals. However, this massive axisymmetric disc prerequisite is probably not likely to be generic, as all hydrodynamical studies of gas discs in binaries have shown that they reach eccentricities that are at least one order of magnitude higher than the few 10 −3 needed in the Rafikov(2013) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kley &amp; Nelson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marzari et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marzari et al., , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Zsom et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Müller &amp; Kley, 2012</ref>).</p><p>On a more positive note, <ref type="bibr">Xie &amp; Zhou (2008)</ref> showed that, during the late stages when gas dissipates from the disc, the dispersal of planetesimal orbits narrows and the systems can get accretion-friendly again. However, this behaviour probably occurs too late, once most planetesimals have already been either grounded to dust or spiralled onto the star because of gas friction ). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Late Stages</head><p>The stage for which the influence of a companion is probably best understood is the final step of planetary accretion, leading from Lunar-sized embryos to fully formed planets. Several studies have shown that the regions where embryo accretion can proceed roughly correspond to those for orbital stability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbieri et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Quintana et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Quintana et al., , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">Haghighipour &amp; Raymond , 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guedes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Haghighipour et al., 2010)</ref>. This is a further reassuring result for all known exoplanets-in-binaries. As an illustration, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.6</ref> the results obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Quintana et al. (2002)</ref> for the late stages of planet formation around a αCen like binary. As can be clearly seen, even in such a tight binary, planetary objects can grow within ∼ 2 AU region from the primary star More recent work on these late stages have been devoted to more specific issues. As an illustration, we present here results obtained by <ref type="bibr">Haghighipour &amp; Raymond (2007)</ref> that focuses on the level of water delivery and water mixing in the terrestrial regions within a binary, assuming that a giant planet could form further out in the disc. The authors considered a binary with a solar-mass primary and a Jupiter-mass giant planet at 5 AU. The mass of the secondary star was taken to be 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 solar-masses and the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary were varied in the range of 20-40 AU and 0-0.4, respectively. For each value of the mass of the primary, <ref type="bibr">Haghighipour &amp; Raymond (2007)</ref> used the planetary orbit stability criterion given by <ref type="bibr">Rabl &amp; Dvorak (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref>, and identified the combination of the mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity of the binary for which the giant planet would maintain a stable orbit at 5 AU. They then considered a disc of 115 Moon-to-Mars-sized bodies with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.7</ref> shows the results of a sample of their simulations for a binary with a massratio of 0.5 and for different values of its semimajor axis and eccentricity. The gray area corresponds to the boundaries of the habitable zone of the primary star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>). As a point of comparison, the inner planets of the solar system are also shown. As shown here, many planets of the same or similar size as Earth and with substantial amount of water formed in and around 1 AU. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.8</ref> shows the snapshots of one of such simulations. During the course of the integration, the embryos in part of the disk close to the giant planet are dynamically excited. As a result of the interaction of embryos with one another, the orbital excitation of these objects is transmitted to other bodies in closer orbits causing many of them to be scattered out of the system or undergo radial mixing. In the simulation of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.8</ref>, this process results in formation of a planet slightly larger than Earth and with a large reservoir of water.</p><p>An interesting result of the <ref type="bibr">Haghighipour &amp; Raymond (2007)</ref> numerical exploration is that, assuming the first stages of planet formation were successful, binaries with moderate to large perihelia and with giant planets on low-eccentricity orbits are most favorable for Earth-like planet formation. Similar to the formation of terrestrial planets around single stars, where giant planets, in general, play destructive roles, a strong interaction between the secondary star and the giant planet in a binaryplanetary system (i.e., a small binary perihelion) increases the orbital eccentricity of this object, and results in the removal of the terrestrial planet-forming materials from the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Planets in formation-hostile regions: solving the paradox</head><p>As has been shown in the previous sections, with the exception of its very late stages, the formation of S-type planets in close binaries has many obstacles to overcome. This is in particular true for the planetesimal-accretion stage, which seems unlikely to proceed at the location where the γ Ceph, HD196885 and HD41004 planets have been detected. To explain this paradox of having planets in planet-formation hostile environments, several solutions can be considered. A first possibility is that these planets were not formed in-situ, but in friendlier regions closer to the primary and later migrated outward to their present position. Classical type I or type II migrations in the gas disc would usually move the planet in the "wrong" direction, i.e., inward. There exists, however, possibilities for these migrations to revert direction (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Masset &amp; Snellgrove, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pierens et al., 2012</ref>), but these scenarios have not been explored yet in the context of binaries. The outward migration process that has been explored for binaries regards a later phase, i.e., the planetesimal-driven migration of terrestrial embryos once the gas disc has dissipated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Payne et al. (2009)</ref> have shown that such a mechanism can indeed move some large embryos beyond their initial position, over timescales of typically 10 6 years. However, the maximum outward displacement does not exceed ∼ 30% of the initial sem-major axis, and is not enough to explain the formation of extreme planets such as HD196885 or γ Ceph. Another potential way of moving planets outward is by planet-planet scattering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marzari et al. (2005)</ref> have studied the dynamical evolution of unstable multi-planet systems in binaries and showed that, for 3 neighbouring Jovian planets, a possible outcome is the ejection of one planet, the inward jump of a second one, and the outward displacement of the third one. In this case, one would end up with 2 giant planets, one of which potentially far outside the region where it accreted. However, the major caveat of this scenario is that it requires the presence of a second giant planet on a close circumprimary orbit, and that such a planet should in principle be more easily detected that the outer one. As such, the non-detection of any second Jovian planet in HD196885 or γ Cephei is a problematic issue. A related, albeit theoretical problem is that this scenario requires the truncated protoplanetary disc to be massive enough to form not just one but two giant planets.</p><p>Another solution is simply to bypass the critical km-sized planetesimals range. If indeed the "initial" planetesimals are large, typically ≥ 100 km, then they are big enough to sustain high velocity collisions and can survive and grow in the perturbed environment of a binary. Of course, for this scenario to work, such large planetesimals should be formed directly from much smaller boulder and pebble-sized bodies, so that the whole dangerous 100m-to-10km range is avoided. Interestingly, two recent planetesimal-forming models, the streaming-instability model of <ref type="bibr">Johansen et al. (2007)</ref> and the clumping mechanism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cuzzi et al. (2008)</ref>, advocate such a km-sizestraddling formation mode. However, it remains to be seen if these formation mechanisms can operate in the highly-perturbed environment of a binary.</p><p>Even if the kilometre-sized planetesimal phase cannot be bypassed, recent studies have shown that there is a possibility that these bodies might after all grow even in the presence of high-∆v collisions. <ref type="bibr">Xie et al. (2010b)</ref> have analytically investigated the "snowball" growth mode, in which planetesimals accrete mass preferentially by sweeping up of dust particles instead of mutual collisions with other planetesimals. If the mass density contained in dust exceeds that contained in large bodies, then this mechanism could provide a viable growth mode in binaries, because dust-onplanetesimal impacts can result in accretion for ∆v much higher than planetesimal-onplanetesimal ones. These results have been strengthened by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Paardekooper &amp; Leinhardt (2010)</ref>, who incorporated for the first time a collisional-evolution model in their simulations, taking into account the fragments produced by high-velocity impacts. Their runs have shown that many planetesimals are able to re-accrete, by sweeping, a large fraction of the mass that has been lost to small fragments by earlier high-∆v collisions. Moreover, frequent collisions with these small fragments can prevent kmsized planetesimals from reaching their equilibrium secular+gas-drag imposed orbits, so that their mutual impact velocities never fully reach the high values resulting from the differential phasing effect. However, the collision outcome prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Paardekooper &amp; Leinhardt (2010)</ref> is still relatively simplistic, with all bodies smaller than ∼ 1 km being treated at dust coupled to the gas, and more sophisticated models have to been tested.</p><p>Another promising explanation for the presence of S-type planets in very close binaries is that these binaries were initially wider than today. As it happens, there is in fact theoretical support for this hypothesis. If indeed most stars are born in clusters, then they should experience many close encounters in their early history. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Malmberg et al. (2007)</ref> have shown that, for a typical stellar cluster, some very wide binaries get broken by close encounters, but for binaries that survive, the main effect of these encounters is to shrink their orbits. Interestingly, for the cluster set-up they considered, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Malmberg et al. (2007)</ref> found that around half of the binaries having a present separation of ∼ 20 AU have had a significant orbit-shrinking encounter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.9</ref> 2 . However, for the specific case of HD196885, we run a series of sim-ulations, each time increasing the binary separation, and found that the present-day planet location became accretion-friendly only for a binary separation of ∼ 45 AU. This means that this separation should have shrunk by at least a factor 2 during the system's evolution, and it remains to be seen if such a change is realistic. Perspectives are however more optimistic for the HZ of the α Centauri system, for which only a moderately larger and/or less eccentric initial binary orbit would be enough to allow planetary accretion there (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig.10</ref>).</p><p>If none of the aforementioned solution works, then a more radical explanation should be considered, i.e., that planets in close binaries form by a different channel than the usual core-accretion scenario. An obvious alternative would be the gravitational instability scenario (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boss, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2010)</ref>, in which planets form very quickly by direct disc fragmentation. Although this model still has several issues that need to be solved, in particular the cooling of collapsing proto-planetary clumps, it has recently been advocated as a possible explanation for the presence of giant planets at large radial distances from their stars, such as in the HR8799 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boss, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Duchêne (2010)</ref> argues that this alternative formation mechanism could be at play in a b ≤ 100 AU binaries, and that it could explain why planets in tight binaries are more massive than around single stars. In such close binaries, the instability mechanism could indeed be more efficient than around single stars, because circumprimary discs might be more compact, and thus more prone to fragmentation, than non-truncated ones, but also because binary perturbations could act as an additional trigger to instabilities. As a result, even close-in planets could be formed this way in binaries <ref type="bibr">(Duchêne, 2010)</ref>. However, several studies have also shown that the instability scenario does also encounter major difficulties in the context of close binaries, and that no circumprimary disc gets dense enough to be unstable. See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Nelson (2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">) or Mayer et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">, 2010</ref>, whose main conclusions are that the presence of a close (≤ 50-60 AU) companion could greatly hinder the development of instabilities. This issue is thus far from being settled yet, and further, more detailed investigations are needed to assess if disc-fragmentation can be considered as a viable alternative formation scenario in close binaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Habitability</head><p>Although Earth-like planets are yet to be discovered in the habitable zone (HZ) of binary star systems, many planet-formation-in-binaries studies have rightfully payed special attention to the HZ (see previous sections). In most of these simulations, it has been generally assumed that the HZ of a binary is equivalent to the single-star HZ of its planet-hosting star. Although in binaries with separations smaller than 50 AU, the secondary star plays an important role in the formation, long-term stability, and water content of a planet in the HZ of the primary, the effect of the secondary on the range and extent of the HZ in these systems was ignored. However, the fact that this star can affect planet formation around the primary, and can also perturb the orbit of a planet in the primary's HZ in binaries with moderate eccentricities, implies that the secondary may play a non-negligible role in the habitability of the system as well.</p><p>Unlike around single stars where the HZ is a spherical shell with a distance determined by the host star alone, in binary star systems, the radiation from the stellar companion can influence the extent and location of the HZ of the system. Especially for planet-hosting binaries with small stellar separations and/or in binaries where the planet orbits the less luminous star, the amount of the flux received by the planet from the secondary star may become non-negligible.</p><p>In addition, effects such as the gravitational perturbation of the secondary star (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Georgakarakos 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, Eggl et al. 2012</ref>) can influence a planet's orbit in the Binary HZ and lead to temperature fluctuations if the planetary atmosphere cannot buffer the change in the combined insolation. Since in an S-type system, the secondary orbits more slowly than the planet, during one period of the binary, the planet may experience the effects of the secondary several times. The latter, when combined with the atmospheric response of the planet, defines the HZ of the system.</p><p>Despite the fact that as a result of the orbital architecture and dynamics of the binary, at times the total radiation received by the planet exceeds the radiation that it receives from its parent star alone by a non-negligible amount, the boundaries of the actual HZ of the binary cannot be obtained by a simple extrapolation of the boundaries of the HZ of its planet-hosting star. Similar to the HZ around single stars, converting from insolation to equilibrium temperature of the planet depends strongly on the planet's atmospheric composition, cloud fraction, and star's spectral type. A planet's atmosphere responds differently to stars with different spectral distribution of incident energy. Different stellar types will therefore contribute differently to the total amount of energy absorbed by the planetary atmosphere (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasting et al. 1993)</ref>. A complete and realistic calculation of the HZ has to take into account the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the binary stars as well as the planet's atmospheric response. In this section, we address these issues and present a coherent and self-consistent model for determining the boundaries of the HZ of S-type binary systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Calculation of the Binary Habitable Zone</head><p>Habitability and the location of the HZ depend on the stellar flux at the planet's location as well as the planet's atmospheric composition. The latter determines the albedo and the greenhouse effect in the planet's atmosphere and as such plays a strong role in determining the boundaries of the HZ. Examples of atmospheres with different chemical compositions include the original CO 2 /H 2 O/N 2 model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasting et al 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Selsis et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kopparapu et al. 2013a</ref>) with a water reservoir like Earth's, and model atmospheres with high H 2 /He concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Pierrehumbert &amp; Gaidos 2011)</ref> or with limited water supply ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abe et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>At present, the recent update to the Sun's HZ given by <ref type="bibr">Kopparapu et al. (2013a&amp;b)</ref> presents the best model. According to this model, the HZ is an annulus around a star where a rocky planet with a CO 2 /H 2 O/N 2 atmosphere and sufficiently large water content (such as on Earth) can host liquid water permanently on its solid surface. This definition of the HZ assumes the abundance of CO 2 and H 2 O in the atmosphere is regulated by a geophysical cycle similar to Earth's carbonate silicate cycle. The inner and outer boundaries of the HZ in this model are associated with a H 2 O-and CO 2 -dominated atmosphere, respectively. Between those limits on a geologically active planet, climate stability is provided by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO 2 concentration varies inversely with planetary surface temperature.</p><p>The locations of the inner and outer boundaries of a single star's as well as a binary's HZ depend also on the cloud fraction in the planet's atmosphere. That is because the overall planetary albedo is a function of the chemical composition of the clear atmosphere as well as the additional cooling or warming of the atmosphere due to clouds. Since the model by <ref type="bibr">Kopparapu et al. (2013a&amp;b)</ref> does not include clouds, it is customary to define two types of HZ; the narrow HZ which is considered to be the region between the limits of runaway and maximum greenhouse effect in the model by <ref type="bibr">Kopparapu et al (2013a&amp;b)</ref>, and the empirical HZ, as a proxy to the effect of clouds, that is derived using the fluxes received by Mars and Venus at 3.5 and 1.0 Gyr, respectively (the region between Recent Mars and Early Venus). At these times, the two planets do not show indications for liquid water on their surfaces (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>). In these definitions, the locations of the HZs are determined based on the flux received by the planet (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Selsis et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kaltenegger &amp; Sasselov 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">and Kopparapu et al. 2013a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Effect of Star's Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)</head><p>The locations of the boundaries of the HZ depend on the flux of the star at the orbit of the planet. In a binary star system where the planet is subject to radiation from two stars, the flux of the secondary star has to be added to that of the primary (planethosting star) and the total flux can then be used to calculate the boundaries of the HZ. However, because the response of a planet's atmosphere to the radiation from a star depends strongly on the star's SED, a simple summation of fluxes is not applicable. The absorbed fraction of the absolute incident flux of each star at the top of the planet's atmosphere will differ for different SEDs. Therefor in order to add the absorbed flux of two different stars and derive the limits of the HZ for a binary system, one has to weight the flux of each star according to the star's SED. The relevant flux received by a planet in this case is the sum of the spectrally weighted stellar flux, separately received from each star of the binary, as given by [see <ref type="bibr">Kaltenegger &amp; Haghighipour (2013)</ref> for details],</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F Pl ( f, T Pr , T Sec ) = W Pr ( f, T Pr ) L Pr (T Pr ) r 2 Pl−Pr + W Sec ( f, T Sec ) L Sec (T Sec ) r 2 Pl−Sec .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In this equation, F Pl is the total flux received by the planet, L i and T i (i=Pr, Sec) represent the luminosity and effective temperature of the primary and secondary stars, f is the cloud fraction of the planet's atmosphere, and W i ( f, T i ) is the binary stars' spectral weight factor. The quantities r Pl−Pr and r Pl−Sec in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> represent the distances between the planet and the primary and secondary stars, respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">figure  11</ref>). In using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, we normalize the weighting factor to the flux of the Sun. From equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, the boundaries of the HZ of the binary can be defined as distances where the total flux received by the planet is equal to the flux that Earth receives from the Sun at the inner and outer edges of its HZ. Since in an S-type system, the planet revolves around one star of the binary, we determine the inner and outer edges of the HZ with respect to the planet-hosting star. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">figure 11</ref>, it is customary to consider the primary of the system to be stationary, and calculate the orbital elements with respect to the stationary primary star. In the rest of this section, we will follow this convention and consider the planet-hosting star to be the primary star as well. In that case, the range of the HZ of the binary can be obtained from</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W Pr ( f, T Pr ) L Pr (T Pr ) l 2 x−Bin + W Sec ( f, T Sec ) L Sec (T Sec ) r 2 Pl−Sec = L Sun l 2 x−Sun .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>, the quantity l x represents the inner and outer edges of the HZ with x=(in,out).

In a close binary system, the gravitational effect of the secondary may deviate the motion of the planet from a circle and cause its orbit to become eccentric. In a binary with a given semimajor axis and mass-ratio, the eccentricity has to stay within a small to moderate level to avoid strong interactions between the secondary star and the planet, and to allow the planet to maintain a long-term stable orbit (with a low eccentricity) in the primary's HZ. The binary eccentricity itself is constrained by the fact that in highly eccentric systems, periodic close approaches of the two stars truncate their circumstellar disks depleting them from planet-forming material <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Artymowicz &amp; Lubow 1994)</ref> and restricting the delivery of water-carrying objects to an accreting terrestrial planets in the Binary HZ <ref type="bibr">(Haghighipour &amp; Raymond 2007)</ref>. This all implies that in order for the binary to be able to form a terrestrial planet in its HZ, its eccentricity cannot have large values. In a binary with a small eccentricity, the deviation of the planet's orbit from circular is also small and appears in the form of secular changes with long periods (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Eggl et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, to use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>, one can approximate the orbit of the planet by a circle without the loss of generality.</p><p>The habitability of a planet in a binary system also requires long-term stability in the HZ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Examples of the Habitable Zone of Main Sequence S-Type Binaries</head><p>As mention earlier, we assume that the orbit of the planet around its host star is circular. Without knowing the exact orbital configuration of the planet, one can only estimate the boundaries of the Binary HZ by calculating the maximum and minimum additional flux from the secondary star at its closest and furthest distances from a fictitious Earth-like planet, as a first order approximation. Note that using the maximum flux of the secondary onto the planet for calculating the new Binary HZ overestimates the shift of the HZ from the single star's HZ to the Binary HZ due to the secondary because the planet's atmosphere can buffer an increase in radiation temporarily. This shift is underestimated when one uses the minimum flux received from the secondary star onto the planet. To improve on this estimation, one needs to know the orbital positions of the planet as well as the stars in the binary. That way one can determine the exact flux over time reaching the planet as well as the number of planetary orbits over which the secondary's flux can be averaged. This depends on the system's <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref> Boundaries of the narrow (dark green) and empirical (light green) HZs in an M2-M2 (top left), F0-F0 (top right), and M1-F8 S-type binary star system (bottom two panels).

We consider the M2 and F0 stars to have effective temperatures of 3520 (K) and 7300 (k), respectively, and their luminosities to be 0.035 and 6.56 of that of the Sun for our general examples here. We note that in calculating the boundaries of the HZ, the orbital (in)stability of the fictitious Earth-like planet is not considered. As a result, depending on the orbital elements and mass-ratio of the binary, its HZ may be unstable.</p><p>To demonstrate the effect of the secondary on the boundaries of the HZ, we calculate the Binary HZ of the systems mentioned above considering the minimum value of the binary semimajor axis for which the outer edge of the primary's empirical HZ will be on the stability limit. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.14</ref> shows the results for the case of a circular binary. The top panels in this figure correspond to an M2M2 (left) and F0F0 (right) binary system. As shown here, the secondary does not have a noticeable effect on the extent of the HZ around the primary. The Binary HZ around each star is equivalent to its single-star HZ. The bottom panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.14</ref> correspond to an F8M1 binary (left) where the primary is the F star, and an M1F8 binary (right) where the primary is the M star. As expected, the effect of the M star on the extension of the single-star HZ around the F star is negligible. However, at its closets distances, the F star can extent the outer limit of the single-star HZ around the M star so far out that at the binary periastron, the two HZs merge.  <ref type="figure">at (0,0)</ref>.

Here we assume that planet formation around both stars of this binary can proceed successfully and they both can host Earth-like planets. We calculate the spectral weight factors of both α Cen A and B <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>, and using the minimum and maximum added flux of the secondary star, estimate the limits of their Binary HZs using equation <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the estimates of the boundaries of the Binary HZ around each star. The terms Max and Min in this table correspond to the planet-binary configurations of (θ, ν) = (0, 0) and (0, 180 • ) where the planet receives the maximum and minimum total flux from the secondary star, respectively. As shown here, each star of the α Centauri system contributes to increasing the limits of the Binary HZ around the other star. Although these contributions are small, they extend the estimated limits of the Binary HZ by a noticeable amount. This is primarily due to the high luminosity  of α Cen A and the relatively large eccentricity of the binary which brings the two stars as close as ∼ 11.3 AU from one another (and as such making planet formation very difficult around α Cen A). Given the eccentricity of the α Cen binary (e Bin = 0.518), both narrow and nominal HZs for α Cen A and B are stable. The stability limit around the primary G2V star is at ∼ 2.768 AU. This limit is slightly exterior to the outer boundary of the star's narrow and empirical HZs. Although the latter suggests that the HZ of α Cen A is dynamically stable, the close proximity of this region to the stability limit may have strong consequences on the actual formation of an Earth-like planet in this region (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Thébault et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Eggl 2012</ref>).</p><p>8.2 Habitable Zone of HD 196885 HD 196885 is a close main sequence S-type binary system with a semimajor axis of 21 AU and eccentricity of 0.42 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chauvin et al. 2011</ref>).

Using the mass-luminosity relation L ∼ M 3.5 where L and M are in solar units, the luminosity of this star is approximately 0.06L Sun , and we consider its effective temperature to be T Star = 3700 K. The primary of HD 196885 hosts a Jovian-type planet suggesting that the mass-ratio and orbital elements of this binary allow planet formation to proceed successfully around its primary star. We assume that terrestrial planet formation can also successfully proceed around both stars of this binary and can result in the formation of Earth-sized objects.</p><p>To estimate the boundaries of the Binary HZ of this eccentric system, we ignore its known giant planet and use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> considering a fictitious Earth-like planet in the HZ. We calculate the spectral weight factor W( f, T ) for both stars of this system <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref> and estimate the locations of the inner and outer boundaries of the binary's HZ <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>.</p><p>As expected (because of the large periastron distance of the binary, and the secondary star being a cool M dwarf), even the maximum flux from the secondary star does not have a noticeable contribution to the location of the HZ around the F8V primary of HD 196886. However, being a luminous F star, the primary shows a small effect on the location of the HZ around the M1V secondary star <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Observational contraints on discs in binaries. left panel: Frequency of disc-bearing systems in close binaries as a function of age in several young stellar clusters (from Kraus et al., 2012, courtesy of the Astrophysical Journal). right panel: Measured excess flux in the millimetre as a function of binary projected separation (from Harris et al., 2012, courtesy of the Astrophysical Journal)</figDesc></figure>

The binary configuration corresponds to the HD196885 case, i.e., M 2 /M 1 = 0.35, a b = 21 AU and e b = 0.42. The gas disc is assumed to be axisymmetric and has a density profile corresponding to the theoretical Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN, see Hayashi, 1981).

Relative importance of different type of mutual impacts as a function of radial distance. Red: impacts for which ∆v s 1 ,s 2 ≥ v ero−M , where v ero−M is the threshold velocity beyond which an impact between two objects of sizes s 1 and s 2 always results in net mass loss. Yellow: v esc−m ≤ ∆v s 1 ,s 2 ≤ v ero−M , where v esc−m is the erosion threshold considering poorly collision-resistant material. Green: ∆v s 1 ,s 2 ≤ v esc where v esc is the escape velocity of the (s 1 , s 2 ) pair. Accretion can here proceed unimpeded, in a "runaway growth" way, as around a single star. Light blue: v esc ≤ ∆v s 1 ,s 2 ≤ v ero−m . Collisions result in net accretion, but ∆v are high enough to cancel off the fast-runaway growth mode. The two thick blue lines denote the location of the inner limit of the "empirical" and "narrow" Habitable Zones (see Sec.7). The planetesimal size distribution is assumed to be a Maxwellian centered on 5 km (modified from Thebault et al., 2009).</figDesc></figure>
