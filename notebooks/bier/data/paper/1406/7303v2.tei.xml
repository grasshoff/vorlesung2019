<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Understanding how planetary systems, including our own, form and evolve frame one of the most fundamentally compelling areas of inquiry in contemporary astrophysics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beuther et al. 2014</ref>). Over the last few decades, optical, infrared and millimeter observations have shown that most stars are surrounded at birth by circumstellar (CS) accretion disks of primordial material.</p><p>Separately, more than a thousand confirmed, and thousands more candidate, extrasolar planets detected to date mostly by photometric transit and radial velocity methods, are believed to originate in such disks with Jovian-mass planets forming before CS accretion disks become gaspoor over time. The evolutionary transformation of gas-rich disks to systems with small amounts of dust and little residual gas occurs over the first ~10 Myr of the host star's lifetime, with warm dust rare in systems after ~ 3 Myr ( <ref type="bibr">Haisch et al. 2001</ref>) and gas rare after 5-10 Myr and stellar mass accretion declining to ~ 10 -11 M yr -1 over the same epoch <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fedele et al. 2010</ref>). Much of the dust may then be tied up in smaller rocky or icy bodies that can interact with co-orbiting giant planets or other small bodies, and collide, thus replenishing the CS environments (transformed into "debris disks") with second-generation material. Such collisional replenishment of dust-rich CS particles can continue throughout the lifetime of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carpenter et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Roccatagliata et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Panić et al. 2013</ref>). In our own Solar System, even after 4.6 Gyr, this is evidenced by the presence of our own zodiacal dust cloud, asteroid and Kuiper belts, and population of comets. Indeed, this dust-production paradigm was reinforced with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Rosetta imaging of the aftermath of the apparent dynamical collision or rotational disruption of minor planet P/2010 A2, releasing a wake of trailing debris <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jewitt et al. 2010</ref>), even as competing forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and radiation pressure "blow out") attempt to clear the circumsolar environment of such particles. However, because these dynamical processes occur on much shorter timescales than a host star's lifetime, a quasiequilibrium condition may exist where dusty debris is continuously generated through collisions and the net solid mass declines with age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wyatt et al. 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Wyatt et al. 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wyatt 2008</ref>).</p><p>The outcomes of such interactions will analogously affect the compositional content and spatial distribution of dusty debris in exoplanetary systems on spatial scales large compared to planets. ! Dynamical interactions of planets with residual planetesimals likely play a vital role in shaping the architectures of planetary systems. Recently formed terrestrial planets can generate copious quantities of dust in the early phases of planetary system formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2004</ref>). E.g., in the history of our Solar System, Jupiter is thought to have wrought considerable destruction in the early evolution of the asteroid belt ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bottke et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Nesvorný, et al. 2013</ref>), scattering volatile-rich planetesimals towards the inner solar system that may have contributed significant water to, and affected the habitability of, the early Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Raymond et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Morbidelli et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Raymond et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albertsson et al. 2014</ref>). The Nice model <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Morbidelli et al. 2005</ref>) for the dynamical re-arrangement of the Solar System explains: (a) the migration of the outer planets; (b) the depletion of dust-producing planetesimals by factors of x10 in both the <ref type="bibr">Asteroid and Kuiper Belts; and (c)</ref> evidence for a Late-Heavy Bombardment in the lunar cratering record ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Strom et al. 2005</ref>). High spatial-resolution (&lt;≈ AU scale) and high fidelity maps of dusty CS debris in exoplanetary systems, in which the presence (or absence) of co-orbiting planetary-mass bodies may be imprinted or encoded on the imaged dust distribution, are needed to test the general applicability of such models around other stars.</p><p>CS dust disks (exo-Kuiper Belts) were first identified by thermal emission in excess of that expected from the stellar photosphere. This is how the majority of debris disks at d &lt; 100 pc are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Backman &amp; Paresce 1993)</ref>, and continue to be discovered ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eiroa et al. 2013</ref>). Most modeling of these disks has focused on the wavelength dependence of the infrared (IR) excess emission (i.e., their spectral energy distributions; SEDs), but is not unique. Different spatial distributions of dust and dust particle properties can produce similar SEDs. Breaking these degeneracies requires spatially-resolved imagery. With sufficient spatial resolution, we can potentially observe the effects of sculpting of the debris by dynamical interactions with planets and other phenomena. At long wavelengths, such imaging studies are currently limited to far-IR thermal emission from nearby (d &lt; 50 pc) disks obtained with the 3.5m Herschel Space Observatory, and the few debris disks studied to date with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) sensitive to larger particles. Those disks that are bright enough to be imaged in scattered near-IR or optical light are observable with ground-based 8-10 m class adaptive optics (AO)-augmented telescopes with coronagraphs, or with HST coronagraphy. In particular, these CS debris systems are detectable and resolvable using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), with Point-Spread-Function (PSF) template-subtracted coronagraphy (PSFTSC), and can uniquely provide detailed information about the systems and their architectures even when the individual planets remain elusive.</p><p>Initially, only ~15% of the thermally-emissive debris disks observed by HST were detected in scattered light, although additional disks continue to be discovered from archival data as postprocessing techniques continue to improve, and as resolved detections from other wavelengths continue to accumulate. The discovery images of these light-scattering disks exhibit a diversity of radially "confined" and non-axisymmetric features in the stellocentric regions thus far explored, including: photocentric offsets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Schneider et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kalas et al. 2005a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kalas et al. , 2008</ref>), warps <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Heap et al. 2000</ref>), clumps <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Greaves et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Greaves et al. , 2012</ref>, non-coplanar features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Golimowski et al. 2006</ref>), spirality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Clampin et al. 2003)</ref>, and brightness asymmetries <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Telesco et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kalas et al. 2007a,b)</ref>. These are exactly the morphological features predicted to arise in starlight-scattering CS debris perturbed by co-orbiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wyatt et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Augereau et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kuchner &amp; Holman 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wyatt 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wyatt , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wolf et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ertel et al. 2012</ref>). Some of these features, however, may also result from different evolutionary scenarios positing the production of belts of colliding planetesimals. The challenge then is to distinguish between disks arising from different mechanisms, e.g., between disks with planetesimals captured into mean motion resonances with planets, and disks where planetesimals are self-stirred <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Wyatt 2008)</ref>.! Distinguishing between these scenarios can best be achieved with images that reveal and spatially resolve most of the debris system sub-structures. Most of the "discovery" images, however, have been plagued with optical artifacts due to systematic effects from incomplete starlight suppression (i.e., residuals from limited-efficacy coronagraphy and PSF-subtraction), and are of insufficient (or questionable) fidelity. To overcome this problem, we have obtained new, much higher fidelity and sensitivity, visible-light observations of an HST-selected sample of CS disks using a multi-roll PSFTSC imaging technique with STIS. Our new STIS observations achieve inner working angles (IWAs) of r &gt; 0.3″, equal to that previously provided by HST's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) coronagraph, but with a field of view and visible-light spatial resolution (≈ 60 mas) comparable to that of HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) with its much larger effective IWAs. (Today, neither the NICMOS nor ACS coronagraphs are operational.) These new STIS images probe the interior regions of these debris systems, with inner working distances below ≈ 8 AU for about half the stars in this sample, corresponding to the giant planet and Kuiper belt regions within our own Solar System. This enables direct inter-comparison of the architectures of these exoplanetary debris systems in the context of our own Solar System, and also studies of disk dynamics, grain properties, and systemic evolution. These in turn can be used to deduce (or exclude) the existence of planets, and more importantly can set constraints on planetary masses, orbital distances, eccentricities and evolutionary history ( <ref type="bibr">Chaing et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rodigas et al. 2014a</ref>).</p><p>Our target sample is discussed in §2 of this paper. In § 3 we discuss the observational motivation and goals of the program predicated on the history of "lessons learned" from nearly two decades of HST coronagraphy and PSF-subtraction. In § 4 we detail our observational approach to greatly improve upon a priori anticipated sensitivity-limiting instrumental and extrinsic systematic effects that arise from incomplete or imperfect PSF subtractions (if observationally unconstrained or uncontrolled). Therein we elaborate upon the observations that define and enable our multi-roll PSFTSC by utilizing time-constrained multiple field (spacecraft roll) orientation ("N"-roll, with N = 6 by optimal design). In § 5 we present our image data reduction, and PSF subtraction methods applied across the target set. In § 6 we place the STIS multi-roll PSFTFC observations in the context of CS disk observations with other instruments, facilities, and at other wavelengths obtained in space and on the ground. In § 7 we present, at a high level across the target set, the observational results of the imaging program, with commentary in § 8. Finally, in Appendix A, we present and discuss the imaging results and derived properties and characteristics of each individual target system in detail. Detailed analysis and modeling of the image data for individual targets will be presented in follow-on papers, (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stark et al. 2014</ref> for HD 181327, <ref type="bibr">Hines et al. 2014 (in preparation)</ref> for HD 61005, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Debes et al. 2014</ref> (in preparation) for HD 32297, and others).</p></div>

These disks span a range of inclinations to the line-of-sight from edge-on (i = 90˚; the most favorable geometry for discovery detection), to nearly face-on (i = 0˚). These are the benchmark disks for thermal IR imaging and SED modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lebreton et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Donaldson et al. 2013</ref>), some of the earliest to be observed by ALMA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">MacGregor et al. 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Walsh &amp; Testi 2012)</ref>, and anticipated for the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and the SpectroPolarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE) coronagraph. Over the past 16 years, HST coronagraphy (with PSF subtraction) has provided some remarkable, even paradigm-changing, images of CS disks through the investment of many hundreds of HST orbits (see representative discovery images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). They are, however, derived from a diversity of heterogeneously planned and executed survey programs that typically have been limited in depth, inner (stellocentric) working angle, and are characteristically "polluted" with artifacts from non-optimal PSF subtractions; this impedes unambiguous interpretation and often provides only loose constraints for well-informed modeling, making comparison within the sample and with models challenging. However, studies of individual objects have demonstrated ways to improve upon the discovery imaging, both by using appropriate observational strategies (see §4) and advanced data reduction techniques (see § § 5.4-5.8, and § 6.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">OBSERVATIONAL MOTIVATION/GOALS</head><p>"Raw" HST coronagraphy alone, with any of the telescope's coronagraphically augmented instruments, has insufficient starlight suppression to study even highly efficiently starlightscattering CS dust without further "disk-to-star" contrast enhancement via PSF subtraction. PSF subtraction significantly enhances the imaging dynamic range (disk-to-star contrast) by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, further removing residual starlight from the PSF halo that is incompletely suppressed by the HST coronagraphs alone. To enable quantitative metrical comparisons with other instrumental systems, in this paper, we specifically define "contrast" as the flux density contained within a resolution element at any stellocentric angular distance arising from the stellar PSF halo ratioed to the flux density within the central resolution element of stellar PSF core unsuppressed by coronagraphy and/or PSF-subtraction. HST PSF-subtracted coronagraphic images are often degraded or compromised by optical artifacts resulting from the subtraction of imperfectly "matched" stellar PSF templates due primarily to chromatism (differences in photopheric SEDs), particularly under the very broad STIS unfiltered bandpass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Grady et al. 2005</ref>), and by variable focus wavefront error caused by spacecraft thermal instabilities on orbital and longer timescales (a.k.a. "breathing" of the optical telescope assembly). Additional contributors to such artifacts that impact different spatial scales and correlation scale lengths in PSF-subtracted images are discussed by <ref type="bibr">Schneider et al. (2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Strategy</head><p>We obtained multiple orientation STIS coronagraphic imaging of the disks listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and single orientation observations otherwise obtained in the same manner, of a color-matched set of PSF template stars <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>, one for each science target. Our goals were to obtain high spatial resolution images of the light-scattering CS material in these disk systems over a wide stellocentric radial and azimuthal range. We imaged as close to the star as possible in stellocentric angle with the STIS occulting Wedge A (limited by the 0.3" half-width at the smallest, standard, position of WedgeA-0.6), and also exposed deeply, commensurate with a requisite "multiple roll" strategy to minimize PSF subtraction residuals, to image tenuous low-SB dust in the outermost reaches of these CS debris systems (at WedgeA-1.0 position) previously unimaged with ACS. The multiple-orientation observing approach, importantly and simultaneously, provides both rejection (by anti-coincidence through median filtering) of optical artifacts that could otherwise be mis-construed as intrinsic sub-structures in CS disks, and completely (or nearly so) azimuthally samples "around" the otherwise obscuring STIS coronagraphic wedge and unapodized HST diffraction spikes. The effectiveness of this approach for debris disk imaging into sub-arcsecond IWA was demonstrated previously to lower efficacy with only two spacecraft roll angles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Schneider et al. 2009</ref>). In this study we planned 6 spacecraft roll angles, to provide complete azimuthal coverage at r &gt; 0.3".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">STIS Coronagraphic Exposures</head><p>For optimal S/N at the edge of the r = 0.3" occulting wedgeA-0.6, our individual short exposures were designed on a target by target basis to reach (but not exceed) 90% of the full-well depth of the STIS CCD from the stellar light PSF-halo that dominates significantly over starlight scattered by CS dust before PSF subtraction. For this we scaled (based on stellar V and B band magnitudes) from previous observations of STIS coronagraphic PSF template stars as well as prior observations of protoplanetary and debris disk hosts. Multiple "short" exposure images (target specific integration times of a few to &lt; tens of seconds depending upon stellar brightness) were obtained to improve the S/N as demonstrated previously for HR 4796A per <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. We supplemented these "shortest" exposures with much deeper exposures (typically ~ 10x each, multiply CR-split for cosmic ray rejection and compensation) to map the mid and outer regions of the disks where the CS disk SB is (in general) much lower (due to the r -2 dilution of the stellar radiation field), and imaging is otherwise photon, rather than contrast, limited. We additionally employ the 0.5" half-width position of WedgeA-1.0, advantageously using the larger unvignetted coronagraphic FOV, to further investigate external perturbations to the CS dust in the form of "tidal tails" and other structures from posited companions and interactions with the local ISM, and blow-out of small scattering particles at large stellocentric distance.</p><p>The WedgeA-0.6 images were designed to: (a) image as close to the central star as possible without saturating at the edges of the wedge in the pre-PSF subtracted images; and (b) provide full (or nearly so) azimuthal coverage unaffected by the wedge and HST diffraction spikes in multiple orientation combination, to r &lt; 3.3". Deeper images (of necessity saturating the regions close to the star) extending to much larger angular distances (using a commensurately larger subarray read out) were separately obtained using WedgeA-1.0. These WedgeA-1.0 images were designed to simultaneously provide: (a) deep images of the outer portions of the target disks to stellocentric distances of &gt; 6"; (b) unsaturated imaging overlapping into the smaller stellocentric regions (to r &gt; ~ 2") separately covered in the non-overlapping domain by the WedgeA-0.6 images to the physical limit of the occulting wedge edges. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for target-specific details with additional information available in the as-executed HST Phase 2 observation plan 2 .</p><p>All data (following standard mode-2 coronagraphic target acquisitions) were obtained with STIS instrumental CCDGAIN = 4, and the longer (deeper) exposures with CR-SPLIT = 3 to 5, optimized for the length of target (declination) specific visibility windows. We employ sub-array readouts tuned to the maximum anticipated angular extent of the outer regions of the light scattering disks detectable to the anticipated levels of the background noise to minimize dead time and maximize observational efficiency. For details see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">STIS Coronagraphic Orbits</head><p>For each science target we obtained a sequence of short and long coronagraphic exposures (see above), in a total of 6 orbits to observe at 6 different spacecraft roll (celestial field orientation) angles for spatial coverage, and to minimize PSF-subtraction residuals that are only partially correlated with different rolls <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Schneider et. al. 2009</ref>). We "broke" the six orbits into two sets of three sequentially executed orbits with, ideally (but seldom realized) relative orientations -30°, 0°, and +30° (with loose tolerance) from off-nominal roll. The two sets of three orbits were each scheduled (at different epochs) at nominal roll orientations differing by 90°-150° to fully sample, (or nearly so) azimuthally beyond the r = 0.3" edge of the coronagraphic wedge, and probe beyond the r = 3.4" edge of the STIS FOV on the narrow side of the wedge's</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</formula><p>taper in the WedgeA-0.6 position. This also had the advantage, by observing at two epochs and thus different Sun and β angles (stochastically, not by requirement), of guarding against the possibility of an anomalous "breathing" phase in a single set of observations that otherwise can significantly degrade PSF subtraction. We imposed no absolute orientation constraints on the three-orbit sets, even in cases where the celestial orientation of disk major axes are known. This eased already constrained schedulability of the individual visits with no penalty or degradation for meeting our science goals. Along with each three-orientation visit set, we also identically observed, but only at nominal roll for one orbit, a bright target-color matched PSF template star to be used for contemporaneous PSF subtraction. Thus, a total of eight orbits were required for each disk-host/PSF-star pair. Hence, we consumed a total of 88 orbits to observe our eleven CS disk targets and matched PSF subtraction template stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">PSF Star Selection and Coronagraphic Performance</head><p>Extensive experience with HST broadband coronagraphy (with NICMOS R = ∆λ/λcent = 0.53 with F110W and even more extreme with STIS unfiltered R = 0.75), had clearly demonstrated the need for PSF stars very well matched in color indices under the instrumental bandpass to mitigate differential chromatic effects in PSF structure that otherwise hinder efficacious PSF subtraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Grady et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schneider et al. 2010</ref>). Hence, whenever possible given other constraints, we selected PSF template stars of very similar photospheric SEDs (and of sufficient brightness) well-matched to each of our CS disk hosting target stars (with [B-V] = +0.02 to +1.44, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) differing by ∆|B-V| &lt; 0.1 for each target/PSF-template star pairs. A second major contributor to optical artifacts in PSF-subtracted images arises from secular changes in the fine structure of the coronagraphic PSF over time (spacecraft orbit and orbital phase) and with spacecraft repointing (attitude and roll). Both differential chromatic and PSF instability effects have hindered ACS coronagraphic observations, very often having prevented even the much larger limiting IWAs of the ACS coronagraph's r=0.9" and 1.8" masks to have been reached as those observations had been conducted. To mitigate these issues to the greatest extent possible, along with each of our CS disk-hosting target stars we interleaved (as the 3rd of 4 sequential orbits), at nominal roll, a target-specific color matched PSF subtraction template star in each of the 90°-150° rotationally offset visit sets. Whenever possible, so as not to excite "breathing" modes with thermal instabilities in the HST Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), we constrained the cross-sky target/template slew distance to &lt; 10° (to minimize spacecraft attitude changes), and kept roll angle differentials from target/template nominal roll as close to zero as possible. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for details. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> provides an as-executed visit-level observation summary for each disk target and its contemporaneously observed PSF star, each observed at two epochs in four contiguous HST orbits. In this program, each visit is comprised of a target acquisition exposure (not shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>) followed by multiple WedgeA-0.6 and WedgeA-1.0 exposures in a single orbit. At each epoch, in chronological order, the 1 st , 2 nd , and 4 th visits are of the disk target with celestial field orientation angles scheduled as close to -30°, 0°, +30° from off-nominal roll as possible, given HST guide star selection and other scheduling constraints. The <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> "Orient" angles give the field angle measured from the 50CCD aperture's image +Y axis to celestial north counterclockwise (through east). In the 3 rd visit at each epoch the PSF star is imaged at its nominal roll angle, thus interleaving PSF observations between the 2 nd and 3 rd disk target orbits (orbits 2 and 4 in each set of target+template images). In most cases the absolute orientation angle of the spacecraft for the PSF orbit, at its nominal roll, is similar to the 2 nd disk target orbit to avoid driving breathing modes with large changes in spacecraft β angle. For each visit, columns <ref type="bibr">4 &amp; 6</ref> in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> indicate the total number of WedgeA-0.6 &amp; WedgeA-1.0 exposures taken in the three same-epoch disk visits (or single PSF visit) followed in columns 5 and 7 by the corresponding total integration time. In detail, from visit-to-visit and between the two epochs the exposure times in particular for the WedgeA-1.0 images are not always identical for the same targets due to variances in target visibility intervals at different times of the year and at different celestial orientations.

All raw image data were retrieved soon after the execution of each target/epoch visit set from MAST.</p><p>Basic image data calibration of each individual exposure in the raw data frames, including bias correction, dark subtraction, flat-fielding, linearity correction, and identification of instrumentally deficient and saturated pixels, was performed using the STSDAS calstisa software 4 as routinely used in the HST/OPUS pipeline. Initial basic instrumental pipeline processing is usually done by STScI immediately following the epoch of observation with bias and dark reference files that often are "stale" and do not best reflect the observationally contemporaneous state of the instrument. Thus, prior to final reduction and PSF subtraction, all raw images were re-calibrated using later-obtained (by STScI as part of the Cycle 19/20 calibration program) bias and dark reference data closer to the dates of actual observations subsequently provided to us through STScI's Calibration Database System 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Visit-Level Reduction</head><p>All instrumentally calibrated frames were visually inspected to check for (compensate if possible, or vet if necessary) any significant imaging performance anomalies such as exceptionally high cosmic-ray event hit rates (e.g., in V45 3 rd WedgeA-1.0 exposure) and loss of two-FGS fine-lock pointing control (e.g., in V62 loss of two WedgeA-0.6 exposures and curtailment of one WedgeA-1.0 exposure). Sky backgrounds were estimated from manually selected regions in the periphery of the field far from the target star/disk and not coincident with any stars/galaxies in the field, and subtracted. Within each visit, separately, the multipleexposure data obtained at each of the two Wedge A occulter positions were median combined for cosmic ray rejection and diminishment of random instrumental and photon noise compared to stellar/disk signal, and then converted to count rate images based on shutter open times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Locating the Target Star</head><p>Because of systematic limitations in the HST on-board autonomous target acquisition process, the final targeting slew to place the target star at the desired location in the STIS 50CCD field can deviate by ~ ± 1 pixel (50 mas) from a fixed fiducial position w.r.t. the grid of detector pixels, and typically by ~ ± 0.25 pixels from the deployable focal plane coronagraphic mask nominal target location. Thus, prior to later two-Wedge position and multi-roll image combination, and subsequent star/disk relative astrometric measures, the location of the coronagraphically occulted target star in visit-level median-combined science image aperture frame (SIAF) must be determined to astrometrically high precision. No direct (unocculted) image of the star itself (other than a target acquisition image at a different field position and with an attenuating filter in place, both insufficient for this purpose) was possible at its post-slew position used for science imaging due to saturation limits from the bright target stars. Thus, we used the previously demonstrated "X marks the spot" method (c.f., <ref type="bibr">Schneider et al. 2009 § 4.2)</ref> to determine the location of the coronagraphically occulted star. We use the bright (but unsaturated) orthogonal HST diffraction spikes, unsuppressed by the STIS coronagraph, that are rotated ~ ± 45° from the occulting wedge axis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>) and with respect to the STIS 50CCD SIAF x/y pixel grid. The target star position in each visit-level frame is typically located with an experimentally determined precision w.r.t. the SIAF frame of ~ 4 -5 mas (~ 0.1 pixels) RMS. These diffraction spike determined stellar centroids are subsequently used to initially co-register intra-visit target images acquired at their differing WedgeA-0.6 and 1.0 positions. They are also used (following PSF-subtraction) for inter-visit (multiple roll) image alignment at a common-origin, astrometrically-determined, stellocentric reference position (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2B</ref>) against which disk substructures can be located w.r.t. the position of the host star (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2C</ref>) with high precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Visit-Level PSF-Subtractions</head><p>The subtraction of PSF template images from those of the disk-hosting stars follows the process described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. The iterative global PSF-subtraction process, treating template brightness and X/Y positions as free parameters, is initially done with target and template images in the detector frame orientation (so disk features rotate in the PSFsubtracted frames from visit to visit at different spacecraft roll angles). A representative full set of visit-level PSF subtracted images (optimized to globally minimize residuals from PSFsubtraction) is shown for HD 181327 WedgeA-0.6 and 1.0 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 3 and 4</ref>, respectively. PSF templates (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for details). 6.2" x 6.0" sub-array regions shown with a linear display from -1.0 (black) to +7.0 (white) cts s -1 pixel -1 . Central red circle overlaid is r = 0.3" centered on the occulted position of the star. PSF template (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for details). Not all visits for a given target result in PSF-subtracted images with the same image quality.</p><p>For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> the visit 16 (panel E) PSF-subtracted image of the HD 181327 debris ring is most free of the radial "tendril"-like artifacts that typify differences in HST "breathing" (driving differential wavefront focus errors), while the visit 11 (panel A) image is most affected by a breathing phase differential. It is not unusual for the first visit in an imaging set to have larger breathing residuals, in particular if the thermal state of the telescope is significantly changing following a slew from a different location in the sky from a preceding observation. The relatively low level of dispersion seen amongst the two sets of six HD 181327 images (WedgeA-0.6 and 1.0) is typical. However, significantly degraded results, despite all efforts for "PSF matching", can occur with episodes of large "breathing" excursions.</p><p>Apart from "breathing" residuals, the on-board autonomous coronagraphic target acquisition process attempts to place targets on the mid-line of the occulting wedge. Because of repeatability limitations in the STIS slit wheel that deploys a retractable focal plane mask used for coronagraphic observations, target placement "behind" the wedge can vary by typically ~ ¼ pixel on initial placement in each visit, as we see in the GO 12228 data and as previously reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kriss et al. 2013</ref>. As a result, there is often a brightness differential from the PSF halo at the opposite side wedge edges that can change both in brightness and parity from acquisition to acquisition. With PSF-subtraction this can result in positive and negative edge gradients that can extend over several pixels thus increasing the innermost working angle otherwise possible beyond the physical (0.3" from the mid-line) limit of the WedgeA-0.6 mask, and the reach of the image saturation region with WedgeA-1.0. This can be seen, for example, in the visit 14 imaging of the HD 181327 debris ring <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3</ref>, panel C) where wedge-edge brightness gradients saturate the regions immediately exterior to the wedge edges a few pixels beyond the r = 0.3" physical limit of the wedge. In the visit 15 imaging <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3</ref>, panel D) exactly the opposite parity (but with similar reach) is seen -indicative of a relative displacement of the target and template stars w.r.t. the mid-line of the wedge. Finally, in this regard, the visit 16 imaging <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3</ref>, panel E) had no perceptible difference in target/template star relative decentering.</p><p>Serendipitously, the visit 16 image as previously noted, was also least subject to breathing effects, so in combination this represents a near best-case for PSF-subtraction performance in the face of instrumentally induced residuals due to both breathing and decentering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Chromatic Correction and Self-Referential PSF Templates</head><p>Despite best efforts in the selection of PSF template stars with "color matching" of optical color indices from catalog photometry, chromatic residuals in PSF subtraction can, sometimes, still appear. In such cases the dominant stellocentric residual patterns manifest themselves as intensity modulated (bright and dark) circular "rings" that are readily apparent in debris systems viewed edge-on, or nearly so where there is little or no disk flux in the chromatically affected off-disk background. These annular-like chromatic residuals are invariant in the frame of the detector, as the (spacecraft) orientation angle on the sky is changed (i.e., where the residuals are revealed in azimuthal angle relative to the position angle of the disk on the sky). By using diskmasked image combinations at multiple rolls to map and characterize these residuals in median combination, an empirical chromatic correction to apply after PSF-subtraction can be obtained.</p><p>We have done this in the cases of HD 32297 ( § A.3) and AU Mic ( § A.10) where we discuss this in detail. In the case of edge-on AU Mic disk, we investigated and compared this approach to a "similar" one alternatively using the off-disk portions of the disk-masked AU Mic halo (including one with the disk fully "hidden" behind the occulting wedge) as its own, composited, PSF template -thus fully eliminating any differential chromatic effects. We discuss the efficacy of this approach in light of potential concerns of "self-subtraction" of the disk if incompletely or imperfectly masked in the creation of a composite PSF template also in section § A.10.</p></div>

On an individual target basis, however, we reject images (or visits) that suffer performance degradation due to anomalous breathing excursions or other operational issues.</p><p>Such cases are noted in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> footnotes, and discussed for individual targets in Appendix A.</p><p>With the optimization of the PSF-subtraction free parameters (∆X, ∆Y, and template brightness scaling) established at the visit-level in the SIAF image orientation, all WedgeA-0.6 and 1.0 images are translated to a common stellocentric origin based upon target image "X marks the spot" centroids, and rotated to a common celestial ("north up") orientation (based upon down-linked engineering telemetry derived from the HST pointing control system). Image translation and rotation is accomplished by remapping the original images onto an output pixel grid via bi-cubic pixel interpolation apodized by a sinc-function of kernel width commensurate with the ~60 mas FWHM of the STIS/50CCD PSF (to prevent "ringing" with less than critical sampling in some pixels). Once all images are co-aligned and in a common celestial frame and PSF-subtracted, image-specific digital masks were created ("manually" crafted for each PSFsubtracted image using the IDP3 software "mask builder") to individually exclude "bad" pixels from each image that were: (a) obscured by the STIS coronagraphic wedges A or B, (b) corrupted by OTA diffraction spikes, (c) saturated close to the star (typically as planned in WedgeA-1.0 imaging, or due to non-ideal target centering), or (d) suspect in calibratability at or very near the physical edge of occulting wedge. (For an idealized illustration, of (a) and (b) only using only a single wedge and optimal differential rolls, see, c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> of Debes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Perrin and Schneider, 2013)</ref>. These artifact-masked images are then median combined into an Analysis Quality (AQ) data image comprised of either just the WedgeA-0.6 or WedgeA-1.0 input images, or both utilizing all unrejected data.</p><p>In final AQ image combination using both Wedge A 0.6 and 1.0 data, we typically truncate the radial extent of the WedgeA-0.6 images at a (target dependent) radius of ~45 -60 pixels (r ≈ 2.5″ -3″) beyond which the short exposure time WedgeA-0.6 images typically become photon starved and would contribute only noise in comparison to 10-20 x more deeply exposed WedgeA-1.0 images. With less complete spatial coverage, we also separately create "epoch 1"</p><p>and "epoch 2" AQ images to enable comparative analysis for temporal variations between the two epochs within the disk (e.g., see MP Mus, § A.11) or for identification of background objects with non-common proper motions.</p><p>In addition to these AQ images themselves, for analysis purposes we also propagate and keep in ancillary images for every pixel: (a) the number of images contributing to every output pixel, (b) the standard deviation about the masked-median median, and (with the matched data masks) (c) the total exposure time in each pixel contributing to the final AQ images.</p></div>

A Multi-roll Residual Removal Routine (MRRR) for doing so is presented, discussed, and demonstrated in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stark et al. (2014)</ref>.

The applicability and efficacy of the MRRR approach is dependent upon the target scene and the roll-angle overlapping of unmasked field coverage at each roll. MRRR is best for disks where such imprinted patterns are independently detectable with significance in the relative absence of disk-flux in the instrument-frame images (before rotating to a common celestial orientation). In such images while the disk-flux is re-oriented on the detector in the images acquired at different spacecraft rolls, the quasi-static PSF-structure remains rotationally invariant. In the context of the well-suited observations of the HD 181327 debris ring, following the application of MRRR, Stark et al, ibid, found a reduction in the photometric measurement uncertainties along its debris ring of ~ 5%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Comparison with HST/ACS Observations</head><p>While the large angular extent of the ACS coronagraphic masks (r = 0.9" and r = 1.8") preclude CS observations at small IWA's the instrument (unlike NICMOS) does provide a coronagraphic FOV comparable to STIS. This has been used advantageously for (angularly) large CS debris systems, but is significantly less efficient than STIS. For example, the full extent of the HD Nebulosity in the STIS image is traced to stellocentric distances of 9.5" with more complete sampling about the star, better image fidelity, and higher sensitivity to low surface-brightness light-scattering material in the outermost, photon-limited, portions of the HD 181327 debris system. The STIS instrument's near full-throughput pupil (compared to ~ 50% for ACS in its coronagraphic mode), and unfiltered spectral sensitivity (∆λ/λ = 75%, compared to 25% for ACS/F606W) together provide an ≈ 6x gain in exposure depth per unit integration time. For these STIS observations, with the additional investment in exposure time of a factor ≈ 4.5x over the ACS images, an improvement in exposure depth by a factor of ≈ x27 and photon-limited S/N of ≈ x5.2 by was realized in the outer-disk photon-limited regime (as closely predicted by the STSDAS/SYNPHOT synthetic photometry instrument models). STIS, however, having only an unfiltered coronagraphic mode provides no diagnostic "color" information as with ACS multiband imaging. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The smallest of the ACS coronagraphic masks (used in the HD 181327 scattered-light disk co-discovery imaging, panel A) provides r &lt; 0.9" IWA obscuration. However, ACS PSF-subtraction residuals completely dominate the disk light interior to the radius of the peak SB of the ring (r = 1.7") revealed by NICMOS PSFTSC (see The improvement in image quality and gains in S/N with STIS multi-roll PSFTFC, enable higher precision measurements of the spatial and SB distributions of the CS materials in, and possibly escaping from, these debris system with more comprehensive, and better observationally constrained, analysis and modeling than possible with the original discovery images alone. For example, in the above case of HD 181327, differences now observable in scattering phase functions in the ring and in the outer halo further suggests the presence of an unseen, planetary-mass perturber that may lie exterior to the ring. Additionally, these improved data have resulted in the putative discovery of a debris "spiral", or spray of ejecta, from a posited recent massive collision in the exo-Kuiper Belt of HD 181327 debris system. Both of these findings are discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stark et al. (2014)</ref>, with the observational data presented for this, and the other disks in this sample, herein. With these data, we are now at the point of directly imaging phenomena postulated as important in the evolution of our Solar System, bringing the analysis of exoplanetary systems with HST into a new regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Comparison with Ground-based Observations</head><p>Ground-based coronagraphs on large, AO-augmented, telescopes are currently capable of revealing the brightest features of CS debris systems that possess strong local contrast gradients (rather than diffuse, extended flux). This is well exampled with the HD 61005 debris system. The HD 61005 ("the Moth") debris system was first imaged with HST/NICMOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hines et al. 2007</ref>), and its brightest features with strong SB gradients have now been imaged from the ground. The NICMOS discovery image showed a bright, but diffuse, skirt of material apparently "blown" off an inner disk viewed nearly edge-on. The skirt of escaping material could be traced 6" from the star, with a brightness (inferred surface density) enhancement posited from a bow-shock on the "front" edge of the debris system in the direction of its relative motion running into an ISM-wind.</p><p>ACS optical coronagraphic polarimetry better revealed the outer portions of the debris disk, the fan of material, and the "limb-brightened" edge of the blow-out fan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Maness et al. (2009)</ref> found the optical-to-nIR disk color blue, and the polarization properties of the outer parts of the disk and skirt were different; in particular, with the skirt dominated by small, compact, lightscattering particles. Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Buenzli et al. (2010)</ref> imaged the brightest (lowest contrast) features of the HD 61005 debris system using VLT/NaCo with ADI and LOCI image processing, resolving the disk as a highly inclined debris ring, and measured its apparent eccentricity, and thus inclination, as 84.3°± 1.0° and suggested a 2.75"±0.85" AU photocentric offset. A crisp inner edge to the ring was inferred, but the skirt of blow-out material was not observed. Our STIS 6-roll PSFTSC imagery (see § A.5): fully discloses the skirt and the forward (higher optical-depth) limb-brightened bow-shock; resolves both the "forward" and "back" sides of the debris ring (similar on its bright side to that seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Buenzli et al. 2010)</ref>; the ring inner clearing; recovers the photocentric offset; and reveals, for the first time, that the disk is a three component system. In addition to the ring-like disk and fan, there is an additional disk component of material beyond the launch point for the fan, which is interpreted an analog to the scattered Kuiper Belt ( <ref type="bibr">Hines et al. 2014, in preparation)</ref>. We also image interior to the ring, finding a largely cleared zone down to 10 AU from the star. The debris ring, as seen in the STIS imagery, is coincident with the planetesimal belt resolved at sub-mm wavelengths ( <ref type="bibr">Ricarte et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">"Comparison" with Thermal IR Excess as a Predictor of Optical Brightness</head><p>IR excess emission above stellar photospheric levels is the signature of re-radiating CS dust attributable to orbiting exoplanetary debris for the majority of systems. Thus, over the past 16 years, HST coronagraphic imaging surveys designed to discover optical/near-IR light-scattering counterparts to (mostly) thermally emissive debris disks have targeted nearby stars with the brightest 12-100 µm thermal IR excesses. These candidate systems were identified from spacebased surveys (e.g., ISO, IRAS, and Spitzer and Herschel photometry and/or spectral energy distributions). In nearly all cases, only IR excess sources with L IR /L star &gt; 10 -4 , as a presumed order of magnitude proxy to a priori unknown optical/near-IR scattering fractions (F disk /F star ), were targeted with anticipation of high survey yields. This was a "conservative" selection criterion given then anticipated (but initially not well quantified) contrast-limited coronagraphic imaging sensitivity to disk-scattered starlight with HST's coronagraphically augmented instruments.</p><p>Collectively, however, (only) ~ 15% of candidate debris systems surveyed were found to possess CS dust with high enough SB to be detected with HST coronagraphy as conducted in a diversity disk-finding survey programs. Only two-dozen spatially-resolved starlight-scattering debris disks emerged from 1998 -2013; most recently with a few previously observed, initially undetected, but newly discovered with advanced re-processing techniques. This relatively low success rate underscores that thermal IR excess alone is not a good predictor of the fraction of starlight scattered by a CS debris disk into the observers line-of-sight (e.g., see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>   For detectable disks, a loose correlation between IR excess and optical/near-IR scattering fraction exists (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref> for the debris systems observed in this sample). This is particularly the case for systems with ages &lt; 100 Myr, and excluding specific systems, like AU Mic, where radiation pressure blowout of small dust particles is negligible. On an individual target basis, with additional dependences, L IR /L star is only a weak predictor of SB and detectability in spatially resolvable light-scattering disks. Grain properties (optical constants), the dust density distribution, the viewing geometry of any disk, and systemic age, can lower disk visibility (contrast) globally, or for sub-structures within, in a complex manner unpredictable without a foreknowledge of those systemic parameters. Additionally, CS debris systems with very similar spectral energy distributions can have vastly different systemic morphologies, geometries, and dust density distributions uniquely informed by spatially resolved imaging. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Observational Results</head><p>The GO 12228 targets constitute a follow-up sample of previously discovered light-scattering CS debris systems and thus excludes "non-detections". A gallery of disk images (discussed in detail in Appendix A) that highlight their morphological diversities is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref>. The ability to discern with clarity sub-structures within these disks, depends not only upon global or large spatial scale disk-to-star contrasts, but also on localized disk signal gradients in the presence of any remaining PSF-subtraction artifacts. I.e., lower contrast substructures (e.g., rings, gap edges, and perceptively edge-on mid-plane regions), are typically more readily detectible (with sufficient integration time) than diffuse, extended features. The latter remain elusive in ground-based images reliant on aggressively advanced locally optimized PSF subtraction/calibration methods such as LOCI, KLIP, and (observationally) ADI that do not preserve disk flux on spatial scales larger than the dominant spatial frequencies of the detectable, lower contrast and spatially localized, disk features. Simply, these methods, though of utility for disk imaging, do not preserve low SB extended flux and typically render such features undetectable. Conversely, the gallery of GO 12228 debris disk images presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref>, derived from STIS multi-roll PSFTSC, are immune to these post-processing effects. These images may be used directly not only to characterize and quantify disk, and disk grain, properties but as "truth" (within their own levels of efficacy and uncertainties) in assessing independent results from ground-based coronagraphs with advanced processing techniques that intrinsically spatially filter disk images. The disk images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref> are presented at differing angular scales due to the differences in target distances with our goal of representing well the debris system morphologies both individually and comparatively. Each disk, and its observationally derived characterizing parameters, is discussed in more detail in Appendix A.</p><p>The primary morphological, geometric, and photometric characteristics of the disks, derived from these images, are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. Disk inclinations (i), except for those very close to edge or face on, and major-axis celestial position angles (PA), are estimated photometrically from stellocentric elliptical isophote fitting. Inner working distances (IWD) are the closest stellocentric distances to which the CS brightness could be measured. The radial extent of the debris systems with large halos are expressed to where the disk flux declines to +3 σ resel -1 of the background far from the disk; Inner (i) and outer (o) radii are separately estimated for disks with concentric components. Total (disk integrated) flux density measurements (F disk ) and scattering fractions (F disk /F star ) at the STIS 50CCD pivot wavelength of 0.57 µm fully enclose the disks, but exclude the small areas unsampled at and interior to the IWD (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 41</ref>). For F star we assume catalog V-band magnitudes, as given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, transformed into the STIS 50CCD spectral band ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). Note that F disk /F star is simply an observationally derived parameter, along the line-of-sight to the observer. For moderately to highly inclined systems, the IWA could conceal a significant fraction of the potentially (otherwise) observable scattered flux, in particular if the dust is highly forward scattering. * inner "half-ring" ~ 80°, extended un-bifurcated disk edge-on; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> we plot the disk-to-star signal contrast as a function of stellocentric angular distance along the disk major axis where the disks are brightest (or nearly so) in CS azimuthal angle on both sides of the star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> is presented in dimensionless contrast units (to facilitate comparison and scaling in other instrumental systems), per the definition of image contrast in §4.</p><p>To the extent the CS light-scattering material may be spectrally neutral across the STIS passband (that cannot be ascertained from these data alone, but in general deviations will be only small), these contrast curves may be closely transformed to photometric SBs at the 50CCD pivot wavelength of 0.57 µm by multiplying by 0.178 mJy arcsec -2 .</p><p>For most disks, their SBs decline radially from IWAs along the major axis of &gt; 0.3" to the outermost disk regions ~ 10" (or where the noise level declines to ~ 3 σ resel -1 over the sky background) by typically ~ 4 dex. At common stellocentric distances, the diversity in debris disk</p><p>SBs amongst the sample varies at the extrema from the highest to lowest contrast disks by ~ 3 dex. The highest contrast disks, e.g. HD 139664 and HD 92945, prove a contrast challenge to STIS PSFTSC at the smallest stellocentric distances and in some cases, in particular with &lt; 6</p><p>rolls, a mask-limited IWA minimum = 0.3" is not reached. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> is of particular utility to those considering future coronagraph designs, and disk imaging programs, where instrumental performance is a prime consideration, hence it is cast in stellocentric angular distance, although each of the debris systems are at different physical distances from the Earth. Such curves may be applied directly to instrument performance models to assess disk visibilities and to derive integration time requirements for fainter disks with scalable S/N. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives the GO 12228 target distances in parsecs, to readily allow transformation of stellocentric angle into astronomical units for each of the disks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref>.

These may be</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</formula><p>qualitatively compared with another first-light total intensity HR 4796A debris ring image from SPHERE 7 .</p><p>Ground-based "total intensity" imaging of CS debris disks, today, however, generally requires observing, and/or post-processing methods, such as ADI, or LOCI/KLIP for contrast enhancement that do not preserve the flux (polarized, or in technically feasible cases, total intensity) in spatially extended regions and with shallow contrast gradients. Thus, the highest fidelity images with recoverable total-light photometry remains, currently, in the domain of space-based coronagraphy, and in particular the highest efficacy yet demonstrated with STIS multi-roll PSFTSC.</p><p>With HST, PSF-subtraction residuals from chromatism and wavefront error instability (breathing) effects can be minimized with judicious PSF template star selection, and observation scheduling and design allowing the "effective" IWA to approach the physical limit of the occulting mask, i.e., r = 0.3" for STIS WedgeA-0.6. Thus, resolving angularly small inner debris rings, centrally cleared regions in CS disks, and constraining their inclinations may be done also with photometric robustness in total light and without need for advanced processing techniques that do not spatially conserve the target flux. In comparison to techniques such as principal component analysis, our variant on classical (global) PSF subtraction does not require an existing a priori geometrical model for the debris system. This is likely to be particularly valuable for systems that have only been resolved at longer wavelengths or those whose debris disks are inferred only from IR excesses; e.g., the many newly-identified debris systems discovered from WISE observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Patel et al. 2014</ref>), or those which are spatially resolved by Herschel, but for which optical imagery does not exist.</p><p>Imaging the outer, faint and diffuse, regions of CS disks, where small particles may be escaping the system or interacting with the ISM is also difficult (if not problematic in most cases) from the ground where Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) facilitates observations. ADI data are obtained as suites of exposures where the rotation of the system on the sky enables the high-contrast detection of sources. ADI relies on azimuthal median filtering where the angular size of the source is less then the system rotation in individual images. Exposure times are limited by the need to avoid rotational smearing, which increases in tangential scale at larger stellocentric distances. ADI is very effective for point sources, i.e., exoplanets in close angular</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 7</formula><p>http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1417/ proximity to their host stars (~ 10s to 100s AU in physical scale in these disks). However, ADIassisted detection of CS debris suffers for systems lacking small spatial scale sub-structures and without locally strong brightness gradients (e.g., face-on disks and those with large, diffuse, outer disk halos), and in particular for stellocentric regions beyond about 2". These issues do not arise with HST.!With HST, "maximum" exposure times are set by Earth-occultation interruptions, or splitting long integrations for cosmic-ray detection and correction, and are on the order of a ks or longer. Total integration times for 6-roll observations are typically &gt;10 ks and thus with sufficient S/N in the outer disks to map faint outer halos, tracing either loosely bound particles, or those which are being actively ejected from the system. !</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">All Debris Systems are NOT the Same</head><p>The imagery presented in this paper shows systems with debris rings of different widths, morphological and SB asymmetries, sub-structures, broader debris disks, and debris systems with blow-out structures that do not imprint conspicuous signatures in their SEDs, in submillimeter observations, or in FIR thermal emission. These data further suggest that environmental interactions of the outer portions of debris disks with the ISM also appear to be common ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Debes et al. 2014</ref>, in preparation).</p><p>Posited implications for other debris system features and sub-structures, revealed by the images we have obtained, are discussed on a target-by-target basis in Appendix A. Therein we demonstrate the analytic and interpretive potential of such high-fidelity optical coronagraphic imaging of CS material uniquely enabled with STIS multiroll PSFTSC. These images highlight the fact that debris disks are highly dynamic and complex environments. The picture that emerges, even from this small sample of previously imaged debris disks, is one of system-tosystem diversity, perhaps matching the diversity of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems known from RV and transit studies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref> clearly illustrates the diversity in debris system global morphologies and architectures (separate from those expected from simple line-of-sight inclination effects) as well as asymmetries and sub-structures. We comment on several below.</p><p>(a) Ring-Like Disks: Ring-like features in CS debris systems are readily, and unambiguously, observable in CS disks with favorable (intermediate to face-on) viewing geometries when they exist, such as in HD 92945 ( § A.6), HD 107146 ( § A.7), and HD 181327 ( § A.9). The improved inner working angle of our data compared to previous HST observations, has resulted in imaging rings also in the nearly edge-on systems HD 61005 ( § A.5) and (partially detected in) HD 15115</p><p>( § A.1). Even in our small sample of systems, the ring architectures are diverse and range from:</p><p>broad and low SB in HD 107146; a narrow ring with an outer diffuse and very low SB component in HD 92945; an extremely bright ring with a extended and highly asymmetric outer component in HD 61005; a narrow and very bright ring seen in HD 181327; and an (apparently)</p><p>extreme "front/back" brightness asymmetry in HD 15115. These five disks are also extremely diverse in scattering fractions from F disk / F star = 0.25% for HD 61005 to 0.005% for HD 92945, though these two disks in particular have rings of approximately the same physical size (r ~ 60 AU) and are of similar estimated ages (~ 100 -200 My). Conversely the broad ring of sun-like star HD 107146, though with a similar spectral type host star as HD 61005, is ~ 2x as large.</p><p>Despite their specific differences, the prevalence of such structures of sufficient brightness to be imaged (seen in other debris disk as well, e.g., HR 4796A and Fomalhaut), suggest they are common features in debris systems.</p><p>(b) Highly Asymmetric Disks: The HD 61005 debris ring was not resolved in the lower spatial resolution scattered-light discovery imaging in the near-IR with NICMOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hines et al. 2007</ref>), due to its nearly edge-on inclination (nor with ACS due to its large IWA). Those observations, however, revealed a large "skirt" of likely small-grain material (earning it the name of "the Moth" by its morphology), attributed to material escaping the system posited by ISM ram pressure ejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hines et. al 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mannes et al 2009)</ref>. This suggested that prior modeling and interpretation of debris disk dynamics and evolution, as isolated systems, was deficient.</p><p>Environmental interactions could be important and must considered, e.g.: chemical evolution of the disk material by ISM "pollution"; compositional evolution and differentiation by stripping of small particles from the disk; and thus mass loss (disk erosion) over time by systemically extrinsic (as well as prior considered intrinsic) forces. The GO 12228 AQ images better revealed the HD 61005 debris system structures, but also three other examples of disks, two at an nearly edge on viewing geometry, HD 15115 and HD 32297 ( § A.3), and the prior described "fan-like" disk of HD 15745 ( § A.2), where ISM/environmental interactions may be responsible for their morphologies. Low S/N detection of diffuse material also beyond the outer edges of the HR 4796 A ( <ref type="bibr">Thalmann et al. 2011</ref>), and Fomalhaut ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kalas et al. 2013</ref>) debris rings, suggest that such structures may be common, and potentially important in understanding debris disk evolution and dynamics.</p><p>(c) Out-of-Plane features/sub-structures in edge-on Disks: Disks viewed edge-on (or nearly so) while (at least partially) self-obscuring the in-plane inner disk regions, fortuitously provide a most favorable geometry for readily studying "out of plane" CS material without ambiguities.</p><p>The prototypical β Pictoris edge-on debris system sports a strong "warp" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Heap et al. 2000)</ref>, or inclined (out-of-plane) secondary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Golimowski et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Apai et al. 2014</ref>). Its origin is posited as possibly arising from a forcing interaction with its interior, imaged, co-orbiting giant planet, β Pic b and/or yet undetected additional planets in the system. In AU Mic ( § A.10), we detect an out-of-plane "bump" (SB and presumed dust density enhancement) on just one side of the disk at ~ 13 AU, but with an asymmetric warp about the disk minor axis that may be difficult to explain in the absence of one or more co-orbiting planets. HD 15115 is viewed nearly-edge on (but not quite so by a few degrees). While no such features are seen in the inner disk, the outer disk on one side only, appears intriguingly bifurcated at large stellocentric distance whose origin remains (at this time) only speculative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Novel Structures and Behaviors in Older Protoplanetary Disks</head><p>While small-particle material originating in debris disks can be seen ejected to large stellocentric distances (with some likely escaping from some systems), distant material associated with protoplanetary disks informs on the evolutionary history, and particularly the star-forming environment, of the host-star system. Large, remnant proto-stellar envelopes have previously been observed at stellar ages of 4 Myr (AB Aur, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Grady et al. 1999</ref>) and at 10 Myr (HD 100546, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grady et al. 2001)</ref>, in association with intermediate-mass stars. The scale of these structures suggests system formation in isolation, and without a history of dynamical perturbations, and again highlights structures inconspicuous at longer wavelengths, and that do not leave a footprint in the disk IR excess. The data for MP Mus ( § A.11) obtained in this survey provide not only a superb image of the disk of this system ready for detailed modeling that can be compared to co-eval systems in the TW Hya association, but also provides evidence for a remnant envelope, indicating that at least some T Tauri stars form in isolation as profound as some of the nearest Herbig Ae stars. Our observation of MP Mus also demonstrates the utility of the observational approach for studying spatially resolved temporal variability in disk-surface illumination.!</p></div>

The inner disk, however, revealed at similar optical wavelengths enabling spatially The asymmetric "needle"-like morphology of the HD 15115 disk, as originally suggested by , is confirmed also into the inner regions unseen previously in the optical.</p><p>However, the suggestion of a more azimuthally symmetric disk, as inferred from the H-band NIRC2 image, is not confirmed, and instead suggests that the symmetrical structure appearing in the ground-based Keck AO image may be an artifact from imperfect wavefront error control and starlight rejection. In addition to the E/W asymmetry in disk extent along the major axis as previously noted, three other very significant disk features are seen in the STIS AQ image:</p><p>(1) The "bowing", or concavity, of the disk along the minor axis to the north of the star scattering surface of an inner debris ring, viewed in nearly edge-on projection, that may be at least partially cleared; See schematic suggestion of a posited inner ring component in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> (inset). The "invisibility" of the opposing (southern) side suggests a very high HenyeyGreenstein scattering asymmetry parameter or dust obscuration through an incompletely cleared inner disk component. Detailed modeling will be needed to arbitrate the possibilities. A similar structure, with a more well-defined central clearing and lesser "front/back" scattering asymmetry, was revealed for the nearly-edge on debris system of HD 61005 ( § A.5).</p><p>(2) On the east side of the debris structure, the light scattered from the dust appears to be bifurcated away from the inferred disk major axis direction. This is indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11C</ref> by the two dashed lines annotating these disk features. The origin of this feature is uncertain, but could be due to a line-of-site opacity enhancement of the dust in that direction. We note more welldefined bifurcated structures associated with the outer disk of HD 61005 as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 23C</ref>. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> There is a significant out-of-plane (vertical) extension in the scattered light distribution at r ~ 2.5" above (to the north of) the disk plane only on the west side of the star, i.e. the region in green as stretched in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> B to the NW of the star.</p><p>All three of these asymmetries must be modeled (and reproduced) prior to ascertaining which of the prior posited asymmetry mechanisms (stellar perturbation, recent episodic collisions, or ISM interaction) may be dominantly causal, though this is beyond the scope this paper.  Introductory Notes. HD 15745 is an ~ 100 My old F2V star for which an extended scattered light disk with a "fan"-shaped morphology was reported by  based on ACS coronagraphic imaging (reproduced in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13A</ref>).</p><p>Observations and PSF Subtraction -Tortured History. The first of the two initially planned sets of observations of HD 15745 and its PSF star executed 2011-Nov-05. The three disk-target orbits (V75, V76 &amp; V78) executed nominally. However, the guide star acquisition for V77-the contemporaneous interleaved PSF template observation-failed and no PSF data were obtained. This full set of observations was then rescheduled as Visits B5 -B8 with a different set of guide stars on 2012-Nov-03. The second set of observations (Visits 71 -74) executed nominally on 2012-Jan-02. However, the PSF star was then found to be an a priori unknown close binary with the companion sufficiently bright to render its unsuitable as a PSF template. Thus, prior to the repeat of the originally failed set of observations, six orientations of target imaging data had been obtained, but without a suitable PSF template star. The 2012-Nov-03 earlier-failed observations re-executed nominally, with a PSF template (VB7) that proved to be an excellent match for its flanking contemporaneous visits. An attempt was made to use the VB7 PSF template for both the non-contemporaneous disk imaging data obtained in Visits 71 -74 and 75 -78. In combination with visits B5, B6, &amp; B8, visits 71, 72, &amp; 74 would provide complete roll coverage. Visit 75, 76, &amp; 78 were respectively redundant with the repeated visits B5, B6, &amp; B8, but could in principle improve the S/N with replicated observations. Unfortunately (though reductions were attempted), the VB7 PSF was badly mis-matched in breathing phase relative to the visit 71, 72, &amp; 74 data. Though after its application, a scattered-light disk could be seen in these data, the PSF subtracted images were riddled with artifacts not suitable for combination with the much more successful Visit (B5, B6, B8) PSF-subtracted images. PSF subtractions from the visit 75, 76, 78 data were somewhat better qualitatively, but still significantly inferior to those obtained at exactly the same roll angles in visits B5, B6, &amp; B8, and could not be used to further improve the data in combination. Other PSF templates obtained in the GO 12228 program were tested as well, but none produced visit 7* PSF-subtracted images of sufficient quality to combine for additional roll coverage with the successful visit B* images. Hence, the fully reduced AQ data images of the HD 15745 disk-unlike the other AQ images in this program-are combined from only three differently oriented visits (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for details). Nevertheless, the data quality and spatial coverage, though not fully complete closest to the star, are both very good and the resulting 3R/PSFTSC combined image shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13A</ref>/B was used to ascertain the principal metrical results discussed below.</p><p>Principal Observational Results. The STIS 3R/PSFTSC AQ image of the HD 15745 CS debris disk, to first order, appears have a "featureless," bi-laterally symmetric, morphology about the disk axes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14, left)</ref>. There are no visually apparent sub-structures evident in the disk, which appears smoothly contiguous, radially and azimuthally, with no turn-over or "central clearing" of the disk radial SB to a smallest IWA effective of appx r = 0.3", but with a posited break in the NE side radial SB profile at r ~ 1.2" (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>) under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Debes et. al 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The celestial orientation of the major axis of the disk appears ~ 22.5° (E of N), with a brightminor to semi-major axial ratio of the disk of ≈ 0.615 as determined from fitting photometric isophotes (e.g., see illustration of best-fit 1 ct s -1 pixel -1 SB contour in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14, left panel)</ref>. For an intrinsically circularly symmetric disk, this axial ratio implies a disk inclination of ≈ 52° from face-on. The estimated center of the disk, also determined from isophotal ellipse fitting, appears offset from the position of the star by 0.258" (16.4 AU projected) along the disk minor axis toward the SW-indicative of strong directionally preferential scattering by the disk material. This significant offset and front/back scattering phase asymmetry in SB, in combination with longer wavelength data, can be modeled to better constrain the physical properties of the lightscattering debris. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>. Left: Geometrical/isophote elliptical fit to the HD 15745 CS disk, in comparison to the location of the star (red circle) offset along the disk minor axis is indicative of very strong directionally preferential scattering by the disk material. The ellipse-fit is to the 0.8 cts s -1 pixel -1 SB isophote (1 cts s -1 pixel -1 = 0.177 mJy arcsec -2 ), which is at r = 34.0 pixels (1.73") from the disk center along the major axis (with minor:major axial ratio 0.615). Right:</p><p>Radial SB profiles along the disk major axis are of common slope, but differ throughout in brightness suggesting a higher dust density distribution on the SW side of the star.</p><p>We measured the total flux density from the HD 15745 CS disk to a stellocentric angular distance of r &lt; 10", excluding the small unsampled area close to the star (shown in black in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.   14A</ref>) with IWD &lt; 19 AU as projected on the sky, as F disk = 3.26 mJy with an uncertainty of a few percent. The 0.57 µm disk scattering fraction (F disk / F star ) at r &gt; 0.3" is ≈ 0.092%. Ninety percent of the dust-scattered starlight is contained within r &lt; 3.55" (255 AU projected) of the star.</p><p>Diffuse material is seen with a SB 3 σ pixel -2 brighter than the background noise far from the disk to a distance of 6.8" along the disk major axis.</p><p>With the geometry of the light scattering disk established from the AQ image, we measured the disk major axis SB profile on both sides of the star <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 14, right panel)</ref>. Measurements were made in single pixel increments, in a 0.1" (2 pixels ≈ 1 resel) wide photometric aperture, ± ≈ 6" in length w.r.t. the disk minor axis as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14 (left panel)</ref>. The SW and NE side SB profiles have identical slopes. At all stellocentric angular distances, however, the SW side of the disk along the minor axis is brighter at the NE side by factors ≈ 3x at r = 0.6" to ~ 2x at r = 6.0". This global (large-scale) "scalable" brightness asymmetry suggests, possibly, a higher surface density of scattering grains on the SW side of the disk-perhaps from a recent collision, or stirred by planet(s) though other morphological signatures of potentially co-orbiting planets are not apparent.</p><p>The spatially unresolved point-object that appears superimposed upon the disk was undetected in the ACS discovery image due to the presence of strong PSF subtraction residuals in that region. The object was found to be a non-comoving background star based on differential proper motion measures using epoch 2004 NICMOS imaging <ref type="bibr">(GO 10177</ref>) in which the inner most portion of the disk (only) was only marginally detected. with a larger IWA of r ~ 5". I.e., the ground and HST images explored mutually exclusive domains in stellocentric distance. The asymmetric morphology and SB maps of the wide-field ground-based, and narrow-angle HST images, however, by extrapolation were strongly spatially correlated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 15B)</ref>, and suggested an unseen extended debris structure linking the inner disk seen by NICMOS with the enveloping nebulosity seen from the ground. <ref type="bibr">Kalas et al. (2005)</ref> suggested that the swept-back morphology of the high SB regions in the nebulosity, deviating in celestial PA from the linear extension of the HST-imaged inner disk, was due to a "sandblasting" interaction of the disk dust particles by the ISM or from perturbations from two nearby stars. The millimeter appearance of this system is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Maness et al. (2008)</ref>. best-fit model for the outer disk was for a minimum particle size of 2.1 µm, and a 1:2:3 ratio of silicates, carbonaceous material, and water ice with 90% porosity, although  argue that this particle mixture may not be consistent with L' imagery of the disk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 -HD 32297</head><p>Observations and PSF Subtraction -Details. Due to a proposal implementation error, the contemporaneous PSF template star scheduled with our HD 32297 orbits was B-V redder, ∆(B-V) = +0.19, than tolerable for unbiased PSF-subtraction. Fortuitously, off-rolled PSF selfsubtraction, using HD 32297 observed at different celestial roll angles as its own PSF template, revealed that the out-of-plane scattered light excess from the disk itself was asymmetrical originating with significance from nearly only one "half" of the disk, to the NW of the disk major axis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>). While the flux from the disk in such a self-subtraction may be partially entangled, and not fully photometrically preserved, this suggested an alternate strategy not unlike that adopted for AU Mic, that proved successful.  We thus created digital masks for each of the PSF-subtracted images ( Comparing the α Pic subtracted images in row E to the chromatically corrected images using our mis-begotten PSF star in row D, and in contrast to the uncorrected images in row A, clearly shows the efficacy of this approach. Note that we do not simply (alternatively) use α Pic as a PSF-template to build a multiple-roll AQ image, as in those subtractions (row E) breathing residuals dominate (i.e., the radial streaks in those images) that are very largely mitigated with the use of the (color mismatched, but corrected) PSF template star. The same is seen with all the WedgeA-1.0 imaging, and we proceed identically with both sets of images to produce the full WedgeA-0.6 and WedgeA-1.0 combined AQ data image. Principal Results. The STIS 6R/PSFTSC AQ image of the HD 32297 CS debris system, utilizing all data obtained from both Wedge occulter positions, is illustrated over its full spatial extent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 18</ref>. The STIS image indeed reveals a contiguous debris structure "connecting" the inner disk seen with HST/NICMOS and ground-based AO imaging, to the outer nebulosity observable with conventional ground-based coronagraphy, with unprecedented clarity. The STIS image shows a large, highly asymmetric, debris structure with complex substructures not previously revealed. Dust-scattered starlight is seen to asymmetrically extend to a distance of ~ 1560 AU from the star with 3 σ resel -1 detection significance w.r.t. the instrumental background noise at the extrema of the "swept back" extensions of the disk major axis. This is, physically, the largest debris system in the GO 12228 ten debris-disk sample. HD 32297 is also the "brightest" of the GO 12228 debris disks in terms of its total starlight scattering fraction with F disk /F star = 0.3%, and is intrinsically bright with a total 0.57 µm flux density of 6 mJy. The concentration of most of this debris-scattered starlight into a narrowly viewed edge-on disk within a few arcseconds of the star (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 18</ref> logarithmic SB contour image) makes the inner regions of the disk along its mid-plane a comparatively "low contrast" target accessible to ground-based coronagraphy. The most intriguing, and more technically challenging, features of the disk over a very large imaging dynamic (contrast) range are revealed (only) in the STIS image. To facilitate discussion of the debris system features, we present the AQ image, with the disk rotated to the image display horizontal in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 19</ref> with three different dynamic display stretches to fully illustrate the nature of the newly revealed debris system sub-structures.</p><p>(1) As previously noted, nearly all of the scattered-light flux from the disk originates from only one side of the star-to the NW, or "above" the plane of the disk, as presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 18.</ref> The large envelope of light-scattering debris above the disk plane has a complex, and asymmetrical morphology, as illustrated by the three different stretches used in panels A, B, and C, to highlight the dust at different stellocentric distances and scale heights above the disk midplane. As suggested for HD 61005 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hines et al. (2007)</ref>, and for HD 32297 by <ref type="bibr">Kalas et al. (2005)</ref>, this too could possibly be due to small particles in the HD 32297 being "ejected" from the debris system as it moves through, and interacts with, the local ISM.</p><p>(2) The most prominent (and brightest) part of the HD 32297 debris system are the two diametrically opposed, nearly linear, extensions of the main disk seen in edge-on projection, partially resolved from the ground, and whose relatively narrow width is best seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 18</ref> (left). The radial extent of these near-linear features are highly asymmetric, reaching app 6.0" to the SE of the star, but only ≈2.8" to the SW of the star. While Keck AO imaging with comparable spatial resolution suggested diametric co-linearity and equal radial extent of these features in SB and S/N maps obtained with LOCI processing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Currie et al. 2012</ref>; c.f., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) this appears not to be the case as informed by the STIS images.</p><p>(3) At larger stellocentric distances, these features "curve up" significantly at their extrema (best seen in panel B) and bifurcate into very low-contrast "V" shaped (or "wish-bone") features with morphological similarity to those seen more readily (with greater contrast) in HD 61005, and on just one side of HD 15115. The morphological similarity of these features, modulo the perspective and line-of-site dust opacity effects suggest, perhaps, a common causality.</p><p>(4) A long "strand" of higher SB scattering material appears "above" the plane of the disk to the NW of the star (only) roughly "parallel" to the plane of the disk, but does not originate at the location of the star. This feature itself appears to have a concavity toward the disk plane, and extends nearly twice as far from the star then the main disk on the same disk of the star. The origin of this feature is uncertain, and may represent a "Pleiades-like" foreground nebulosity rather than a dust enhancement physically associated with the HD 32297 debris disk explicitly.</p><p>The causal mechanism(s) for the extreme asymmetries and complex sub-structures seen in the HD 32297 disk pose a challenge to current models of CS debris disks, and may require a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic forces to replicate and explain the observed structures. Field: 460 x 186 STIS pixels (23.2" x 9.4"). Red circle r = 0.3" (6 STIS pixels == width of WedgeA-0.6). Introductory Notes. HD 53154, a G9V solar analog at 18.3 pc with an estimated age of ~ 1 Gy, is the oldest star in the GO 12228 survey and possibly the oldest star (other than the Sun) for which light-scattering CS debris has been imaged. A low SB light-scattering debris disk was discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kalas et al. (2006)</ref>, seen to a contrast-limited IWA of r &gt; 3" (55 AU projected), and to a photon-limited stellocentric angular distance of &lt; app 6" with HST/ASC F606W (0.6 µm) coronagraphic imaging. These authors inferred an intermediate inclination viewing geometry of the disk of ~ 45° and major axis PA = 147° ± 2° based on the ACS discovery image reproduced herein as originally presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 20A</ref>. With their determination of "no SB asymmetries detected between (the two) sides of the disk" they then measured the disk's 3" &lt; r &lt; 6" minor-axis-mirrored SB profile along its mid-plane and found a smooth decline in SB from 22 to 24 mag arcsec -2 , with a shallow dip between app &gt; 3.5" and &lt; 5" (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 -HD 53154 !</head><p>Observations and PSF Subtraction. The first set of four visits (81-84) of HD 53154 and its (originally chosen) PSF star executed on 10 January 2011, but with a target acquisition failure preceding the planned coronagraphic imaging in Visit 81. The telescope was mis-pointed and no useful data were obtained for that visit. A second problem plagued this first set of visits in that the wrong PSF star (too red) was associated and executed with the disk imaging visits. While the contemporaneous color-mismatched PSF template/calibration data from V83 were obtained, they were not useful due to chromatic residuals strongly polluting the resulting disk images.</p><p>The second set of visits (85-89) executed nominally with a replacement PSF star, HD 59780, in V87 on 2011 Apr 11. Serendipitously, this replacement proved a mostly suitable calibration template also for the earlier non-contemporaneous disk-imaging visits. However, because of both "breathing" and differential target centering errors from wedge-deployment non-repeatability, the WedgeA-0.6 (only) attempted PSF-subtractions from V82 and V84 (but not V81) were significantly degraded and not of any utility. The WedgeA-1.0 data from these same visits, after non-contemporaneous PSF-subtraction, were only mildly degraded (w.r.t. the very high quality of the epoch 2 PSF-subtracted imaging using its contemporaneously observed PSF template), but are still quite useful, and in combination better tile the roll space, and overall improve the full data set.</p><p>The AQ image for HD 53143 ( Principal Results. The STIS (5/3)-roll PSFTSC imaging of the HD 53143 CS debris disk importantly improves over the ACS discovery imaging in two key aspects. First, by better unveiling an asymmetrical structure in the architecture of the outer (&gt; 55 AU) disk SE vs. NW sectors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 20B</ref>), and second by revealing a previously unimaged inner, azimuthally symmetric, inner disk component from r ~ 0.3" to 3.0" (~5.5 AU to 55 AU; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 20C</ref>).</p><p>(1) The Outer Disk: The ACS and STIS images of the commonly sampled (outer) regions of the HD 53143 CS disk are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 20</ref> A/B presented at the same spatial scale and celestial orientation (north up, east left). The STIS image is shown with a log 10 stretch to permit simultaneous display of both the outer and inner disk components, and to match as closely as possible the dynamic display range of the ACS discovery image as previously published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kalas et al. (2006)</ref>. In the STIS image, despite the presence of some low SB residual light from the extended wings of the not-completely-suppressed stellar PSF halo, a scattered light excess in the outer disk peaking at ~ r = 4.7" to the NW and SW of the star is seen, as is also the case in the ACS image. In the STIS image, a background galaxy whose presence in a single epoch image alone would conflate the morphology of the scattered light, is unambiguously identified as a polluter (along with that of a STIS-resolved binary star superimposed within the disk) contributing spatially coincident flux not originating in the disk itself.</p><p>The CS scattered light in the outer disk is seen with significance in the two sectors flanking the outer disk major axis on both side of the star to a stellocentric distance &lt; app 5.8" (105 AU).</p><p>In the STIS image the SB excess to the SE of the star appears spatially contiguous to decreasing radial distances into and interior to the ACS r = 3" IWA effective . In the diametrically opposed NW sector, however, a dearth of disk light between about 3.5" -4.4" (63 to 80 AU) is apparent, which is not seen at the same distance to the SE of the star. Careful, visual, examination of the represents a spatial re-distribution (outward migration) of the scattering dust particles in this region of the disk over this time interval, or a difference due to color-dependent scattering efficiency given the much wider STIS spectral bandpass, or simply from measurement uncertainty, is highly speculative -but noted here in expectation of future (better informing) observations.</p><p>(2) The Inner Disk: The STIS AQ image reveals a significantly brighter inner disk component at r &lt; app 2.8″ (blue/pink encoded in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 20B</ref>) that (unlike the outer disk component) appears to be circularly symmetric or nearly so (it is marginally brighter at equal stellocentric radii on the SE side of the star than on the NW side of the star). Ninety percent of the dust-scattered starlight is contained within 2.03" of the central star. An azimuthally medianed radial surface profile of the inner and immediately flanking regions of the disk from 0.4" &lt; r &lt; 3.6" is very well fit by a single power law of index -3.7 with no significant deviations (goodness of fit R = 0.991).</p><p>(3) The Full Disk: The total flux density from the disk, measured to a radius of 5.8" excluding the small region unsampled around the IWA effective = 0.3" is F disk = 6.92 mJy ± a few percent with then a 0.6 µm disk scattering fraction, F disk / F star = 0.104%.</p><p>Contrary to earlier speculation based on the ACS discovery image alone, these new STIS observations may implicate a nearly face-on inner disk, with an unbroken r -3.7 power law in its SB to ~ 3.6", with an anisotropic (asymmetric) dust density distribution in the outer disk, giving rise to the localized "arc"-like scattering structure seen to the NW of the star at r ~ 5".  <ref type="formula">(2007)</ref>, discovered a lightscattering debris system associated with HD 61005 of unusual character. The morphology of the debris system was highly asymmetric (more-so than any other previously seen) with nearly all of the light-scattering material confined to only one side of the star, earning it suggestively a name in the discovery literature as "the Moth.". This large scattered-light structure had what appeared to be a leading-edge "bow shock" in the direction of the stellar proper motion. The general paradigm suggested for its (then) unique morphology was causal not as a system in isolation, but posited as one interacting with an ISM wind -as we have subsequently seen with some similarities for HD 32297 ( § A.3), HD 15115 ( § A.1), and perhaps HD 15745 ( § A.2).</p><p>The morphology of the large debris structure, seen in the wake of HD 61005's proper motion, and 2011 May 03 (V21 -V24). We followed exactly the procedure described for reduction, calibration, and the creation of a 6-roll combined image using all date from the two occulting wedge positions as described in § 5.7. The 6-roll combined image of the HD 61005 debris system (exquisitely) reveals the edge-on disk, its centrally cleared region interior to a highlyinclined bright ring, as well as the conjectured "blowback" material from its interaction with the ISM from the space motion of the system. However, a low-level stellocentric circularlysymmetric residual halo of light (in this case bright, rather than dark as noted for HD 32297) was seen in the NNW centered sector of the image "above" the star (where the asymmetric debris structure does not appear), closely reminiscent (but to a lesser degree) of the chromatic PSF subtraction residuals in HD 32297 prior to mitigation. This superimposed halo is an image artifact due to (small) chromatic differences in the SED of HD 61005 (which itself may be slightly dust reddened) and the PSF template star HD 56161. The halo is not reproducible through intentional PSF template mis-scaling in intensity; attempts to "null it out" by adjusting the scaling produces VERY deep (non-physical) negative residuals close to the star and along the diffraction spikes. We therefore applied the same method of chromatic correction to mitigate these residuals as we adopted for HD 32297 to produce the AQ image discussed below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</formula><p>Principal Results. The AQ image of the HD 61005 debris system reveals with clarity a highly-inclined debris ring and its (dark) central clearing to a stellocentric IWD approaching ≈10 AU; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref> presented in two panels to better illustrate (A) the debris ring itself, and (B) the inner part of the skirt of material "blowing" off the ring and of its front-edge bow enhanced in visibility at the extrema from the dust opacity along the line-of-sight. This "skirt" of (likely small) particles emanating from the previously unresolved inner part of this complex debris structure is likely pushed-back from the disk-plane as the system plows through the ISM.   In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 23A</ref> we show the debris ring and the "wings of the moth" to roughly the same detection sensitivity as provided by the NICMOS discovery, and ACS polarimetry, images.</p></div>

Assuming the ring ellipticity results simply from its projection onto the sky (i.e., is intrinsically circularly symmetric) by ellipse fitting we estimate the minor:major ellipse axial ratio as 0.0882:1 from which an inclination of ~ 4.9° from edge-on is derived. We measured the stellocentric angular distance to the center of the debris ring along the disk major axis (i.e., to the ansae, i.e., the radius of the debris ring) on average in both directions from the star as r = 1.57" ± 0.07". We then estimate the radius of the inner edge of the debris ring (in convolution with the STIS PSF) as ~ 1.30" along the disk major axis, and assume radial symmetry outward. Finally, we estimate a "front-to-back" scattering efficiency ratio for the dust along the disk minor axis of ~ 3:1. Physical modeling must be done to confirm/optimize these geometrically and photometrically derived parameters, but as is provides observational constraints for image interpretation. Separately, in panel C we call to attention a (first order) axially symmetric scattering feature originating at, and extending beyond, the ring ansae with a "Y" shaped morphological bifurcation of the scattered light flux on the leading edge of the posited bow shock and (more diffusely) along the disk major axis. Morphologically similar features are seen in the (likely) ISM interacting disk of HD 32297 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 19)</ref>, and may be related to the bifurcated structure seen only on the east side of the HD 15115 disk <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11C</ref>). Panel D</p><p>shows the full spatial extent of the "skirt" of (likely small) dust particles emanating from the previously unseen inner part of this complex debris structure that may be escaping the system, pushed-back from the disk-plane as the system plows through the ISM, to the full sensitivity limits imposed by the instrumental and sky background noise. 1.8, 0.18, 0.018 to 5600 mJy arcsec -2 ). Field: 400 x 250 STIS pixels (20.28" x 10.14") --North up, east left. Red circle r = 0.3" (6 STIS pixels == width of WedgeA-0.6). The morphology, geometry, and "front-to-back" SB asymmetry of a now well-seen highly inclined debris ring (previously identified in ground based LOCI and ADI imaging by REFS) is suggested by illustration to scale in panel A. The nearly-symmetric observed "ridges" of diffuse scattering grains, morphologically bifurcated in the skirt of lower SB material to the SE of the star are indicated (compare also to HD 11515 panel E).  approximately r = 5.1". Also suggested is a co-inclined higher SB ring extending from inner ring from r = 2" -3". In their F606W image (exploring the disk to smaller stellocentric angles than with their F814W image), they found the radial SB profile of the disk along its major axis is local peaked (and globally maximum) at the r = 56 AU in the inner ring and also at r = 100 -110 AU, just interior to the outer disk truncation radius (c.f., their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4)</ref>. These peaks were more pronounced on the west side of the disk than on the east side. disk images and (fortuitously) were found to be acceptable matches to produce PSF subtracted images for those visits. For this reason, in addition to the visit (61, 62, 64)-minus-visit 63, and visit (65, 66, 68)-minus-visit 67 PSF-subtractions, a third set of PSF-subtracted images, visit (61, 62, 64)-minus-Visit 67, was added to the image reduction to provide information on the region otherwise corrupted by the background star appearing in the visit 63 template. In subsequent reduction and analysis of this data set, and the creation of an AQ image after PSF subtractions, a set of 18 PSF-subtracted images (nine WedgeA-1.0 and nine WedgeA-0.6) was used, with the background-star-affected region in the visit 67 template digitally masked (and rejected). The resulting 6R/PSFTSC AQ image of the HD 92935 CS debris disk is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 24A</ref>. For completeness only, we note that the inverse was also tested, i.e., using the visit 63 template for disk visits 65, 66 &amp; 68, but was found inferior in all three visits to the visit 67 template due to differences both in breathing and centering, and so was not used in this manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.6-HD 92945 !</head><p>The STIS 6R/PSFTSC AQ image reproduces the main features of the disk as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Golimowski et al. (2011)</ref> and probes to smaller stellocentric distances for (potentially brighter) dust in the interior. The inner ring, inside r ≈ 3", is well seen on at least the west side of the star and with lesser visibility on the east side, through the presence of both some low-amplitude chromatic (despite ∆(B-V) = +0.01 target-template color matching), and high spatial frequency radially-directed breathing residuals remaining in this image. The chromatic residuals are manifested primarily as (positive and negative) circularly concentric rings impressed upon the image detectable at approximately r &lt; 3". To partially mitigate their presence, to a simple first order, their azimuthally symmetric brightness was estimated, then subtracted, in the following manner. First, a digital mask was created to exclude flux from the large, diffuse, outer disk regions (and two field objects); see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 25A</ref>. Second, a digitally-masked median radial profile derived from image A was transformed to a two-dimensional image; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 25B</ref>. To first order, this primarily represents the largely azimuthally symmetric chromatic residuals only, though other information was included in the initial image. The high spatial frequency radial "tendrils" (positive and negative emanating from the star due to uncompensated breathing errors) are conserved in total flux (or nearly so) circumferentially at any radial distance from the star, so on the azimuthal median are at (or very close to) zero. Flux from the inner disk ring itself is confined to a narrow ellipse, occupying only a small fraction of any annular zone in area, and so is not filtered out with azimuthal medianing. Third, the panel C difference image (A-B) subtracts the empirically determined estimation of the radial biases from chromatic residuals. While the high spatial frequency breathing tendrils are not eliminated, visibility of the inner debris ring with reduced chromatism is improved (compare panels A and C). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 24B</ref> we separately additionally enhanced the visibility of the inner ring by low-pass spatial filtering the image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.   25C</ref> with a 0.4 pixel kernel. This conservatively reduces the amplitude of the high-spatial frequency tendrils without a significant effect on the lower spatial frequency ring and outer disk. Finally, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 26 (top)</ref>, we more aggressively applied a 5x5 pixel (~ ¼ arcsec, similar to the 11x11 kernel used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Golimowski et al.

(2011)</ref>. The STIS AQ image reveals (at least) the eastern side of the inner ring with somewhat better clarity, and the northern extent of the ring closer to its sky-projected minor axis (e.g., compare also to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Golimowski et al. 2011</ref>, c.f., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>). From the STIS data, we find the 50CCD band integrated brightness of the disk from r = 1.67" (~ 36 AU on the disk major axis) outward, largely unaffected by residuals from imperfect PSF subtractions, to be 0.143 mJy, and thus a disk scattering fraction, F disk / F star ~ 0.0051% at r &gt; 1.67". The uncertainty in the absolute calibration both of these measurements is estimated as ± 20% 1-σ. This is in good agreement with what <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Golimowski et al.

Modulo uncertainties in stellar ages (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) HD 92945 may be the oldest debris disk in our GO 12228 sample for which an inner debris ring within a larger debris system is clearly resolved.

HD 107146 is a 27.5 pc distant, 80 -200 Myr old, close-solar analog star (spectral type G2V) with a large infrared excess, L IR /L star = 0.12%, attributed to several tenths of an Earth mass of re-radiating dust orbiting the star. The presence of a broad starlightscattering CS debris ring about the star was reported, and discussed in detail, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardila et al. (2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ardila et al. ( , 2005</ref>. The disk, then seen in ACS/HRC PSF template-subtracted coronagraphic observations at 0.6 and 0.8 µm, was suggested to be inclined ≈ 25° from pole on and broadly peaking in radial SB in both bands ~ 4.7" (130 AU) from the central star. While the ACS observations have been successfully used to ascertain the primary characteristics of the disk, the above authors have stated "{PSF} subtraction errors, caused by mismatches in the colors of the stars or PSF time variability, dominate the emission within ∼2" from the star and contribute light at large distances. With only one reference star, we cannot quantify very precisely the magnitudes of these two error sources." The debris belt was initially detected in the millimeter  discovery imaging, now marginally intrudes into the outer periphery of the broad ring-like disk, as it has been "closing" on HD 107146 due to the stellar (reflex) proper motion since the 2004 epoch discovery imaging. Circa 2020 the galaxy will be superimposed upon the intrinsically brightest part of the disk, radically altering its apparent SB distribution then and for a decade to follow (a warning to future observers).</p><p>Improving on earlier ACS and NICMOS data, the STIS AQ image sensitively traces dust depletion in the inner regions of the broad HD 107146 debris ring to within ≈ 60 AU of the star, half the stellocentric distance from where the debris ring is brightest.

The STIS SB image and its azimuthal median radial profile <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 27)</ref>, clearly show a steep decrement in SB interior to the broad ring with the region cleared of light-scattering debris to a 1-σ per resel sensitivity limit of ~ 0.2 µJy arcsec -2 (image contrast ~ 2 x 10 -7 ) at 2.3".</p><p>The ring SB declines more rapidly interior of r peak toward the star and less steeply radially outward from r peak .

With the higher-fidelity STIS image, and lack of correlation in the asymmetry implied only in the ACS F606W image, we suggest this was an optical artifact from pollution by incomplete PSF subtraction beyond r &gt; 2" and/or imperfect geometrical distortion correction in the ACS F606W image.</p><p>From the STIS data we can also quantitatively assess SB limits on any dust undetected between 0.4" to 2.3" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 27, bottom right)</ref> where dust detection by scattered-light becomes contrast limited.

HD 139664 is a 17.4 pc distant F5 main sequence star with a starlightscattering CS disk that was revealed at stellocentric distances &gt; 3" (52 AU) with HST/ACS coronagraphic imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kalas et al. 2006</ref>). Its estimated age of 300 (-200, +700) Myr, comparable to Fomalhaut and possibly as old as HD 51354 (1 Gy, see § A.4), makes it one of the oldest stars for which a CS debris disk has been imaged in scattered light. HD 139664 also has the smallest IR excess, L IR /L star = 0.009%, of any of the stars on the GO 12228 sample and the general population of ~ two dozen CS debris disks that have been imaged in scattered light to date, and follows the general trend of IR excess declining with stellar age <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Fig. 9)</ref>.

A minoraxis mirrored (to improve S/N) radial SB profile suggested a peak in the dust density at r ≈ 83 AU, the radius of a postulated inclination-obscured planetesimal belt.</p><p>Observations and PSF Subtraction. The STIS observations of HD 139664 and its PSF star HD 99353 executed nominally at two epochs, 2011 May 23 (V95 -V98) and 31 July 2011 (V91 -V94), and would prove to be the most challenging of all the GO 12228 targets to improve over previous observations. HD 139664 itself at V = 4.64 is significantly brighter than our other disk target stars (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Thus, to permit sufficient imaging dynamic range across the inner to outer disk regions in the face of image saturation in the region adjacent to the STIS occulting WedgeA, for HD 139664 and its commensurately bright PSF star, we imaged using WedgeA-0.6 with both very short and intermediate duration exposure times, in addition to the deeper (centrally saturated as expected) WedgeA-1.0 imaging; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for summary details.</p><p>Following our homogeneous multiple-orientation observing paradigm across the target set, even with foreknowledge of the edge-on disk major axis PA from the ACS observations, we did not constrain the absolute (celestial) orientation of the disk in any of the STIS visits to enable us to probe for, and study, any out-of-plane material that, a priori unknowingly, might have existed (e.g., as seen in the cases of the HD 61005 ( § A.5) and HD 32297 ( § A.3) nearly edge-on disks).   <ref type="formula">2009)</ref>, with the following differences deviating from their determination that "no surface brightness asymmetries were detected between each side of {the} disk". To facilitate visual comparison, we additionally suppress still remaining high-spatial frequency breathing residuals in the fully circum-azimuthal FOV by applying a 3x3-pixel boxcar kernel as a low-pass spatial filter. The result is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 30B</ref>.</p><p>An examination also of a radial SB profile along the disk major axis (prior to smoothing, i.e., derived from the image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 29</ref>) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 31</ref> confirms an "east/west" SB asymmetry. Though somewhat polluted with PSF-subtraction artifacts, starlight-scattering dust on the east side of the edge-on disk is traceable in the STIS AQ image to a (masked, but saturation limit obscured) inner working distance of r ~ 1.2" (21 AU), with a SB ~ 50 µJy arcsec -2 at r = 2.7" and declines inwardly by a factor of two at r = 1.3" just beyond where the disk is obscured in the STIS image. On the opposite (west) side of the star, the disk SB peaks further from the star at r = 3.7", reaching a maximum SB of ~ 30 µJy arcsec -2 and declines linearly. Directly opposite the east side peak at r = 2.7" the west side only ~ 17 µJy arcsec -2 .

On the west side, the bright part of the edgeon disk (color scaled as red in the STIS image) is a narrow linear feature defining the disk plane surrounded above, below, and exterior by dust scattered starlight at lower SB (encoded light blue). On the east side only, dust-scattered starlight extends at higher SB to a greater distance "above" the disk plane, with greatest height in the STIS image at r ~ 2.8" to 3.7" where the SB peaks.

A radial SB profile along the disk plane from this "off-rolled" subtraction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 32, right)</ref> is highly correlated and in good agreement with the identically-measured two-roll subtraction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 31)</ref> where both are photometrically reliable at r &gt; 1.7". along the plane of the disk using the achromatic V95 "off-rolled" target PSF.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.9 -HD 181327 !</head><p>These characteristics made it a high-priority target for prior HST high-contrast (coronagraphic) imaging investigations at both near-IR (HST/GO 10177, 10847) and visible-light (HST/GTO 9987) wavelengths. An optically bright light-scattering debris disk circumscribing HD 181327 (F disk / F star = 0.17% at 1.1 µm) was first reported from HST/NICMOS and ACS observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Schneider et al. (2006)</ref>, while mid-IR imagery along with IR spectroscopy was discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chen et al. (2008)</ref>. Together, those observations revealed the existence of a relatively narrow ring-like debris belt responsible for ~ 70% of the total disk flux, peaking in SB at a stellocentric distance of ≈ 86 AU. The ~ 31.7° from face-on inclined debris system appeared to be largely cleared of light-scattering material closely interior to the bright ring as determined from the NICMOS images and, exterior, surrounded by a much larger, asymmetric, halo of diffusely scattering low SB particles further from the star as detected in deeper ACS optical imaging. ! Observations and PSF Subtraction. Our STIS GO 12228 6R/PSFTSC observations of HD 181327 are detailed in §5.5 as archetypical of the observation and data reduction/processing methodologies as applied to all GO 12228 targets. In particular, for HD 181327, an ensemble of 168 images targeting the inner regions of the debris ring to a WedgeA-0.6 limiting stellocentric angle of r = 0.3", and 64 deeper WedgeA-1.0 images to probe the outer regions of the debris system, were obtained at six different spacecraft roll (field orientation) angles with up to ~ 12.8 ksec of total integration time in most pixels (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for details). An intermediate set of twelve "visit level" combined images (derived from multiple images, separately at each wedge position in each orbit) were created; see Figs. 3 and 4. Though there is some (anticipated) small dispersion in the quality (occurrence and amplitude of PSF-subtraction residuals) between these images in the regions unaffected by the HST/OTA diffraction spikes and the STIS occulting wedges (e.g., qualitatively compare the panel A "worst case" panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> to the panel E "best") none were excluded as outliers in subsequent multi-roll image combination. An AQ data image (with error estimate propagation), combining all twelve astrometrically registered, artifactmasked, PSF-subtracted visit-level images, each oriented in the celestial ("north up") frame, was then created with up to ~ 12.8 ksec of total integration time in most pixels.

The bright narrow ring of dust at r = 1.86" (88.5 AU projected distance), exhibits non-axisymmetric SB asymmetries ( Morphologically, the HD 181327 debris disk appears as an asymmetrically bright narrow elliptical ring cleared of scattering material in the interior, and exterior surrounded by a larger, fainter diffuse region. Assuming intrinsic circular symmetry, after elliptical isophote fitting of the flux density in the ring, and finding a celestial PA of 102°±4° for the major axis of the bright ring inclined 30.1°±1.2° from face-one, we deproject the HD 181327 disk to a face-on viewing geometry as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 34</ref> with debris ring major axis horizontal.

Additionally, (4) the diametrically opposed sides of the ring about minor axis (vertical in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 34</ref>) at mirror-symmetric deprojected azimuthal phases angles (theta in <ref type="figure">Fig.</ref> 34B/C; theta = 0° coincident with the azimuth angle of the peak SB along the ring), are of significantly different brightness and, (5) with a minimum in the SB around the ring not coincident with deprojected theta = 180° (i.e., not H-G scattering) and, (6) is also not diametrically opposed to the direction of the "extension" of the outer disk halo to the north.</p><p>Compensating for the r -2 decline of the stellar radiation field with increasing stellocentric distance, we transform the deprojected SB image of the debris ring <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 35A)</ref> into a proxy for the product of the optical depth and the scattering phase function of light-scattering particles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.   35B</ref>).

Follow-on Keck II NIRC2/H-band images (Liu 2004) revealed not only the disk itself, but suggested some sub-structures along the disk major axis at stellocentric distances beyond about 25 AU, suggestive (perhaps) as influenced by co-orbiting, unseen, planets.</p><p>Subsequent HST/ACS imaging by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Krist et al. (2005)</ref>, in three broad optical bands, revealed (diffraction polluted) light from the disk as close as 0.75" (interior to the r = 0.9″ focal plane mask at the HST spherically aberrated focal plane) from the central star (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> top left panel reproduced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Krist et al. 2005</ref>) and cleanly traced the disk along its edge-on major axis from app r = 2" -15". The ACS F606W (0.61 µm) image reproduces some of the sub-structure suggested in the Keck II image in this radial range, though with a "relatively large discrepancy in position of feature C {that} … may be due to subtraction errors in either or both data sets." <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Krist et al. (2005)</ref> state that a three component fit to the disk radial SB profile along the disk major axis, decreases in steepness (in two breaks) with stellocentric distance. Subsequently the disk has been modeled using multiwavelength and polarized light data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Graham et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fitzgerald et al. 2007</ref>) and the signatures of grain growth probed.  Given the above, we used the V35 disk-occulted images of AU Mic itself as its own selfreferential PSF template that, fortuitously, exhibited no significant breathing excursions w.r.t. the non-contemporaneous disk imaging visits 31 -34. In doing so, we first tested whether or not this could over-subtract with significance any disk flux from out-of-plane light due to the disk in the  I.e., the "halo" is indeed an optical artifact, and not intrinsic to the CS environment. Therefore, the AQ data images we present, and discuss, here all use the V35 disk-occulted image of AU Mic itself as its own self-referential PSF template. </p></div>

The AU MIC edge-on disk is cleanly imaged with STIS 5R/PSFTSC using the disk-obscured AU Mic image as its own PSF template to a stellocentric inner working distance of 5 AU along the disk mid-plane. Here, we photometrically define the disk mid-plane (illustrated by the horizontal white line in panels A-C) by fitting the central ridge of isophotal SB maximum at stellocentric distances 50 -100 AU on either side of, and passing through, the star (finding a celestial position angle of 37.8 ± 0.2°).</p><p>In the inner ( r &lt; 50 AU) region of the disk, the new image reveals:</p><p>(1) a significant NW (brighter) to SE (fainter) brightness asymmetry between the two "sides" of the disk at equal stellocentric distances interior to ~ 15-20 AU inner working distances (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 38</ref> A) that had not been cleanly probed with earlier scattered-light imaging.</p><p>(2) a prominent brightness enhancement ("bump") on the SE side of the star "above" (to the NE) of the disk mid-plane at 13 AU (see also panel A).

This is shown in the  In the vertical dimension, the aforementioned "bump" at 13 AU to the north of the mid-plane on the east side of the disk is a most prominent feature.

This scattered light in excess of the exponential fit does not appear either south of the disk on the east side, nor north of the disk on the ("no bump") west side -though visibility there is precluded at r &lt;~ 12 AU due to the remaining obscuration by the STIS occulting wedge. The "bump" and excess to the NE of the star, and "warp" in the photometric mid-plane of the disk to the diametrically opposed SW may have a common causality with dust in the inner part of the system orbiting non-coplanar (slightly inclined) to the outer part of the disk, e.g., like β Pictoris, possibly (here) to a yet unseen inner planet. The primary focus of the GO 12228 investigation and its target sample is on CS debris disks.</p></div>

The intervisit brightness of the occulted star was determined by ratioing the flux from the unocculted OTA diffraction spikes, before PSF-subtraction, beyond the WedgeA-0.6 mask. In detail we found the following relative brightnesses, by Visit: (Epoch 1): A1 = x 1.0000, A2 = x 1.0041, A4 = x 1.0081; (Epoch 2): A5 = x 1.0784 , A6 = x 1.0714, A8 = x 1.0554.</p><p>In the thusly-weighted six-roll combined image, the disk is very cleanly resolved to an instrumentally asymmetric IWA of as close as 0.305" from the disk-hosting star.

This photometric (isophotal) offset does not necessarily imply a physical offset in the particle density distribution as the large scattering fraction (F disk /F star , see below) is consistent with a disk that is at least partially optically thick and non-isotropic scattering may account for this offset (as later modeling can explore). We revisited the disk geometry, applying this observed isophotal stellocentric offset to define the disk center. We find: (1) the celestial orientation (position angle) of the disk major axis is 10°</p><p>+/-2° east of north; (2) the minor:major axial ratio is 0.889 ± 0.026 implying; (3) an inclination of 27.3 ± 3.3° from a face-on viewing geometry (in statistical agreement with, but improving upon the earlier determination of i = 32° ± ~5° by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cortes et al.

But, only 90% of the total starlight scattered by the MP Mus CS disk (excluding the central region obscured by the STIS wedge in the STIS 6-roll combine image) is within 2.0" of the star (see encircled energy plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 41, right panel)</ref>.

The detailed spatially resolved morphology of the disk is better revealed in a series of three representations of the 6R/PSFTSC AQ image as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 42</ref>. The disk apparently exhibits strong directionally preferential scattering centered at a celestial PA ~ 92°, that is offset from the disk's brighter semi-minor axis by -8°. E.g., at r = 0.6" along the disk minor axis, the disk SB is ~ 3.5x brighter on the eastern side of the disk compared to its diametrically opposed western side.</p><p>The 6R image is composed of images from two epochs with strong evidence, discussed below, for time-variable illumination resulting in spatially localized fluctuations of disk SB at levels of tens of percent that must be considered in analytic modeling of the disk. Our STIS 6-roll PSFTSC observations were obtained at two epochs, in two sets of threetarget orbit, three months apart. In the spatial regions commonly sampled at both epochs, a significant change in the disk SB with stellocentric azimuth angle was seen, separate from an anticipated correlation of the global disk brightness with stellar variability. By ratioing first epoch to (globally renormalized) second epoch AQ images, a strong signature of azimuthally differentiated SB variability unassociated with the (global) stellar variability is seen.</p><p>Specifically, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 43</ref>, in an annulus from 0.6" &lt; r &lt; 1.4" in regions commonly sampled at both epochs, the first epoch to second epoch globally renormalized ratio of median disk SB varied significantly on opposite sides of the disk. In particular, in sector from approximately celestial PA ≈ 20° to 230° (roughly centered on the presumed forward scattering direction to the SE of the star; green dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 43</ref>) the median disk SB increased by +11% relative to the star. Contemporaneously, in near diametric opposition from celestial PA approximately 240° to 360° (blue dashed lines) to the NW, the medianed disk SB declined by -24% relative to the star. Given the orbital time scales, these changes cannot be from a change in the surface density distribution of light-scattering grains. We interpret this, possibly as due to time-variable shadowing (or "beaming") of starlight to the outer disk beyond, either by opaque material orbiting close to the star, or the "puffing" (change in vertical height) of a unseen inner cavity wall, interior to the inner working distance (~35 AU) that could probed by the STIS coronagraph.</p><p>Alternatively, some variation in the illumination pattern onto the disk might arise from differentiated brightness or localized on the stellar photosphere from accretion "hotspots." These possibilities might be arbitrated with properly sampled time-resolved imaging on the stellar rotation versus longer timescales, that our two-epoch data inform, but themselves are insufficient to differentiate between the possibilities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Local optimization methods enhance the visibility of the ring, however, they: (a) do not conserve low-SB flux density in spatially extended regions, and (b) require a large, observationally diverse, "library" of template coronagraphic PSFs that simply do not yet exist for HST optical images.</figDesc></figure>

Historically, most ground-based CS disk imaging has relied on coronagraphy with polarimetric differential techniques (Hinkley et al. 2009), where light from the disk is simultaneously imaged in the orthogonal (ordinary and extraordinary) linear polarization components, with the unpolarized light of the star used as the PSF to achieve contrast augmentation; e.g., see Perrin et al. (2014a) for a comprehensive review. Images obtained in this mode can reveal the "polarized intensity" of the CS material imaged, i.e., the "p*i" product of the polarization fraction and "total intensity", a useful diagnostic, but from which these fundamental quantities are inseparable. Because of the nearly ideal properties (brightness, contrast, size, morphology) of the HR 4796A debris ring for high contrast imaging, it has become somewhat of a de facto "truth test" target for ground-based AO systems (both "extreme" and less aggressive) that can be compared against either the HST/NICMOS nIR discovery imaging (Schneider et. al 1999) or the subsequent HST/STIS optical follow-up imaging (Schneider et al. 2009). E.g., this debris ring has been spatially resolved from the ground with the Subaru HIgh Contrast Instrument for Adaptive Optics (HICIAO; Thalmann et al. 2011), the Very Large Telescope Naysmith Adaptive Optics System (NAOS) Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (CONICA) coronagraph (NaCo; Lagrange et al. 2012), and Gemini South Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI; Wahhaj et al. 2014), none extreme AO systems, and also very recently with the Clay Magellan AO (MagAO; Rodigas et al. 2014b, in preparation) instrument, with varying levels of fidelity.</figDesc></figure>

The detection of radial differences in the scattering phase functions in inner debris rings and outer disk halos, with (or without) pericenter offsets of debris belts from their host stars, offer new constraints to such models. Modeling efforts incorporating these data are still in their early phases, but have already yielded indirect signatures suggesting the presence of wide exoplanets in HD 181327 (Stark et al. 2014) and HD 61005 (Hines et al. 2014). The detection of spiral-structured debris from a posited major collision originating in a well-revealed exo-Kuiper Belt 86 AU from HD 181327 (Stark et al., ibid) challenges models for when larger bodies are present in such structures, and highlights debris disks as highly dynamical in nature.</figDesc></figure>

E.g., HD 139664 (reported in this paper with STIS), HD 127821 and HD 13337 all L IR /L star ~ 10 -4 (Su et al. 2013), HD 207129 (Löhne et al. 2012) and Eta Crv (Duchêne et al. 2014). These Herschel- resolved debris disks are typically too large in angular extent to image with extreme AO systems (and in some cases too large for complete imaging by the James Web Space Telescope (JWST)), but can be fully imaged with HST/STIS. Some of these newly-discovered ring-like disks show IR pericenter glow in Herschel PACS imagery, but the low (order arcsecond) angular resolution of the Herschel data preclude a quantitative measurement of pericenter offsets that are classic signatures of exo-planets on eccentric orbits. Optical coronagraphy with HST/STIS, with spatial outer working angle coverage of the full exo-Kuiper belt regions of such disks, provides an order of magnitude improvement in angular resolution, compared to Herschel data. This also enables measurements of pericenter offsets &lt; 3 AU at d=27.5 pc, and of outer belts inclinations to ± ~ 1° that are an order of magnitude improved over those achievable from the thermal IR imagery (Greaves et al. 2014). The availability of such inclination constraints, in systems with known exoplanets with orbital data, would result in more robust estimates of the fraction of exoplanets with orbits that are close to coplanar with their host star Kuiper belts, and the fraction that have been perturbed into higher inclination orbits (Dawson &amp; Dodson-Robinson 2011). Moreover, the frequency of pericenter offsets and their quantitative measures allow us to evaluate similar data for eccentric planets (see Beust et al. 2014 for application to Fomalhaut).

The NICMOS image revealed a nearly edge-on disk with a linear morphology extending to a sensitivity limited stellocentric distance of r = 3.3", and was traced inward to the NICMOS r = 0.3" IWA. The disk was noted as asymmetrically brighter to the SE along the disk major axis at r ~ 0.6" (50 AU), closely coincident with a peak in the millimeter brightness later reported by Mannes et al. (2008). Schneider et al. (2005) noted a minor-axis mirrored asymmetric break in the radial 1.1 µm SB profile along the plane of the disk ~180 AU from the star, seen only on the NE side of the disk. A subsequent re-examination of the NICMOS image revealed a slight concavity of the disk with the ansae of the major axis slightly deflected to the NW as shown in Fig. 15A. Kalas et al.

While there is rotationally invariant azimuthal sub-structure at high cyclical frequencies, at low spatial frequencies the over-subtraction pattern is globally symmetric radially about the star. Hence, we create a radial median image as shown in panel C2, to "fill in" by approximation (without additional higher spatial frequency information) the "missing data" regions (panel C3). We then produce a composite C1 + C3 image as a correction template to apply to each of the images in row A to remove (most of) the chromatic over-subtractions. The PSF-subtracted disk images, corrected in this fashion, are shown in row D. We validated the efficacy of this approach by separately performing PSF-subtractions with a non-contemporaneously observed PSF calibration star, α Pictoris, who's B-V color is a near (but not exactly) perfect match to HD 32297.</figDesc></figure>

As shown in Fig. 22 panels A &amp; B (reproduced from Buenzli et al 2010), the brighter material in the likely preferentially forward scattering half of the HD 61005 debris ring only, and ansal "streamers" to a distance of ~ 1.5" beyond the ring ansae, had been detected in ground- based imaging with VLT/NACO using LOCI and ADI techniques. The more diffuse, lower spatial frequency, material in the "blow-out skirt" uniquely revealed with STIS 6R/PSFTSC (panel C at the same spatial scale and orientation) was seen prior with lesser efficacy also with ACS and NICMOS imaging, but was undetected from VLT with LOCI and ADI processing that do not conserve the flux density in such features. The structures identified in the ground-based images as processed, however, may be directly compared to the HST/STIS image. To do so on a closer footing, the STIS image was high-pass filtered with a &lt; 5 pixel (0.25") spatial-frequency pass-through that rejected low-spatial frequency information in a manner that is similar (by design) to the consequences of LOCI and ADI processing, as shown in Panel D. The ability/utility of ground-based ADI/LOCI techniques to identify such (comparatively) lower- contrast features in CS disks (with the HST imaging as a "truth test") is demonstrated with these observations, even though low spatial frequency diffuse structures (as in panel C) are undetectable in the ground-based images. The complexity of the starlight-scattering debris structures in the HD 61005 CS disk is manifested over a very large range of SBs. To better illustrate, in Fig. 23 we present images of the HD 61005 debris system in incrementally increasing, x10 per step shown logarithmically, dynamic display ranges.</figDesc></figure>

All observations of HD 107146 and its PSF reference star HD 120066 executed nominally on 2011 Feb 22 and 2011 May 30. After visit-level PSF subtraction, it was obvious that the V24 PSF-subtracted images for both WedgeA-0.6 and 1.0 were clearly inferior to the other visits with "breathing" driven PSF-subtraction residuals dominating the inner regions of the disk. The (initial) inclusion of the V24 data into a six-roll combined AQ image, in a systematic inter-visit manner as described in § 5.7, marginally degraded the final product rather than improving it compared to a five-roll combination excluding V24. Fortunately, this was not critical to the metrical analysis of this target's angularly large, broad, and nearly face-on ring-like disk that is spatially well sampled in the five other, nearly equally superior, visit-level images included in then a five-roll combination. The 5-roll combined AQ image is presented in Fig. 27 (left panel). The interior region of the disk, along the direction of and flanking its major axis (SE to NW) is imaged to an IWA efective = 0.41", about 2 resels beyond the edge of the occulting wedge. The r &lt; 1" CS region in the 5R/PSFTSC combined image roughly in the direction of the disk minor axis only (depicted as the contiguously hard-black stellocentric region in Fig. 27) is unsampled due to the rejection of the V24 imaging data that uniquely tiled that space. Separately, two 3-roll combined images, divided by epoch inclusive of the V24 data in the second epoch, were created for the purpose of investigating potential companionship by common proper motion for point sources identified in close proximity to the disk not adversely affected by breathing degradation of the V24 disk image itself.</figDesc></figure>

These were (separately) corrected for the data acquired at the two different wedge positions by same method described in § A.3. With the inter-visit relative orientations unconstrained against absolute celestial PA, the disk major axis itself was unobscured by the STIS wedge, OTA diffraction spikes, and IWA saturation region beyond the mask edge, in only two of the six STIS visits (V96 &amp; V98) constrained by a combination of guide star and target visibilities. This limited, in aggregate, the sensitivity depth of detection in the outer regions of the disk along the disk major axis explored with the (deeper) WedgeA-1.0 exposures. V95 was significantly degraded by breathing residuals at both wedge occulter positions after PSF subtraction, and hence was rejected in the creation of the final multi-roll (chromatism corrected) AQ image shown in 29.</figDesc></figure>

STIS 6R/PSFTSC observations of AU Mic and its contemporaneously observed PSF star, HD 191847, were conducted at two epochs nearly a year apart: 2010 Aug 09 (V35 -V38), and 2011 July 16 (V31 -V34). In V35, the edge-on debris disk was aligned with, and obscured by, STIS occulting WedgeA. Thus, only five rolls in the two epochs combined contribute to the imaging of the disk along its mid-plane. Despite the excellent ∆(B-V) = -0.02 color match of its PSF template star, PSF-subtractions from all six visits revealed bright residuals in the form of a chromatic ring at r = 0.8" and a large diffuse chromatic halo beyond. These residuals are illustrated in Fig. 36 with two representative visits each from WedgeA-0.6 (panels A &amp; B) and WedgeA-1.0 (panels E &amp; F). These residuals mostly arise from mis-match in target:template photospheric SED on the red end of the very broad, unfiltered, STIS bandpass of greater impact for this reddest (B-V = +1.46) of all our disk hosting stars. In panels C &amp; D and E &amp; F we respectively use the disk-obscured images of AU Mic itself obtained in V35 as its own PSF template, in which the self-mitigating effects to chromatism are apparent.</figDesc></figure>

On the NW side, at 125 AU a background galaxy to the just to the NE of, and blending with, the disk mid-plane pollutes the image. The disk SB along the mid-plane, as measured from earlier ACS images, had been fit and discussed by Krist et al. (2005) with a three-component power-law of increasing index in segregated zones with increasing distance from the star. Here, without invoking physical arguments, we separately fit the STIS derived SB profile on both sides of the disk each to a simple exponential. We did so to better examine the apparent local deviations from a smoothly continuous radial SB profile with stellocentric distance to identify small spatial scale sub- structures in the disk above the local measurement uncertainties. The as-measured profiles, and the two resulting fits, are illustrated in Fig. 39.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_67"><head>!</head><label></label><figDesc>Introductory Notes. Unlike the other GO 12228 targets, MP Mus (a.k.a. PDS 66, Hen 892) is a pre-main sequence, classical T-Tauri star (cTTS) hosting a late stage starlight-scattering protoplanetary/transition disk discovered by Cortes at al. (2009) with HST/NICMOS as part of a Spitzer/FEPS-selected coronagraph imaging survey of Sun-like stars. Its age was estimated by Cortes et al. (2009) as ~ 13 Myr, as a member of the Sco Cen OB association (Lower Centaurus- Crux moving group) and by fitting stellar evolutionary tracks. Despite its advanced age for a CTTS (having been described in the literature as "mature"), CS material is still accreting onto the star, as evidenced by variability in the thermal SED and other accretion signatures typical for much younger stars. MP Mus is known to be optically variable with a 5.75 day period and peak- to-peak amplitude of ≈ 0.1 mag in V-band; see Batalha et al. (1998); the GCVS 2007-2011 gives V mag range 10.30 to 10.42. In combination with ACTA interferometric observations in four continuum bands from 3 mm to 6 cm, and an IR SED derived from 2MASS, IRAS, and Spitzer IRAC &amp; MIPS photometry and IRS spectroscopy, the grain and physical properties of the disk were partially constrained by Cortes et al. (2009), with its geometry informed by the NICMOS imaging to assess the potential for planet formation in the disk. Kastner et al. (2010) detected molecular gas (CO) orbiting MP Mus as had been found previously for the prototypical "old" cTTS TW Hya, and for V 4046 Sgr (both, like MP Mus, within 100 pc of the Earth).</figDesc></figure>

STIS 6/PSFTSC observations of MP Mus and its PSF template star executed per the observation plan at two epochs three months apart with no issues on 2011 Mar 03 (VA1 -VA4) and 2011 Jun 06 (VA5 -VA8). Unlike our other targets, in the case of MP Mus and its PSF star, our observing strategy included, by design, only WedgeA-0.6 imaging. The combination of the relative faintness of the star (V = 10.44) and efficiently scattering disk dust particles, as known from the NICMOS imaging, allowed us to expose more deeply with WedgeA-0.6 (only) without risk of saturation close to the star. This, and the anticipated smaller angular size of this 86 pc distant protoplanetary disk, obviated the need for WedgeA-1.0 imaging (and the additional, and longer, overheads incurred from its utilization).</figDesc></figure>
