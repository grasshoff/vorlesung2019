			<abstract>
				<p>Despite the strong increase in observational data on extrasolar planets, the processes that led to the formation of these planets are still not well understood. However, thanks to the high number of extrasolar planets that have been discovered, it is now possible to look at the planets as a population that puts statistical constraints on theoretical formation models. A method that uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis where synthetic planetary populations are generated and compared to the actual population.The key element of the population synthesis method is a global model of planet formation and evolution. These models directly predict observable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary disk, linking two important classes of astrophysical objects. To do so, global models build on the simplified results of many specialized models that address one specific physical mechanism. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models included in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models describing the protoplanetary disk (of gas and solids), those that describe one (proto)planet (its solid core, gaseous envelope, and atmosphere), and finally those that describe the interactions (orbital migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches taken in different global models, discuss the links between specialized and global models, and identify physical processes that require improved descriptions in future work. We then shortly address important results of planetary population synthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relationship. With these statistical results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during planet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models describing them can be put to the observational test.Due to their nature as meta models, global models depend on the results of specialized models, and therefore on the development of the field of planet formation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this theory, it is likely that the global models will in future undergo significant modifications. Despite these limitations, global models can already now yield many testable predictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical characteristics of the synthetic planets, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about the habitability of planets based on their formation and evolution.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Thanks to the progress of observational techniques in the last decades, we are the first generation of human beings that has had the technological capabilities to answer the question about the existence of planets around other stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>. Since then, there was an enormous increase in observational data on extrasolar planets. The latest observational results from different detection techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Borucki et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>) even indicate that the presence of planets is the rule rather than the exception, at least around solar-like stars. However, this increase in observational data on extrasolar planets does not mean that we can now fully explain how these planets came into existence from a theoretical point of view. On the contrary, many observational findings on extrasolar planets were not predicted from planet formation and evolution theory, or were even in contrast to it, showing that this field is still in its infancy.</p><p>A young method to improve the theoretical understanding of planet formation is planetary population synthesis. It is a statistical method that makes it possible to</p><p>Correspondence to: Christoph Mordasini, mordasini@mpia.de</p><p>Reimar-L ¨ ust Fellow of the MPG improve the theoretical understanding of the physics governing planet formation and evolution by using statistical comparisons to observational constraints provided by the population of extrasolar planets. With this approach the global effects of many key physical processes occurring during planet formation and evolution can be put to the observational test, something which is notoriously difficult in astronomy, since the objects that are studied are far away and only accessible via the radiation they (or their host star) emit.</p><p>In this paper we review global models of planet formation and evolution that are used in such planetary population synthesis calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">,b, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">, 2008b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2009a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Miguel &amp; Brunini 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ida &amp; Lin 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Alibert et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2012a,c,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Forgan &amp; Rice 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Ida et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Galvagni &amp; Mayer 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Benz et al. 2013</ref>). In this context, "global" means that these models can directly predict planetary properties based on properties of the protoplanetary disk in which the planets form. To do so, they unite in one model the results of many specialized models that address a specific important mechanism occurring during planet formation like accretion or migra-2 C.

Here we concentrate on the physical description of these processes as included in the global models because this is the key ingredient of the entire population synthesis approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Observational motivation</head><p>Currently, there are approximately 1500 confirmed exoplanets known 1 that were mostly detected with the spectroscopic radial velocity technique or photometric transit observations. Additionally, there are about four thousand candidates from the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>) that were detected with extremely precise transit photometry. These detections have revealed an exiting diversity in the properties of planetary companions that was not expected from the structure of our own planetary system, the Solar System. The detections have, however, not only revealed a surprising diversity, but also a number of interesting correlations and structures in the properties of the planets.</p><p>These insights were in particular possible thanks to the large number of planets now known. For the first time, this allows to look at the extrasolar planets no more solely as single objects. Instead, it is possible to look at them as a population that is characterized by a number of statistical properties. Important examples are the distributions of masses, semimajor axes, radii, eccentricities and the relations between theses quantities. Understanding these statistical properties from the point of view of planet formation and evolution theory is one of the fundamental goals of the models presented here. The understanding that can be gained in this way also feeds back into the way we understand our own Solar System. Also the Solar System itself provides a large body of precise observational constraints against which planet formation models must be compared. But developing a theory that is focused on one planetary system can be misleading; the discovery of exoplanets that are very different from any Solar System planet has shown that.</p><p>The special interest in a statistical population-wide approach also comes from the fact that the knowledge about a single extrasolar planet is often limited. For the large majority of the extrasolar planets, still only a few orbital elements (semimajor axis, eccentricity,...) and a minimum mass are known (or a radius, but no mass in the case of most Kepler candidates). In order to benefit also from the large number, but individually limited data sets, statistical methods are necessary. Having this ability is important since several future surveys like the Gaia space mission or the Sphere and Gpi direct imaging surveys ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Beuzit et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">McBride et al. 2011</ref>) will yield additional statistical data sets.</p><p>For a handful planets this has partially changed in the last few years, and a first rough geophysical characterization of some extrasolar planets has become possible by multi-band photometry or spectroscopy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Richardson et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Konopacky et al. 2013</ref>). These are typically planets around bright stars for which both the mass and the radius are known (or alternatively the intrinsic luminosity in the case of directly imaged planets). In this case, more <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Regularly updated databases can be found at www.exoplanet.eu ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>) and www.exoplanets.org ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">Wright et al. 2011</ref>). observational constraints can be derived like the mean density or the atmospheric structure and composition. These planets are investigated in detail, and will likely have a special role in the next decade of extrasolar planet study. This observational progress was the motivation for some recent work on the theoretical side discussed in this paper, which is the extension of an existing planet formation model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Alibert et al. 2005a</ref>) into a self-consistently coupled planet formation and evolution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>). With such a combined model one can predict all major observable characteristics of a planet. We will discuss this topic and how it can be incorporated into statistical studies in Sect. 3.</p><p>The fundamental assumption behind the planetary population synthesis method is that the observed statistical properties of exoplanets (like the aforementioned distributions) can be explained by the action of the always identical governing physical processes during the formation phase of the planets, but under different initial conditions. The initial conditions for the planet formation process are the properties of the protoplanetary disk which are found to surround most newly born stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Haisch et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Fedele et al. 2010</ref>). Observations of such circumstellar disks show that they also have, as planets, a wide variety of properties in terms of their most important characteristics like their mass, lifetime, or radius (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Andrews et al. 2010</ref>). For an individual planetary system, the properties of the protoplanetary disk from which it formed are mostly unknown, except maybe for the dust-to-gas ratio in the disk that is likely correlated with the stellar metallicity that can be measured spectroscopically today. This means that the initial conditions are only known in a statistical sense, which again makes a statistical approach appropriate. It is clear that this fundamental assumptions neglects that stars, and therefore planets, usually do not form in isolation, but in stellar clusters. This environment can influence the formation process. Two examples are the impact of close-by massive stars on the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. 2004</ref>), or the gravitational perturbation by a passing star or temporary binary companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Malmberg et al. 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observational constraints</head><p>In comparison to other studies in the domain of planet formation theory, population synthesis is directly at the interface between theory and observation, since it is a goal to connect these two domains. It is therefore interesting to briefly discuss two central observational results that are important for the theoretical studies, namely, the semimajor axis -mass and the mass -radius diagram.</p><p>It is clear that besides these two results, there is a very large number of additional statistical constraints that can be deduced from the extrasolar planets like the distributions of radii, eccentricities, and luminosities, as well as the relations between all these quantities. Further important observational constraints are the frequency and properties of planets as a function of host star properties like mass and metallicity, the mean spacing between planets in multiple systems, the alignment of the planets among themselves and with the stellar equator, the frequency of planets in mean motion resonances and so on. A recent review on the observed properties of extrasolar planets can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Fischer et al. (2014)</ref>. </p></div>

The most recent breakthrough in the observation of exoplanets is that it has become possible to not only detect exoplanets, but also to start characterizing them. In this context, the planetary mass-radius diagram is probably the most central representation. The importance of the M-R plot stems from its information content about the inner bulk composition of planets which is the first, very basic geophysical characterization of a planet. In the Solar System, we have three fundamental types of planets, namely terrestrial, gas giant and ice giant planets. The imprint of the bulk composition on the radius is indicated by theoretical lines. Two lines show the theoretical mass-radius relationship for solid planets made of silicates and iron, and of water, while the third line shows the M -R for giant planets consisting mostly of H/He. Being able to understand and reproduce in a model this second fundamental figure is another goal of planetary population synthesis. The reason for the importance for formation theory stems from the fact that it contains additional constraints on the formation process, which we cannot derive from the mass-distance diagram alone. An example are the observational constraints coming from the M -R diagram on the extent of orbital migration. Efficient inward migration brings ice-dominated, low-density planets from the outer parts of the disk close to the star. These planets can be distinguished from planets consisting only of silicates and iron, which have presumably formed in situ in the inner, hotter parts of the disk.

Semimajor axis -mass diagram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 1</ref> shows the planetary semimajor axis-mass (a-M) diagram. It is a classical observational constraint for population synthesis and is still one of the most important observational results. Explaining the structures seen in this plots is one of the goals of planetary population synthesis. The extreme diversity, but also the existence of certain structures in the a-M diagram is visible. For extrasolar planets, the mass-distance diagram has become a representation of similar importance as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stellar astrophysics <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004a</ref>).</p><p>In the plot, one can distinguish several groups of planets. There are, for example, massive close-in planets without an equivalent in the Solar System. Such hot Jupiters are found around approximately 1% of solar-like stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Marcy et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Howard et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011)</ref>. A class of extrasolar planets that has only been detected in the last few years thanks to the progress in the observational precision are low-mass planets with masses between 1 to 30 M ⊕ (Earth masses). These super-Earths and mini-Neptunes seem to be very abundant, since every second FGK star is found to have such a companion with a period of up to 100 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). This result is at least in qualitative agreement with the analysis derived from the Kepler mission which also detects an extremely numerous population of planets with small radii 4R ⊕ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). Since hot Jupiters are much more easily detected by both the radial velocity and the transit method compared to low-mass (respectively small) planets, the number of such low-mass planet is underestimated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 1</ref> which is not corrected for observational biases.</p><p>If we further inspect <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 1</ref>, we may ask whether it points to a statistically significant deficit of planets with a mass of approximately 40 Earth masses (so-called "planetary desert", <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Ida &amp; Lin 2004b)</ref>. This is, among many others, a very interesting question from a theoretical point of view that will be discussed later on (Sect. 6.1, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Mordasini et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The semimajor axis distribution and the planetary mass function are two fundamental 1D statistical distributions that are encoded into the a-M diagram. These distributions are (besides of the radius distribution) of prime interest for statistical studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Ida &amp; Lin 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>) and can be compared to theoretical results with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>). The planetary initial mass distribution is further addressed in Sect. 6.1.</p><p>In the figure there are also planets that were discovered by direct imaging. In this technique, one measures of course not the mass, but the luminosity of a planet. The conversion of luminosity into mass is model dependent and uncertain as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref>. In Mordasini (2013) a new aspect was pointed out which is important for the conversion of luminosity into mass. It is found, perhaps surprisingly at first sight, that the post-formation luminosity of giant planets formed by core accretion depends significantly on the mass of the solid core. We address this finding in Sect. 6.4. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 2</ref> shows the observed mass-radius diagram of the extrasolar planets and compares it with three theoretical mass-radius relationships for planets with different bulk compositions (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref>). The combination of measurements of the radius of a transiting planet (first by <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Henry et al. 2000 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Charbonneau et al. 2000)</ref> and its mass (via radial velocity) makes it possible to derive the mean density of the planet. In the past years, such combined measurements were made for many exoplanets, so that the planetary mass-radius diagram became known 2 . It is an observational result of similar importance as the semimajor axis-mass diagram. One notes that as in the a-M diagram there is a large diversity, but that there are also clear trends leading, e.g., to regions in the plot that are not populated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Mass-radius diagram</head><p>A surprising observational result was the discovery of numerous "inflated" planets with radii much larger than Jupiter which was not predicted from standard planet evolution theory. It is now clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Miller &amp; Fortney 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Demory &amp; Seager 2011</ref>) that these bloated radii are related to the proximity of the planets to the host star (most currently known transiting planets have small orbital distances of a few 0.1 AU or less due to the decreasing geometrical transit probability with distance). The exact mechanism that leads to the large radii is still not completely understood. Several possible explanations have been put alone. An example are the observational constraints coming from the M -R diagram on the extent of orbital migration. Efficient inward migration brings ice-dominated, low-density planets from the outer parts of the disk close to the star. These planets can be distinguished from planets consisting only of silicates and iron, which have presumably formed in situ in the inner, hotter parts of the disk. In future, the atmospheric composition of exoplanets as measured by, e.g., the planned EChO mission will provide additional, important constraints.</p><p>Another important goal of population synthesis that goes beyond the purely planetary properties is to understand the correlations between planetary and host star properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population synthesis method</head><p>The general framework for population synthesis calculations is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. III.1.2</ref>. With this framework, theoretical formation models can be tested how far they can reproduce the statistical properties of the entire known population. The most important ingredient is the planet formation and evolution model which establishes the link between disk and planetary properties. It will be addressed below. The second central ingredients are sets of initial conditions. These sets are drawn in a Monte Carlo way from probability distributions. These probability distributions represent the different properties of protoplanetary disks and are derived as closely as possible from observational results regarding the  forward in the past, including tidal heating ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Bodenheimer et al. 2003</ref>), dissipation of stellar irradiation deep in the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Guillot &amp; Showman 2002)</ref>, double diffusive convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Chabrier &amp; Baraffe 2007)</ref>, enhanced atmospheric opacities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Burrows et al. 2007)</ref>, and ohmic dissipation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The importance of the M-R diagram stems from its information content about the inner bulk composition of planets which is the first very basic geophysical characterization of a planet. This first characterization is found by the comparison of the observed mass and radius with theoretical models of the internal structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Fortney et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b260">Seager et al. 2007</ref>). In the Solar System, there are three fundamental types of planets, namely, terrestrial, ice giant and gas giant planets. The imprint of the bulk composition on the radius is indicated by three theoretical lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 2</ref>. Two lines show the theoretical mass-radius relationship for solid planets made of silicates and iron in a 2:1 ratio as for the Earth and for pure water planets, while the third line shows the M-R relationship for giant planets consisting of H/He and a solid core of about 10% in mass. Being able to understand and to reproduce this second fundamental figure besides the a-M diagram is another goal of statistical studies of planet formation and evolution. The reason for the importance of the M-R diagram for formation theory are the additional constraints on the formation process that cannot be derived from the mass-distance diagram alone.</p><p>An example are the observational constraints coming from the M-R diagram on the radial extent of orbital migration. Efficient inward migration brings ice-dominated, low-density planets from the outer parts of the disk close to the star. These planets can in principle be distinguished from denser planets consisting only of silicates and iron that have presumably formed more or less in situ in the inner hotter parts of the disk. Complications arise from the fact that the mass-radius relationship is degenerate in some parameter space (different bulk compositions can lead to an identical mass-radius relationship, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rogers &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>. Therefore, spectroscopic measurements might be necessary to actually distinguish the two types of planets. Other key questions are: 1. What are the heavy element masses contained in giant planets? This is related to the question about the fundamental formation mechanism of giant planets, core accretion or gravitational instability. 2. Which planets can accrete and also keep primordial H/He envelopes (envelope evaporation)? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 2</ref> shows that there are low-mass planets which likely contain important amounts of H/He. They therefore form a class of low-mass, low-density planets without counterpart in the Solar System. 3. Are there correlations between the planetary bulk composition and stellar properties (metallicity) as has been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Guillot et al. (2006</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">From detection to characterization</head><p>The above three questions are an observational motivation to extend a global planet formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref>. It then becomes possible to calculate radii based on the bulk composition obtained during formation, which makes new observational constraints usable for population synthesis. Such a model can then be used to study the population-wide mass-radius relationship and to compare with the radius distribution found by the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref>). Compared to other, well-established planet evolution models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>), the evolutionary model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref> is, however, still significantly simplified in several aspects as discussed in Sect. 5.6. In view of future observations yielding very precise radii (e.g., by the photometric CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite Cheops, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Broeg et al. 2013</ref>) it will probably be necessary to find more accurate physical descriptions also in global models.</p><p>The mass-radius diagram represents, in a prototypical way, the transition of the focus from pure exoplanet detection to beginning exoplanet characterization in the past few years. Besides the M-R relationship, there was recent observational progress towards characterization in two other domains:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Direct imaging</head><p>The first technique besides transits that has recently yielded important new results for planet characterization is the direct imaging technique. The method is technically challenging due to the small angular separation of a very faint source (the planet) from a much brighter one (the host star). The number of planets detected by direct imaging is currently still low. But already these discoveries, like the planets around HR 8799 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Marois et al. 2008</ref>) or β Pictoris ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Lagrange et al. 2010</ref>) have triggered numerous theoretical studies regarding their formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Kratter et al. 2010)</ref>. Two points about these planets are interesting: their large semi-major axis and the fact that we directly measure the intrinsic luminosity at young ages in several IR bands. Both quantities are important to understand the formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability) and in particular the physics of the accretion shock occurring when the accreting gas hits the planet's surface during formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Commerçon et al. 2011</ref>). If the gravitational potential energy of the accreting gas is radiated away, low entropy gas is incorporated into the planet, leading to a faint luminosity and small radius (so-called "cold start", <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Marley et al. 2007</ref>) while the accretion of high entropy material leads to a "hot start" with a high luminosity and large radius (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baraffe et al. 2003)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> have shown that the different scenarios result in observable difference in the magnitudes of the young planets. The global model mainly discussed in this work (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>) calculates the luminosity during both the formation and evolution phase with a self-consistent coupling. For young giant planets, this is a significant difference compared to purely evolutionary models, since this coupling is necessary to know the entropy in the envelope directly after formation and to correctly predict the luminosity at young ages. Since multi-band photometry can be used to estimate the metal enrichment of a planet and because new direct imaging instruments are currently becoming operational (Sphere and Gpi), it is important that future global models will include better descriptions of the gas accretion shock and better atmospheric models (cf. Section 5.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Spectroscopy</head><p>Second, one of the most important aspects of the recent observational progress towards characterization are the spectra of a number of exoplanets transiting bright stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Richardson et al. 2007</ref>). The atmosphere represents a window into the composition of a planet and contains a multitude of clues to its formation history. The atmospheric composition depends on the composition of the host star, the nebula properties like the temperature where the planet formed, the composition of the accreted gas and planetesimals, the size of the planetesimals and their (material) strength, the evolution of the distribution of the chemical compounds inside the planet, and so on. Each migration and accretion history will result in a different atmospheric composition, as well as core and total heavy element mass. Jupiter, for example, is enriched in carbon by about a factor three relative to the sun, while Uranus and Neptune are enriched by a factor ∼30 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Guillot 1999</ref>). An enrichment relative to the sun is a natural prediction of the core accretion formation model but not of the competing gravitational instability model. For example, planet formation simulations based on the core accretion paradigm that reproduce (some of) the observed chemical composition like the enrichment in carbon were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Gautier et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Alibert et al. (2005b)</ref>. One should however note that other aspects of the composition of Jupiter are not straightforward to understand neither in the context of the core accretion nor gravitational instability model. In particular, the measurement that the enrichment of Jupiter both in highly volatile argon on the one hand and the more refractory sulphur on the other is similar (again by a factor of 2-4 relative to solar, <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Owen et al. 1999</ref>) is difficult to explain in the context of conventional models of trapping of highly volatile gases in amorphous ice and a growth of Jupiter in a region similar to its current position. Several explanations to this conundrum have been put forward like a formation of the planetesimals that enriched Jupiter's envelope at lower temperatures and thus probably at significantly larger orbital distances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Owen et al. 1999</ref>) or the incorporation of noble gases in the form of clathrate hydrates in crystalline ice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Gautier et al. 2001</ref>).</p><p>An exoplanet that lately got a lot of attention as an example how spectroscopy constrains planet formation and evolution theory is GJ1214b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Charbonneau et al. 2009</ref>). It has a radius of about 2.7 Earth radii and a mass of 6.5 Earth masses, so that it is a planet without counterpart in the Solar System between terrestrial planets and ice giants. The measured mass and radius is compatible with different internal compositions, like a rocky core with a hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a planet dominated by water with a water vapor atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">(Rogers &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>. Such different compositions, and the associated different mean molecular weight lead to different transmission spectra (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bean et al. 2011</ref>). Initially observed spectra showed that GJ1214b must either have an atmosphere with highaltitude clouds or hazes, or contain at least 70% water by mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bean et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Berta et al. 2012</ref>). Recent precise observations could rule out cloud-free atmospheres even of high mean molecular mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Kreidberg et al. 2014)</ref>. A clear solar-composition atmosphere is excluded with very high confidence. Combined formation and evolution simulations that keep track of where planetesimals deposit their mass during impacts in the gaseous envelope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. 2006</ref>) indicate that highly enriched atmospheres are a typical outcome for a planet like GJ1214b with clear consequences for spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Fortney et al. 2013</ref>). But in general, despite the fact that some processes have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">( ¨ Oberg et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Thiabaud et al. 2014</ref>), no self-consistently linked calculations have been made to date that keep track of the chemical composition of both the accreted gas and planetesimals during formation and directly predict the atmospheric composition and spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Elements of the population synthesis method</head><p>Planetary population synthesis as a suitable method for statistical studies of planet formation and evolution was introduced in the pioneering work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ida &amp; Lin (2004a)</ref>. A similar framework, but intended for more quantitative comparisons was established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Mordasini et al. (2009a)</ref>. The basic idea is to run a global planet formation model for varying initial conditions. With this framework the population-wide, statistical consequences of a theoretical description of a specific physical mechanism can be studied and compared with the population of actual extrasolar planets. Examples are specialized models of type I migration or of grain growth in protoplanetary atmospheres, see Section 6.3. The possibility to test specialized models is an important aspect of population synthesis. These specialized models are typically more complex and contain more subtleties than their simplified counterpart embedded in a global model. But if the simplified counterpart is still able to capture the essence of the original specialized model, then population synthesis is often the only possibility to test them observationally. A framework for population synthesis typically consists of the following elements that are shown in the flowchart of the method in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. disk.

In order to make quantitative comparisons with the observations, one must therefore apply in the next step a synthetic observational bias. This leads to the subpopulation of detectable synthetic planets. This group is then compared in the following step with a comparison sample of actual exoplanets. Depending on the observational technique, different biases will be used. It is clear that the selection bias of a given observational survey should be known as well as possible for this step. This makes that large, well characterized surveys like e.g. the Kepler mission are of particular interest. For the comparison in the next step, various statistical methods can be used, like for example two-dimensional Komogoroff-Smirnofftests in the a -M plane. This tests whether the actual and the synthetic planets are distributed in a similar way. Other quantities that are tested are the detection frequency, or the radius distribution. It can further be studied if correlations exist between the initial conditions, and the planet properties, and if similar correlation exist in reality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Global planet formation and evolution model</head><p>The most important element of population synthesis is a global planet formation and evolution model that establishes the link between disk and planetary properties. The sub-models of the global models typically used in population synthesis are described below in Section 5 and are the main subject of this paper. For the different sub-models, already relatively well established standard physical descriptions are employed if possible, which are the result of specialized models. Important simplifications are, however, often necessary for computational time restrictions. It is clear that the current global models (and often also the specialized ones) only provide a first, very rough approximation of the complex processes that actually govern planet formation. In this sense it is likely that the global models will in future undergo important modifications, tracing in this way the developments in the field of planet formation theory. In order to still test the global models as far as possible, dedicated simulations are made for relatively well known individual planetary systems, in particular the Solar System. But also some extrasolar systems can be studied individually, like, for example, the planetary system around HD 69830 with three Neptunian planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Lovis et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alibert et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>A global formation models should output as many observable quantities as possible, since in this case, one can use combined constraints from many techniques. The typical outputs are: the planetary mass, orbital distance and eccentricity (for comparison with radial velocity and microlensing), the radii for comparisons with transit observations, the intrinsic luminosity for comparison with discoveries made with direct imaging, and the atmospheric structure and composition for comparison with spectroscopy. The ability to compare concurrently and self-consistently with many different observational techniques (and therefore different sub-populations of planets) is crucial because global models suffer from the fact that they necessarily rely on a relatively high number of ill-constrained parameters (e.g., the viscosity parameter α, the sizes of the planetesimals, the initial radial slope of the solids etc.). The more comparisons are possible, the better these quantities can be determined, and the less likely it becomes that agreement of the model with observations is only obtained because of a sufficiently high number of unconstrained quantities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Probability distributions for the initial conditions</head><p>The second central ingredient for population synthesis are sets of initial conditions. These sets of initial conditions are drawn in a Monte Carlo way from probability distributions. These probability distributions represent the different properties of protoplanetary disks and are derived as closely as possible from results of disk observations. At least three different fundamental disk properties have been considered in past population synthesis studies: The total disk (gas) mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Beckwith &amp; Sargent 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Andrews et al. 2010)</ref>, the dust-to-gas ratio (assumed to be correlated with the stellar [Fe/H], <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005)</ref>, and the lifetime of the disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Haisch et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Mamajek 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Fedele et al. 2010</ref>). Additionally properties can be the outer radius of the disk (controlled by the angular momentum of the collapsing cloud) or the initial radial slope of the solid surface density ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Kornet et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Miguel et al. 2011</ref>). It is important to note that the derivation of such distributions for the initial conditions is not straightforward, introducing uncertainties in the final populations. For example, the total disk mass is typically found from sub-mm observations of cold dust at large semimajor axes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Andrews et al. 2010</ref>) to which gas is added at a ratio that is typical for the interstellar medium (usually a factor 100). The disk masses that are derived with this method can be up to one order of magnitude smaller compared to disk mass estimates based on the stellar accretion rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Hartmann et al. 1998</ref>). This discrepancy can result from a substantial growth of the dust to sizes to which submm observations are no more sensitive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, the concept of an "initial" protoplanetary disk is in any case questionable since disks form dynamically during the infall of the protostellar core. A more realistic model for the initial conditions would therefore include the early formation phase of the disks based on a simple infall model (e.g., Hueso &amp; Guillot 2005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Synthetic detection bias</head><p>For a given set of initial condition, the formation model is used to calculate the final outcome, i.e., the planetary system. This step is repeated many times leading to a population of synthetic planets (typically ∼10 000 planets). Many of these synthetic planets could not be detected by current observational techniques because their mass (or radius) is too small. In order to make quantitative comparisons with the observations, one must therefore apply a synthetic observational detection bias. This leads to the sub-population of detectable synthetic planets. This group is then compared with a comparison sample of actual exoplanets. Depending on the observational technique, different detection biases are used, meaning that typically, different sub-populations are probed. It is clear that for quantitative comparisons, the selection bias of a given observational survey should be known as accurately as possible for this step. This makes that large, well characterized surveys like, e.g., the Harps high-precision survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>), the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>), and also microlensing surveys (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>) are of particular interest. Depending on the results of this procedure, one can judge if the theoretical model is able to reproduce certain observed properties. In the ideal case, one single population should reproduce all observational constraints coming from many different techniques in a statistically significant fashion. In reality, there will always be differences between the model and the observations. This is, however, not an issue but instead the modus operandi of population synthesis, because the reasons for these differences are then analyzed, so that various physical descriptions of the processes occurring during formation and evolution can be tested. This can have the consequence that an existing sub-model must be modified or even abandoned for being inconsistent with observations, or that new physical mechanisms must be added to the theoretical model. This is the fundamental process by which statistical studies improve the understanding of planet formation and evolution. Clearly, we currently still stand at the beginning of this process, even if the global formation models discussed below already concentrate a non-negligible amount of physics in one framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Predictions</head><p>In case of a satisfactory agreement between theory and observation (at least for a given aspect), one can return to the full underlying synthetic population and make predictions about planets or planetary properties that currently cannot be observed yet, like very low-mass planets and on the longer term, their habitability. The capability of population synthesis to produce output for direct falsifiability with future observations, i.e., its predictive power is a strength of the method. Besides that, such predictions are also useful to estimate the yield of future instruments and surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Global planet formation and evolution models</head><p>We now come to the description of the physics of global models, which is the central subject of this paper. On the observational side, usually only the initial conditions (the protoplanetary disks) and the final outcomes of the planet formation process (the planets) are accessible to observations, even if in future direct imaging and Alma might allow to observe planet formation as it happens for a limited number of cases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Quanz et al. 2013</ref>).

The various mechanisms like accretion or migration must be treated in an interlinked way because they happen on similar timescales and feed back into each other. Ideally, the models would start with a protoplanetary disk at a very early stage when the solids are in the form of micrometer-sized dust grains (or in principle even earlier with the collapse of the cloud), and yield as an output full-blown planetary systems with fully characterized planets at an age of several billions of years. In reality this is impossible, but it means that also the evolu-tion of the planets over long timescales should be modeled, since in most cases, we observe planets a long time after they have formed. This applies both to the long-term evolution of the internal structure of a planet (its cooling and contraction) and to the secular evolution of the orbits due to gravitational interactions and tides.</p><p>The fact that the models must follow the planetary systems during the entire formation process is the reason why global models are typically one (or at most two) dimensional, for example, in the description of the protoplanetary disk (assumed to be axisymmetric) or the internal structure of the planets (assumed to be spherically symmetric). More realistic 2D or 3D hydrodynamical simulation can at least currently not be used to simulate thousands of different initial conditions (protoplanetary disks) over their entire lifetime.</p><p>Most global models used to date in population synthesis calculations are based on the core accretion paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(Perri &amp; Cameron 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Mizuno et al. 1978)</ref>. Core accretion states that first, solid cores form, some of which later accrete massive gaseous envelops to become giant planets (bottom-up process). The remaining cores collide to form both ice giants and terrestrial planets (for an overview of this sequential picture of planet formation, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Mordasini et al. 2010</ref>).

However, we also compare with other global models and review important ongoing and future work. Each sub-model is relatively simple, but the interaction of them leads to a considerable complexity. We next discuss the physics included in the different sub-models. They can be split in three classes: models for the protoplanetary disk, for one (proto)planet, and for the interactions (migration and N-body interaction).</p></div>

The gaseous disk model yields the ambient properties in which the planets form. The ambient pressure and temperature serve as outer boundary conditions for the calculation of the structure of the gaseous envelope of the planets. The structure of the disk is also very important for the orbital migration of the protoplanets, since the direction and migration rate depends on the radial slopes of the temperature and the gas surface density (Sect. 5.10). A good compromise for the numerical description of the disks that are in reality very complex, 3D structures driven by (magneto-)hydrodynamical processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Flock et al. 2011</ref>) is provided by α-viscosity models <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">(Shakura &amp; Sunyaev 1973</ref>) that describe the disk as a rotating viscous fluid. In the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Alibert et al.

The second and third equation state that the energy liberated by viscous dissipation (characterized by a turbulent viscosity ν) causes a flux of energy F that is transported via radiative diffusion to be radiated away at the surface of the disk. The other quantities in the equation are the temperature T and the opacity κ, while σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.</p><p>The turbulent viscosity is calculated using the classical α parametrization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Shakura &amp; Sunyaev (1973)</ref> as (c s is the sound speed) ν = αc 2 s /Ω in which all the complex physics about the angular transport processes in protoplanetary disks is hidden. The current understanding about these processes is actually still quite poor; for a recent review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Turner et al. (2014)</ref>. In the context of the vertical disk structure, we note that the α parametrization of viscosity leads to viscous heating that is concentrated around the disk midplane. This is a consequence of the vertically constant α. Direct radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulation where the turbulence is due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Balbus &amp; Hawley 1991)</ref> lead in contrast to a less concentrated heating, and thus to a different vertical temperature profile than in an α model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Flock et al. 2013</ref>). Such a difference is particularly strong when the turbulence is primarily occurring above the midplane as it is the case in an MRI active layer above a midplane deadzone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Dzyurkevich et al. 2013</ref>). This (and other differences, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Turner et al. 2014)</ref> show that the α parametrization of the turbulence might not be sufficient for a realistic description of protoplanetary disks.</p><p>Viscous dissipation is the dominant heating mechanism in the inner parts of the disk (e.g., Chambers 2009). At larger orbital distances, the irradiation of the host star becomes dominant.

Typically, one assumes a power-law dependency of the gas surface density as a function of radius all the time (i.e., not only as initial condition) and an exponential decrease on a uniform timescale τ disk .

This does, however, not mean that 1+1D α models are already sufficient to catch all important effects found in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Regarding the general evolution and structure of the disk itself, an important assumption in the models presented here is the one of a radially constant α. The results obtained for the radial disk structure (like the surface density or temperature) depend significantly on the magnitude and assumed radial profile of α (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bell et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Kretke &amp; Lin 2010)</ref>. It is clear that in actual protoplanetary disks, various processes occurring at different radii like the strength of the MRI, the radial and vertical extent of a possible low-turbulence deadzone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Dzyurkevich et al. 2013</ref>), or the occurrence of layered accretion (Gammie 1996) produce radial variations in the effective α. The use of one constant α must therefore be seen as a strong simplification.</p><p>Regarding planet migration, changes in the effective α can significantly affect planetary migration tracks by slowing or stopping the migration in planet traps (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Matsumura et al. 2007</ref>). In the context of global planet formation models, this was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ida &amp; Lin (2008b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, Uribe et al. (2011) find additional torques in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations where the turbulence is given by the magneto-rotational instability. They are directly related to the presence of the magnetic fields so that they cannot be described in a 1+1D α model. The output of the disk structure model is used in several other sub-models. The "atmosphere" model, for example, needs the midplane pressure and temperature in the nebula to calculate the boundary conditions for the planet's interior. The "migration" models needs, as mentioned, the surface density and temperature gradients, the surface density itself, the vertical scale height H, and the viscosity to calculate the planetary migration rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Disk of solids (planetesimals, fragments)</head><p>A third sub-model describes the structure and evolution of the disk of small solid bodies (planetesimals) from which the bigger protoplanets grow. The division in "small" and "big" bodies is made since runaway growth leads to a bimodal size distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">(Weidenschilling et al. 1997</ref>). The model of the disk of solids yields as a function of time and orbital distance the typical size s solid (or size distribution) of the bodies, their dynamical state (random velocities or, equivalently, inclinations and eccentricities) and their surface density Σ solid . These quantities control the core accretion rate of a forming protoplanet.</p><p>In a protoplanetary disk, the solids are initially in the form of tiny dust grains that grow in time to form kilometer-sized planetesimals (by a process that is currently debated, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Cuzzi et al. 2008</ref>). Destructive collisions can again reduce the size of the bodies. Additionally, solid bodies drift radially through the disk at a rate that depends among others things on the size of the bodies. The dynamical state of the small bodies is influenced by several non-linear processes like dynamical friction, viscous stirring, or damping by gas drag (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Ida &amp; Makino 1993;</ref>). The interaction of all this processes make that the evolution of the disk of solids is in reality a very complex problem. Some aspects (in particular the viscous stirring by the protoplanets) were recently included in global models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Fortier et al. (2013)</ref>. In earlier population syntheses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. (2009b)</ref> used a very simple model for the solids where the disk of planetesimals only changes due to the accretion and ejection of planetesimals by the protoplanet. The size of the planetesimals is uniform in time and space (usually 100 km). It is furthermore assumed that the accretion and ejection (for massive protoplanets) homogeneously reduces the surface density of planetesimals in the feeding zone of the planet, which is taken to have a radial width equal to W feed = B L R H where B L ≈ 4 − 5 (Lissauer 1993). This ignores the potential formation of a gap in the disk of planetesimals <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Shiraishi &amp; Ida 2008)</ref>.

More recent works on the composition of the solar nebula (like <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Lodders 2003)</ref> indicate that the change of the surface density at the iceline is probably rather about a factor of 2 than 4 as assumed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Hayashi (1981)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref> shows the initial surface density and its evolution due to a growing protoplanet. The initial profile simply traces the initial profile of the gas (Eq. 10) except for the sudden increase at the iceline. The planet initially forms at about 15 AU, and then migrates inwards depleting the planetesimal disk down to a distance of about 5 AU. Due to migration, the expansion of the feeding zone occurs mainly towards the interior part of the disk. It occurs on a shorter timescale than for in situ formation, which can reduce the overall formation timescale of a giant planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alibert et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Other global planet formation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012</ref>) use similar prescriptions for the initial surface density distribution.

(2013)</ref>, but it is likely that the prescriptions for the core accretion rate will be further significantly modified in view of new result of specialized models: as understood recently (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Ormel &amp; Klahr 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Lambrechts &amp; Johansen 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Morbidelli &amp; Nesvorny 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Chambers 2014</ref>) the accretion rate of decimeters-sized pebbles instead of km-sized planetesimals can be very high, especially also at larger semimajor axes. Such high rates are necessary to form a ∼10 M ⊕ core during the presence of the nebula in a MMSN disk which is otherwise far from simple to achieve, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Ormel &amp; Okuzumi (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">) or Chambers (2014</ref>. The high accretion rates are due to a strongly increased capture cross section for small particles due to drag with the disk gas during the encounter with the protoplanetary core. Understanding the global predictions of pebble accretion when coupled to global planet formation models and population syntheses is an important task for future studies.</p><p>The formation model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ida &amp; Lin (2004a)</ref> also uses a Safronov-type rate equation but describes the dynamical state of the swarm based on more recent results for the oligarchic growth regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Ida &amp; Makino 1993;</ref>). As they assume smaller planetesimals (km-sized instead of 100 km), the resulting core growth timescales are nevertheless relatively similar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>). The global model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hellary &amp; Nelson (2012)</ref> is much more detailed because the solid accretion rate is found by direct N-body integration of a few ten protoplanets plus a several thousand planetesimals. The downside of this is that the associated long computation time makes the calculation of statistically sufficiently large population of synthetic planets difficult, at least for the moment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Internal structure of the planetary gas envelope</head><p>The sub-models discussed up to this point describe the protoplanetary disk and the growth of the core. The "envelope" model (together with the internal structure model of the core) deals with the protoplanet itself, calculating the internal 1D (spherically symmetric) radial structure of the gaseous envelope (H/He) of the planet. During the formation phase, the model in particular yields the gas accretion rate ˙ M XY . Low-mass cores can only bind tenuous atmospheres, while cores more massive than roughly 10 Earth masses can trigger rapid runaway gas accretion, so that a giant planet forms. After the formation phase the longterm evolution, i.e., the contraction and cooling at constant mass is calculated, which yields the radius and intrinsic luminosity of a planet (recent reviews on planetary internal structures and the temporal evolution can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Baraffe et al. 2014 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Chabrier et al. 2014</ref>). The internal structure is found by integrating the standard equations for planetary interiors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986)</ref> which are the equations of mass conservation, hydrostatic equilibrium, energy conservation and energy transfer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∂m ∂r = 4πr 2 ρ ∂P ∂r = − Gm r 2 ρ (16) ∂l ∂r = 4πr 2 ρ ε − P ∂V ∂t − ∂u ∂t ∂T ∂r = T P ∂P ∂r (T, P) (17)</formula><p>In these equations, r is the radius as measured from the planetary center, m the gas mass inside r, ρ, P, T, u the gas density, pressure, temperature, and specific internal energy, V the specific volume 1/ρ, and t the time.

Th ese are the same equations as for stellar interiors with the difference that the luminosity is not due to nuclear burning of hydrogen but due to the contraction and cooling of the gas, and the energy deposition by impacting planetesimals that is found with the "infall" sub-model. The burning of deuterium in sufficiently massive objects can also be included in the energy source term ε ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Bodenheimer et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mollì ere &amp; Mordasini 2012)</ref>. Note that the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. (2013)</ref> simplify the energy equation by assuming a luminosity that is radially constant. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">Figure 6</ref> shows an example of the radial envelope structure inside a growing giant planet that forms in situ at 5.2 AU, with initial conditions similar to the classical J1 simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>. The left end of the lines corresponds to the core-envelope interface at R core , while the outer radius approximately corresponds to the Hill sphere radius. The radial structure is shown at the "crossover" point which is the moment when the core and envelope mass are equal. One sees that the pressure and density increase by many orders of magnitude across the envelope. At the outer edge, the density is of order 10 −11 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , which is typical for the outer parts of the solar nebula, while at the core-envelope interface, the density approaches an almost fluid like value of 0.17 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . Also the temperature at this position is already quite high with T c ≈ 18 000 K. The plot also indicates the position of the protoplanet's capture radius for 100 km planetesimals. It is about ten times larger than the core radius, leading to a core accretion rate that is about a factor 100 larger compared to the case of an envelope free core <ref type="bibr">(Eq. 15)</ref>.</p><p>At a small core mass, the gas accretion rate found by solving the internal structure equations ˙ M KH is small, because the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale is long <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref>.

This means that the envelope of the planet now contracts so quickly that (at least formally) an empty shell between the planet's envelope and the background nebula develops. The planet therefore detaches from the nebula and contracts rapidly, becoming much more centrally condensed. The gas now freely falls from the Hill sphere onto the planet, where it is accreted through an accretion shock 4 . The planetary gas accretion rate is thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">˙ M XY = min ˙ M KH , ˙ M XY,max .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>The disk-limited gas accretion rate ˙ M XY,max is controlled by a number of processes, namely, the local availability of gas, the gas flux through the disk that decreases itself in time, and the effect of gap formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Lubow et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">D'Angelo et al. 2011</ref>).

After the local reservoir has been exhausted, the global flux of gas in the disk towards the planet starts to limit the gas accretion. This rate is now given by (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. 2012c</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">˙ M XY,max,F = k Lub 3πνΣ + 6πr ∂νΣ ∂r (21)</formula><p>where k Lub is a factor that describes the fraction of the gas streaming viscously through the disk towards the planet that is eventually accreted onto it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Lubow et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Lubow &amp; D'Angelo 2006</ref>). Note that there is considerable uncertainty about the efficiency of gas accretion in the disklimited regime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Benz et al. 2013</ref>). This directly influences the predictions for the upper end of the planetary mass function, but also for type II migration and the resulting formation of Hot Jupiters.</p><p>Other global models of planet formation describe the accretion of gas in the phase when it is limited by the envelope's contraction in a parameterized way without solving the internal planet structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012)</ref>. Instead, a parametrization of the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale τ KH is used, and the gas accretion rate is written in an equation of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">˙ M XY = M τ KH (22)</formula><p>where the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale is itself a function of the planet mass M and the opacity κ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref>, typically approximated as τ KH = kM −p κ −q . A potential limitation of such an approach is the dependency on the parameters k, p, and q that are not well constrained (p ≈ 1.9-3.5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Miguel &amp; Brunini 2008)</ref>. This can have directly visible consequences in population syntheses, for example in the predicted planetary mass function <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Miguel &amp; Brunini 2008)</ref>. When no internal structures are calculated, no direct predictions for transit or direct imaging searches can be made, especially at early times when the formation still directly influences these quantities. On the other hand, the computational cost is much reduced. It should be noted that also the solution of the 1D structure equations is (currently) not completely free from prespecified parameters. This is due to the fact that in global models, the opacity κ in Eq. 18 is typically not found ab initio as in specialized models, but approximated as the ISM opacity multiplied with some prespecified reduction factor (cf. Sect. 6.3.2). These specialized models <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">(Podolak 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Movshovitz &amp; Podolak 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Movshovitz et al. 2010</ref>) find the grain opacity self-consistently by solving the Smoluchowski equation in each atmospheric layer including the effects of grain growth, settling, and vaporization. This is computationally time consuming, therefore <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Mordasini et al. (2014)</ref> have recently tried to parametrize these results for use in population synthesis models by deriving the reduction factor of the ISM opacity that leads to gas accretion timescales that agree with the results of the specialized models. The problem with this approach is that one global reduction factor cannot capture the dependency of the mechanisms governing the grain dynamics on planetary properties like the core and envelope mass. The "envelope", "infall", and "accretion rate" submodels of the global formation model shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> are very similar to classical 1D giant planet formation codes like <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack (1986)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Lissauer et al. (2009)</ref> which are the conceptual origin of this model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Helled et al. 2013</ref> for a recent review on giant planet formation). Despite this origin, most planets that  form in a population synthesis are in fact low-mass planets that do not trigger gas runaway accretion. These planets can, however, still be modeled with the restriction that primordial H/He envelopes are the only type of envelope that can currently be considered.</p><p>The extension into an evolutionary model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. 2012c)</ref> can bring a global model close to classical models of (giant) planet long-term evolution (cooling and contraction) like <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>. The set of equations for the internal structure during the evolution after the dissipation of the protoplanetary nebula remains the same as during formation, but they are solved with different outer boundary conditions as described in the "atmosphere" section below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Figure 7</ref> shows the long-term evolution of the internal structure of a close-in hot Jupiter planet represented by its pressure-temperature profile. The figure shows a temporal series of profiles, including both the atmosphere and the complete interior. The upper end of the lines thus corresponds to the outer radius of the planet, while the lower is the core-envelope boundary. The uppermost line shows the state shortly after the end of formation when the final mass has been reached, while the lowest line corresponds to the state after 5 Gyrs. The gradual cooling of the interior is obvious. The atmospheric model is the semi-gray solution of Guillot (2010) discussed below. The formation of a deep radiative zone that is characteristic for strongly irradiated giant planets is visible <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Guillot &amp; Showman 2002</ref>). In contrast to the interior, the temperature at the outer radius is nearly constant since it is dominated by stellar irradiation, which was assumed to be constant (the temporal evolution of the host star and its luminosity is neglected).</p></div>

A better atmospheric model than the gray atmosphere is the semi-gray approximation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Guillot (2010)</ref>. This model provides the temperature as a function of optical depth in an atmosphere that transports both an intrinsic heat flux and receives an outer irradiation flux.

This expression provides a fair approximation of detailed irradiated atmosphere models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">Showman et al. 2009</ref>) and therefore also gives more realistic cooling curves. This is important for the comparison of the radii of synthetic and actual transiting exoplanets. A better atmospheric structure also makes it possible to calculate the transit radius that is bigger than the τ≈1 radius to the grazing observational geometry more accurately (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Hansen 2008)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">Figure 8</ref> shows a typical example of the atmospheric structure of a Hot Jupiter found with the semi-gray model.

A strong reduction of the opacity in the visual leads to a deeper penetration of the irradiation into the planet (blue line), while an enhanced optical opacity leads to a hotter outer atmosphere with a temperature inversion, while the deep atmosphere is cooler (green line).</p><p>Besides the semi-gray atmospheres for strongly irradiated planets that are studied with transit observations, the gray atmosphere should also be replaced with a full coupling of the internal structure calculations with the nongray atmospheres of, e.g., Allard et al.

This will not only provide more accurate cooling curves for giant planets observed with direct imaging, but also their magnitudes in the different observational bands instead of the total luminosity only.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Infall of planetesimals into the protoplanet's envelope</head><p>This sub-model calculates the interaction of planetesimals and the gaseous envelope of the protoplanet during the formation phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. 2006</ref>). A similar sub-model was described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Podolak et al. (1988)</ref> for the classical giant planet models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>. This sub-model links the accretion of solid (5.4) and the envelope structure (5.5). Two quantities are the main output of the sub-model: the protoplanet's capture radius R capture for planetesimals that enters the solid accretion rate (Eq. 15), and the radial energy and mass deposition profiles that enter into the calculation of the envelope structure in particular via the equation for the luminosity. It also yields how much high-Z material is deposited in the envelope to enrich it, and how much of it directly reaches the core. This is important in the context of the (atmospheric) composition of planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Fortney et al. 2013</ref>). The sub-model calculating the interaction (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. 2006</ref>, for a short overview) includes gravity and gas drag, thermal ablation as for shooting stars, and aerodynamical disruption inspired by the destruction of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in Jupiter's atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Crawford et al. 1995)</ref> or the Tunguska event ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Chyba et al. 1993</ref>).</p><p>To model the interaction, a set of coupled ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, giving the position in three dimensions r, velocity ˙ r, mass M pl , and radius R pl of the impacting planetesimal as a function of time t.

S is the cross section of the planetesimal, equal to πR 2 pl for a spherical planetesimal. Note that it is only initially assumed that the planetesimal is spherical, later on it can get distorted due to aerodynamic forces.</p><p>As the planetesimal flies through the envelope, pressure and temperature are increasing. Eventually, two effects can lead to its destruction: thermal ablation and mechanical mass loss. These effects determine how deep the planetesimal is able to penetrate, thus determining where in the planet's envelope the energy and the debris of the planetesimals are deposited. The mass loss rate due to thermal ablation can be written in its simplest form as <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">(Opik 1958)</ref> dM pl</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">dt = − 1 2 C H ρ ˙ r 3 S 1 Q abl .<label>(32)</label></formula><p>Q abl is the amount of energy needed to heat body material from its initial temperature to the point where melting or vaporization occurs plus the specific heat needed for this phase change. The heat transfer coefficient C H is an a priori unknown function that can vary over many orders of magnitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Svetsov et al. 1995)</ref>. It depends on the velocity, envelope conditions, flow regime, shape of the body etc. and gives the fraction of the incoming kinetic energy flux of the gas that is available for ablation. Note that in order to compute this fraction, the hydro-and thermodynamic state of the flow surrounding the impacting planetesimals needs to be known. The most important flow regime for massive impactors is a hypersonic highly turbulent continuum flow. This means that a strong shock wave forms. The radiation field generated by the shock is the dominant heating source leading to thermal ablation, as temperatures in excess of 30'000 K are reached (e.g., Zahnle 1992). Therefore, in these conditions, the bow shock temperature must be computed by solving the shock jump conditions for a non-ideal gas (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Chevalier &amp; Sarazin 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Besides thermal ablation, mechanical effects can result in a rapid destruction of the planetesimal by fragmenting it into a large number of small pieces that eventually get thermally ablated. Mechanical destruction is of prime importance for massive (km-sized) impactors as was understood in the hydrodynamical simulations for SL-9 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Svetsov et al. 1995</ref>). The main effect to consider is the large pressure difference between the front of the planetesimal (stagnation point) and the back where the pressure almost vanishes. This pressure difference (if large enough) leads to a lateral spreading of the body (the so-called "pancake" model, introduced by Zahnle 1992) and eventually its disruption by fragmentation. The rate of lateral spreading is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">d 2 R pl dt 2 = C S ρ ρ b ˙ r 2 R pl .<label>(33)</label></formula><p>where C S is a coefficient of order unity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Chyba et al. 1993</ref>) while ρ b is the mean density of the fluidized impactor. The impactor acts approximately as a fluid for ram pressure exceeding the internal tensile strength by a large factor. The disruption into many fragments is then due to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities that grow due to the deceleration of the front side of the body (a denser fluid) by the shocked gas (a less dense fluid). Such instabilities are seen to develop in hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Korycansky et al. 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. (2006)</ref> describe this process as a fragmentation cascade due to growing RT fingers. In the non-linear stage, the height until which fingers have grown into the body h inst can be estimated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">(Sharp 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b286">Youngs 1989)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_31">d 2 h inst dt 2 = 2α ρ b − ρ stagn ρ b + ρ stagn¨r stagn¨ stagn¨r<label>(34)</label></formula><p>where the expression in brackets is the Atwood number, α a parameter ≈ 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">(Sharp 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b286">Youngs 1989</ref>) while ρ stagn is the gas density at the stagnation point. The combined actions of flattening and growth of RT fingers leads to a fast destruction of the impactor in a terminal explosion, similar as in the Tunguska event ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Chyba et al. 1993</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. (2006)</ref> illustrates the output of the "infall" sub-model. It shows the fate of stony planetesimals of various initial radii in protoplanetary envelopes with masses between 0.001 and 100 M ⊕ . The basic result is that the larger the impactor and the lower the envelope mass, the more likely it is that the planetesimal can penetrate to the core, as one expects. The plot shows that the detailed structure is, however, more complex. There are intermediate sized planetesimals (radii ∼100-1000 meters) that penetrate through surprisingly massive envelopes. They are too massive for efficient purely thermal ablation, but too small to undergo intense fragmentation. Big bodies (100 km) on the other hand are protected by their selfgravity from intense fragmentation. It is clear that these results depend on the material properties of the impactors which are typically not well constrained. Icy planetesimal are more prone to destruction in the envelope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Podolak et al. 1988)</ref>, for large impactors mainly due to their lower tensile strength (by about a factor 100, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Chyba et al. 1993)</ref>.

Fate of planetesimals in the envelope of a growing giant planet. The plot shows whether they can penetrate to the solid core or if they get completely destroyed in the envelope as a function of the envelope mass of the protoplanet and the initial radius of the impacting planetesimal (thick solid line). Planetesimals inside the roughly squared region limited by the thin line in the upper right corner undergo aerodynamic fragmentation (figure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Mordasini et al. 2006</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">v 0 = 1 R H Ω K Stone Central</formula><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Asphaug &amp; Benz 1994)</ref>, the ability of planetesimals to reach the solid core would be even more reduced. The population synthesis framework shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> is currently the only global planet formation and evolution model that explicitly addresses the interaction of planetesimals and the protoplanetary atmosphere. The coupling with the rest of the model is, however, at the moment not yet self-consistent. Despite the fact that the mass deposition profiles are calculated, it is assumed in the "envelope" submodel that all accreted solids immediately sink to the core ("sinking approximation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>). The output of the "infall" sub-model is thus not used to calculate the (radially changing) composition of the gas, and linked to that, its opacity. Both are known to be important for the formation process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Hori &amp; Ikoma 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Movshovitz et al. 2010)</ref>, and compositional gradients even have the potential to lead to a semi-convective interior instead of the usually assumed fully convective state in giant planets, with important consequences for the cooling and inferred bulk composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012)</ref>.

It is necessary for the correct prediction of the total radius of solid planets without a sizable H/He envelope. But also for giant planets, it is necessary to calculate the core radius correctly to obtain accurate total radii during the evolutionary phase (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. 2012c)</ref>.</p><p>The sub-model for the solid core used in the global model of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> was originally developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Figueira et al.

As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, the radius is found by solving the 1D internal structure equations that are in principle the same as for the gaseous envelope. The situation is, however, considerably simplified by assuming that the density of the solid material ρ is (in contrast to gas) approximately independent of temperature, so that the density is function of pressure P only. The system of equations to solve is then just</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">dm dr = 4πr 2 ρ dP dr = − Gm r 2 ρ<label>(35)</label></formula><p>which are the equations of mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium (m denotes the core mass inside a radius r, G is the gravitational constant).

An advantage of this EoS is that it approaches at sufficiently high pressures (giant planet cores) the correct asymptotic limit which is the EoS of a completely degenerate, non-relativistic electron gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">(Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter 1969)</ref>. The mean density of a core of a massive giant planet can in principle reach very high values exceeding 100 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , with potentially observable consequences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Charpinet et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref> illustrates the output of this sub-model by showing the radius as a function of mass for low-mass solid planets (no external pressure). Three different bulk compositions are shown: Earth-like with a 2:1 silicate-toiron ratio, pure water ice, and a mixture of both types of materials. The plot shows that the radius follows to good approximation a power-law, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">Valencia et al. (2006)</ref>.</p><p>A second output of this sub-model is the timedependent radiogenic luminosity of the solid core that is due to the decay of long-lived radionuclides in the mantle. As described in Mordasini et al.

The radiogenic core luminosity is very small compared to the luminosity due to the cooling of the gaseous envelope of a giant planet. For core dominated planets it can, however, become the dominant internal heat source during the evolution over gigayears, and therefore affect the contraction of the planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Nettelmann et al. 2011</ref>). Much can be improved in the basic description of the interior of solid planets presented here, like the inclusion of a more accurate EoS, the calculation of the radial temperature structure or the thermal cooling of the interior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">Valencia et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013b)</ref>. At early times, the effect of cooling of the core could be particularly important for rocky planets with cores retaining residual heat from the accretion process, especially if the core contains heat from a violent, short timescale build-up <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . Also the process of core formation (differentiation of rocky planets into a metallic core and silicate mantle) provides an important heating source, the timescale of which is however not yet entirely clear ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">Rubie et al. 2007</ref>). Further improvements could be to include the dissolution of the solid core in giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Guillot et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Wilson &amp; Militzer 2012</ref>) and the outgassing of secondary atmospheres given the core's composition acquired during formation (e.g., .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.10.">Orbital migration</head><p>The discovery of a Jovian planet at an orbital distance of only 0.05 AU from its star by <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Mayor &amp; Queloz (1995)</ref> was a surprise because theoretical planet formation models had rather predicted (e.g., Boss 1995) that giant planets should be found several AU away, as it is the case in the Solar System. The mechanism that was underestimated was orbital migration, i.e., the radial displacement of planets. Several mechanism can cause orbital migration including classical disk migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980)</ref>, migration due to the planetesimal disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Levison et al. 2010;</ref>), or Kozai migration with tidal circularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Kozai 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref>. Another possible mechanism producing close-in planets is planet-planet scattering followed by tidal circularization (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ivanov &amp; Papaloizou 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Beaugé &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´ Nesvorn´y 2012)</ref>. Support for such a dynamical origin of Hot Jupiters arises from the distribution of the orbital distances of these planets relative to the Roche limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Ford &amp; Rasio 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Valsecchi &amp; Rasio 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, but see Rice et al. 2012</ref> for a contrasting view) or the observation of highly inclined planetary orbits relative to the stellar equator via measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">Winn et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Triaud et al. 2010</ref>). Such misaligned orbits are not expected from classical disk migration (but see also Batygin 2012). The relative importance of the various mechanisms that lead to Hot Jupiters is currently debated. A recent comparison of the distribution of the spin-orbit angles indicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Crida &amp; Batygin 2014</ref>) that both disk migration and dynamical mechanisms contribute.</p><p>Here we concentrate on classical disk migration which is the consequence of the gravitational interaction of the gaseous protoplanetary disk and embedded planets. This mechanism was the first to be included in most global planet formation models. The dynamical effects in multibody systems that can potentially also lead to Hot Jupiters were in contrast only addressed recently in population syntheses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Ida et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. 2013</ref>). The main result of the large body of studies addressing disk migration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kley &amp; Nelson 2012</ref>, for a recent review) is that angular momentum is being transferred between disk and planet via torques that lead in most cases to a loss of angular momentum for the planet (inward migration). The angular momentum J of a planet of mass M in orbit around a star of mass M * at a semimajor axis a, and the migration rate da/dt under the action of a total torque Γ tot are given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">J = M GM * a da dt = 2a Γ tot J (40)</formula><p>Two types of migration are distinguished depending upon the mass of the planet, respectively its impact on the disk structure. Low-mass planets (M 10-100 M ⊕ ) lead to angular momentum fluxes that are much smaller than the background viscous angular momentum transport and therefore do not affect the surface density of the disk in a significant way. They migrate in type I migration where the total torque is found by summing up the contributions from the inner and outer Lindblad torques plus the corotation torque (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Ward 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Tanaka et al. 2002)</ref>. The total torque Γ tot can be expressed in a form like )</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">Γ tot = 1 γ (C 0 + C 1 p Σ + C 2 p T )Γ 0 Γ 0 = q h 2 Σa 4 Ω 2 (41)</formula><p>where γ is the adiabatic index of the gas, q = M/M * , h the disk aspect ratio, Σ the gas surface density at the planet's position, and Ω the Keplerian frequency. The constants C i depend on the local thermodynamical regime in the disk. The quantities p Σ and p T are the local radial power-law slopes of the gas surface density and temperature profile in the protoplanetary disk. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref> assumed a locally isothermal disk which results in fast inward migration for typical disk conditions. These equations were used in several older population synthesis calculations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Ida &amp; Lin 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Alibert et al. 2011</ref>) where it was found -not surprisingly-that the migration rates needed to be reduced by large factors to bring the synthetic results in better agreement with observations. In the meantime it was understood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Baruteau &amp; Masset 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Casoli &amp; Masset 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Paardekooper et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Kley et al. 2009</ref>) that in more realistic non-isothermal disks, there are several sub-types of type I migration, some of which lead to outward migration. The different sub-types can be identified by the comparison of four characteristic timescales, namely, the U-turn, the viscous, the libration, and the cooling timescale <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Dittkrist et al. 2014</ref>). These more realistic type I descriptions were used in several recent population synthesis simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Dittkrist et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In each type I sub-regime, the migration rate and direction depend besides the planet's mass on the local radial slopes of the surface density and temperature that are given  by the disk model (Sect. 5.2). These slopes change due to opacity transitions which has the consequence in the adiabatic sub-regime that there are special places in the disk with zero net torque and a negative dΓ tot /da. This means that inwards of these positions, migration is directed outwards, and outwards of them, it is directed inwards, so that planets in this convergence zone migrate from both sides towards the migration traps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Lyra et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Sándor et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Kretke &amp; Lin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Dittkrist et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows the semimajor axis of six growing planets undergoing non-isothermal migration. All planets migrate in the same protoplanetary disk, but do not interact mutually. The planetary embryos start at different locations ranging from 3 to 8 AU. One sees that at the beginning, the planets starting inside of 6 AU migrate quickly outwards, while those starting further out migrate inwards, so that all planets reach the convergence point where the total torque vanishes. If the disk itself would not evolve, migration would stop at this point. Due to disk evolution the point of vanishing torque moves itself inwards. This inward migration is much slower than isothermal type I migration as it happens on a viscous timescale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Paardekooper et al. 2010)</ref>. During this time, the planets grow by accreting planetesimals and gas.</p><p>After a few 10 5 years, the planets leave the convergence point because the corotation torque saturates, so that they are back at faster inward migration. Shortly afterwards, the planets are sufficiently massive that they transition into type II migration (see below) which is again slower. The planets eventually stop as the local disk mass becomes smaller than the planet mass, so that the inertia of the planet prevents further rapid migration. Simulations that include the gravitational interaction and collisions between the protoplanets find that the convergence zone can be the place of rapid growth as it concentrates a lot of matter in one region. It has therefore the potential to be a preferred place for rapid core formation for (giant) planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Horn et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The second main type of disk driven migration is type II migration of sufficiently massive planets. The gravitational interaction of such massive planets with the protoplanetary disks repels the gas in an annulus around the planet, so that a gap forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Lin &amp; Papaloizou 1986)</ref>. According to the so-called viscous criterion for gap formation, the torque due to the presence of the planet (that repels the gas) must be larger than the background torque in the disk due to turbulent viscosity (that tries to fill up the gap). The additional thermal criterion demands that the disk vertical scale height should be smaller than the planetary Hill sphere radius, so that no sharp, unstable density gradients arise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Crida et al. (2006</ref>) derived a combined criterion that was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. (2012b)</ref> while earlier population syntheses partially only used the thermal criterion.</p><p>Type II migration itself comes in two sub-regimes (Armitage 2007). Disk-dominated type II migration occurs if the mass of the planet M is much smaller than the local disk mass (∼ Σa 2 ). The planet then acts as a relay that communicates the viscous torques in the disk across the gap by tidal torques. The planet's migration is then locked to the evolution of the disk itself. The migration rate is thus equal to the radial velocity of the gas v r,gas</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">da dt = v r,gas = − 3 Σ √ r ∂ ∂r Σν √ r (42) = − 3ν 2r − 3 Σ ∂ ∂r (Σν) ,<label>(43)</label></formula><p>but note that hydrodynamic simulations find a more complex behavior depending on the planet mass and gas surface density <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Edgar 2007)</ref>. This means that inside of the radius of maximum viscous couple (or velocity reversal, Lynden-Bell &amp; Pringle 1974), the planet migrates inwards (which is the normal case) while in the outer parts where the disk is spreading, it moves outwards. Massive planets in the inner disk (or at late times into the disk evolution) are more massive than the local disk mass, so that planet-dominated migration occurs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.11.">Interaction between several (proto-)planets</head><p>From the oligarchic growth regime (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Ida &amp; Makino 1993)</ref> it is expected that throughout the disk massive bodies ("oligarchs") form with radial spacings equal to a few mutual Hill spheres. For such a concurrent formation of many protoplanets, multiple effects arise due to the interaction of the planets: regarding accretion, the planets compete for the accretion of gas and solids, excite the random velocities of the planetesimals with consequences for the solid accretion rate of neighboring protoplanets, and increase (for insufficient damping by the disk of gas or planetesimals) the eccentricities of the massive bodies which leads to collisions among the protoplanets and/or their ejection. Also the orbital migration is modified, since migrating planets can get caught into mean-motion resonances, which can, for example, cause outward migration of giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Masset &amp; Snellgrove 2001)</ref>. The modification of the surface density of the gas disk due to an already formed giant planets affects the migration of subsequently forming cores (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Masset et al. 2006</ref>). The population synthesis calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. (2009b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. ( -2012b</ref>) in contrast assumed that only one planet per disk forms. This one-embryo-per-disk approximation is probably the most severe limitation of the first generation of global models, especially for low-mass planets since the observations show (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>) that such planets are mostly found in multiple planet systems. Therefore it is likely that the formation of each planet was influenced by the presence of other bodies. For single giant planets, the impact is probably less severe.</p><p>In the context of global planet formation models, this limitation was recently addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ida &amp; Lin (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Ida et al. (2013), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. (2013)</ref>. In the latter work, an explicit N-body integrator was added "on top" of the existing model that calculates the gravitational interaction and the collisions of concurrently forming protoplanets. Typically 10 protoplanets per disk are considered in order to keep the computational time on a level that still allows to conduct planetary population synthesis calculations. The effects of the gravitational interaction with the gaseous disk (eccentricity damping) is modeled as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Fogg &amp; Nelson (2007)</ref>, and it is assumed that the planetesimal surface density is uniform in overlapping feeding zones. The planetesimals are still described via a surface density and a mean dynamical state, and not as individual (super-)particles as it is the case in the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hellary &amp; Nelson (2012)</ref>. In this model, both the protoplanets and the planetesimals (represented by super particles) interact via an explicit N-body integration. The population synthesis models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ida &amp; Lin (2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">-2008b</ref> also initially used the one-embryo-per-disk approximation but allowed for several generations of subsequently forming planets. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ida &amp; Lin (2010)</ref>  approach was presented to describe the gravitational interaction of several protoplanets in a statistical way based on orbit crossing timescales. The advantage of such an approach is the small computational cost that is several orders of magnitude lower than direct N-body integrations. Here, one can clearly see the different origins of various global formation models that are used for statistical studies, like giant planet formation as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> for the Alibert, Mordasini &amp; Benz models, N-body calculations for the Hellary &amp; Nelson (2012) models, or a dedicated code for a rapid calculations of statistical results as in the case of the Ida &amp; Lin models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.12.">Illustrative output: formation tracks</head><p>An illustrative output of the population synthesis framework represented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 12</ref>. It shows formation tracks in the mass-distance plane for the oneembryo-per-disk approximation. The non-isothermal type I migration model is used. Planetary embryos are inserted at a given starting distance into protoplanetary disk of varied properties with an initial mass of 0.6 Earth masses. They then grow by accreting planetesimals and gas, and concurrently migrate due to the interaction with the gas disk. The distribution of the final positions of the planets (at the moment the protoplanetary disk goes away) can be compared with the observed semimajor axis-mass distribution.</p><p>One can see that the outcome of the formation process is of a high diversity, despite the fact that always exactly the same formation model is used. This is a basic outcome similar to the observational result. In the figure, one can, for example, find tracks that lead to the formation of hot Jupiters. Most embryos, however, remain at a low mass, since they cannot accrete a sufficient amount of planetesimals to start rapid gas accretion and become a giant planet. At an orbital distance of 0.2 to 1 AU, an over-density of lowmass planets (M 5M ⊕ ) can be seen. These are planets that are captured in the inner convergence zone (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>). One also notes that almost all giant planets are inside of 1 AU, which is not in agreement with observations. This points to too rapid inward orbital migration in the model, meaning that the theoretical description of this process must be further improved. It is a typical result that the synthetic mass distribution (discussed in the next section) is in better agreement with the observational data than the synthetic semimajor axis distribution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>).</p><p>he HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets 00. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Comparisons with observation</head><p>In this section we discuss important selected comparisons between theoretical and observed statistical properties.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Radial velocity: the planetary initial mass function</head><p>Among the many outputs that can be compared with observations, one of the most fundamental results of population synthesis is a prediction for the distribution of planetary masses. It is obvious that the planetary mass function has many important implications, including the question about the frequency of habitable extrasolar planets. In the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 13</ref>, the planetary mass function is shown as derived from the high-precision radial velocity Harps survey of FGK dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). It makes clear that below a mass of approximately 30 Earth masses, there is a strong increase in the frequency. In particular, lowmass planets of with masses less than ∼10M ⊕ are very frequent. The right panels shows the predicted mass function from an early population synthesis calculations of planets around a 1 M star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref> , see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Ida &amp; Lin 2004a</ref>). The synthetic model predicted a large population of low-mass planets. A feature that is very interesting from a theoretical point of view is that also in the theoretical curve, there is a strong change in the frequency at a similar mass as in the observations. This is explained by the fact that in this mass domain (beyond the critical core mass), planets start to accrete nebular gas in a rapid, runaway process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Mizuno et al. 1978</ref>). They then quickly grow to masses M 100M ⊕ . It is unlikely that the protoplanetary disk disappears exactly during the short time during which the planet transforms from a Neptunian into a Jovian planet. This makes that planets with intermediate masses 30M ⊕ are less frequent ("planetary desert", first found in Ida &amp; Lin 2004a). The "dryness" of the desert depends directly on the rate at which planets can accrete gas during the runaway phase (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Mordasini et al. 2011</ref>), while the mass where the frequency drops represents the mass where runaway gas accretion starts, i.e., the critical core mass which is of order 15M ⊕ , so that the total mass is about 30M ⊕ (core and envelope mass are approximately equal when the rapid accretion of gas sets in, <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>). We thus see how the comparison of synthetic and actual mass function constrains the core accretion model. We further note that while qualitatively, model and observation agree in the basic result that low-mass planets are very frequent, quantitatively the number of detectable planet at 1 and 0.1 m/s is clearly underestimated in the model. This could partially be related to the one-embryo-per-disk approximation that is used in this early simulation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Benz et al. 2013</ref> for an updated synthetic mass function).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Astrometry and microlensing: exploring different sub-populations</head><p>The observational constraints from astrometric observations are in principle similar to those from the radial velocity technique, with the difference that the actual mass is measured, and that the detection sensitivity increases with semimajor axis. To date, detecting extrasolar planets with this technique has proven difficult to achieve (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">Sahlmann et al. 2011</ref>), but is the ultimate goal of a num-24 C. Mordasini et al.: Global Models of Planet Formation and Evolution ber of ground based (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Prima, Launhardt et al. 2008)</ref> and space based missions (like the proposed Neat satellite, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Malbet et al. 2011</ref>). In any case, the Gaia satellite is predicted to discover a very large number of extrasolar giant planets (several thousands at intermediate orbital distances of ∼1 to 4 AU, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Casertano et al. 2008</ref>). Since these discoveries will result from an unbiased, magnitude-limited survey with a well defined detection bias (similar to the Kepler satellite), they will be extremely useful for statistical studies of giant planet formation.</p><p>Also results from the microlensing technique are important for statistical studies, since they probe the subpopulation of low-mass planets at a few AU of orbital distance that is not accessible to other techniques. Microlensing is in some sense an extreme statistics-only method, because in its simplest form it only yields the distance of the planet in units of the star's Einstein radius and the ratio of the planet's mass to the (unknown) host star mass, meaning that very few physical information about an individual planet is revealed (this can change if a number of effects like the microlensing parallax, the orbital motion of the planet, or finite source effects can be measured, see, e.g., Gaudi 2012).</p><p>For statistical studies, this is not necessarily a problem, provided that the number of detections is sufficiently high and that the observational detection bias is well known. A number of studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>) have already used the microlensing discoveries to derive the frequency and a power-law exponent for the planetary mass function. From a theoretical point of view it seems rather unlikely that two parameters (normalization and power-law slope) are sufficient to describe the planetary mass function over three orders of magnitude in mass (from a few 10 0 to a few 10 3 M ⊕ ) as it is currently made in the observational studies due to the low number of microlensing planets. From the core accretion paradigm one expects that at least four parameters are needed (this will still be a rough approximation only), because there are two different fundamental types of planets (solid planets and gas giants) for which different physical mechanisms determine the mass. The two types should therefore come with separate slopes and normalizations as one can already deduce from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 13</ref>. As the number of microlensing planets is expected to increase thanks to ground and space based observations with satellites like Euclid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Penny et al. 2013</ref>) or Wfirst ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Goullioud et al. 2012</ref>), it will become possible to test this prediction observationally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Transits</head><p>In the past few years, there was a very rapid increase of observational data coming from photometric observations, in particular thanks to the Kepler satellite. This new observational data provides important new impulses to planet formation and evolution theory, since it adds constraints that go beyond the position of a planet in the mass-distance diagram. Extended comparisons of theoretical and observational results derived from transit observations can be found for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. (2012b)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2013b)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Marcy et al. (2014)</ref> to name just a few. Here we concentrate on two important results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Synthetic mass-radius diagram</head><p>The first is the mass-radius diagram. The observed massradius relationship was shown in Sect. 2.2. Here we discuss its synthetic counterpart. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 14</ref> shows a comparison of the mass-radius relationship of actual and synthetic planets as found in a population synthesis that combines planet formation and evolution (modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref>). The global shape of the planetary massradius relationship can be understood from the core accretion paradigm and the basic properties of matter as expressed in the equations of state: Low-mass planets can only accrete tenuous H/He envelopes since their KelvinHelmholtz timescale of envelope contraction during the formation phase is long compared to the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref>. Therefore, the top left corner in the M-R plane remains empty, as no low-mass, gas-dominated planets come into existence.</p><p>Also the bottom right and middle part remains empty. For typical protoplanetary disks, this is simply a consequence of the fact that such disks do not contain enough mass in metals to form a solid Jovian-mass planet. For the MMSN, for example, one can roughly estimate a total amount of heavy elements of M disk,MMSN × Z ≈ 0.013M × 0.015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Hayashi 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Lodders 2003</ref>) which corresponds to about 64 M ⊕ . However, for a very massive metal rich disk, we can in contrast have a disk gas mass that is still selfgravitationally stable of about 10% of the stellar mass and a metallicity [Fe/H]=0.5. Then one estimates for a 1 M star a total mass of heavy elements of order 1M × 0.1 × Z × 10 0.5 which gives about 1600 M ⊕ (for a similar discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>). Obviously, it is not clear how much of this mass can be incorporated into one planet and at what point of the formation process this should happen.</p><p>In this context it useful to note that a number of transiting giant planets seem to have extreme amounts of metals in their interior as estimated from their mass-radius relation: for Hat-P-20b <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Leconte et al. (2011)</ref> estimate of order 340 M ⊕ of metals (water) in the interior; about 300-1000 M ⊕ of solids seem to reside in Corot-20b <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Deleuil et al. 2012</ref>, using the internal structure model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Guillot &amp; Morel 1995)</ref>. This indicates that large amounts of solids are indeed available in some disks and that some planets even manage to accrete a significant fraction of the totally available metal inventory. From these considerations it appears that just from the availability of metals in protoplanetary disks, it is not excluded that in principle a, say, 100 M ⊕ planet made entirely of ices could form. Yet, no such planet has been observed to date: all known planets in this mass range (M 100M ⊕ ) have a mass-radius relation that shows that they contain significant amounts of H/He (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 2</ref>). This is expected from the core accretion model since massive cores necessarily cause runaway gas accretion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 1999)</ref>, so that the final composition of the forming planet contains significant amounts of envelope gas, at least if the cores form during the presence of the gaseous nebula. Thus, no massive purely solid planets come into existence that would populate the bottom right and middle part of the mass-radius diagram. One further notes that the synthetic and most actual planets (both in-and outside of the Solar System) populate similar loci in the mass-radius plane.</p><p>From the position of a planet in the mass-radius relationship it is possible to deduce (within limits due to the degeneracies, cf. Rogers &amp; Seager 2010) the bulk composition of a planet. The plot shows that depending on the mass range, there can be many different associated radii for one mass, reflecting a large diversity in interior compositions (in this case, fraction of heavy elements versus H/He). These different compositions are in turn due to the different formation histories. It is, for example, found that for the low planetesimal random velocities assumed here, planets at large distances typically contain a higher fraction of solid elements, since the mass of planetesimals available to accrete (the isolation mass) increases for typical disk models (radial slope of the planetesimal surface density) with distance. This correlation is preserved even under the action of disk migration. It might not be preserved if scattering is responsible for the formation of close-in planets. This could open a new possibility to distinguish different modes of formation for Hot Jupiters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Impact of grain opacity on the planetary radius distribution</head><p>The second example of a synthetic result that can be compared with transit observations is the planetary radius distribution. It can serve as an example of how planet population synthesis can be used to study the global consequences of a specific physical mechanism (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Mordasini et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 15</ref> compares the observed distribution of radii of planets inside of 0.27 AU as found by the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Howard et al. 2012</ref>) with the radius distribution in three different population syntheses. The three calculations are identical except for the value of f κ . This parameter describes the reduction factor of the opacity due to grains suspended in the protoplanetary atmosphere during the formation phase relative to the interstellar value. A value of f κ = 1 means that the full interstellar opacity is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Bell &amp; Lin 1994)</ref>, while f κ = 0 means that we are dealing with a grain-free gas where only molecular opacities contribute ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Freedman et al. 2008</ref>). These opacities are used when calculating the internal structure of the planets (Sect. 5.5) where the magnitude of the opacity is important for the rate at which planets can accrete primordial H/He envelopes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref>. At low opacities, the liberated gravitational potential energy of the accreted gas can be more promptly radiated away, allowing the envelope to contract faster, so that new gas can be accreted. Specialized microphysical models of grain evolution predict that the opacity should be strongly reduced in protoplanetary atmospheres relative to the ISM because grains grow rapidly in the denser atmosphere and then settle into the deeper parts of the envelope where they are vaporized <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">(Podolak 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Movshovitz &amp; Podolak 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Movshovitz et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the radius bin in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 15</ref> that contains the giant planets at about 1 Jovian radius (≈11 Earth radii), we see that with full grain opacities, there are too few synthetic planets relative to the observations. With vanishing grain opacities, the efficiency of giant planet formation is on the contrary too high in the model relative to the data. A relatively good agreement with the observations is found with a f κ = 0.003 (middle panel), which is the value derived from fitting gas accretion timescales found with detailed grain growth models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Movshovitz et al. 2010</ref>). Even if this comparison is preliminary (it is unclear whether the fitting value found for a specific simulation can generalized to the entire population, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Mordasini et al. 2014</ref>), it shows that the grain opacity has statistically visible population-wide consequences. This open the possibility to observationally test microphysical grain models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Direct imaging: luminosity at young ages</head><p>The direct imaging technique measures the intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters. This is interesting for planet formation and evolution theory because it is an observable quantity that is determined by the entropy of the gas in the interior of the planet. The entropy is in turn determined by the structure of the accretion shock of gas during the gas runaway accretion phase. Even more fundamentally, the entropy state could be related to the basic giant planet formation mechanism (core accretion versus gravitational instability, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Galvagni et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The number of planets detected by this method has increased significantly in the last few years (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Marleau &amp; Cumming 2014</ref>, for an overview).

Customized means that the quantities that are known for this specific star (its mass and metallicity) are fixed at the observed values, in contrast to normal population syntheses where these quantities are Monte Carlo variables. Additionally, the properties of the synthetic planets are studied at the actual age of the star. β Pictoris is orbited by a directly imaged companion at a semimajor axis of about 8-10 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Lagrange et al. , 2010</ref>.

According to "hot start" models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>) that assume an arbitrary (high) value of the entropy after formation without considering the actual formation phase, these values correspond to a mass of the companion of 9 +3 −2 Jovian masses. Radial velocity observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Lagrange et al. 2012)</ref> show that the mass of the companion must be less than 10 and 25 Jovian masses for semimajor axes of 8 and 12 AU, respectively.

The new result shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 16</ref> is that the theoretical model predicts besides mass and semimajor axis also the luminosity and effective temperature. Thus it becomes possible to combine the constraints from both direct imaging and radial velocity. The plot shows that there are indeed a number of planets that agree in all four fundamental properties (a, M, L, and T eff ) with the observed values, indicating that β Pictoris b could have formed by core accretion and that it has a mass in the planetary mass domain of about 10 Jovian masses. Note that this result directly depends on the assumption in the formation model that the planetesimal random velocities are low as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Pollack et al.

While investigating the reason for the discrepancy, it was found that the difference between the simulations stems from different core masses M core : in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> simulations, the core masses are less than 19 M ⊕ , while the synthetic planets that agree with the observations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 16</ref> have much more massive cores exceeding ∼100 M ⊕ . For identical core masses, the two models agree well. This insight from the population synthesis led to a systematic dedicated study of the dependency of the post-formation entropy and luminosity on the core mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">(Mordasini 2013)</ref>. This is therefore another example how global models feed back into specialized ones. It was found that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass due to a self-amplifying mechanism (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Mordasini 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Bodenheimer et al. 2013</ref> for details).</p><p>It is currently unclear whether such massive cores can actually form, especially at large orbital distances. Several factors play a role, like for example the settling of dissolved planetesimal material towards the center of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Iaroslavitz &amp; Podolak 2007)</ref> and the timescale of core accretion which might get speeded up if mainly small bodies are accreted (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Ormel &amp; Klahr 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Kratter &amp; Murray-Clay 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Lambrechts &amp; Johansen 2012)</ref>. At least for some close-in transiting giant planets, very large core masses ( 100M ⊕ ) have been inferred as mentioned from the observed mass-radius relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Miller &amp; Fortney 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Deleuil et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Summary</head><p>We have reviewed global planet formation models that are used in population synthesis calculations. Such global models predict the properties of a planetary system based on the properties of a protoplanetary disk. They therefore establish a link between two classes of observable astrophysical objects which are on one hand the protoplanetary disks as the initial conditions for the planet formation process and on the other hand the extrasolar planets that are the final outcome of this process. Global models have mainly been used in statistical studies. Such studies are a young approach that helps to improve the theory of planet formation by the comparison of theoretical results and statistical observational constraints provided by the entire population of extrasolar planets. With this approach, the global effects of many different physical mechanisms occurring during planet formation and evolution can be assessed, and (often strongly simplified) theoretical descriptions of these processes derived from specialized models can be tested against observations.</p><p>The first group of extrasolar planets that was known in sufficient numbers for statistical comparisons were giant planets detected by the radial velocity method. Population synthesis calculations therefore initially concentrated on studying the mass and semimajor axis distribution of this type of planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>).</p><p>After this first phase of extrasolar planet detection, recent observational progress now also provides a first geophysical characterization of a growing number of planets outside of the Solar System (Sect. 3). This has led to additional observational constraints for global models like the planetary mass-radius relationship <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 2)</ref> or the intrinsic luminosities of young giant planets <ref type="bibr">(Section 6.4)</ref>.</p><p>In order to yield synthetic populations that can be directly compared with all these different techniques, global models unite in one point the essential results of a significant number of specialized sub-models that describe one specific physical mechanism. The global formation and evolution model mainly discussed in this paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Alibert et al. 2005a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Mordasini et al. 2012c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alibert et al. 2013</ref>), for example consists of eleven sub-models <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> addressing the following aspects: (1) the vertical structure of the protoplanetary disk. (2) the radial structure of the protoplanetary disk. (3) the disk of solids (planetesimals). <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> the core accretion rate of the protoplanet. (5) the planetary gas envelope. (6) the atmosphere of the (proto)planet. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> the infall of planetesimals into the protoplanet's envelope. (8) the internal structure of the solid core. (9) the atmospheric escape (envelope evaporation) during evolution. (10) the orbital migration due to tidal interaction with the protoplanetary gas disk and finally (11) the gravitational interaction between the protoplanets. There are therefore three different classes of sub-models, namely those that describe the protoplanetary disk <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>, those that describe one (proto)planet (4-9), and those that describe the interactions <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. In this paper, we have presented detailed descriptions of the physics included in these different submodels and addressed their limitations and possible future improvements.</p><p>Due to their nature as meta models, the global models discussed in this review depend directly on the results of many different specialized models, and therefore on the development of the entire field of planet formation theory. There are important uncertainties in this theory regarding even key aspects, therefore it is likely that the global models presented here will in future undergo significant modifications. These aspects include (1) the formation of planetesimals and the resulting "initial" distribution of solids in the disk. (2) the accretion of the solid core. (3) the opacity in the protoplanetary atmosphere and the associated gas accretion timescale. (4) the efficiency of orbital migration (which is still too rapid even with non-isothermal migration, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 12</ref>) and (5) the magnitude of gas accretion in the runaway phase. The later two points could be addressed with 2D hydrodynamic simulations which can now be run over long timescales ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Zhu et al. 2011</ref>) instead of 1D disk models. It is also possible that at some point it becomes necessary to abandon the simplifications that planetary systems form in isolation, because the gravitational interaction with other stars in young stellar clusters could be important ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Malmberg et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The description of planetary evolution in the global models should in future include better atmospheric models and address the effects of heavy element settling, core erosion in giant planets, and eventually the formation of secondary atmospheres based on the composition acquired during the planets' formation for low mass planets. Future global models of planet formation and evolution should therefore also include better descriptions of condensation and disk chemistry, so that the resulting compo-sition of the planets can be predicted in a more detailed and self-consistent way ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Thiabaud et al. 2014</ref>). On a longer timescale, this should make it possible to predict the habitability of a planet based on its formation.</p><p>Despite the current limitations, when used in planetary population synthesis calculations, global models can already now yield many testable predictions for the major observational techniques. This is important in a time where many surveys both from space and ground yield or will soon yield large amounts of additional data on both the global statistics and the detailed physical characteristics of extrasolar planets. Seeking for the theoretical models that best explain these combined data sets will be a promising approach towards a better understanding of planet formation and evolution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>C</head><label></label><figDesc>.

Other quantities that are tested are the detection frequency, and all different 1D distributions. It can further be studied if correlations exist between the ini- tial conditions and the planet properties (Ida &amp; Lin 2004b; Mordasini et al. 2012a), and if similar correlation exist in reality. The most important observed correlation is the one between the stellar metallicity and the frequency of giant planets. Giant planets are much more frequent around high metallicity stars (Gonzalez 1997; Santos et al. 2004; Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005), a correlation that can be reproduced with formation models based on the core-accretion theory (Ida &amp; Lin 2004b; Mordasini et al. 2009b).</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Note that the mass-radius relation is a function of time at least for planets with a significant gaseous envelope because they contract on Gyr timescales. The a-M is usually more static at late times (several Gyrs after formation). But at early times (typically a few 10-100 Myrs after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk) it also evolves due to giant impacts, gravitational interactions, and atmospheric mass loss.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> It is clear that this is an artificial concept since disks are a gradually forming byproduct of star formation. Simple cloud collapse models (Shu 1977) can be used to describe the initial formation of the disk by infall (Hueso &amp; Guillot 2005; Dullemond et al. 2006).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> This applies to the strictly 1D picture. Hydrodynamic simulation in 3D show a basically similar picture, with the difference that at the moment of rapid contraction, the spherical symmetry is lost, as a circumplanetary disk forms (Ayliffe &amp; Bate 2012). This can not be captured in 1D models.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> Sometimes, the outer radiative zone is called the &quot;atmosphere&quot; in this phase (e.g., Movshovitz &amp; Podolak 2008).</note>
