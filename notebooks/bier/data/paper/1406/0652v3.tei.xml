				<p>Context. In the context of the space missions CoRoT, Kepler, Gaia, TESS, and PLATO, precise and accurate stellar ages, masses, and radii are of paramount importance. For instance, they are crucial for constraining scenarii of planetary formation and evolution. Aims. We aim at quantifying how detailed stellar modelling can improve the accuracy and precision on age and mass of individual stars. To that end, we adopt a multifaceted approach where we carefully examine how the number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on observations and on model input physics affect the results of age-dating and weighing. Methods. We modelled ⋆ in detail the exoplanet host-star HD 52265, a main-sequence, solar-like oscillator that CoRoT observed for four months. We considered different sets of observational constraints (Hertzsprung-Russell data, metallicity, various sets of seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties of HD 52265 inferred from stellar models, and we quantified the impact of the model input physics and free parameters. We also compared model ages with ages derived by empirical methods or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion. Results. For our case study HD 52265, our seismic analysis provides an age A = 2.10 − 2.54 Gyr, a mass M = 1.14 − 1.32 M ⊙ , and a radius R = 1.30 − 1.34 R ⊙ , which corresponds to age, mass, and radius uncertainties of ∼ 10, ∼ 7, and ∼ 1.5 per cent, respectively. These uncertainties account for observational errors and current state-of-the-art stellar model uncertainties. Our seismic study also provides constraints on surface convection properties through the mixing-length, which we find to be 12 − 15 per cent lower than the solar value. On the other hand, because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial helium abundance is determined modulo the mass value. Finally, we evaluate the seismic mass of the exoplanet to be M p sin i = 1.17 − 1.26 M Jupiter , much more precise than what can be derived by Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion. Conclusions. We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows us to substantially improve the age accuracy that can be achieved with other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of stellar oscillations-such as the large frequency separation-is not enough to derive accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to narrow the age scatter that is a result of the model input physics uncertainties. Further progress is required to better constrain the physics at work in stars and the stars helium content. Our results emphasize the importance of precise classical stellar parameters and oscillation frequencies such as will be obtained by the Gaia and PLATO missions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Stellar ages are crucial input parameters in many astrophysical studies. For instance, the knowledge of the stellar formation rate and age-metallicity relation (Gilmore 1999; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hernandez et al. 2000</ref>) is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Freeman 1993</ref>). In addition, precise ages of the oldest Galactic halo stars are essential to set a lower limit to the age of the Universe <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Watson 1998</ref>). Moreover, the huge harvest of newly discovered exoplanets calls for accurate and precise ages of their host stars, a crucial parameter for understanding planet formation and evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Havel et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>While stellar masses and/or radii can be measured directly for some particular stars -masses and radii for members of binary systems, radii for giant stars or bright dwarfs observable ⋆ Tables 4, 5, A.2, A.3, A.4, A.5 are also available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/ by interferometry -stellar ages cannot be determined by direct measurements, but can only be estimated or inferred. As reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Soderblom (2010)</ref>, there are many methods to estimate the age of a star according to its mass, evolutionary state, and configuration -single star or star in a group. The ages of single main-sequence (MS) stars are often inferred from empirical indicators (activity or rotation) and/or from stellar model isochrones that are compared with observed classical parameters such as effective temperature T eff , luminosity L or surface gravity log g, and metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. However, the precision and accuracy that can currently be reached are not good enough to precisely characterize exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Havel et al. 2011</ref>). Several error sources hamper single-star age-dating: errors on the observational data, internal error related to the age-dating method, and, for stellar-model-dependent methods, degree of realism of the models. Depending on the mass and evolutionary stage and on the method, the error on age may be in the range of 50 to more 1 Y. Lebreton and M.J. Goupil: " ` A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology than 150 per cent (see for instance <ref type="bibr">Lebreton &amp; Montalbán 2009, and references therein)</ref>. Indeed, stellar model outputs, as the age attributed to a given star, are quite sensitive to the physical inputs of the model calculation. For instance, the processes of transporting or mixing chemical elements, such as convection and overshooting, microscopic diffusion, and turbulent diffusion induced by hydrodynamical instabilities have been found to have a major impact. Unfortunately, these processes are still only poorly described and often have to be parametrized.</p><p>Progress is made with the availability of asteroseismic data provided by the high-precision photometric missions CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baglin et al. 2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Koch et al. 2010</ref>). Lowamplitude solar-like oscillations have been detected in many stars, and their frequencies have been measured with a precision typically of a few tenths of micro Hertz (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Michel et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chaplin &amp; Miglio 2013)</ref>. Seismic data have recently and very frequently been used to age-date and weigh stars. Currently, two approaches are taken. The first one, ensemble asteroseismology, attempts to determine the mass and age of large sets of stars based on their mean seismic properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chaplin et al. 2014</ref>). In this approach, interpolation in large grids of stellar models by different techniques provides the mass and age of the model that best matches the observations. The alternative approach, which is more precise, is the hereafter named "` a la carte" modelling 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lebreton 2013)</ref>, that is, the detailed study of specific stars, one by one, also referred to as "boutique" modelling, (see e.g. D. <ref type="bibr">Soderblom, 2013</ref>, invited review at the International Francqui Symposium 2 ). This approach has been used to model CoRoT and Kepler stars (see the reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baglin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chaplin &amp; Miglio 2013)</ref>. Stars hosting exoplanets have been modelled for example by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gilliland et al. (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lebreton (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Escobar et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lebreton (2013)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gilliland et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we address the specific problem of quantifying the sources of inaccuracy that affect the estimates of age, mass, and radius of stars. In the past, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brown et al. (1994)</ref> addressed this problem theoretically, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lebreton et al. (1995)</ref> discussed it in an early prospective study related to the preparation of the Gaia-ESA mission. The need for this quantification has become even more crucial because age, mass and radius of exoplanet host-stars are key to characterizing the planets and then to understanding their formation and evolution. This is therefore a prerequisite in the context of the space missions <ref type="bibr">CoRoT, Kepler, and forthcoming Gaia, TESS, and PLATO. Recently, Valle et al. (2014)</ref> used a grid approach and a synthetic sample of solar-type MS stars to carry out a theoretical investigation to identify and quantify the sources of biases on the mass and radius determinations. Here we instead consider thè a la carte approach to characterize a main CoRoT target, HD 52265, as an illustrative case-study. The G-type metal-rich star HD 52265 is a MS star that hosts an exoplanet whose transit was not observable, but CoRoT provided a rich solar-like oscillation spectrum that was analysed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ballot et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gizon et al. (2013)</ref>. HD 52265 has been modelled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Soriano et al. (2007)</ref> prior to its observation by CoRoT, and then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Escobar et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lebreton &amp; Goupil (2012)</ref> on the basis of CoRoT data. The asteroseismic modelling by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Escobar et al. (2012)</ref> was based on the large and small mean frequency separations (see Sect. 2). It provided a seismic mass of 1.24 ± 0.02 M ⊙ , a seismic radius of 1.33 ± 0.02 R ⊙ , and a seismic age of 2.6 ± 0.2 Gyr. Note that the error bars on these values do not include the impact of the uncertainties on stellar model inputs. The mass of the exoplanet was not evaluated either.</p><p>In this study, we characterize the star in terms of age, mass, radius, initial helium content, etc. To that end, we performedà performed`performedà la carte modelling based on several classes of dedicated stellar models corresponding to different assumptions on the input physics and chemical composition, and we used different sets of observational parameters to constrain the models. We examined how the uncertainties on the observational constraints and on the model input physics and free parameters affect the results of stellar modelling.</p><p>In Sect. 2, we review the observational data available for HD 52265. In Sect. 3, we describe our methodology and choices for cases of interest. The results are detailed in Sect.4, namely the range of age, mass, radius, initial helium content, and mixing-length parameter of the models. They show that using seismic constraints severely restricts these ranges. For comparison, Sect. 5.1 discusses the empirical ages of the star, while Sect. 5.2 presents ages obtained through isochrone placement in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. We discuss the impact of the uncertainty on the mass of the host-star on the mass of the exoplanet in Sect. 6, and we draw some conclusions in Sect. 7.</p></div>

Astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy HD 52265 <ref type="bibr">(HIP 33719</ref>) is a nearby single G0V star. According to its Hipparcos parallax π=34.53±0.40 mas <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(van Leeuwen 2007)</ref>, it is located at ≈29 pc. To model the star, we considered the observational data listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. In the literature, we gathered twenty spectroscopic determinations of the effective temperature T eff , surface gravity log g, and metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> of HD 52265 reported since 2001. We adopted here the average of these quantities and derived the error bars from the extreme values reported. To derive the luminosity L, we used the parallax and the Tycho V T magnitude, V T =6.358±0.004 mag, which we translated into the Johnson value, V J = 6.292 ± 0.005 mag, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mamajek et al. (2002)</ref>. The bolometric correction BC=−0.014±0.012 was derived from T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] using the tools developed by <ref type="bibr">VandenBerg &amp; Clem (2003)</ref>. The Stefan-Boltzmann radius corresponding to the adopted values of L and T eff is R SB = 1.28 ± 0.06 R ⊙ . <ref type="bibr">Butler et al. (2000)</ref> detected an exoplanet through observed radial velocity (RV) variations of HD 52265. From the RV curve they derived the semi-amplitude K, orbital period P, eccentricity e, and semi-major axis a of the orbit. From RV data and the Kepler third law, a lower limit on the mass of the planet can be inferred, via M p sin i = M 2/3 star K(1 − e 2 ) 1/2 (P/2πG) 1/3 ,</p><p>where i is the angle of inclination of the orbital plane on the sky (see e.g. Perryman 2011).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Individual oscillation frequencies</head><p>HD 52265 shows a pressure-mode (p-mode) solar-like oscillation spectrum, in which Ballot et al. (2011) identified 28 reliable low-degree p-modes of angular degrees ℓ = 0, 1, 2 and radial orders n in the range 14-24 (see their <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>). The frequencies ν n,ℓ are in the range 1500-2550 µHz. Because the data are of high quality, the precision on each frequency is of a few tenths of µHz.</p><p>In the present study, individual frequencies were used to constrain stellar models. Before turning to the problems related to the use of individual frequencies, we briefly recall some basic properties of stellar oscillations.</p><p>A formulation adapted from the asymptotic expansion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Tassoul (1980)</ref> is commonly used to interpret the observed lowdegree oscillation spectra (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mosser et al. 2013</ref>, and references therein). It approximates the frequency of a p-mode of high radial order n and angular degree ℓ≪n as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ν n,ℓ ≃ n + 1 2 ℓ + ǫ ∆ν asym − ℓ(ℓ + 1)D 0 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the coefficients ǫ, ∆ν asym , and D 0 depend on the considered equilibrium state of the star. In particular</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∆ν asym =           2 R 0 dr c           −1 and D 0 ≈ − ∆ν asym 4π 2 ν n,ℓ R 0 dc r ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where c is the adiabatic sound speed c = (Γ 1 P/ρ) 1/2 (Γ 1 is the first adiabatic index, P the pressure, and ρ the density). For a perfect gas, c ∝ (T/µ) 1 2 where T is the temperature and µ the mean molecular weight.</p><p>The quantity ∆ν asym measures the inverse of the sound travel time across a stellar diameter and is proportional to the square root of the mean density, while D 0 probes the evolution status (and then age) through the sound speed gradient built by the chemical composition changes in the stellar core.</p><p>The ǫ term weakly depends on n and ℓ but is highly sensitive to the physics of surface layers. The problem is that outer layers in solar-type oscillators are the seat of inefficient convection, a 3-D turbulent process, which is poorly understood. The modelling of near-surface stellar layers is uncertain and so are the related computed frequencies. These so-called near-surface effects are a main concern when using individual frequencies to constrain stellar models because they are at the origin of an offset between observed and computed oscillation frequencies. Some empirical recipes can be used to correct for this offset. This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">ν max , ∆ν, and scaling relations</head><p>From the oscillation power spectrum of HD 52265, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ballot et al. (2011)</ref> extracted the frequency at maximum amplitude ν max = 2090 ± 20 µHz. This quantity is proportional to the acoustic cutoff frequency, itself related to effective temperature and surface gravity (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brown et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Belkacem et al. 2011</ref>).

We used the mean large frequency separation to constrain stellar models and calculated it in three different ways, but each time the observational value and the model value were calculated accordingly. First, the mean large frequency separation can be calculated as an average of the individual separations defined by Eq. 5. We first calculated the mean separation ∆ν ℓ for each observed angular degree (ℓ = 0, 1, 2) by averaging over the whole range of observed radial orders. We then obtained the overall mean separation from ∆ν = 1 3 2 ℓ=0 ∆ν ℓ . Its value is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Second, in the asymptotic approximation (Eq. 2), ∆ν ℓ (n)≡∆ν asym is approximately constant regardless of the ℓ value. We carried out a weighted least-squares fit of the asymptotic relation, Eq. 2, to the 28 identified frequencies and obtained the value of ∆ν asym given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, as well as D 0 (1.43 ± 0.05µHz) and ǫ (1.34 ± 0.01). The quoted error bars were inferred from a Monte Carlo simulation.</p><p>Third, as mentioned in Sect. 2.2.1, ∆ν ∝ ∝ρ 1/2 . This yields a scaling relation that can be used to constrain stellar mass and radius (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Ulrich 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∆ν sc /∆ν ⊙ =(M/M ⊙ ) 1/2 (R/R ⊙ ) −3/2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ∆ν ⊙ = 134.9 µHz. The inversion of Eqs. 4 and 6, with the observed values of ∆ν, ν max , and T eff of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, yields R sc = 1.33 ± 0.02 R ⊙ , M sc = 1.25 ± 0.05 M ⊙ , and log g sc = 4.29 ± 0.01 dex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Small frequency separations and separation ratios</head><p>The difference in frequency of two modes of degrees that differ by two units and orders that differ by one unit reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d ℓ, ℓ+2 (n)=ν n,ℓ −ν n−1, ℓ+2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and is commonly referred to as the small frequency separation. Modes of ℓ = 1 are rather easy to detect, while modes of ℓ = 2 are not always observed or are affected by large error bars. This led <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov (2003)</ref> to propose to use the five Y. Lebreton and M.J.

They read</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dd 01 (n) = 1 8 (ν n−1,0 − 4ν n−1,1 + 6ν n,0 − 4ν n,1 + ν n+1,0 ) (8) dd 10 (n) = − 1 8 (ν n−1,1 − 4ν n,0 + 6ν n,l − 4ν n+1,0 + ν n+1,1 ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>According to the asymptotic relation (Eq. 2), d 02 (n) scales as ≈6D 0 , while dd 01/10 (n) scales as ≈2D 0 . Thus, they all probe the evolutionary status of stars. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov (2003)</ref> demonstrated that while the frequency separations are sensitive to near-surface effects, these effects nearly cancel in the frequency separation ratios defined as r 02 (n) = d 02 (n)/∆ν 1 (n) (10) rr 01 (n) = dd 01 (n)/∆ν 1 (n) ; rr 10 (n) = dd 10 (n)/∆ν 0 (n + 1). <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> As detailed in the following, we used these frequency separations and ratios to constrain models of HD 52265.

But when only modes of ℓ = 1 are observed, it is interesting to consider the mean ratios rr 01/10 , which are also sensitive to age (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Miglio &amp; Montalbán 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mazumdar 2005</ref>). This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, which shows the run of (rr 01 + rr 10 )/2 as a function of ∆ν along the evolution on the MS of stars of different masses. For all masses, the rr 01/10 ratio decreases at the beginning of the evolution on the MS to a minimum and then increases to the end of the MS. The lowest value is higher and occurs earlier as the mass of the star increases, that is as a convective core appears and develops.</p><p>Deviations from the asymptotic theory are found in stars as soon as steep gradients of physical quantities build up. This occurs for instance at the boundaries of convective zones because of the abrupt change of energy transport regime. Such glitches affect the sound speed, and an oscillatory behaviour is then visible in frequency differences (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gough 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Audard &amp; Provost 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov 1994)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Searching for an optimal model of HD 52265</head><p>We present the optimization method we used to obtain a model that best matches a selected set of observational constraints. We considered several choices of observational constraints, as explained in Sect. 3.4. First, we chose a reference set of input physics for the modelling and, for this set, the optimization gave us a reference model for each selected case of observational constraints. In a second step, we carried out additional optimizations based on other possible choices for the input physics. We then quantified the age and mass uncertainties, for instance by comparing the additional models to the reference one. Below we first present the inputs of the models (Sect. 3.1), then the calculation of the oscillation frequencies (Sect. 3.2), and finally the optimization method (Sect. 3.3) and the choice of the sets of observational constraints (Sect. 3.4) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Model input physics and chemical composition</head><p>We have modelled the star with the stellar evolution code Cesam2k <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Morel &amp; Lebreton 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marques et al. 2013</ref>). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lebreton et al. (2008)</ref>, to ensure numerical accuracy, the models were calculated with ≈ 2000 mesh points and ≈ 100 time steps were taken to reach the optimized final model of the star. Our aim has been to evaluate the effect of the choice of the model input physics on the inferred age, mass, and radius of HD 52265. We considered the input physics, and parameters described below and listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>-Opacities, equation of state (EoS), nuclear reaction rates: Our reference models (set A,  <ref type="bibr">15</ref> O reaction, where we adopted the revised A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology LUNA rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Formicola et al. 2004</ref>). To estimate uncertainties, we also calculated models based on the OPAL01 EoS (set H) and the NACRE nuclear reaction rate for the 14 N(p, γ) 15 O reaction (set D). -Microscopic diffusion: Our reference models take into account the microscopic diffusion of helium and heavy elements including gravitational settling, thermal and concentration diffusion but no radiative levitation, following the formalism of <ref type="bibr">Michaud &amp; Proffitt (1993, hereafter MP93</ref>). Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Escobar et al. (2012)</ref> showed that radiative accelerations do not affect the structure of the models of HD 52265. To estimate uncertainties, we calculated models without diffusion (set E), and in set G models with diffusion, but treated with the Burgers formalism ( <ref type="bibr">Burgers 1969, hereafter B69)</ref>.</p><p>In a test, we investigated the effect of mixing that results from the radiative diffusivity associated with the kinematic radiative viscosity ν rad (subset A described in Appendix A). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Morel &amp; Thévenin (2002)</ref>, it can be modelled by adding an additional mixing with a diffusion coefficient</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">d rad = D R × ν rad with D R ≈ 1.</formula><p>It limits gravitational settling in the outer stellar layers of stars with thin convective envelopes. -Convection: Our reference is the CGM convection theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Canuto et al. (1996)</ref>, which includes a free mixing-length parameter α conv = ℓ/H P (ℓ is the mixing length and H P the pressure scale height). To estimate uncertainties, we considered in set B the MLT theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Böhm-Vitense 1958)</ref>. When enough observational constraints were available, the value of α conv was derived from the optimization of the models. When too few observational constraints were available, the value of the mixing length had to be fixed. For the reference model, it was fixed to the solar value α conv,cgm = 0.688 or α conv,mlt = 1.762, which results from the calibration of the radius and luminosity of a solar model with the same input physics (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Morel &amp; Lebreton 2008)</ref>. Other choices for the mixing length are considered in the study and presented in Appendix A. -Core overshooting: In reference models we did not consider overshooting. We explored its impact in alternate models where we assumed that the temperature gradient in the overshooting zone is adiabatic. A first option (set I) was to set the core overshooting distance to be ℓ ov,c =α ov ×min(R cc , H P ), where R cc is the radius of the convective core and α ov = 0.15. In a second option (set J), we adopted the Roxburgh (1992) prescription, in which overshooting extends on a fraction of the mass of the convective core M cc , the mass of the mixed core being expressed as M ov,c =α ov × M cc with α ov = 1.8. -Convective penetration: Convective penetration below the convective envelope is the penetration of fluid elements into the radiative zone due to their inertia. It leads to efficient convective heat transport with penetrative flows that establish a close to adiabatic temperature gradient, and to an efficient mixing of material in the extended region. A model for convective penetration has been designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zahn (1991)</ref>. In this model, the distance of fluid penetration into the radiative zone reads L p = ξ PC χ P H P , where χ P = (∂ log χ/∂ log P) ad is the adiabatic derivative with respect to the pressure P of the radiative conductivity χ = 16σT 3 3ρκ (κ and σ are the opacity and Stefan-Boltzmann constant, respectively). The free parameter ξ PC is of the order of unity but has to be calibrated from the observational constraints. We adopted here either ξ PC = 0.0 (reference set A, no penetration) or ξ PC = 1.3 (set K), this latter best adjusts the oscillatory behaviour of the individual frequency separations rr 01/10 (n) of HD 52265 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lebreton &amp; Goupil 2012)</ref>. -Rotation: We did not include rotational mixing in our models, except in one test case (see subset A in Appendix A), where we considered rotation and its effects on the transport of angular momentum and chemicals as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marques et al. (2013)</ref>. In that case, additional free coefficients enter the modelling: a coefficient K w intervenes in the treatment of magnetic braking by stellar winds (see <ref type="bibr">Eq. 9 in Marques et al. 2013</ref>), following the relation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kawaler (1988)</ref>. We adjusted K w so that the final model has the observed rotation period. This is one option among many possible ones. A thorough study of the impact of rotation on the modelling of HD 52265 will be presented in a forthcoming paper. -Atmospheric boundary condition: The reference models are based on grey model atmospheres with the classical Eddington T-τ law. In set F, we investigated models based on the Kurucz (1993) T-τ law. For consistency with these <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kurucz (1993)</ref> T-τ tables, in models F convection is computed according to the MLT theory. -Solar mixture: We adopted the canonical GN93 mixture <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grevesse &amp; Noels 1993)</ref> as the reference, but considered the AGSS09 solar mixture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asplund et al. 2009</ref>) in set C. The For the initial helium abundance Y 0 we considered different possibilities. When enough observational constraints were available, the value of Y 0 was derived from the optimization of the models. When too few observational constraints were available, the value of Y 0 had to be fixed. For the reference model, we derived it from the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio (Y 0 − Y P )/(Z − Z P )=∆Y/∆Z, where Y P and Z P are the primordial abundances. We adopted Y P =0.245 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Peimbert et al. 2007</ref>), Z P =0. and, ∆Y/∆Z≈2, this latter from a solar model calibration in luminosity and radius. Other choices for Y 0 are considered in the study and presented in Appendix A. -Miscellaneous: The impact of several alternate prescriptions for the free parameters is investigated and described in Appendix A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Case 1: Age and mass from classical parameters.</head><p>In this case, we assumed that the classical parameters alone are constrained by observation (T eff , present surface [Fe/H], L). We determine the mass M, age A, and initial metal-tohydrogen ratio (Z/X) 0 required for the model to match these constraints. Since this gives three unknowns for three observed parameters, we made assumptions on the other inputs of the models, mainly the initial helium abundance Y 0 , the mixing length α conv , and overshooting parameter α ov . As a reference, we assumed that Y 0 can be derived from the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio ∆Y/∆Z = 2. We took α conv,⊙ =0.688 from solar model calibration and In case 2, we assumed that only ∆ν is known together with the classical parameters. We then adjusted the mixing-length parameter together with the mass, age, and initial metal-tohydrogen ratio (four unknowns, four constraints). We still had to fix the initial helium abundance from ∆Y/∆Z. We considered three sub-cases. In sub-case 2a, we did not explicitly calculate the frequencies of the model but derived the model's large frequency separation from the scaling relation (Eq. 6) and compared this with the observed mean large frequency separation ∆ν of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.

Depending on the optimization case, there may be orders of magnitude differences in the χ 2 R -values. For instance, in case 1, the χ 2 R -values are very low because it is quite easy to find a model that matches the classical parameters alone. Hence, in case 1, for a given set of input physics and fixed free parameters, the optimization provides a very precise solution but the stellar model may not be accurately determined. The adopted values of the fixed parameters such as the mixing length may not be appropriate for the studied star; that introduces biases that can have strong impact on the results, as discussed below. Conversely, in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 3</ref>). The uncertainties result from the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization procedure (i.e. diagonal terms of the covariance matrix of inferred parameters).

First, we examine the classical observables T eff , L, [Fe/H], and log g. We considered two diagrams, a T eff -L and a [Fe/H]-log g diagram, as plotted in the upper left and right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>. For the purpose of readability we distinguish each set in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 3</ref> but not the different input physics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. These latter are discussed in the next sections. The total size of these diagrams is the size of the 2σ error box on the classical parameters, while the inner box identifies the 1σ error box. The figures show that all models satisfy the classical constraints at the 2σ level with only two models lying outside the 1σ error box on T eff , L, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and log g. These outliers are model E6 ([Fe/H]=0.28, no microscopic diffusion) and model K6 (L/L ⊙ = 2.12, convective penetration). We point out that models optimized with seismic data (especially the case 6 and 7 models) show a trend towards the lower range of the observed spectroscopic effective temperature. This supports the claim for a redetermination of the observed T eff in the light of the seismic surface gravity, which is robust, as discussed below.</p><p>The seismic value for log g is found to be mostly independent of the model input physics (see also Sect. 4.4) and differs from the spectroscopic one by 0.03 dex. Note that two models have a log g in the upper range of the spectroscopic error bar, that is higher and more different than the seismic value. These are the two models of case 5 with overshooting (I5 and J5). However, as discussed below, these models are not considered in the following (model I5 has a very low initial helium content, much lower than the primordial value, while model J5 has a high χ 2 R,seism ). Second, we examine the seismic mean observables ∆ν, r 02 , and rr 01/10 . We considered two diagrams, a ∆ν-r 02 and a ∆ν-rr 01/10 diagram, as plotted in the lower left and right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>. Here, the total size of these diagrams is the size of the 10σ error box on the seismic parameters, while two inner boxes delimit the 1σ and 3σ error boxes. We note that many models lie outside the 1σ error box of ∆ν, r 02 , and rr 01/10 . Some models are not even in the plotted areas. In most of these cases, the seismic data have not been used as model constraints. In particular, no model of case 1 matches the seismic constraints. This shows that a model that only matches the classical parameters can indeed be very far from a seismic model. We also note that several models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 5, A</ref> A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology have been optimized on ν max ). This can be explained by the fact that the error bar on ν max given by Ballot et al. is an internal error that is quite small (1 per cent). As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barban et al. (2013)</ref>, the method adopted to infer ν max from the power spectra affects its value. Furthermore, one can expect differences between the observational value of ν max and the theoretical value, which obeys the scaling relation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Belkacem et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>In the following, to derive the age and mass of HD 52265 and their uncertainties, we considered only the models that satisfy χ 2 R,classic &lt; 1. Because of the high precision of the frequencies, no model with χ 2 R,seism &lt; 1 was found. We therefore only kept models with χ 2 R,seism &lt; 2.</p></div>

These additional models, included in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>, are presented in Appendix A.2.</p><p>In case 1 (column 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>), there is a large scatter in the ages of HD 52265 obtained with different sets of input physics when no seismic observations are available, that is ≈ ±60 per cent with respect to the reference age. This is the usual situation of age-dating from classical parameters L, T eff and surface <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. The values of Y, α conv , and α ov had to be fixed and different ages result from different choices. In particular, for a change of α conv of 20 per cent around the solar calibrated value, the age changes by more than 50 per cent. At the highest boundary of the age interval, the oldest models are those without diffusion and the model with a long mixing length α conv = 0.826. The youngest models are models with the lowest -primordial-initial helium abundance (Y P = 0.245) and the model with low α conv = 0.55. The ages of the other models are concentrated in a narrow age interval, 2.6-3.0 Gyr, about that of reference model A.</p><p>We point out that if the error bars on the classical parameters were to be reduced, as will be the case after the Gaia-ESA mission (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Liu et al. 2012</ref>, and references therein), the error bar of an individual age determination with a given set of input physics would be reduced, but the scatter associated with the use of different input physics would remain the same unless significant advance in stellar modelling is made.</p><p>In cases 2a, b, and c, where the large frequency separation is included as a model constraint, the age scatter is smaller than in case 1. Unlike case 1, the ages of the optimal models computed with different input physics and free parameters span the whole range of the scattered interval. Indeed, the values of the inferred mixing length differ from one case to another and still span a wide range [0.466-0.656] for α conv,cgm for case 2a, for instance, as can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables 4, A</ref> </p><note type="other">(i.e. not from the scaling relation) using the stellar models (cases 2b and 2c).</note><p>In case 3, the age scatter is slightly smaller than in case 2a. As already pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lebreton (2013)</ref>, this is because the additional constraint on ν max does not add much more knowledge on the age of the star.</p><p>Cases 4, 5, 6, and 7 all take into account seismic constraints directly sensitive to age, that is either the small frequency separation d 02 , the frequency separation ratios r 02 , rr 01/10 , or the individual frequencies. The spectacular consequence is a reduction of the age scatter, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.4</ref>.</p><p>For case 4, considering the different possible options for the input physics of the stellar models, our criterion χ 2 R,seism ≤ 2 excludes the model without microscopic diffusion (model E4). Accordingly, the ages range between 2.02 ±0.22 Gyr (model J4) and 2.22±0.27 Gyr (model C4). This yields an age of 2.15±0.35 Gyr, that is an age uncertainty of ∼ ±16 per cent.</p><p>For case 5, considering the different possible options for the input physics of the stellar models, two models (I5, J5) were excluded because their initial helium abundance Y 0 was found to be much lower than the primordial value Y P . Accordingly, the ages range between 2.08 ± 0.25 Gyr (model D5) and 2.33 ± 0.40 Gyr (model E5). This yields an age of 2.28 ± 0.45 Gyr, which means an age uncertainty of ∼ ±20 per cent. It is possible to reduce this scatter even more. Helioseismology has shown that microscopic diffusion must be included if one considers the Sun. This must also be true for solar-like stars like HD 52265: its mass is only slightly larger than the solar one and it has an extended convective envelope. Excluding the model without diffusion then yields an age in the range 2.08 ± 0.25 Gyr (model D5) -2.28 ± 0.31 Gyr (model C6), that is, an age of 2.21 ± 0.38 Gyr, i.e. an age uncertainty of ±17%. Hence the main cause of scatter on the high side of the age interval here is microscopic diffusion (model E5) followed by the solar mixture (model C5). The low side of the age interval comes from the change of nuclear reaction rates (model D5). This shows that we start to reach the quality level of data that enables testing the microscopic physics in stars other than the Sun.</p><p>For case 6, considering the different possible options for the input physics of the stellar models, our criteria χ 2 R,classic ≤ 1 and χ 2 R,seism ≤ 2 exclude models I6, J6 and K6. Accordingly, the ages range between 2.21 ± 0.11 Gyr (model A6) and 2.46 ± 0.08 Gyr (model E6). This yields an age of 2.32 ± 0.22 Gyr, that is an age uncertainty ∼ ±9.5%. The main cause of scatter here is microscopic diffusion closely followed by the choice of the solar mixture: GN93 (model A6) versus AGSS09 (model C6). The range for the mixing-length value is [0.588, 0.606]. This range is considerably narrower than the one usually taken a priori to compute stellar models. Compared with the values we obtained from a calibration of a solar model with the input physics of reference set A (α conv,cgm,⊙ = 0.688 ± 0.014), the values obtained for HD 52265 are lower than solar by 12 − 15 per cent. The results for the initial helium abundance are discussed in Sect. 4.3 below. We point out that the range of ages obtained in case 6 is quite close to that obtained in case 5. This can be understood by the fact that, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, the mean value of rr 01/10 is already a good indicator of the evolutionary state, at least if the classical parameters are also used to constrain the stellar mass and if the convective core is small. We therefore reach a similar accuracy in cases 5 and 6, but the precision on the individual ages is better in case 6, which is more constrained by the use of individual ratios. Furthermore, as discussed in Sect. 4.6, in case 6, the individual values rr 01/10 provide additional information on A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology 5900 6000 6100 6200 6300</p><p>T eff (K)  Here, the rectangles delimit 1 and 3σ error bars, and the boundaries of the whole plotting area are 10σ errors.

However, HD 52265 is a case study, with a small convective core, and we can expect that larger convective cores whose size is crucial for the age-dating are better characterized by individual ratios than by their mean values. For case 7, considering the different possible options for the input physics of the stellar models, our criterion χ 2 R,seism ≤ 2 excludes several models (E7, I7, J7, K7). Accordingly, the ages range between 2.05 ± 0.02 Gyr (model D7) and 2.49 ± 0.02 Gyr (model B7). This yields an age of 2.27 ± 0.24 Gyr, that is an age uncertainty ∼ ±9.5%. The upper boundary of the age interval is due to the choice of the MLT approach for the convective transport (model B7) closely followed by the choice of the solar mixture (model C7). The lower boundary is due to changes in the nuclear rates (model D7).</p><p>To summarize, the best precision and accuracy, in the context of the present input physics, is therefore obtained in case 4 -constrained by the mean values of the large and small frequency separations, case 6 -constrained by the individual values of the frequency separation ratios, and case 7 -constrained by individual frequencies. However, as stressed above, cases 4 and 7 suffer from the caveat that the individual frequencies were corrected for surface effects. As can be seen from model A7-noSE in Appendix A, the age is increased by more than 40 per cent in a model optimized without correcting for these effects. We therefore consider that case 6 is the optimal choice of observational constraints regarding the age of the star (see also the discussion by Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Aguirre et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Additional models, based on different choices for the optimization (correction from surface effects, correlations between the seismic ratios, etc.), do not imply drastic changes in the optimized age (see <ref type="bibr">Appendix A.2</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>. Ranges of ages (left) and masses (right) derived from stellar model optimization for HD 52265.

For each case, several model optimizations can be identified according to the symbols and colours indicated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. In addition, open red symbols are for additional models of set A described in Degeneracy between age and mixing length: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>, left panel, shows the relation between the convection parameter α conv and age of the optimized models. There is a possible trend for α conv to increase with age. From a linear regression we derived α conv /α conv,⊙ ≃ 0.13×A+0.59, where the age is in Gyr. This trend can be understood as follows: higher ages on the MS would imply lower T eff and larger radii. The radius of a star is smaller for a more efficient convective energy transport. Smaller radii, hence higher α conv -related to more efficient convection-are therefore needed to bring T eff back into the observational range. However, we checked that the ages determined by model optimization in cases 6 and 7 are not affected by this possible degeneracy because allowed variations of α conv along the regression line are limited by the constraints on T eff and [Fe/H].  <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 3</ref> the mass of the optimal model for a given set of physics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Like the age, the mass is better constrained when seismic data are taken into account, in particular when seismic constraints explicitly sensitive to mass are used (large frequency separation, frequency at maximum power as in cases 2 and 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Mass and initial helium abundance</head><p>Optimization of models of case 3 relies on the scalingrelations (Eqs. 4 and 6). These models therefore have the peculiarity that their mass and radius are tightly fixed because scaling relations provide quite precise values of the mass and radius. On the one hand, the accuracy of the derived values for the mass and radius depend on the accuracy of the scaling relations. As proposed in Sect. 4.2, models of case 6, optimized with the frequency separation ratios, provide the best age but since they do not constrain surface layers, they do not explicitly fix the mass. On the other hand, the ages of models of case 7 are less secure because they are affected by the correction for surface effects. Nevertheless, as can be seen from model A7-noSE in Appendix A.2, correction for surface effects only slightly modifies the optimized mass. Thus, we suggest that models of case 7, optimized with the individual frequencies, are probably more suitable for mass determination.</p><p>Degeneracy between mass and initial helium abundance: This Y 0 -M degeneracy agrees with what is expected from homology relations (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cox &amp; Giuli 1968)</ref>. For a MS star in the domain of mass of HD 52265, the luminosity varies as L∝µ 7.5 M 5.5 R −0.5 with R∝µ 0.55 M 0.73 (CNO cycle) or R∝µ −0.43 M 0.14 (pp chain). In addition, for a fully ionized gas, µ≈4/(8−5Y −6Z), which increases with Y. Therefore, for a given observed luminosity -fixed in the optimization process-there is a range of pairs (Y 0 , M) that lead to the same L value. The Y 0 -M degeneracy may severely hamper the determination of the mass of HD 52265, as shown by the results of cases 4 and 5. A large scatter in the mass value is obtained. However, low-mass models such as those found in case 4 have high values of Y 0 (i.e. higher than 0.33), which are hardly acceptable. More reasonable Y 0 values (i.e. lower than 0.30) would yield models with masses larger than 1.20M ⊙ .</p><p>For set A, cases 6 and 7, we calculated additional opti-  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Radius and surface gravity</head><p>Figure 3 (top, left) shows that the range of surface gravities of the models is very narrow, which means that log g is very well determined by the modelling and is hardly sensitive to the input physics (see also the determinations of the seismic surface gravities of Kepler stars by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mathur et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Metcalfe et al. 2012</ref>). For HD 52265, taking into account the Y 0 -M degeneracy, seismic models of cases 6 and 7 have log g in the range 4.28 − 4.32, which improves the precision on log g by a factor of ten with respect to spectroscopy. We point out that for this star, the central value of the spectroscopic log g (4.32 ±0.20 dex) agrees well with both the value inferred from the scaling relation (4.29 ± 0.01 dex) and our seismic optimized value (4.30 ± 0.02). This would not be the case for all the stars. The potential of asteroseismology to improve the determination of surface gravity and therefore of spectroscopic parameters (T eff , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> ) has already been demonstrated. For instance, it has been applied to the spectroscopic analysis of two CoRoT targets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morel et al.

Interestingly, all models have a radius in-between the StefanBoltzmann radius R SB = 1.28 ± 0.06 R ⊙ and the scaling radius R sc = 1.33 ± 0.01 R ⊙ . Three groups of models lie on the StefanBoltzmann line. There are case 1 models -which is expected because they were optimized with only the classical parametersand nearly all models of case 4 and 5. In the optimization process, these latter reproduce the observed effective temperature and luminosity of HD 52265 best. Case 6 and case 7 models with different input physics and accounting for the the Y 0 -M degeneracy, have seismic radii in the range 1.30 − 1.34 R ⊙ . This represents a precision of ≈ ±1.5 per cent on the radius, which is a good improvement on what can be obtained with the StefanBoltzmann law (≈ ±5 per cent) for HD 52265.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Internal structure</head><p>HD 52265 has a very small convective core and a convective envelope. For instance, in model A7, the convective core has a mass M cc ∼ 0.014 M ⋆ and a radius R cc ∼ 0.045 R ⋆ , while the Y. Lebreton and M.J. Goupil: " ` A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology radius at the basis of the convective envelope is R zc ∼ 0.80 R ⋆ . These quantities can be quite different in other models, which are nevertheless seismically equivalent. In particular, the Y 0 -M degeneracy has a major impact on the core mass. For instance, changing Y 0 from 0.26 to 0.32 changes M ⋆ from 1.28 to 1.18M ⊙ , M cc from 0.006 to 0.023 M ⋆ , and R cc from 0.035 to ∼ 0.053 R ⋆ . The depth of the convective envelope is unaffected.</p><p>Models optimized with rather high, currently accepted or predicted values of core overshooting <ref type="bibr">(sets I and J)</ref> show quite high values of χ 2 R,seism , indicating that overshooting is probably ruled out for this star. We investigated this point in depth by performing an optimization where we also adjusted the overshooting parameter (models A6-ov and A7-ov, in the appendix). We found that quite low overshooting is indeed preferred, with α ov in the range 0.0 − 0.04. In principle, seismology has the potential to distinguish between different values of overshooting even for small cores through the signature left in the oscillation spectrum by the convective core (see the recent works by Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Aguirre et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brandão et al. 2013</ref>, and references therein). Such diagnostics are beyond the scope of this paper. However, we made some additional tests that indicate that in the case of HD 52265, the seismic data are probably not precise enough to allow us to infer the size of the mixed core precisely or accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Seismic properties</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>, we show how the stellar models succeed -or not-in matching observed oscillation frequencies and frequency separations. Since a thorough examination of seismic properties of all the models is beyond the scope of this paper, we selected some models. The top left panel shows thé echelle diagram corresponding to the model of case A7, optimized on the basis of the individual frequencies. When surface effects are corrected for, the model succeeds rather well in reproducing thé echelle diagram for a value of the adjustable parameter b SE = 4.2 (Eq. 12) compatible with the solar value obtained by Deheuvels &amp; Michel (2011) with quasi-similar input physics (b SE,⊙ = 4.25). On the other hand, in the high-frequency range, un-corrected models do not match observations. In this respect, models A6 (frequencies not corrected, not plotted) and A7 (with uncorrected frequencies) give similar results. Furthermore, the top right panel shows that model A7 reproduces the observed individual large frequency separations ∆ν ℓ (n) quite well. The bottom left panel shows the comparison of the observed and model frequency separation ratios rr 01/10 (n). Model A7 reproduces the mean slope of the variation of the ratios rather well, but not the oscillatory behaviour. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lebreton &amp; Goupil (2012)</ref>, this behaviour in HD 52265 is reproduced in models that include convective penetration below the convective envelope, like the model of set K, which is similar to set A but with ξ PC = 1.3. The figure also shows the effect of the Y 0 -M degeneracy on the diagram. The larger the helium abundance, the higher the rr 01/10 (n) ratios. However, with the present accuracy on the data, it is hard to distinguish the models with different (Y 0 , M) values. Finally, we plotted a model of set I that takes into account a moderate amount of core overshooting (α ov = 0.15). As already pointed out in Section 4.5, the overshooting amount cannot be very large since even a moderate amount of overshooting is ruled out by the present data. The bottom right panel shows the fit of the r 02 (n) ratios. In this case, regarding the precision on the data, it is difficult to distinguish the models. Age (Gyr) <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.

It is widely used to age-date large samples of stars for Galactic evolution studies (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Casagrande et al. 2011</ref>, and references therein). Different inversion techniques can be used to extract the stellar age (and mass) from theoretical isochrones. However, in several regions of the H-R diagram, for instance when the star is close to the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) or at turn-off, the morphology of the isochrones is complex and leads to severe age degeneracy.

For the star HD 52265, which is approximately half-way on its MS, we expect the isochrone inversion technique and the optimization performed in case 1 of the present study to be equivalent in terms of precision -for a given set of input physics-because they are both based on the observational constraints on the classical parameters. However, the isochrone grid to be used for the inversion has to be dense enough both in mass and chemical composition. On the other hand, for stars lying in regions of degeneracy in the H-R diagram, priors should be included in the optimization process in case 1 to deal with multiple possible solutions (see e.g. Jørgensen &amp; Lindegren 2005).</p></div>

From a grid of stellar models, Butler et al. inferred the mass of the star, first by placing the star in a colourmagnitude diagram at solar metallicity, and then by correcting for the metallicity of the star -which they estimated to be [Fe/H] = 0.11, using stars of published mass and metallicity. They inferred a stellar mass of 1.13 ± 0.03M ⊙ (note that the error bar here is an internal error bar and does not take into account the uncertainties of the stellar models) and deduced that the exoplanet has a mass M p sin i = 1.13 M Jupiter . They did not give uncertainties on this determination, nor the values for the age of the host-star.</p><p>Using the RV data reported by <ref type="bibr">Butler et al. (2000)</ref> and isochrone fits to derive the mass of the host-star, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gizon et al. (2013)</ref> estimated the minimum mass of the exoplanet to be M p,min = 1.09 ± 0.11 M Jupiter (i.e. sin i = 1 in Eq.1). Here, again, the error bar does not account for the uncertainties of stellar models. Furthermore, with their measure of the inclination of the spin axis of the star (sin i = 0.59 +0.18 −0.14 ), assumed to be the axis of the planetary orbit as well, they estimated the mass of the exoplanet to be M p = 1.85 +0.52 −0.42 M Jupiter . Note that the dominant source of error is the sin i error.</p><p>We have re-estimated the exoplanet mass on the basis of the range of mass of the host-star discussed above. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref> shows the range of mass of the exoplanet as a function of its age, assumed to be the age of the host-star, for the different physical options and optimization sets considered. When considering all cases, the scatter is quite large. In particular, models of case 4, which correspond to low stellar mass, form the bunch of points at low planet mass and at age around 2 Gyr, but note that these models have to be excluded because of their very high initial helium abundance. On the other hand, the use of seismic constraints in cases 6 and 7 considerably narrows the range of ages of the star while they mostly favour higher masses with respect to other cases (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figs. 4)</ref>. Hence, these optimized models predict a higher mass for the exoplanet. Taking into account the Y 0 − M degeneracy and excluding models E without microscopic diffusion, the exoplanet mass M p sin i is found to be in the range 1.16 − 1.26 M Jupiter , where we included the error budget due to the error on the host-star mass optimization and on the RV data characterizing the exoplanet orbit. The scatter around the central value is therefore ∼ ±4 per cent. These values of the mass are higher (≈ 7 per cent) than the value of <ref type="bibr">Butler et al. (2000)</ref>. Furthermore, with the extreme values of sin i given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gizon et al. (2013)</ref>, the mass of the exoplanet would be in the range 1.5 − 2.8 M Jupiter . The scatter is slightly larger than that in the result by Gizon et al. because we accounted for the uncertainties in the stellar model inputs. We therefore confirm that the companion of HD 52265 is a planet, not a brown dwarf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The optimization of models of the star HD 52265 using both classical and seismic observational data provides strong constraints on the age, mass, radius, and surface gravity of the star, and on the mass of its exoplanet. Taking into account the full information provided by seismic observations and considering the current uncertainties that affect the calculation of stellar models, we found an age A = 2.10 − 2.54 Gyr, a mass M/M ⊙ = 1.14 − 1.32, a radius R/R ⊙ = 1.30 − 1.34, and a surface gravity log g = 4.28 − 4.32. A la carte" stellar age-dating and weighing with asteroseismology  <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 3</ref> for different input physics, as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Models for case 6 are plotted in grey, other cases are shown with open blue symbols. The group of models with low mass and age of ∼ 2 Gyr are case 4 models, to be rejected because of their high initial helium abundance (see text).</p><p>We stress that in the present case, the mass and radius given by the scaling relations agree quite well with the result of the full modelling. This can be explained by the fact that the effective temperature used in the scaling relations is accurately determined by spectroscopy and does correspond to the evolutionary stage of the star for its metallicity.</p><p>The mass of the exoplanet is found to be in the range M p sin i = 1.16-1.26 M Jupiter . This represents considerable progress with respect to what can be achieved without seismic data or when using only mean values inferred from seismic observations, as the mean frequency separation and frequency at maximum power. An important point is that while the age, mass, and radius of the star can be rather well estimated from classical and mean seismic parameters after the input physics of the models are fixed, uncertainties on the input physics produce a large scatter of the results. We demonstrated here that taking full profit of seismic data -in particular considering the frequency separation ratios-considerably reduces this scatter by allowing one to estimate free parameters of the models.</p><p>The full optimization performed here allowed us to better estimate the uncertainties and identify their origin, in particular concerning the age.</p><p>When no seismic constraints are available, the main cause for the age scatter and inaccuracy are the values of the mixing length and initial helium abundance that belong to a wide interval of possible values. Seismic constraints allowed us to estimate these free parameters of stellar models, as the mixing-length parameter for convection and the core overshoot and convective penetration parameters. As a result, the interval of possible values for α conv , [0.59, 0.61], is considerably narrowed. These values are lower by 12 − 15 per cent than the solar values obtained by a solar calibration using the same input physics. This provides an observational constraint on the convective transport efficiency that can be compared with the results of 3-D numerical simulations. The initial helium abundance could also be obtained but there remains a degeneracy between helium and mass. To remove this degeneracy, more precise oscillation frequencies are required. As studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Houdek &amp; Gough (2007)</ref>, it would allow us to detect an oscillatory behaviour of the frequencies that results from changes in the adiabatic exponent in the second helium ionization zone, a seismic diagnostic of the helium abundance. When the mixing length and initial helium abundance are unlocked, we find that the main cause of the age scatter is the choice of the solar mixture. When this problem is solved, we will then be at the level of testing nuclear reaction rates and internal transport processes, as demonstrated here.</p><p>Currently, the availability of precise observational frequencies for close well-known stars only concerns a small number of stars among which very few host an exoplanet. These calibrators are key to better understanding the physics that govern stellar interiors. A crucial need for the future is to increase the number of these calibrators. In this context, the ESA-PLATO high-precision photometry mission is really needed ( <ref type="bibr">Rauer et al. 2013</ref>). It will provide essential information that complements the classical data that will be provided, with ultra high accuracy, by the Gaia-ESA mission, and interferometry and spectroscopic ground-based observations. Obtaining numerous and precise asteroseismic data is also a necessary step to make towards the full characterization of the age, mass, and radius of exoplanets. It is only with this effort that we will achieve a new understanding of the interiors, habitability, and formation scenario of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems. In the following, we present other optimization models, all based on the reference physics of set A <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>). These models were optimized following <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 3</ref>, but with different approaches or choices of free parameters, as described below and listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table A.</ref>1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Cases 1 − Y / 2 − Y</head><p>As explained in the main text, in cases 1 and 2a, b, and c, the initial helium content Y could not be adjusted because of the lack of observational constraints. Here we investigate the consequence of not deriving Y from the ∆Y/∆Z = 2 enrichment law (as was done in cases 1 and 2 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>We sought a solution with the lowest possible initial helium content, never lower than the primordial abundance. These choices have an important impact on the results and are therefore discussed in the main text. We point out that in case A1-Y it was possible to find a solution with a primordial helium abundance. This is because no seismic constraints were used in this case. On the other hand, in cases A2a−Y, b−Y , and c−Y, we had to increase the helium abundance above the primordial one because of the seismic constraints introduced, to find a solution that agreed with both Y.

Cases 1-α0.550, 1-α0.826</p><p>In case 1, α conv could not be adjusted because of the lack of observational constraints and, as often seen in papers, the solar value α conv,⊙ was used. Here, we investigated the impact of other choices and we sought a solution for acceptable, extreme values of α conv . Numerical 2-D simulations of convection suggest that α conv might differ by a few tenths of dex from the solar value (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ludwig et al. 1999</ref>). We investigated changes of α conv of 20 per cent around the solar value that correspond to α conv,min = 0.550 and α conv,max = 0.826. These choices have an important impact on the results and are therefore discussed in the main text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Cases 1-ov30</head><p>No overshooting was assumed in the reference models of case 1. Here, to estimate its impact, we chose a rather high value, i.e. α ov = 0.30. The impact on case 1 results is discussed in the main text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Case 5-allfreq</head><p>In the list of frequencies extracted by Ballot et al. (2011), 31 frequencies were given, of which 28 were flagged as secure.</p><p>In this model, we considered the 31 values and found that the impact is weak and that the results remain inside the uncertainty range we gave in the main text. 6. Case 6-Y M, 7-Y M For each optimization case, there are a range of initial helium-mass doublets (Y 0 , M) that provide seismically equivalent optimized models. We investigated the Y 0 − M degeneracy by searching for optimized models with different values of Y 0 and M. As discussed in the main text, the impact on age is weak but a range of possible masses of HD 52265 is found. 7. Case 6-nocorrel As explained in the main text, in case 6, we took into account the correlations between the frequency separation ratios and calculated the χ 2 from Eq. 13. In this model the correlations are not considered and the χ 2 is evaluated from Eq. 14. The impact is weak and is not discussed further. 8. Case 6-interr <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov (2013)</ref> recently claimed that modelfitting by searching for a best fit of observed and model separation ratios at the same radial orders n is incorrect, and that the correct procedure is to compare the model ratios interpolated to the observed frequencies. We followed this recommendation here. The impact is weak and the results remain in the uncertainty range we gave in the main text. 9. Case 7-rot As explained in the main text, rotation and its effects on the transport of angular momentum and chemicals was treated as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marques et al. (2013)</ref>, and we tuned the K w coefficient that enters the treatment of magnetic braking by winds to match the observed rotation period. The impact on age and mass is weak for this rather evolved star. A thorough study of the effects of rotation on HD 52265 will be presented in a forthcoming paper. 10. Case 7-noSE and case 7-bSE4.9.</p><p>As explained in the main text, in case 7, we corrected the individual frequencies for the surface effects with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kjeldsen et al. (2008)</ref> empirical prescription and calibrated the b SE parameter in Eq. 12 to achieve the best match between observed and modelled frequencies. In model 7-bSE4.9, we used the solar value of b SE calibrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kjeldsen et al. (2008)</ref> and found that the impact on the results is weak. In model 7-noSE, we did not correct frequencies for the surface effects. The impact is strong, in particular on age. This is discussed in the main text. 11. Case 7-pms.</p><p>The main models were calculated by starting the computation at the zero-age main sequence. This model was evolved from the pre-main sequence. The impact is weak. 12. Cases 6 and 7-ov.</p><p>In the models presented in the main text, overshooting was either neglected (sets A−H, K) or fixed (sets I, J). Since there are enough observational constraints to add overshooting and convective penetration as additional free parameters in cases 6 and 7, we considered this possibility here. We therefore also optimized the values of α ov and ξ PC . As also discussed in the main text, we found that low values of α ov are favoured (range 0.00−0.04) and rather high values of ξ PC (range 0.90− 1.25). This latter result, related to the oscillatory behaviour of the frequencies, close to the convective envelope agrees with the conclusions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lebreton &amp; Goupil (2012)</ref>.</p></div>

In case 1 (2), Y and α conv (Y) could not be inferred and had to be fixed by the modeller. Therefore, for these two cases, we calculated additional models with somewhat extreme choices of Y and α conv . In case 1, we also included a model with much overshooting (α ov = 0.30). These additional models, included in Fig. 4, are presented in Appendix A.2. In case 1 (column 1 in Fig. 4), there is a large scatter in the ages of HD 52265 obtained with different sets of input physics when no seismic observations are available, that is ≈ ±60 per cent with respect to the reference age. This is the usual situation of age-dating from classical parameters L, T eff and surface [Fe/H]. The values of Y, α conv , and α ov had to be fixed and different ages result from different choices. In particular, for a change of α conv of 20 per cent around the solar calibrated value, the age changes by more than 50 per cent. At the highest boundary of the age interval, the oldest models are those without diffusion and the model with a long mixing length α conv = 0.826. The youngest models are models with the lowest -primordial-initial helium abundance (Y P = 0.245) and the model with low α conv = 0.55. The ages of the other models are concentrated in a narrow age interval, 2.6-3.0 Gyr, about that of reference model A. We point out that if the error bars on the classical parameters were to be reduced, as will be the case after the Gaia-ESA mission (see e.g. Liu et al. 2012, and references therein), the error bar of an individual age determination with a given set of input physics would be reduced, but the scatter associated with the use of different input physics would remain the same unless significant advance in stellar modelling is made. In cases 2a, b, and c, where the large frequency separation is included as a model constraint, the age scatter is smaller than in case 1. Unlike case 1, the ages of the optimal models computed with different input physics and free parameters span the whole range of the scattered interval. Indeed, the values of the inferred mixing length differ from one case to another and still span a wide range [0.466-0.656] for α conv,cgm for case 2a, for instance, as can be seen in Tables 4, A.2, and A.4. Moreover, the initial helium Y 0 slightly changes in the optimization because ∆Y/∆Z is fixed but Z/X is adjusted in the optimization. Note that for given input physics and free parameters (cases 2a, 2b, 2c for set A in Tables 4), the age is significantly modified depending on the way the mean large frequency separation is computed; the changes are correlated with changes in the inferred mixinglength values. The scatter in the inferred mixing-length values, hence on the age, is smaller when ∆ν is calculated explicitly</figDesc></figure>

Like the age, the mass is better constrained when seismic data are taken into account, in particular when seismic constraints explicitly sensitive to mass are used (large frequency separation, frequency at maximum power as in cases 2 and 3). Optimization of models of case 3 relies on the scalingrelations (Eqs. 4 and 6). These models therefore have the peculiarity that their mass and radius are tightly fixed because scaling relations provide quite precise values of the mass and radius. On the one hand, the accuracy of the derived values for the mass and radius depend on the accuracy of the scaling relations. As proposed in Sect. 4.2, models of case 6, optimized with the frequency separation ratios, provide the best age but since they do not constrain surface layers, they do not explicitly fix the mass. On the other hand, the ages of models of case 7 are less secure because they are affected by the correction for surface effects. Nevertheless, as can be seen from model A7-noSE in Appendix A.2, correction for surface effects only slightly modifies the optimized mass. Thus, we suggest that models of case</figDesc></figure>
