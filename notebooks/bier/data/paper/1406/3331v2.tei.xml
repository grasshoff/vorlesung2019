			<abstract>
				<p>Warped accretion discs are expected in many protostellar binary systems. In this paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession for discs with dimensionless thickness H/r larger than their viscosity parameter α, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warp evolution. For small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-body precession. We derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of the disc and the alignment timescale for a variety of models. Applying our results to circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane of the binary on a timescale comparable to the global precession time of the disc, and typically much smaller than its viscous timescale. We discuss the implications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinary discs (such as KH 15D) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as Kepler-413); these observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertain aspects of the disc warp theory. On the other hand, we find that circumstellar discs can maintain large misalignments with respect to the plane of the binary companion over their entire lifetime. We estimate that inclination angles larger than ∼ 20 • can be maintained for typical disc parameters. Overall, our results suggest that while highly misaligned cir-cumstellar discs in binaries are expected to be common, such misalignments should be rare for circumbinary discs. These expectations are consistent with current observations of protoplanetary discs and exoplanets in binaries, and can be tested with future observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Warped accretion discs are expected in a variety of astrophysical systems, such as protoplanetary discs, discs around spinning black holes, remnant discs following neutron star binary mergers and stellar tidal disruption by massive black holes. In particular, in proto-stellar binary systems, both circumstellar discs and circumbinary discs are likely formed with inclined orientations, as a consequence of the complex star/binary/disc formation processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bate et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McKee &amp; Ostriker 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Klessen 2011</ref>). Indeed, a number of binary young stellar objects (YSOs) are observed to contain circumstellar discs that are misaligned with the binary orbital plane (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stapelfeldt et al. 1998</ref>). Observations of jets along different directions in unresolved YSOs also suggest the existence of misaligned discs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Davis, Mundt &amp; Eislöffel 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Roccatagliata et al. 2011</ref>). Additionally, Email: ffoucart@cita.utoronto.edu imaging of circumbinary debris discs show that while the disc plane and the binary orbital plane are aligned for some systems (such as α CrB, β Tri and HD 98800), significant misalignments can occur in others (such as 99 Herculis, with mutual inclination &gt; ∼ 30 • ; see <ref type="bibr">Kennedy et al. 2012a,b)</ref>. Finally, the pre-main sequence binary KH 15D is surrounded by a precessing circumbinary disc inclined with respect to the binary plane by 10 • -20 • (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Winn et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Capelo et al. 2012</ref>), while in the FS Tauri system, circumbinary and circumstellar discs appear to be misaligned ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hioki et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Also of relevance is the recent discovery of transiting planetary systems around stellar binaries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Doyle et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Welsh et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Orosz et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kostov et al. 2014</ref>). While most of these systems have the binary orbital plane and the planetary orbital plane consistent with alignment, a small misalignment (∼ 2.5 • ) has been found in the Kepler-413 system (consisting of a Neptune-size planet orbiting an eclipsing stellar binary; <ref type="bibr">Kostov et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>arXiv:1406.3331v2 [astro-ph.EP] 8 Sep 2014</head><p>A potential explanation for this misalignment is that the planet formed in a circumbinary disc misaligned with respect to its host binary. Understanding the inclination distribution of circumbinary planets is important for determining the abundance and the formation scenarios of these planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Martin &amp; Triaud 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armstrong et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Theoretical studies of the evolution of misaligned accretion discs have been performed under the assumption of small warps in the discs, with numerical simulations providing information for the behavior of discs with larger warps. For discs in which the viscosity parameter α is smaller than H/r (with H the scaleheight of the disc), bending waves can propagate warps through the disc at about half the disc sound speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">( Papaloizou &amp; Lin 1995)</ref>. This rapid communication allows a misaligned disc experiencing an external torque to precess approximately as a rigid body, as long as the precession timescale of the disc is longer that the time required for bending waves to travel across the disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 1995)</ref>. This analytical prediction has been verified by 3D numerical simulations of circumstellar discs using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( <ref type="bibr">Lar- wood &amp; Papaloizou 1997)</ref> and finite volume methods <ref type="bibr">(Frag- ner &amp; Nelson 2010)</ref>. Smoothed particle simulations of narrow circumbinary discs have provided similar results ( ). Recent numerical simulations have also been used to explore the limitations of the linear theory <ref type="bibr">(Fragner &amp; Nelson 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sorathia et al. 2013a)</ref>.</p><p>A one-dimensional model for the evolution of small warps in a thick disc has been developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">(see also Lubow et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Ogilvie 2006</ref>), and used to study the evolution of circumstellar discs. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie (2000)</ref> used this model to study misaligned circumstellar discs in binaries, and compute discrete eigenmodes of the warp. They found that, for specific values of the outer radius of the disc, unstable modes exist which can drive the growth of the disc inclination. Away from these resonant radii, the inclination of the disc is damped on a timescale which can be computed numerically by solving an eigenvalue problem. An analytical estimate for the damping rate of the inclination of circumstellar disc has also been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref>, based on a global estimate of the energy dissipation in the disc due to viscous torques. This damping timescale is generally of the order of the viscous timescale of the disc. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gammie et al. (2000)</ref> found that even when the disc warp is small enough to satisfy the linear theory, the disc may still be susceptible to parametric instabilities, whose effect on the long term evolution of the disc is currently uncertain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref> postulate that parametric instabilities will cause the damping of the inclination on a timescale comparable to the growth timescale of the instability, and would cause circumstellar discs to rapidly align within an angle of the order of the disc thickness H/r. Estimates of the condition under which parametric instabilities can grow, and of their growth rate have more recently been improved by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ogilvie &amp; Latter (2013)</ref>, Some of the results obtained for circumstellar discs can be applied to the less studied circumbinary discs. The condition and the timescale for global precession <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 1995)</ref> can be similarly obtained, and the approximate formula for the damping of the disc inclination proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref> appears to match the results of one-dimensional simulations performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Facchini et al. (2013)</ref> to within factors of a few. The disc profile and the alignment of the disc-binary system were also studied in the limit of infinite circumbinary discs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Foucart &amp; Lai (2013)</ref>, and the evolution of finite size discs towards an equilibrium warped profile has been demonstrated numerically by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Facchini et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we study in more details the warp profile of both circumstellar and finite circumbinary discs. Building on the methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem (1995)</ref> and on the eigenmode decomposition performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie (2000)</ref>, we provide approximate analytical expressions for the orientation profile of the disc and the damping timescale of the inclination by considering the properties of the lowest order-mode. With the warping profile closest to a flat disc, such a low-order mode has the smallest internal stresses and the longest lifetime, and will dominate the long term evolution of the disc. We show that these approximate formulae are correct to first order in the disc warp, and provide solutions which match well the results obtained both by solving the eigenvalue problem exactly, and by full 3D simulations. In particular, our results allow for the computation of the damping timescale of the disc inclination (both for circumstellar discs with an external binary companion and for circumbinary discs), which is much more accurate than the formula previously derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref>, without the need for expensive simulations or the explicit solution of an eigenvalue problem. Because we directly recover the orientation of the disc at all radii, we can also easily compare our disc warp profiles with the predictions of <ref type="bibr">Ogilvie &amp; Lat- ter (2013)</ref> for the local conditions leading to the growth of parametric instabilities, and thus obtain improved estimates on the conditions under which these instabilities might affect the evolution of the disc. We show that circumstellar discs are likely to be able to maintain significant misalignments with respect to the orbital plane of a binary companion, in contrast to the early conclusion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref>.</p><p>In Sec. 2 we present our analytical model for disc warps and inclination damping, and compare our results with numerical solutions. We then apply our calculations to the study of circumbinary discs in Sec. 3, and circumstellar discs in Sec. 4. We consider the effects of parametric instabilities in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6 we revisit the case of the KH 15D system, and examine how our results impact the interpretation of that system as a truncated circumbinary disc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Winn et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Lodatto &amp; Facchini 2013</ref>. In Sec. 7 we summarize our results and discuss their implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DISC WARP AND INCLINATION DAMPING: THEORETICAL MODEL AND ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS</head><p>We consider the evolution of an accretion disc in the gravitational potential</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Φ(r) = − GM r + δΦ(r, z),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>assuming that the deviation δΦ from the pure Keplerian potential (−GM/r) is small (in a sense to be specified below). For circumbinary discs, we have M = M1 + M2 with M1,2 the masses of the two binary components; for circumstellar discs, we have M = M with M the mass of the central star.</p><p>The potential δΦ(r, z) is axisymmetric, with the coordinate z along its symmetry axis, the angular momentum axis of the binary. We also assume that δΦ is either time-independent or time-averaged. The disc is generally misaligned with respect to the z-axis, with the angular momentum of the disc element at radius r lying at time t in the directionîdirectionî(r, t). In cartesian coordinates, we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ˆ l(r, t) = (sin β cos φ, sin β sin φ, cos β),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β(r, t) is the warp angle (the inclination ofîofî relative to the z-axis), and φ(r, t) is the twist angle (corresponding to the rotation ofîofî around the z-axis).</p><p>We consider a vertically integrated model for the disc, with surface density Σ and integrated pressure given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Σ = ρ dz, P = p dz = Ω 2 z ΣH 2 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here ρ is the density in the disc, p the pressure, Ωz the frequency for vertical oscillations in the potential Φ, and H is an effective scale height defined by Eq. (3). We also define cs = HΩz. For a vertically isothermal disc, cs is the isothermal sound speed and H the usual Gaussian scale height (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lubow et al. 2002)</ref>. If the disc warp is linear, i.e., if the variation of the disc orientation satisfies ψ ≡ |∂î|∂î/∂ ln r| | 1, theoretical studies of α-discs (with isotropic viscosity ν = αH 2 Ω, where α is the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter, and Ω is the angular velocity) have shown that the evolution of the warp follow two possible behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Papaloizou &amp; Pringle 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Papaloizou &amp; Lin 1995</ref>). For discs with H/r &lt; ∼ α, the warp satisfies a diffusion-type equation with the diffusion coefficient ν2 = ν/(2α 2 ), at least for α 1 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ogilvie 1999 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lodato &amp; Price 2010</ref> for analytical and numerical studies of the effects of a larger α). For thicker discs (H/r &gt; ∼ α), the warp propagates as bending waves at about half the sound speed cs and dams on a timescale 1/(αΩ). In the latter case, the numerical simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sorathia et al. (2013a)</ref> suggest that the linear theory remains valid for small warp satisfying ψ ≡ |∂î|∂î/∂ ln r| H/r while for stronger warps nonlinear effects cause rapid damping of the inclination of the disc. For larger viscosities, bending waves damp on a length scale shorter than the scale height of the disc, and do not propagate across the disc. In this paper, we will consider discs with H/r &gt; ∼ α, which are relevant for a large class of astrophysical systems including protoplanetary discs.</p><p>For discs with H/r &gt; ∼ α and linear warps, the orientation of the disc evolves according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lubow &amp; Ogilvie 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Lubow et al. 2002 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ogilvie 2006</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σr 2 Ω ∂ ˆ l ∂t = 1 r ∂G ∂r + Σr 2 Ω 2 Ω 2 − Ω 2 z 2Ω 2 ˆ ez × ˆ l,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂G ∂t = Σc 2 s r 3 Ω 4 ∂ ˆ l ∂r + Ω 2 − κ 2 2Ω 2 Ωêz × G − αΩG,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>wherê ez is the unit vector along the z-axis, G is the internal stress in the disc, and Ωz and κ are the vertical and radial epicyclic oscillation frequencies. The first term on the right-hand side of Eqs. (4)-(5) describe the free propagation of bending waves in the disc. The last term in Eq. (4) corresponds to the external torque that the potential δΦ applies on the misaligned disc. The last two terms in Eq. (5) arise from periastron advance for non-Keplerian orbits and from viscous damping in the disc, respectively. For small misalignments betweenîbetweenî andêzandˆandêz, the frequencies Ωz and κ can be computed according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">κ 2 = 2Ω r d(r 2 Ω) dr ,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ω 2 z = ∂ 2 Φ ∂z 2 z=0 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The validity of Eqs. (4)-(5) requires a small deviation from the Keplerian potential, i.e., |κ 2 −Ω 2 | &lt; ∼ δΩ 2 and |Ω 2 z −Ω 2 | &lt; ∼ δΩ 2 , where δ = H/r. Under these assumptions, Eqs. (4-5) have been shown to reproduce the results of 3D numerical simulations for the evolution of linear warps (see, e.g., Larwood &amp; Papaloizou 1997 for circumstellar discs, or <ref type="bibr">Fac- chini et al. 2013</ref> for circumbinary discs). For large misalignments betweenîbetweenî andêzandˆandêz, Eqs. (6-7) would have to be corrected to appropriately reflect the time-averaged effects of the gravitational potential on the warp in a plane different from z = 0, but the general properties of the equations are left unchanged. This should be contrasted with the requirements of a quasi-Keplerian potential and of a small warp |∂î|∂î/∂ ln r| | 1, which are both necessary for the linear theory of bending wave propagation to apply.</p><p>There are however a couple of important caveats to keep in mind when using this one-dimensional model for the warp evolution. The first is that it was derived under the assumption of isotropic viscosity ν = αH 2 Ω. In general, the viscosity may be anisotropic, and there is thus no guarantee that, in such case, the viscosity parameter α entering Eq. (5) is identical to the viscosity parameter responsible for the radial transfer of mass and angular momentum. Shearing box simulations of turbulence have found reasonable agreement with the assumption of isotropic viscosity <ref type="bibr">(Torkelsson et al. 2000)</ref>, at least as far as its influence on the damping parameter α is concerned. But recent global simulations find that the viscosity generated by the magnetorotational instability is anisotropic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sorathia et al. 2013b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Teixeira et al. 2014</ref>). In practice, we can take α as a simplified parametrization of all the physical effects causing a damping of bending waves in the disc.</p><p>The second caveat is that, even in the linear regime, the disc warp may be unstable to a parametric instability and the development of turbulence due to the strong vertical shear in the flow velocity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gammie et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ogilvie &amp; Latter 2013)</ref>. When this occurs, the behavior of the disc warp is uncertain. One reasonable proposal is that the damping of the disc warp would then be set by the growth rate of the instability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. 2000</ref>). For a given disc profile, the parametric instability would then effectively set a minimum value for α. We discuss this issue in more detail in Sec. 5.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the linear model for the propagation of bending waves remains a useful tool to obtain approximate solutions to the evolution of warped discs, without having to resort to expensive numerical simulations that include all the microphysical effects required to recover the exact form of the viscosity in the disc. In the following, we derive analytical approximations for the main properties of the disc (warp amplitude, internal stress, global precession frequency, damping timescale of the warp) for configurations in which the disc, as a result of external torques, undergoes an approximately solid-body precession. We then compare these analytical results with numerical solutions in Sec. 2.4.</p></div>

Compared with circumbinary discs, which will be our main application here, an important difference is that for circumstellar discs the eigenmodes are a mixture of W+ and W−, because the driving of the disc at the orbital frequency Ω b of the binary cannot always be neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lubow &amp; Ogilvie 2000</ref> in fact solved the equations in a frame corotating with the binary), i.e. the assumption that the potential can be time-averaged breaks down. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie (2000)</ref> showed that this additional effect is small for most disc parameters, but can cause resonances at specific locations in the the outer region of the disc, leading to a growing misalignment between the circumstellar disc and the binary.</p><p>In the following, we will focus on circumbinary discs, although the equations derived here are valid for any configuration in which the perturbing potential can be timeaveraged -we will discuss the behavior of circumstellar discs away from resonances in Sec. 4. In Sec. 2.4 we present numerical solutions for the warp equations and the inclination damping rate. To gain more insight into the properties of the solutions for generic external potentials and disc profiles, however, it is useful to obtain analytical approximations to the numerical results. In the following subsections, we discuss such an approximate treatment for the lowest order warp mode of the disc -which in general has the slowest damping rate, and will thus dominate the long-term evolution of the warp (high-order modes are also more likely to violate the small warp condition, and are thus likely to damp even faster than predicted in the linear theory).</p></div>

It is also convenient to rotate the coordinates to a frame following the twist of the disc.

The numerator is the difference between the total torque applied on the disc, and the torque required to maintain the global precession of the disc (up to the same factor of 2π). The existence of this difference is due to the fact that the finite viscosity α twists the disc by an angle φ, thus creating a non-zero torque on the disc in the plane defined by the orbital angular momentum of the binary L b and that of the disc.

When the first-order corrections are small, however, we will see that the approximate formulae derived above are accurate enough to give good estimates of the warp and twist of the disc and of the damping timescale of its lowest-order eigenmode.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Numerical solutions: disc eigenmodes</head><p>Before applying our analytical results to real astrophysical systems, we would like to get an estimate of their accuracy when compared to the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem given by Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>. We use the shooting method to solve the set of 4 complex ODEs, combined with a Newton-Raphson root-solver to find the value of the warp at the disc boundaries and the complex eigenvalue ω. In more details, we assume the boundary conditions˜lxditions˜ditions˜lx(rout) = 1, ˜ Gx,y(rin) = 0 and˜Gxand˜ and˜Gx,y(rout) = 0, and we solve for˜lyfor˜for˜ly(rout), ˜ lx,y(rin) and ω using the initial guess˜lyguess˜guess˜ly(rout) = i, ˜ lx,y(rin) = ˜ lx,y(rout), ω = 10 −7 Ωin. At each Newton-Raphson iteration, we integrate the 4 complex ODEs from both boundaries, and measure the mismatch between the solutions at the midpoint of the disc. The problem is then reduced to solving for the value of the 4 complex unknowns, ˜ ly(rout), ˜ lx,y(rin) and ω, which satisfy the 4 complex matching conditions at the midpoint of the disc 2 . In general, there is an infinite number of eigenmodes which are solutions of this problem; which one the Newton-Raphson solver converges to depends on the chosen initial guess for the warp on the boundaries and the eigenfrequency. The initial choice made here is convenient for finding the solution closest to the flat disc profile, which has the smallest warp, internal stresses, and damping timescale rate and should thus dominate the long term evolution of the warp. Higherorder modes can be found using the same method if the initial guess is modified appropriately.</p><p>We test our analytical results on a sequence of circumbinary disc models with power-law profiles.

For this choice of c, the condition for the propagation of bending waves α &lt; H/r is satisfied at all radii (H/r = δin everywhere). For an equal mass binary (η = 1/4), we then have Kin = −Zin = 0.047.

The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. The first-order analytical approximation recovers the disc profile and the precession timescale to ∼ 10%−20% accuracy over a wide range of disc sizes (xout ∼ 5 − 1000).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fiducial disc Model</head><p>We can now use the results of the previous section to study the properties of misaligned circumbinary discs. For concreteness, we first consider discs with a constant thickness H/r and a density profile which approximately follows a power-law with p = 1. Because the shape functions [Γ's in Eqs. (42)-(47)] depend only on rout/rin and on the assumed disc profile, the other parameters can be varied at will without changing the value of the Γ functions -as long as the small warp approximation remains valid. Here we consider prograde discs with rout rin, and will discuss modifications for retrograde discs in Sec. 3.3.</p><p>The global precession period of the disc is</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">Pp = 20200 rout 100AU 3/2 1 4η rin 2a 2 2M M 1/2 yrs (51)</formula><p>where M = M1 + M2 is the mass of the binary.

Note that we explicitly differentiate between the viscosity parameter α0 responsible for the viscous evolution of the disc density profile and the viscosity parameter α responsible for the damping of disc warp.</p><p>The relative change in the warp across the whole disc, Evolution of linear warps in accretion discs 9</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">δl θ = |1 − l θ (1)|, is δl θ = 0.88 [Γ1(1) + Γ2(1)] (4η) 2 2a rin 4 0.1 δin 2 ≈ 0.2(4η) 2 2a rin 4 0.1 δin 2 ,<label>(54)</label></formula><p>where in the second line we have used the fact that Γ1(1) + Γ2(1) is nearly independent of xout (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>). The strong dependence of the warp on the location of the inner radius of the disc is noteworthy. If the inner edge of the disc was closer to the binary, the small warp approximation would break down. The twist across the disc is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">φ(1) = −24 • α 0.01 (4η) 2a rin 2 0.1 δin 2 Γ3(1) 2 .<label>(55)</label></formula><p>In contrast with the disc warp, the twist has a non-negligible dependence on the size of the disc, since Γ3(1) varies by about an order of magnitude between xout = 5 and xout = 3000 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>). For large discs (xout ∼ 100−3000), we have Γ3(1) ∼ 2, hence the scaling chosen in our twist expression given above. However, narrower discs can have much smaller twists, of order of a few degrees. For the disc profile considered in this section, Eq. (46) shows that the maximum of the dimensionless warp ψmax is largely independent of the location of the outer edge of the disc, and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">ψmax = 0.1(4η) 2 2a rin 4 0.1 δin 2 sin βout<label>(56)</label></formula><p>if α Z(1.4) (i.e. if we can neglect α in Eq. <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>). The condition |d lnîlnî/dr| &lt; 1 is thus easily satisfied. The stronger constraint |d lnîlnî/dr| &lt; H/r suggested by the numerical work of Sorathia et al. 2013a is marginally satisfied for our fiducial disc parameters. For thinner discs, nonlinear effects might thus cause the damping of the inclination to be faster than what the linear theory predicts. Finally, we can compute the alignment timescale of the disc and the binary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">t damp = γ −1 1 + 2M disc 3M a rout 1/2 −1 ,<label>(57)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">γ −1 = 13000 1 x 3/2 out ΓI δin 0.1 2 0.01 α 2M M b 1/2 × rout 100AU 3/2 (4η) −2 rin 2a 4 yrs.<label>(58)</label></formula><p>This means that, for rout 100AU, a circumbinary disc of constant thickness δ = 0.1 and viscosity α = 0.01 will align on a timescale comparable to its global precession timescale, and much shorter than its expected lifetime. This can easily be understood from the fact that most of the disc angular momentum is at large radii, while most of the torque exerted by the binary on the disc is applied at small radii. The torque is perpendicular to the local direction of the disc angular momentum, which is rotated by an angle ∼ φ(1) with respect to the total angular momentum of the disc. A component of order (sin φ)T of the total torque T will thus attempt to align the angular momentum of the disc, while the precession is due to a torque of order (cos φ)T . For our nominal value of φ(1) = 24 • at the inner edge of the disc, about 0.4T goes towards aligning the disc instead of driving precession.</p><p>From the above results we see that, for the fiducial disc profile considered here, an inclined circumbinary disc can survive for a significant fraction of its viscous evolution timescale only if one of the following conditions is met:</p><p>• A low effective viscosity α α0. This appears unlikely; if anything, the growth of parametric instabilities could cause α α0 for misalignments greater than a few degrees (see Sec. 5).</p><p>• A thick disc δ 0.3. This is also unlikely for protoplanetary discs.</p><p>• A small symmetric mass ratio η 1/4. This should be rare as η varies slowly with the mass ratio q = M2/M1 of the binary for q ∼ 1 (to gain a factor of 3 in η, one needs a binary with a mass ratio of 1:10)</p><p>• A large binary eccentricity. This would lead to disc truncation at rin 4a <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Artymowicz &amp; Lubow 1994)</ref>. Given the strong dependance of the damping timescale in the ratio rin/a, this would modify the damping timescale by about an order of magnitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dependence on the disc profile</head><p>The power-law surface density profile Σ ∝ r −p with p = 1 considered in the previous subsection provides only an approximate description of protoplanetary discs. Other density profiles are possible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Williams &amp; Cieza 2011)</ref>. There is also uncertainty on the temperature profile of the discs. Observations suggest that protoplanetary discs have a 'flaring' profile, where H/r grows with radius. This corresponds to a sound speed profile cs(r) ∝ r −c , with 0 c 0.5 (with preferred value c ∼ 0.2, or H ∝ r <ref type="bibr">1.3</ref> ). Here we examine how different disc profile parameters (p, c) affect the evoluton of disc warp and misalignment.</p><p>Qualitatively, a flaring disc has large δ = H/r for r rin, thus decreasing the warp and twist of the disc at large radii. A flaring disc is thus nearly flat at large radii, while its behavior is mostly unmodified for r ∼ rin. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows an example of this behavior for the relatively extreme case c = 0 (constant sound speed, or H ∝ r 3/2 ). Because the disc is nearly flat for r 5rin, the total twist and warp are about a factor of 4 smaller than in the c = 0.5 case (constant δ). This is reflected in the inclination damping timescale, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>: as the damping is due to the misalignment between the outer and inner edges of the disc, a flaring disc can remain inclined for a significantly longer time than a disc of constant δ. For xout ∼ 100, going from c = 0.5 to c = 0 increases the damping timescale by a factor of ∼ 6. We expect most protoplanetary discs to lie in between these two limits. The disc flaring effect is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> for a disc model with c = 0.2. We see that for our standard choice of parameters, the damping timescale for the inclination is ∼ 20% − 30% of the viscous evolution timescale tν for xout ∼ 10 − 100. There is thus a class of acceptable disc parameters for which t damp ∼ tν . Rapid damping of the inclination does however remain the most likely outcome. Indeed, δin ∼ 0.1 is probably optimistic for such a flaring disc, and t damp /tν ∝ δ 4 in . Additionally, α0 0.01 is quite likely in the dead zones, but the same is probably not true for α (see Sec. 5). A combination of these effects is likely to lead to the observed tν ∼ 10 6−7 yrs for rout ∼ 100AU without causing as much of a modification in t damp -thus leading to t damp ∼ (0.005 − 0.05)tν for our standard parameters. Conversely, this means that the observation of a significant inclination in a circumbinary disc can provide significant constraints on the age and parameters of the system.</p><p>The density profile of the disc has a smaller effect on its warp and twist profiles, as both the torque applied on an annulus of the disc and the angular momentum of that annulus are proportional to its surface density. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> for a disc with p = 0.5, c = 0. The effect on the inclination damping timescale is much more significant. Indeed, a shallower disc profile (p &lt; 1) has a larger fraction of its angular momentum in the outer region of the disc. Thus, it is harder for the torques applied on the smaller amount of material available at small radii to affect the global evolution of the disc. Accordingly, both the precession timescale and the damping timescale are larger (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>). For xout 1 and p + c &lt; 1.5, these scale as ωp ∝ γ ∝ x p−5/2 out . A shallow disc profile, although less likely than a flaring disc, thus provides another pathway to increase the timescale over which the disc's inclination is damped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Retrograde circumbinary discs</head><p>Most of the results discussed in the previous sections can be directly applied to retrograde circumbinary discs, as long as the misalignment between the orbital angular momenta of the disc and the binary remains small. There are however a few important distinctions when attempting to determine the long term evolution of retrograde discs. The first is that, because there are no Lindblad resonances in these discs, we expect the inner edge of the disc to be closer to the binary. This will result in shorter precession (∝ r 2 in ) and damping (∝ r 4 in ) timescales, larger twists (∝ r −2 in ) and warps (∝ r −4 in ), and faster growth of parametric instabilities. A low mass retrograde disc will thus rapidly reach a nearly counter-aligned configuration.</p><p>The second difference is that the back-reaction torque on the binary has the effect of increasing the misalignment of the disc with respect to the counter-aligned equilibrium configuration. This means that if the angular momentum of the disc is larger than the angular momentum of the binary, the misalignment angle is driven towards 90 • and might eventually switch to a prograde configuration. The details of this process have been studied under fairly general assumptions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">King et al. (2005)</ref>. They find that the disc will eventually become prograde if cos θ &gt; −L disc /(2L b ).</p></div>

In contrast to circumbinary discs, the misalignment of a circumstellar disc also damps on a timescale much longer than the precession timescale or even the viscous timescale. It is thus much more natural to expect misaligned circumstellar discs than misaligned circumbinary discs. Furthermore, in circumstellar discs, resonances can drive a growth of the disc inclination for some specific choices of the ratio rout/a (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Our analytical result for γ matches the numerical solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie (2000)</ref> to high accuracy (if we adopt the same disc parameters: p = 0.5, c = 0.5, for which the numerical factor in Eq.

The conditions under which this occurs in binary systems were first studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref>, with the objective of studying circumstellar discs. They estimated v from the internal stress G in the disc. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ogilvie &amp; Latter (2013)</ref> have presented the first detailed study of the linear growth of these parametric instabilities, by performing numerical simulations in the warped shearing sheet formalism. For isothermal and quasi-Keplerian discs, they find A2 ≈ 65 and A1 ≈ 45 (using q = 1.6). These results should be taken with some caution, as they are only valid for ψ 0.01 and likely depend on the vertical profile of the disc. However, they are probably the best estimate currently available when trying to determine whether a given disc profile is susceptible to the growth of parametric instabilities. From these results, it is clear that in many discs parametric instabilities can grow even when the small warp condition ψ 1 is satisfied. They could thus play a significant role in the long term evolution of the disc. However, the consequences of the growth of these instabilities on the behavior of the disc are not known at present. One reasonable assumption is that the warp would then be damped on a timescale comparable to the growth timescale of the instabilities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gammie et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bate et al. 2000</ref>, in which case the parametric instabilities would effectively act as a lower bound on the viscosity parameter α entering the equations for the propagation of bending waves in the disc. That bound would then depend on the maximum value of ψ, and roughly follow Eq. (64). If this is the case, the parametric instabilities could significantly affect the damping timescale of the warp in many relevant astrophysical configurations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. 2000</ref>; see also the following subsections).</p></div>

If, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al.

For standard circumbinary discs, we would then expect the inclination to decay to βout 1 • within about 10 5 yrs. After that, the inclination would evolve on a longer (viscous) timescale (if the effective viscosity is then α 0.01).</p><p>We note that the effects of the local parametric instabilities on the global effective viscosity α are still speculative, and that the inclination damping from the growth of the parametric instabilities remains uncertain.

Damping of the inclination on a timescale much shorter than the lifetime of the disc is thus expected to be the norm even if the parametric instabilities do not significantly affect the evolution of the inclination.</p></div>

In a previous analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al.

The pre-main sequence binary KH 15D shows an unusual light curve, which has been interpreted as the result of a narrow precessing disc around the binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Winn et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay 2004</ref>). The system exhibits deep eclipses occurring at a period of 48.35days and lasting ∼ 1 day. Radial velocity measurements indicate the binary component masses of M1 ∼ M2 ∼ 0.5M and orbital eccentricity 0.68 &lt; e &lt; 0.80 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Johnson et al. 2004</ref>). The model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay (2004)</ref> gives the disc precession period of 2770 yrs (with M1 = M2 = 0.5M and binary separation a = 0.26AU). LF studied two numerical models for the KH 15D disc system. Both have the disc parameters rin = 4a (due to the large eccentricity of the binary), δin = 0.1, α = 0.05, and c = 3/4. Their surface density profiles have index p = 0.5 and p = 1, with the corresponding outer disc radii xout = 6.71 and xout = 9, respectively. The outer edge of the discs are chosen in order to recover the desired precession period.</p><p>We first verify that our model for the profile and evolution of the disc warp agrees with the numerical results obtained by LF. The main results are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, where we give the precession period, total warp, and damping timescale obtained by LF, as well as our results using both the approximate analytical method and the explicit numerical computation of the disc eigenmode. We see that the two numerical methods agree extremely well, with the worst disagreement being on the damping timescale of the p = 0.5 model (∼ 20%, while other quantities agree to within a few percents). The approximate analytical model gives equivalently good results for the precession and damping timescales, but perform more poorly for the total disc warp (∼ 50% error). The reason for this larger error can be easily understood if we also compute the twists, which are 8 • and 14 • for p = 0.5 and p = 1 respectively. This means that the twist modifiesîmodifiesî by 15% − 25%, while the warp is only  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lodato &amp; Facchini (2013)</ref> using 1D numerical simulations[Num. Sim.

Accordingly, the second order terms in the twist, which we have neglected in the computation of the warp, can significantly affect the warp. Note that if we choose α 0.01, then the approximate analytical method agrees with the eigenmode analysis much better, as shown in Sec. 2.4. We can now go further and consider the potential influence of parametric instabilities. For the disc to survive multiple precession periods without aligning with the binary, the viscosity needs to be significantly smaller than α = 0.05. LF estimate that α &lt; 0.005 is required, assuming the expected linear relation t damp ∝ α −1 . Then we have ψmax ∼ 0.009 sin β for the p = 0.5 model and ψmax ∼ 0.016 sin β for the p = 1 model. For α = 0.005, parametric instabilities will thus develop for β &gt; 10 • (resp. 5 • ) for the p = 0.5 (resp. p = 1) model. In the Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay (2004) models, inclinations of ∼ 10 • − 20 • are required to explain the observation. If the parametric instabilities damp the inclination of the disc, some fine tuning of the disc parameters is needed to (i) maintain solid body precession for multiple precession periods, (ii) avoid fast damping due to parametric instabilities and (iii) maintain a significant disc inclination. For α ∼ 0.005, these models remain possible, with damping timescales of order of 10 − 20 precession periods. Considering the uncertainties related to the effects of the parametric instabilities on the long term evolution of the disc, this consideration cannot rule out the precessing disc model for KH 15D. But there are certainly mild tensions between that model and the idea that the warp is damped on the growth timescale of parametric instabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have presented analytical calculations for the long-term evolution of inclined/warped accretion discs under the influence of an axisymmetric perturbing potential. Such evolution is governed by the combined effects of disc bending waves and viscous dissipation. Our calculations can be applied to misaligned circumbinary and circumstellar discs in protostellar systems, as well as to other astrophysical discs (such as discs formed in neutron star binary mergers and in tidal disruption events). In particular, we have derived approximate expressions for the global precession rate and the disc alignment timescale due to viscous dissipation, as well as expressions for the disc warp and internal stress profiles. Our results build on the analysis performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem (1995)</ref> for inviscid circumstellar discs, and the formulation of the bending wave equations with finite viscosity as an eigenvalue problem by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie (2000)</ref>. Our approximate analytic results by-pass the much more time-consuming simulations of the evolution of disc warps, as well as numerical calculations of warp eigenmodes. In essence, our analytic solution corresponds to the lowest-order eigenmode, which dominates the long-term evolution of the disc warp and inclination. We have compared our results to previous numerical calculations (when available) and found good agreement in general. Our analytic results are useful for various applications and also provide insights into the disc warp evolution under various conditions/parameters.</p><p>We have applied our results to inclined/warped circumbinary discs. For the viscosity parameter α ∼ 0.01 (and typical protoplanetary disc parameters), we find that the alignment timescale of the disc is comparable to its global precession timescale, but much shorter than its viscous evolution timescale. For the inclination to survive for a significant fraction of the disc lifetime, we need either a high binary eccentricity or an asymmetric binary, in which case the inner edge of the disc is pushed out and the torque acting on the disc is smaller, or an abnormally thick disc, which is unlikely. We have also shown that the density and temperature profiles of the disc can play a significant role in the magnitude of the disc warping and the inclination damping timescale, with more strongly 'flaring' discs (i.e. discs with rapidly growing scaleheight H) allowing the inclination to survive for a larger fraction of the disc's lifetime.</p><p>Applying our analytical results to circumstellar discs in binaries, we find that inclined discs tend to have very small warps (and smaller than circumbinary discs). Our results are, in this respect, significantly more favorable for the survival of large inclinations in circumstellar discs than previous studies which rely on the global properties of the disc to estimate this damping timescale. Thus, misaligned circumstellar discs are expected to be quite common in proto-binaries. Qualitatively, the key difference between circumbinary discs and circumstellar discs is that in former/latter, the binary torque is exerted at the inner/outer region of the disc, which contains small/larger amount of angular momentum, leading to relatively large/small warp and thus faster/slower viscous damping.</p><p>We have explored the possibility of efficient damping of disc warp through parametric instabilities associated with the strong velocity shears across the disc. Our updated estimate for the alignment timescale of the disc shows that, for circumbinary discs, the inclination angle above which parametric instabilities are likely to drive rapid damping of the inclination is small (about 4 • for typical disc parameters; see Sec. 5.2), thus making it difficult to maintain inclination angles of more than a few degrees for a significant part of the lifetime of the disc. The recent discoveries of circumbinary planetary systems with negligible or small inclinations (such as <ref type="bibr">Kepler-413;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Kostov et al. 2014</ref>) between the binary plane and the planetary orbital plane are consistent with this picture. On the other hand, we find that significant misalignments could be possible in circumstellar discs, even when parametric instabilities are taken into account. In this respect, our predictions based on the approximate local prescription for the growth of parametric instabilities derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ogilvie &amp; Latter (2013)</ref> differ from the earlier results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. (2000)</ref>, which predicted rapid damping of the inclination to less than the disc thickness H/r.</p><p>We have also showed that the above considerations apply not only to nearly aligned discs but also to relatively low mass (nearly) anti-aligned discs, except that in the latter case the disc may counter-align with the binary. The smaller inner radius of counter-aligned discs is also likely to make counter-alignment even faster than alignment.</p><p>As a concrete application of our model, we verified that our calculations are in agreement with the numerical results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lodato &amp; Facchini (2013)</ref>, who modeled the precessing circumbinary disc system in KH 15D (following an earlier analytical model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay 2004</ref>). Our result for the inclination damping shows that there exist some tensions between the required misalignment angle and the fact that that misalignment should be maintained for a few precession periods, at least if parametric instabilities damp the inclination efficiently. In that case, a misalignment angle of ∼ 10 • can only be maintained for ∼ 10 precession periods, if the parameters of the system are tuned appropriately. This is however sufficient to explain current observationsand the tensions disappear if the parametric instabilities do not lead to efficient inclination damping. <ref type="figure">(</ref> </p><p>where we defined F (x, y; n) as Finally, ΓI can be recovered using the identity </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Under the relatively general assumption that p &lt; 5/2 and p + z &gt; 1, we get Γ1(x) = −Γ 2 p F (x, xout; 2 + 2c) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 1/2) 5/2 − p +Γp F (x, xout; 2c − z + 1/2) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 1/2) 1 − p − z Γ2(x) = −Γp F (x, xout; 1/2 + 2c − k) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 2 − k) 5/2 − p + F (x, xout; 2c − z − 1 − k) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 2 − k) 1 − p − z Γ3(x) = −Γp F (x, xout; 1/2 + 2c) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 2) 5/2 − p + F (x, xout; 2c − z − 1) − F (x, xout; p + 2c − 2) 1 − p − z .</figDesc></figure>
