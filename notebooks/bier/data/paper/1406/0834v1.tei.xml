				<p>While not detected yet, pairs of exoplanets in the 1:1 mean motion resonance probably exist. Low eccentricity, near-planar orbits, which in the comoving frame follow the horseshoe trajec-tories, are one of the possible stable configurations. Here we study transit timing variations produced by mutual gravitational interaction of planets in this orbital architecture, with the goal to develop methods that can be used to recognize this case in observational data. In particular, we use a semi-analytic model to derive parametric constraints that should facilitate data analysis. We show that characteristic traits of the transit timing variations can directly constrain the (i) ratio of planetary masses, and (ii) their total mass (divided by that of the central star) as a function of the minimum angular separation as seen from the star. In an ideal case, when transits of both planets are observed and well characterized, the minimum angular separation can also be inferred from the data. As a result, parameters derived from the observed transit timing series alone can directly provide both planetary masses scaled to the central star mass.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Stable configurations of planets in the 1:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) comprise three different cases: (i) tadpole orbits, which are similar to the motion of Trojan asteroids near Jupiter's L4 and L5 stationary points, (ii) horseshoe orbits, which are similar to the motion of Saturn's satellites Janus and Epimetheus, and (iii) binaryplanet orbits, in which case the two planets revolve about a common center-of-mass moving about the star on a Keplerian orbit. Numerous studies explored these configurations with different aims and goals. Some mapped stability zones in orbital and parametric spaces. Other studies dealt with formation and/or capture of planets in the 1:1 MMR and their survivability during planetary migration. Still other works explored observational traits such as the radial velocity (RV) signal in stellar spectrum or transit timing variations (TTVs) in the case that one or both planets transit the stellar disk. While we still do not know details of dominant formation and evolutionary processes of planetary systems, as well their variety, a general consensus is that planets in 1:1 MMR should exist. Here we briefly recall several important studies directly related to our work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref>, while studying methods that would reveal a pair of planets in 1:1 MMR from the RV analysis (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giuppone et al. 2012</ref>), pointed out two possible formation scenarios: (i) planet-planet scattering that would launch one of the planets into a coorbital zone of another planet (including possibly one of the high-eccentricity stable orbital configurations 1 ), and (ii) in-situ formation of a smaller planet near the L4 or L5 points of a Jupiter-class planet. These authors also noted that the 1:1 MMR would persist during subsequent migration, since the balance between angular momentum and energy loses prevents an eccentricity increase. This behavior stands in contrast with planets captured in other (higher-order) resonances. Moreover, if significant gas drag is present, the libration amplitude may be damped, thus stabilizing the coorbital configuration.</p><p>The suggested scenario of in-situ formation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref> has been modeled by several groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beaugé et al. (2007)</ref> started with a population of sub-lunar mass planetesimals already assumed to be present in the tadpole region of a giant planet, and studied conditions of coorbiting planet growth. They took into account mutual gravitation interaction of the planetesimals as well as several gas-density models. With this set-up, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beaugé et al. (2007)</ref> noted that only ≃ 0.6 Earth mass planets grow in their simulations. Beaugé et al. also conducted simulations of planet growth during the migration phase and found essentially the same results. Notably, the Trojan planet orbit has not been destabilized and safely survived migration with a low final eccentricity.</p><p>A more detailed study has been presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lyra et al. (2009)</ref>. Using a sophisticated model of gas and solid dynamics in a self-gravitating thin disk, these authors modeled planet formation starting with centimeter-size pebbles. They showed that pressure maxima associated with macroscopic vortexes may collect enough particles to generate instability followed by gravitational collapse. Up to 5 − 20 Earth mass planets may form this way in the tadpole region of a Jupitermass primary, depending on size distribution of the pebble population.</p><p>Another pathway toward the formation of loweccentricity planets in the 1:1 MMR has been stud- <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Note that there is a surprising variety of 1:1 MMR planetary configurations, many of which have large eccentricities or inclination (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Giuppone et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giuppone et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hadjidemetriou et. al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Schwarz et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Had- jidemetriou &amp; Voyatzis 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Haghighipour et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Funk et al. 2013</ref>. In this paper, we do not consider these cases.</p><p>ied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cresswell &amp; Nelson (2006)</ref>. These authors analysed the orbital evolution of a compact system of numerous Earth-to super-Earth-mass planets during the dynamical instability phase. If the planetary orbits were initially several Hill radii apart in their simulations, the coorbital configuration emerged as a fairly typical case for some of the surviving planets. A similar set-up, though with different assumptions about the gas-disk density profile, has also been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giuppone et al. (2012)</ref>, who showed that even similarmass planets may form in the 1:1 MMR configuration. Additionally, these authors also simulated the coorbital-planet formation and stability during the gas-driven migration. Common to these works was that the 1:1 MMR configuration formed in a sufficiently low-eccentricity state, assisted by efficient gas friction, prior or during the migration stage. If, on the other hand, most of closein planets formed as a result of tidal evolution from a high-eccentricity state, acquired during the planet-planet scattering (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beaugé &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2012)</ref>, and the gas drag was of no help to keep the eccentricities low at any stage of evolution, the fraction of surviving 1:1 MMR configurations may be very small. Orbital evolution and survival of planets in the 1:1 MMR during migration has also been studied in some detail. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cresswell &amp; Nelson (2009)</ref> considered dynamics of coorbiting planets during and after the gas-disk dispersal and generally found the system to be stable. In some cases, the late migration stage with low-gas friction, or after nebula dispersal, has resulted in an increase of the libration amplitude of the tadpole regime and transition into a horseshoe regime, or even destabilization (see also analysis in <ref type="bibr">Flem- ing &amp; Hamilton 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rodríguez et al. (2013)</ref> included also tidal interaction with the star and found that equal-mass planets may suffer destabilization during their inward migration. Unequalmass configurations on the other hand that naturally form in the in-situ scenario, may thus be more common.</p><p>As far as the detection methods are concerned, the easiest idea would be to seek photometric dips about 1/6 for the hot-Jupiter orbital period away from its transit (as expected for a planet located in the Lagrangian stationary points L4 or L5). However, this approach did not yield so far a pos-itive result (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rowe et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Moldovan et al. 2010</ref>). For that reason researchers sought other detection strategies. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ford &amp; Gaudi (2006)</ref> found that a Trojan companion to hot Jupiter might be revealed by detecting an offset between the mid-time of its transit and the zero point of the radial velocity of the star (assuming that barycenter motion is subtracted). This effect would be detectable with available technology for planet companions with at least several Earth masses. While interesting, this method requires a combination of high-quality TTV and RV observations. So far, only upper limits of putative Trojan companions were obtained with this method.</p><p>A method based uniquely on analysis of the TTVs of hot Jupiter, if accompanied by a Trojan planet, was discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ford &amp; Holman (2007)</ref>. While finding the TTV amplitude large enough for even low-mass <ref type="bibr">Trojan companions, Ford &amp; Hol- man (2007)</ref> also pointed out difficulties in interpretation of the data. For instance a Trojan planet on a small-amplitude tadpole orbit would produce nearly sinusoidal TTVs in the orbit of giant planet. Such signal may be produced by a distant moon and/or resonant perturbations due to additional planets in the system. It would take further tests and considerations to prove the signal is indeed due to a Trojan companion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Haghighipour et al. (2013)</ref> presented so far the most detailed study of TTVs produced by a Trojan companion of transiting hot Jupiter. Their main goal was to demonstrate that the expected TTV amplitudes were within the detectable range of Kepler (or even ground-based) observations. With that goal, they first numerically determined the stable region in the orbital phase space. Next, they modeled the TTVs in the hot Jupiter orbit, giving several examples of how the amplitude depends on key parameters of interest (mass of the Trojan companion and eccentricity of its orbit, orbital period of hot Jupiter, etc.). While confirming a confidence of detectability of the produced TTVs, this work did not give any specific hints about inversion problem from TTVs to the system's parameters neither it discussed uniqueness of the TTV-based determination of Trojan-planet properties.</p><p>In this work, we approach the problem with different tools. Namely, we develop a semi-analytic perturbative method suitable for low-eccentricity orbits in the 1:1 MMR. While our method can be applied to the tadpole regime, or even the binary planet configuration, we discuss the case of a coorbital planets on horseshoe orbits. This is because in this case the TTV series have a characteristic shape, which would allow us to most easily identify the orbital configuration (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ford &amp; Holman 2007)</ref>. While the final TTV inversion problem needs to be performed numerically, multi-dimensionality of the parameter space is often a problem. Our formulation allows us to set approximate constraints on several key parameters such as the planetary masses and amplitude of the horseshoe orbit. This information can be used to narrow the volume of parameter space that needs to be searched. Analytic understanding of TTVs is also useful to make sure that a numerical solution is physically meaningful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Robutel &amp; Pousse (2013)</ref>, we use the Poincaré relative variables (r 0 , r 1 , r 2 ; p 0 , p 1 , p 2 ) to describe motion of the star with mass m 0 and two planets with masses m 1 and m 2 . It is understood that (m 1 , m 2 ) ≪ m 0 . The stellar coordinate r 0 is given by its position with respect to the barycenter of the whole system, and the conjugated momentum p 0 is the total (conserved) linear momentum of the system. Conveniently, p 0 is set to be zero in the barycentric inertial system. The coordinates (r 1 , r 2 ) of planets are given by their relative position with respect to the star, and the conjugated momenta (p 1 , p 2 ) are equal to corresponding linear momenta in the barycentric frame. The advantage of the Poincaré variables stems from their canonicity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski et al. 2008</ref>. Their slight caveat is that the coordinates and momenta are given in different reference systems, which can produce non-intuitive effects (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013</ref>). These are, however, of no concern in our work.</p><p>Heading toward the perturbation description, the total Hamiltonian H of the system is divided into the unperturbed Keplerian part</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H K = 2 i=1 p 2 i 2 µ i − G µ i M i r i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and the perturbation</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H per = p 1 · p 2 m 0 − G m 1 m 2 |r 1 − r 2 | .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here we denoted M i = m 0 + m i and the reduced masses µ i = m 0 m i /M i for the planets i = 1, 2. The gravitational constant is denoted by G.</p><p>For sake of simplicity, we restrict the analysis to the planar configuration. The reference plane of the coordinate system is then chosen to coincide with the orbital plane of the two planets around the star. As a result, the planetary orbits are described by only four orbital elements: semimajor axis a, eccentricity e, longitude of pericenter ̟ and mean longitude in orbit λ. To preserve canonicity of the orbital parameters, and to deal with orbits of small eccentricity, we adopt Poincaré rectangular variables (λ, Λ; x, −ı¯ x), instead of the simple Keplerian set, to describe orbits of both planets (ı = √ −1 and over-bar meaning complex conjugate operation). Here the momentum conjugated to the longitude of orbit λ is the Delaunay variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Λ = µ √ GM a. The com- plex coordinate x = √ Λ 1 − √ 1 − e 2 exp(ı̟)</formula><p>has its counterpart in the momentum −ı¯ x, both fully describing eccentricity and pericenter longitude. In a very small eccentricity regime we may also use a non-canonical, but simpler, variable z = e exp(ı̟) = 2/Λ x + O(x 3 ). Since the difference in mean longitudes of the two planets becomes the natural parameter characterizing coorbital motion, it is useful to replace variables (λ 1 , Λ 1 ; λ 2 , Λ 2 ) by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ 1 = λ 1 − λ 2 , J 1 = 1 2 (Λ 1 − Λ 2 ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ 2 = λ 1 + λ 2 , J 2 = 1 2 (Λ 1 + Λ 2 ) . (4)</formula><p>The advantage is that (θ 1 , J 1 ; θ 2 , J 2 ) remains a set of canonical variables and θ 1 , with J 1 , are the primary parameters describing the coorbital motion.</p><p>The total Hamiltonian H, expressed in (1) and (2) as a function of Poincaré relative variables, can be transformed with a lot of algebraic labor into a form depending on modified Poincaré rectangular variables (θ 1 , J 1 ; θ 2 , J 2 ; x 1 , −ı¯ x 1 ; x 2 , −ı¯ x 2 ) (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_5">. In general, H = H K + H per = H 0 + k≥1 H k , where H k ∝ x p1 1 x p2 2 ¯ x ¯ p1 1 ¯ x ¯ p2</formula><p>2 with positive exponents such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p 1 + p 2 + ¯ p 1 + ¯ p 2 = k.</formula><p>Hence, H k are of progressively higher orders in the eccentricities of the two planets. We restrict ourselves to the lowest order. The elegance of the coorbital motion description for small eccentricities is due to a simple, though rich, form of the fundamental Hamiltonian H 0 . While we shall return to the role of H 1 and higher-order terms in Sec. 2.2, we first discuss the H 0 term. Note that H 0 contains both the Keplerian term H K and the fundamental part of the planetary interaction in H per .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Dynamics corresponding to the H 0 term</head><p>We find that</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H 0 = − G µ 1 M 1 2a 1 − G µ 2 M 2 2a 2 (5) + Gm 1 m 2 cos θ 1 √ a 1 a 2 − 1 Γ (a 1 , a 2 , θ 1 ) ,</formula><p>where the dependence on the orbital semimajor axes a 1 and a 2 of the planets only serves to keep this expression short; the Hamiltonian is truly a function of the momenta (J 1 , J 2 ) via</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">a 1 = (J 1 + J 2 ) 2 Gµ 2 1 M 1 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">a 2 = (J 1 − J 2 ) 2 Gµ 2 2 M 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Additionally, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Γ (a 1 , a 2 , θ 1 ) = a 2 1 + a 2 2 − 2a 1 a 2 cos θ 1 , (8)</formula><p>which is not to be developed in Taylor series for description of the coorbital motion at this stage. We also note that a factor m 0 / √ M 1 M 2 has been omitted in the first term of the bracket in Eq. (5). This is a fairly good approximation for planetary masses much smaller than the stellar mass. We observe that the coordinate θ 2 is absent in H 0 , implying that the conjugated momentum J 2 is constant. The J 2 conservation is just a simpler form of a general angular momentum integral 2J 2 − |x 1 | 2 − |x 2 | 2 = C 1 at this level of approximation (eccentricities neglected). The motion is thus reduced to a single degree of freedom problem H 0 (θ 1 , J 1 ; J 2 ) = C 2 , where C 2 is constant. The C 2 isolines in the (θ 1 , J 1 ) space provide a qualitative information of system's dynamics.</p><p>Further development is driven by observation that in the coorbital regime a 1 and a 2 are both very close to some average value a 0 . As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Robutel &amp; Pousse (2013)</ref>, a 0 may conveniently replace the constant J 2 momentum using</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">J 2 = 1 2 µ 1 GM 1 + µ 2 GM 2 √ a 0 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In the same time, it is advantageous to introduce a small quantity, which will characterize small deviation of a 1 and a 2 from a 0 . This is accomplished by replacing (θ 1 , J 1 ) with (θ, J) using a simple shift in momentum:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">J 1 = 1 2 µ 1 GM 1 − µ 2 GM 2 √ a 0 + J ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">θ 1 = θ. So now H 0 = H 0 (θ, J; a 0 ). Finally, it</formula><p>is useful to define a dimensionless and small parameter u instead of J by J = (µ 1 +µ 2 ) √ Gm 0 a 0 u even at expense, that u is not canonically conjugated to θ. The dynamical evolution of the system is then described by quasi-Hamiltonian equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">du dt = − 1 c ∂H 0 ∂θ , dθ dt = 1 c ∂H 0 ∂u ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with c = (µ 1 + µ 2 ) √ Gm 0 a 0 . At this moment it is also useful to relate (θ, u) to the semimajor axes of the two planets via</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a 1 = a 0 1 + µ 1 + µ 2 µ 1 m 0 M 1 u 2 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">a 2 = a 0 1 − µ 1 + µ 2 µ 2 m 0 M 2 u 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>and H 0 still given by Eq. (5). These relations permit to compute differentiation with respect to u using the chain rule, such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">∂ ∂u = ∂a 1 ∂u ∂ ∂a 1 + ∂a 2 ∂u ∂ ∂a 2 .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Once the solution the planet motion in new variables u(t) and θ(t) is obtained, we shall also need to know mean longitudes, λ 1 and λ 2 , to determine TTVs. To that end we invert Eqs. (3) and (4), obtaining</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">λ 1 = 1 2 (θ 2 + θ) ,<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">λ 2 = 1 2 (θ 2 − θ) ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>and find θ 2 (t) from the integration of</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">dθ 2 dt = ∂H 0 ∂J 2 .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Differentiation with respect to J 2 is obtained by the chain rule with Eqs. (6) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(7)</ref>. It is also useful to recall that θ evolves more slowly than θ 2 , since to the lowest order in u: dθ 2 /dt ∝ u 0 , while dθ/dt ∝ u 1 . In fact, the unperturbed solution reads θ 2 ≃ 2 n 0 (t − t 0 ), with</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">n 0 = Gm 0 a 3 0 ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>implying λ 1 = λ 2 ≃ n 0 (t − t 0 ) to the lowest order.</p><p>Note that so far we considered the exact solution of H 0 , without referring to approximations given by its expansion in small quantities: u, and m 1 /m 0 and m 2 /m 0 . The reason for this was twofold. First, we found such series may converge slowly and truncations could degrade accuracy of the solution. Second, although we find it useful to discuss some aspects of such development in the small parameters below, we note that the system is not integrable analytically at any meaningful approximation. This implies that semi-numerical approach is anyway inevitable. Considering the complete system, as opposed to approximations given by truncation of series in the above mentioned small parameters, does not extent the CPU requirements importantly. In fact, Eqs. (11) and (17) are easily integrated by numerical methods (in our examples below we used simple BurlishStoer integrator leaving implementation of more efficient symplectic methods for future work).</p><p>While numerical approach provides an exact solution, it is still useful to discuss some qualitative aspects by using the approximated forms of H 0 . The smallness of u permits denominator factors such as 1/Γ in Eq. (5) be developed in power series of which we preserve terms up to the second order (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Robutel &amp; Pousse 2013)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">H 0 (θ, u; a 0 ) = G a 0 A 0 + A 1 u + A 2 u 2 .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>The A-coefficients read </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">A 0 = σ 2 2 − γ 2 − 2 γ ,<label>(20)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">A 1 = − σ + σ − 2 (1 − γ) 2 1 + 2 γ ,<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">A 2 = − 3 2 m 0 σ 3 + σ + (22) σ 2 + σ σ 2 + − 3σ 4 − γ 2 2 − 1 γ + 2σ 2 + γ 3 ,</formula><p>with the mass-dependent parameters σ ± = m 1 ± m 2 and σ = m 1 m 2 , and γ = √ 2 − 2 cos θ. Terms to the second power of planetary masses have been retained in Eq. <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. In fact, the simplest form is obtained by dropping the linear term in u, and approximating A 2 by the first factor only. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This results in</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">H 0 = − 3 2 G a 0 m 0 σ 3 + σ u 2 + Gσ a 0 cos θ − 1 γ ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>2 Note that the second term in A 2 is by a factor ∝ σ + /m 0 smaller than the first term. The smallness of the term linear in u is obvious in the limit of planets with a similar mass for which σ − ≃ 0. In the regime of planets with unequal masses, m 2 ≪ m 1 , one finds that A 1 u/A 0 ∝ (m 1 /m 0 ) 1/3 , rendering the omitted linear term again small (see Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(27)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref>  introduced already by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yoder et al.

Unfortunately, the Hamiltonian <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref> is not integrable analytically. Still, the energy conservation H 0 = C 2 provides a qualitative insight into trajectories in (u, θ) space and also allows us to quantitatively estimate some important parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows examples of two trajectories in phase space of (u, θ), one corresponding to a horseshoe solution (H) and one corresponding to a tadpole solution (T) librating about the L4 Lagrangian stationary solution. Here, we set m 0 equal to solar mass, m 1 /m 0 = 10 −3 and m 2 /m 0 = 2 × 10 −5 . Since we are primarily focusing on the horseshoe coorbital regime, we determine relations between parameters characterizing the H-trajectory in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. These are the: (i) minimum u 1 and maximum u 2 amplitudes of |u| along the trajectory, (ii) minimum separation angle θ min , and (iii) half-period T of motion along the trajectory in the (u, θ) space. One easily finds that u 1 corresponds to planetary opposition θ = ±π, and u 2 corresponds to longitude of the Lagrangian stationary solutions θ = ±π/3.

Obviously, a 0 is now needed to gauge n 0 , while c 2 may be obtained as a function of either of the parameters u 1 , u 2 or θ min ( see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref>). If one wants the right hand side in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(29)</ref> be solely a function of θ min , we have <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows time evolution of the semimajor axes a 1 and a 2 , and mean orbital longitude rates for the exemplary system shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> (m 0 = 1 M ⊙ , m 1 /m 0 = 10 −3 , m 2 /m 0 = 2 × 10 −5 , and a 0 = 0.5 au). In this case we focus on the horseshoe orbit denoted H on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. The longitude rates, computed from their definition <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> and using Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>, are represented in a normalized way by (dλ 1 /dt)/n 0 − 1 and (dλ 2 /dt)/n 0 − 1. As the trajectory moves along the oval-shaped curve in the phase space, the orbits periodically switch their positions with respect to the star causing their semimajor axis to jump around the a 0 value. Each orbit stays at higher/lower-a regime for time T , which is approximately ∝ m 0 /σ + /3 longer than its orbital period. The switch in semimajor axes is reflected in the corresponding variations in longitude rate. Note that the average λ-rates for both orbits are not equal to n 0 from (18), producing an offset shown by the difference of the dashed line and zero at the bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. This is because of the planetary masses also contributing to their mean motion about the star, while the definition of n 0 as a nominal, reference fast frequency did not take this into account. In fact, we find that the longitude rate normalized by n 0 and averaged over the coorbital cycle 2 T is approximately 1 + (m i /2m 0 ) + 6 (σ + /m i ) 2 u 2 ⋆ + . . . for each of the orbits (i = 1, 2), with u ⋆ being a characteristic value of the u-parameter over one of the half-cycles (e.g., one could approximate u ⋆ ≃ (u 1 + u 2 )/2). When the planetary masses are unequal, as in our example, the more massive planet has the mean longitude rate primarily modified by its own mass. In our case (dλ 1 /dt)/n 0 − 1 ≃ m 1 /(2m 0 ). The lighter planet's longitude rate is dominated by the second term, i.e., in our case (dλ 2 /dt)/n 0 − 1 ≃ 6 (σ + /m 2 ) 2 u 2 ⋆ . Even more important for the TTV analysis is to consider how much the mean rates in longitude change during the coorbital cycle. We find that the change in longitude rates during the low/higha states for each of the planets is approximated by ≃ ±6 n 0 (σ + /m i ) u ⋆ (i = 1, 2). If large enough, this value may build over a timescale T to produce large variations in the mean longitude of planets, and thus result in large TTVs. We will discuss this in Sec. 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">c 2 = 1 − Σ min + 1 √ 2 Σ min .<label>(30)</label></formula></div>

For instance, in the case of closely packed (but not coorbiting) orbits studied by Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y &amp; Vokrouhlick´yVokrouhlick´y (2014), the eccentricity term (32) was generally larger than the direct perturbation in λ over a short-term timescale.</p><p>We should also note that the H 1 and H 2 Hamiltonians would also contribute to variations of the (u, θ, θ 2 ) variables.

From these numerically-determined functions we subtracted the average mean motion trend n ⋆ (t − t 0 ) and obtained variation δλ of both planets as needed for the computation of TTVs (Eq. 40). The effective eccentricity terms δλ eff were computed from their definition in Eq.

For sake of the example we assumed an ideal situation with both planets transiting.

With that adjustment, the match between the synthetic TTV series and the modeled function δt is excellent. We also note that the contribution of the second term in the right-hand side of (40) is negligible and basically all effect seen on the scale of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> is due to the first term (i.e., direct perturbation in orbital longitude).

The match to the mean behavior of the TTVs is good, since in the simplest approximation the planets motion may be understood as a periodic switch between two nearly circular orbits. Since the period T is about 15 times longer than the orbital period of the planets in our case, the effect may accumulate into a large amplitude TTV series.</p><p>It is interesting to point out that recognizing the planet's configuration requires observations covering at least the fundamental period T of the coorbital motion. For instance, if the observations would have covered a shorter interval, say between <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.-Transit timing variations (TTVs) of the heavier planet δt 1 (top) and the lighter planet δt 2 (bottom) from <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> if the dataset is limited to observations between 2.6 yr and 8.3 yr. In this case, the analysis would reveal misleading signal with quasi-periodicity of ≃ 4.2 yr and much smaller amplitude (solid lines). <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, one may not recognize the coorbital signature in the TTVs. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 4</ref> shows how the data would have looked in this case. TTV series of both planets would look quasiperiodic with a period ∼ T /2 ≃ 4.2 yr, reflecting behavior of the planets' mean motion variation over one quarter of the coorbital cycle (i.e., when θ leaps from θ min to 360 • − θ min , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Equation <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> indicates that T ∝ a 3/2 0 (m 0 /σ + ) 1/2 , making thus the necessary observational timescale (i) shorter for closer-in planets, and (ii) longer for less massive planets. So for instance ≃ 12 y periodicity of the TTV series shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> would also hold for about 8 Earth mass coorbiting planets at about 0.15 au distance (i.e., ≃ 20 d revolution period) from a solar mass star. These are very typical systems observed by the Kepler satellite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">yr and 8.3 yr in</head><p>Consider now an ideal situation when both planets are transiting and a long enough series of TTVs are recorded for both of them (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). Analysis based on approximate Hamiltonian (23) then suggests (Sec. 2.1) that the ratio of maximum amplitudes of the TTV series, to be denoted T 1 for the more massive planet and T 2 for the less massive planet, is equal to the ratio of their masses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">T 2 /T 1 = m 1 /m 2 .</formula><p>Since T 2 /T 1 can be measured from the observations, the mass ratio of the coorbital planets is readily constrained.

We used a 0 = 0.5 au and set the planets initially at opposition, i.e. giving them λ 1 = 180 • and λ 2 = 0 • . The initial eccentricity values were assumed small, e 1 = e 2 = 0.001, and pericenter longitudes ̟ 1 = ̟ 2 = 0 • . For each of the mass configurations considered, we followed the system for 1000 yr and derived the synthetic TTV series as shown by symbols in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. We then fitted the maximum amplitudes T 1 and T 2 . Their ratio is shown by black circles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>, while the gray line is the expected direct proportionality relation mentioned above.

Since T /P 0 can be directly constrained from the observations, Eq. (42) provides a link between the mass factor σ + /m 0 and θ min . We tested the validity of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(42)</ref> by directly by integrating the planetary system in Poincaré rectangular coordinates. The model parameters were mostly the same as above, except for: (i) fixing now the planetary masses m 1 = 10 −3 M ⊙ and m 2 = 2 × 10 −5 M ⊙ , and (ii) starting the two planets at a nominal closest approach, λ 1 = θ min , λ 2 = 0 • and a 1 = a 2 = a 0 = 0.5 au. Both were given small initial eccentricity e 1 = e 2 = 0.001, and the system was propagated for 1000 yr with the Burlish-Stoer integrator. We recorded series of planetary transits and constructed a synthetic TTVs, similar to ones shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The code also provided numerical mean values of the planetary orbital periods, used to compute P 0 , halfperiod T of the TTV series, and the mean value of the minimum planetary separation. This last parameter was obviously very close to the given initial distance θ min , but typically differed from it by few tenths of a degree because of the effect of planetary eccentricities. With those parameters determined for the direct numerical model, we have all data needed to test the validity of Eq. (42). The results are shown by black circles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. The gray line is the J (θ min ) integral from Eq. (41), computed by a Romberg's scheme with controlled accuracy. Note that this integration needs a simple parameter transformation to remove the integrand singularity at θ = θ min limit. We note a very good correspondence of the numerical results with the expected trend from the analytic theory.</p><p>Once we verified the validity of Eq. (42), we can use it as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>. Here the abscissa is the minimum planet separation θ min , while the ordinate is now the ratio T /P 0 given for a set of different m 0 /σ + values (solid lines). The T /P 0 factor may be directly constraint from the observations and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref> hints that this information may be immediately used to roughly delimit the m 0 /σ + factor. This is because θ min can span only limited range of value for the horseshoe orbits: (i) θ min cannot approach too closely to the theoretical limit ≃ 23.9 • derived in Sec. 2.1, especially of e 1 and e 2 are non-zero, otherwise instability near the Lagrangian point L3 would onset, and (ii) θ min cannot be too small, otherwise instability near the Lagrangian points L1 and L2 would onset. While not performing a complete study here, assume for sake of an example that θ min could be in the interval ≃ 10 • to ≃ 22 • . Then if T /P 0 = 10 is obtained from the observations (as shown by the dashed gray line a in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7)</ref>, the m 0 /σ + ratio cannot be much larger than ∼ 2000. On the other hand, in T /P 0 = 30 is obtained from the observations (as shown by the dashed gray line b in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7)</ref>, the m 0 /σ + ratio cannot be much smaller than ∼ 3000. Hence the observations may directly hint the nature of planets in the coorbital motion.</p><p>So far we discussed properties of TTVs obtained for the two planets. This is because these series rely on transit observations of each of the planets individually. While we have seen that a more complete information could be obtained when we have TTVs for both planets, some constraints were available even if transits of the larger planet are observed only. We now return to the ideal case, when transits of both planets are observed and note that even more complete information may be obtained by combining transit series of both planets. Consider a series of transit instants t 2 of the second (less massive, say) planet and the consecutive transit instants t 1 of the first planet. We may then construct a series of their difference t 1 − t 2 as a function of the transit number. Using our example system from above, this <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.-Difference between the transit time t 1 of the more massive planet and the immediately preceding transit time t 2 of the less massive planet in the simulation shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The abscissa is a transit number of the first planet. The average value of t 2 − t 1 , shown here as δt av , is half of the mean orbital period of the planets. The minimum and maximum values of t 2 − t 1 , shown here as δt min and δt max , correspond to the extreme configurations, when θ = λ 1 − λ 2 is either minimum or maximum. information is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. As expected, t 1 −t 2 has the characteristic triangular, sawtooth shape which basically follows from the time dependence of the planets' angular separation θ(t) and spans values between zero and mean orbital period of the planets. Consequently, the minimum value of t 1 − t 2 , which we denote δt min , is directly related to the minimum angular separation θ min of the planets. Similarly, the average value of t 1 − t 2 , say δt av , is one half the mean orbital period of the planets (and when t 1 − t 2 ≃ δt av , the planets are at opposition). As a result θ min /π = δt min /δt av .</p><p>Since δt min and δt av are in principle discerned from observations, θ min can be fairly well constrained as well. In the same way, the maximum value of t 1 − t 2 , say δt max , provides θ min /π = 2 − δt max /δt av .</p><p>As an example, θ min estimated from the series in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> is ≃ 21.9 • , which is very close to the numerically obtained value of ≃ 21.4</p><p>• . With θ min constrained, we note that the TTVs analysis using Eq. (42) provides an independent, correlated constraint of θ min and the normalized sum of planetary masses σ + /m 0 = (m 1 + m 2 )/m 0 . Henceforth, σ + /m 0 can be directly obtained. If combined with the information about their ratio m 1 /m 2 discussed above, we finally note that individual planetary masses m 1 and m 2 (given in m 0 units) can be determined from the observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>While still awaiting for the first confirmed exoplanetary coorbital configuration, we derived here simple parametric relations that could be revealed from the TTV series of a such a system. From all possible coorbital architectures we chose here the horseshoe case that provides TTVs having the most singular nature. This is because at the zero order one may consider this situation as two noninteracting planets that periodically switch their orbits around some mean distance a 0 from the star. Instead of sinusoidal in nature, the TTVs thus resemble a triangular-shaped series with the half-period T of the coorbital motion.</p><p>In an ideal case, where TTVs of both planets are observed, we find that the characteristics of a complete-enough dataset of planetary transits may directly provide information about their masses. This is because the ratio of the TTV amplitudes constrains directly the ratio of the planetary masses. Additionally, time separation between the transits of the two planets allows to constrain their minimum angular separation θ min as seen from the star. This information, if combined with Eq.

(42) to relate the total mass of planets, σ + , to their minimum angular separation θ min . This only requires the data constrain T and the mean orbital period P 0 , or rather their ratio T /P 0 . Since the available range of θ min value is limited for stable orbital configurations, the value T /P 0 itself roughly sets a possible range of planetary mass, allowing us to distinguish cases with Jupiter-mass planets as opposed to the super-Earth-mass planets participating in the coorbital motion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Example of two trajectories in the (u, θ) phase space of Hamiltonian H 0 ; for sake of illustration we used m 0 = 1 M ⊙ , m 1 /m 0 = 10 −3 and m 2 /m 0 = 2 × 10 −5 . The trajectory in a horseshoe regime, labeled H, is characterized by: (i) minimum and maximum value of |u| parameter (denoted here u 1 and u 2 ), and (ii) minimum angular separation θ min of the coorbiting planets. The trajectory labeled T shows an example of a tadpole orbit, librating about the Lagrangian stationary point L4 for comparison.</figDesc></figure>
