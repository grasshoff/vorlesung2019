			<abstract>
				<p>NASA&apos;s Kepler Space Telescope was designed to determine the frequency of Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars, but these planets are on the very edge of the mission&apos;s detection sensitivity. Accurately determining the occurrence rate of these planets will require automatically and accurately assessing the likelihood that individual candidates are indeed planets, even at low signal-to-noise ratios. We present a method for classifying potential planet signals using deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms that have recently become state-of-the-art in a wide variety of tasks. We train a deep convolutional neural network to predict whether a given signal is a transiting exoplanet or a false positive caused by astrophysical or instrumental phenomena. Our model is highly effective at ranking individual candidates by the likelihood that they are indeed planets: 98.8% of the time it ranks plausible planet signals higher than false positive signals in our test set. We apply our model to a new set of candidate signals that we identified in a search of known Kepler multi-planet systems. We statistically validate two new planets that are identified with high confidence by our model. One of these planets is part of a five-planet resonant chain around Kepler-80, with an orbital period closely matching the prediction by three-body Laplace relations. The other planet orbits Kepler-90, a star which was previously known to host seven transiting planets. Our discovery of an eighth planet brings Kepler-90 into a tie with our Sun as the star known to host the most planets.</p>

But early in the mission, most of the major results coming from Kepler were the discoveries of individual particularly interesting planets or planetary systems. Kepler discovered the smallest transiting planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Muirhead et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. 2013</ref>), the closest transiting planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jackson et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ofir &amp; Dreizler 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013</ref>), the most-distant transiting planets † shallue@google.com 1 Google Brain, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA <ref type="bibr">94043</ref> 2 Department of Astronomy, The University of Texas at Austin, 2515 Speedway, Stop C1400, Austin, TX 78712</p><p>3 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden St., Cambridge, MA 02138</p><p>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and NASA Sagan Fellow ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kipping et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wang et al. 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2016)</ref>, and some of the most interesting and unusual systems in terms of orbital architectures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Doyle et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cabrera et al. 2014</ref>). As such, the first lists of planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr">Borucki et al. 2011a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>) produced by the Kepler team were assembled in a heterogeneous way in an effort to include as many planet candidates as possible. Most of the first lists of planet candidates were produced from lists of "threshold crossing events" (TCEs; detected periodic signals that may be consistent with transiting planets) from the Kepler pipeline ( <ref type="bibr">Jenkins et al. 2010b,c)</ref>, which were manually culled by humans to remove false positives caused by astrophysical variability and instrumental artifacts. A few candidates came from other sources as well; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. (2013)</ref> listed four planet candidates identified by eye by volunteers for the Planet Hunters project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fischer et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>As the Kepler mission matured and the list of planet candidates grew, the focus of the community shifted towards population-level studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pe- tigura et al. 2013a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dress- ing &amp; Charbonneau 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burke et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mul- ders et al. 2015a,b)</ref>. This shift in focus also manifested in changing attitudes towards the way planet candidate lists were produced and vetted. While heterogeneous catalogs that rely on human judgment are an efficient way to spur follow-up observations of Kepler's numerous exciting planet candidates, they are not well suited for population studies, which rely on uniformity. Uniform and automatically produced catalogs make it possible to characterize both precision (the fraction of detections that are true planets) and recall (the fraction of true planets that are detected), which are essential quantities for estimating population-level occurrence rates. Mid-way through the mission, efforts were taken to produce planet candidate catalogs in an automated way, relying less and less on human judgment in what became a planet candidate. Projects such as the Robovetter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>), a decision tree designed to mimic the manual process for rejecting false positive TCEs, progressed to the point that they could be used in lieu of human vetting to produce fully automated catalogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Coughlin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Catanzarite 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, others began to explore the use of machine learning for automatically vetting Kepler TCEs. The Autovetter project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McCauliff et al. 2015</ref>) used a random forest model to classify TCEs based on features derived from Kepler pipeline statistics. A similar approach was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mislis et al. (2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Thompson et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Armstrong et al. (2017)</ref> used unsupervised machine learning to cluster Kepler light curves with similar shapes, and defined classification metrics using the distances between new light curves and TCEs with known labels. The LPP metric defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Thompson et al. (2015)</ref> is used by the Robovetter to filter out light curves with "not transit like" shapes. In addition to using machine learning on transiting planets in Kepler, others have used machine learning to identify different types of candidate signals in Kepler and other datasets. <ref type="bibr">Mill- holland &amp; Laughlin (2017)</ref> used supervised learning to identify candidate non-transiting planets in Kepler data, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dittmann et al. (2017)</ref> used a neural network to identify the most likely real transits among many candidate events in the MEarth dataset.</p><p>In this paper we present a deep neural network for automatically vetting Kepler TCEs. Our model uses light curves as inputs and is trained on a set of humanclassified Kepler TCEs. Neural networks have previously been applied to a variety of astronomical problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pearson et al. (2017)</ref> used a neural network to detect planet transits in simulated light curves. Our best model has similarities with those of Cabrera- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Vives et al. (2017)</ref> for transient detection and <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Schaefer et al. (2017)</ref> for strong gravitational lens detection. Like those papers, we feed views of our inputs through separate convolutional columns, a technique that has previously been successful for image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cire¸sanCire¸san et al. 2012</ref>). Our model is able to distinguish with good accuracy the subtle differences between genuine transiting exoplanets and false positives like eclipsing binaries, instrumental artifacts, and stellar variability. This paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2, we introduce the concept of neural networks and describe several different neural network architectures that may be useful for problems like vetting transiting planet candidates. We describe the inputs to our neural network models in Section 3, and describe how we designed and trained our models in Section 4. In Section 5, we analyze the performance of our models and visualize some of the features our models learned about transiting planets and false positive signals. In Section 6, we use our best model to rank TCEs from a new search of stars observed by Kepler that are already known to host multiple transiting planet candidates. We discover several new planet candidates, and apply further scrutiny to statistically validate the best few candidates. In Section 7, we discuss two newly discovered planets -Kepler-80 g and Kepler-90 iand we also discuss the prospects for using our technique for occurrence rate calculations in the future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The goal of machine learning is to combine input features into useful outputs. For example, we might wish to build an image classification model that learns to assign labels (e.g. "dog", "car", "tree") to input images. To build this model, we could manually define the input features that our model needs to make classification decisions (e.g. "number of legs" and "number of wheels" would be useful features for distinguishing between dogs and cars). However, defining those features in terms of image pixels is extremely difficult. Instead, we could build a model that learns features automatically from data: this is called representation learning.</p><p>Deep learning, which is a type of representation learning, uses computational layers to build increasingly complex features that are useful -in particular -for classification problems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lecun et al. 2015</ref>). For example, a deep image classification model might first detect simple edge features, which can then be used to detect curves and corners, and so on, until the model's final feature layer can discriminate between complex objects. Deep neural networks, which are a type of deep learning model, have recently become the state-of-the art in a variety of tasks (e.g. image classification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Krizhevsky et al. 2012</ref>), and often outperform models built with hand-designed features. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a fully connected neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron or feed-forward neural network ). Its layers, which are comprised of scalarvalued units called neurons, are arranged hierarchically: the outputs from one layer are the inputs to the next. The output value of a neuron for a specific set of inputs is called its activation. The activations of the first layer (the input layer ) are the inputs to the network, and the activations of the final layer (the output layer ) are the network's predictions given those inputs. All other layers are hidden layers because their activations are not directly observed. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-Three layers of a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network. The convolutional layer takes the discrete crosscorrelation operation of the vectors in its input layer with kernel vectors that are learned by the model. The pooling layer aggregates values in small neighborhoods along its input, typically by taking the mean or maximum value within each neighborhood. The pooling layer aggregates regions spaced s neurons apart, where s is the stride length; here, the stride length is 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Fully Connected Neural Networks</head><p>Hidden layer activations are defined by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a i = φ(W i a i−1 + b i ) (1)</formula><p>where a i is the vector of length n i of activations in layer i, W i is an n i × n i−1 matrix of learned weight parameters, b i is a vector of length n i of learned bias parameters, and φ is an elementwise activation function.</p><p>The activation function φ is always nonlinear (a stack of linear layers would be equivalent to a single linear layer), so it is also called a nonlinearity. The optimal choice of φ is application dependent and is often determined experimentally. Popular choices include the sigmoid function φ(x) = 1/(1 + e −x ), hyperbolic tangent φ(x) = tanh(x), and the linear rectification function φ(x) = max{0, x}. The former two choices are saturating activation functions because their derivatives approach zero as x → ±∞, which can cause gradient-based optimization algorithms to converge slowly. The derivative of the linear rectification function does not diminish as x → +∞, which helps avoid this "vanishing gradient problem" and often results in faster training and better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Nair &amp; Hinton 2010)</ref>. Neurons with this activation function are called rectified linear units (ReLU).</p><p>For a classification problem, the output layer is normalized so that each neuron's value lies in (0, 1) and represents the probability of a specific output class. A binary classification problem (i.e. two output classes, {0, 1}) typically has a single output neuron representing the probability of the positive class. In this case, it is standard to use the sigmoid activation function for the output neuron because its range is (0, 1) and it induces a particularly convenient formula for gradient-based optimization 6 .</p><p>2.3. Convolutional Neural Networks <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The sigmoid is the inverse of the "canonical link function" of the Bernoulli distribution. Assuming the model represents a conditional Bernoulli distribution of the target variable given the input, the inverse of the canonical link function induces a simple formula for the derivative of the log likelihood of the training data with respect to the model's parameters (Bishop 2006, §4.3.6).</p><p>Fully connected neural networks, which densely connect every neuron in layer n to every neuron in layer n + 1, ignore any spatial structure present in the input. For example, every pixel in a 2D input image would be treated independently without using the fact that some pixels are located near each other. Features that are composed of neighboring pixels, like edges and shapes, need to be learned independently by the model for each location in the input. By contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exploit spatial structure by learning local features that are detected across the entire input; each feature only needs to be learned once. This significantly reduces the number of parameters that the model needs to learn, and reduces the memory usage and number of computational operations required to compute the output.</p><p>A CNN typically consists of convolutional layers and pooling layers <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. The input to a (1-dimensional) convolutional layer is a stack of K vectors a i (l = 1, 2, ..., L) of length n i . The operation that takes the stack of K input vectors to the l th output vector is called a feature map, and is defined by the operation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a (l) i = φ K k=1 w (k,l) i * a (k) i−1 + b (l) i (2)</formula><p>where * is the discrete cross-correlation operation (colloquially called "convolution"), w</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(k,l) i</formula><p>is a vector of length m i of learned parameters called the convolution kernel or filter, b</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(l)</formula><p>i is a vector of length n i of learned bias parameters, and φ is an elementwise activation function. Typically the kernel size is small (e.g. m i = 3 or 5) and the feature map detects the presence of a local feature along its input.</p><p>A pooling layer aggregates values within small neighborhoods along its input, typically by taking the mean or maximum value within each neighborhood. This makes the network approximately invariant to small translations of the input, which is helpful if we care more about whether a particular feature is present than its precise location. A pooling layer typically aggregates regions spaced s neurons apart, rather than one neuron apart, where s is called the stride length (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. This reduces the number of neurons in the pooling layer, which allows the feature maps in the next convolutional layer to have a wider view of the input -albeit at a lower resolution -without increasing the number of trainable parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Neural Network Training</head><p>A neural network is trained to minimize a cost function, which is a measure of how far its predictions are from the true labels in its training set. The cross-entropy error function is the standard cost function for binary classification, and is defined by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C(w) = − 1 M M i=1 (y i logˆylogˆ logˆy i + (1 − y i ) log(1 − ˆ y i )) (3)</formula><p>where w is the vector of all parameters in the model, y 1 , y 2 , ..., y M are the true labels of all examples in the training set (defined to be either 0 or 1, depending on their classifications), andˆyandˆ andˆy i is the model's predicted probability that y i = 1 given w.</p><p>The gradient of the cost function with respect to the model's parameters indicates how those parameters should be changed to reduce the value of the cost function. The model's parameters, which are initially random, are iteratively updated by descending along the gradient until a suitable minimum value of the cost function is reached. It is unnecessary and computationally expensive to compute the exact gradient of the cost function (e.g. computing the exact gradient of C(w) in <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> would involve iterating over the entire training set). Instead, each gradient step approximates the true gradient using a subset of the training set (called a "mini-batch") of size B, where 1 ≤ B M . B is typically called the "(mini-)batch size."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CREATING OUR TRAINING SET</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">TCEs and Labels</head><p>We derived our training set of labeled TCEs from the Autovetter Planet Candidate Catalog for Q1-Q17 DR24 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Catanzarite 2015)</ref>, which is hosted at the NASA Exoplanet Archive <ref type="bibr">7</ref> .</p><p>We sourced TCE labels from the catalog's av training set column, which has three possible values: planet candidate (PC), astrophysical false positive (AFP) and non-transiting phenomenon (NTP). We ignored TCEs with the "unknown" label (UNK). These labels were produced by manual vetting and other diagnostics; see Catanzarite (2015) for full details. In total there are 3,600 PCs, 9,596 AFPs and 2,541 NTPs. We binarized the labels as "planet" (PC) and "not planet" (AFP / NTP), but our model would only require minor changes to perform multi-class classification instead.</p><p>For the rest of this paper we assume that these labels are the ground truth. However, this is not totally accurate -we discovered several mislabeled examples by manually examining a small subset of the full training set. For example, Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) 2950.01 and 5308.01 are eclipsing binary false positives, and are labeled as such in the latest KOI table ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson et al. 2017</ref>), but both are labeled PC in the Autovetter Catalog. We assume that the effects of mislabeling on our model and performance metrics are relatively minor.</p><p>We randomly partitioned our data into three subsets: training (80%), validation (10%) and test (10%). We used the validation set during development to choose model hyperparameters (Section 4.2), and we used the test set to evaluate final model performance (Section 5.1). This is the gold-standard way to evaluate model performance because the test set contains no data used to optimize the model in any way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Light Curves</head><p>We downloaded light curves produced by the Kepler mission from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes 8 . These light curves were produced by the Kepler pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jenkins et al. 2010b</ref>), which calibrates the pixels, identifies optimal photometric apertures, performs simple (stationary) aperture photometry, and removes common-mode instrumental artifacts using the Presearch Data Conditioning-Maximum A Posteriori (PDCMAP) method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stumpe et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Smith et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Stumpe et al. 2014</ref>). Each light curve consists of integrated flux measurements spaced at 29.4 minute intervals for up to 4 years (approximately 70,000 points).</p><p>We then performed a few additional steps to prepare the light curves to be used as inputs to our neural network. For each TCE in the training set, we removed points corresponding to transits of any other confirmed planets in the system. Then we "flattened" the light curve (that is, we removed low frequency variability) by fitting a basis spline to the light curve and dividing the light curve by the best-fit spline. To preserve transits, we removed the TCE's in-transit points while fitting the spline and linearly interpolated over those transits. We iteratively fit the spline, removed 3σ outliers, and re-fit the spline while interpolating over those outliers to prevent the spline from being "pulled" by discrepant points like cosmic ray hits. This process is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref>.</p><p>One parameter we had to choose when fitting the spline was the spacing of spline "knots" or "break-points", between which the spline calculates its piecewise polynomial coefficients. Each Kepler light curve has different low-frequency stellar variability characteristics, so using one break-point spacing for all light curves is suboptimal. Instead, we chose the optimal spacing of spline break-points for each light curve by fitting splines with different break-point spacings, calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Schwarz et al. 1978</ref>) for each spline, and choosing the break-point spacing that minimized the BIC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Input Representations</head><p>We generated our neural network inputs by folding each flattened light curve on the TCE period (with the event centered) and binning to produce a 1D vector.</p><p>To bin a folded light curve, we define a sequence of uniform intervals on the time axis with width δ and distance λ between midpoints, and compute the median flux of the points falling within each interval. If we choose δ = λ then the intervals partition the time axis: each point falls in precisely one bin. If we choose δ &gt; λ then the bins overlap, which reduces scatter and makes some transits more visible.</p><p>The simplest choice of λ would be a fixed constant, but this would result in a wide range of input lengths due to the wide range of TCE periods. Instead we choose two TCE-specific values for λ, each of which generates a different "view" of the light curve ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>We generate a global view of the light curve by choosing λ as a fraction of the TCE period. All light curves are binned to the same length and each bin represents the same number of points, on average, across light curves. A disadvantage is that long-period TCEs may end up with very narrow transits that fall entirely within a small number of bins ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3b</ref>).</p><p>We generate a local view of the transit by choosing λ as a fraction of the TCE duration. We consider k transit durations on either side of the event so that the  transit occupies a fixed fraction of the resulting vector. This technique represents short-and long-period TCEs equally, but it only looks at part of the curve and therefore may miss important information, such as secondary eclipses <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3c</ref> . Unlike those papers, we use these two representations as separate inputs to our model. Finally, we normalized all light curves to have median 0 and minimum value -1 so that all TCEs had a fixed transit depth.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Neural Network Architectures</head><p>We consider 3 types of neural network for classifying Kepler TCEs as either "planets" or "not planets". For each type, we consider 3 different input options: just the global view, just the local view, and both the global and local views.</p><p>• Linear architecture. Our baseline model is a neural network with zero hidden layers (which is equivalent to a linear logistic regression model). This is a natural choice for its simplicity and popularity, but it makes the strong assumption that the input data is linearly separable -that is, planets and non-planets are separated by a linear decision surface in the input space. If both global and local views are present, we concatenate them into a single input vector.</p><p>• Fully connected architecture. A fully connected neural network is the most general type of neural network and makes the fewest assumptions about the input data. If both global and local views are present, we pass the two vectors through disjoint columns of fully connected layers before combining them in shared fully connected layers <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig- ure 4</ref>).</p><p>• Convolutional architecture. Convolutional neural networks have been tremendously successful in applications with spatially structured input data, including speech synthesis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Oord et al. 2016</ref>) and image classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Krizhevsky et al. 2012</ref>). We use a 1-dimensional convolutional neural net-  work with max pooling. This architecture assumes that input light curves can be described by spatially local features, and that the output of the network should be invariant to small translations of the input. If both global and local views are present, we pass the two vectors through disjoint convolutional columns before combining them in shared fully connected layers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>All hidden layers use the ReLU (linear rectifier) activation function, and the output layer uses the sigmoid activation function. The output of each model is the predicted probability that the input is a transiting planet; values close to 1 indicate high confidence that the input is a transiting planet and values close to 0 indicate high confidence that the input is a false positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Training Procedure</head><p>We implemented our models in TensorFlow, an open source software library for numerical computation and machine learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadi et al. 2016</ref>). We used the Adam optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kingma &amp; Ba 2015)</ref> to minimize the cross-entropy error function over the training set (Section 2.4). We augmented our training data by applying random horizontal reflections to the light curves during training. We also applied dropout regularization to the fully connected layers, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping" some of the output neurons from each layer during training to prevent the model becoming overly reliant on any of its features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Srivastava et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>We used the Google-Vizier system for black-box optimization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Golovin et al. 2017</ref>) to automatically tune our hyperparameters, including those for the input representations (e.g. number of bins, bin width), model architecture (e.g. number of fully connected layers, number of convolutional layers, kernel size), and training (e.g. dropout probability). Each Vizier "study" trained several thousand models to find the hyperparameter configuration that maximized the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (see Section 5.1) over the validation set. Each model was trained on a single central processing unit (CPU), and training time ranged from 10 minutes to 5 hours depending on the size of the model. Our best model (see Section 5.2) took 90 minutes to train. To speed up the hyperparameter search, we used 100 CPUs per study to train individual models in parallel. We ran many Vizier studies during model development as we iteratively improved our input representations and design decisions. We tuned each combination of architecture and input representation separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Model Averaging</head><p>Once we had selected the optimal hyperparameters for a particular architecture and input representation, we trained 10 independent copies with different random parameter initializations. We used the average outputs of these 10 copies for all predictions in Sections 5 and 6. This technique, known as "model averaging" (a type of "ensembling"), often improves performance because different versions of the same configuration may perform better or worse on different regions of the input space, especially when the training set is small and overfitting is more likely. It also makes different configurations more comparable by reducing the variance that exists between individual models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Test Set Performance</head><p>We use the following metrics to assess our model's performance:</p><p>• Precision: the fraction of signals classified as planets that are true planets (also known as reliability, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>• Recall: the fraction of true planets that are classified as planets (also known as completeness).</p><p>• Accuracy: the fraction of correct classifications.</p><p>• AUC: the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, which is equivalent to the probability that a randomly selected planet is scored higher than a randomly selected false positive.</p><p>The values of the first three metrics depend on the classification threshold we choose for our models. A natural choice is to classify a TCE as a planet candidate if its predicted probability of being a planet is above 0.5, and as a false positive if its predicted probability is below 0.5, but this threshold can be adjusted to trade-off precision versus recall. Increasing the threshold typically results in higher precision at the expense of lower recall, and vice-versa. The value of AUC is independent of the choice of classification threshold. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows precision versus recall for our three model architectures on our test set, which consists of .-Precision versus recall on the test set for our three neural network architectures. All models use both global and local input views. For each model, every point on its curve corresponds to a different choice of classification threshold. All TCEs predicted to be planets with probability greater than the threshold are considered to be classified as planets, and all TCEs predicted below the threshold are considered to be classified as false positives. Our convolutional architecture has the best overall performance.

These tables show that, for all architectures, using both global and local views gives better performance than using either view individually. Interestingly, the local view (on its own) gives better performance than the global view (on its own) in the linear and fully connected architectures, but the opposite is true in the convolutional architecture.

The Robovetter differs from machine learning vetting systems (like ours) in that its heuristics are explicitly defined by humans instead of learned automatically from data 9 .</p><p>The Kepler team recently released their simulated data products to the public, so we decided to test the effectiveness of our model at distinguishing simulated planets from simulated false positives. We considered the following simulated data sets, which are available at the NASA Expolanet Archive:</p><p>• Injected Group 1 contains a single on-target injected periodic signal for 146, 294 Kepler targets. Each injection simulates a transiting planet.</p><p>• Injected Group 2 contains a single off-target injected periodic signal for 22, 978 Kepler targets.

A detected signal must have MES &gt;7.1 to be considered significant enough to become a TCE. Therefore, the Kepler pipeline only recovers a subset of the simulated planets and false positives as TCEs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the number of these simulated TCEs classified as planets by our model with probability greater than 0.5, compared to the Robovetter. We discuss these results in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1.">Injected Group 1</head><p>Among the 45,377 simulated planets recovered by the Kepler pipeline, our model is similarly permissive to the latest version of the Robovetter, correctly classifying 36,826 of these TCEs as planets versus the Robovetter's 38,668. Among the full set of 146,294 TCEs (many of which were not recovered by the Kepler pipeline), we find that our model's predictions depend strongly on the MES of the simulated signal (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10)</ref>. At MES greater The number of simulated TCEs predicted to be planets by our convolutional neural network (exceeding the probability threshold of 0.5) and the Robovetter (classified as Planet Candidates).

The region between MES=5 and MES=10 is of particular interest because: a) it is the likely region of Earth-sized planets transiting Sun-like stars in temperate orbits, and b) it is at the detection limit of the Kepler pipeline, where the recovery rate is low and where there are likely to be as-yet undiscovered planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Christiansen et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Christiansen 2017)</ref>. We suspect that we may be able to improve our model's performance on low signal-to-noise TCEs by including simulated transits like these in our training set. In our current implementation, only 8% of planets and planet candidates in our training set have MES less than 10; our model rarely saw any low-MES positive examples during training and may have learned that low-MES events are a priori unlikely to be true planets. Including simulated low-MES planet candidates (as well as simulated low-MES false positives) in our training set may make our model more discriminating at low MES.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2.">Injected Group 2</head><p>We find that our model classifies many simulated false positive TCEs from Injected Group 2 as planets. The signals in Injected Group 2 were injected into the Kepler pixels off-target, simulating an astrophysical signal from a nearby star, which can mimic the transit of an ontarget planet <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . The fact that our model often classifies these signals as planets makes sense, because our model does not take in any information about the location of the transits on the pixels, like centroid shifts during transit or in-transit difference imaging. These types of diagnostics can help identify when transit signals are coming from off-target sources. We have plans to incorporate this type of centroid or positional information into our model in the future to help identify this kind of false positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3.">Injected Group 3</head><p>We find that our model predicts about 65% of the simulated eclipsing binary TCEs (with secondary events injected at the same orbital period) to be planets with probability greater than 0.5. Our model is therefore not able to identify these false positives as well as the Robovetter, which only classifies about 37% of these simulated eclipsing binaries as planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows that our model rejects most simulated TCEs when the secondary signal is stronger than the primary signal, but passes most simulated TCEs when the secondary signal is weaker than the primary signal. We know from Section 5.3.1 that our model can, in some cases at least, recognize subtle secondary eclipses (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8d</ref>), but it is evidently not sensitive enough to weak secondary eclipses to classify many of these simulated signals as false positives. It is possible that some of the simulated eclipsing binaries do not look like real examples from the training set (e.g. not V-shaped), or have a secondary eclipse that is too faint to detect in our representation. One way to increase our model's sensitivity to eclipsing binaries would be to include secondary and tertiary local views to give the model a "close up" view of any putative secondary eclipses and avoid information about the shape of secondary events from being lost in coarselybinned global views. Including these simulated eclipsing binaries in our training set would likely help as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.4.">Inverted Group</head><p>We find that our model predicts about 3.2% of the false positive TCEs in the Inverted Group to be planets with probability greater than 0.5, compared to the Robovetter, which only passes about 0.4%. One thing we discovered when examining these false positives is that our light curve "flattening" technique (Section 3.2) occasionally makes non-transit-like phenomena look like transits. Specifically, the issue arises when we remove "in-transit" points before fitting the basis spline and linearly interpolate over those points. If the light curve sits below the linear interpolation then the flattened light curve gets an artificial dip that sometimes looks like a transit. We mainly observed this in light curves with high-frequency stellar variability. We originally decided to remove intransit points to prevent the basis splines from being distorted by real transits. We could mitigate this issue in the future by improving our flattening routine, for example by interpolating non-linearly over in-transit points, or including views of the data with alternative detrending methods, which might give different or better representations of the putative transits. We also noticed that some of the model's confident predictions were spurious signals that had some features in common with real planet candidates, but were easily distinguishable by eye. Signals like these were not present in our training set, which limited our model's ability to properly classify them as false positives. Our model would likely benefit from including this set of false positives in our training set, to further improve its ability to reject spurious signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.5.">Summary</head><p>There are several caveats to keep in mind when using these simulated data to assess our model's performance. Firstly, inverted light curve tests do not reproduce all known types of false positives (e.g. those caused by sudden dropouts in pixel sensitivity caused by cosmic rays), so they do not assess our model's ability to identify these signals. On the other hand, inverted light curve tests may introduce new types of false positives not present in normal transit searches or our training set, which our model is not well equipped to identify. Secondly, some of the simulated false positives may not be physically realistic. For example, in many cases, eclipsing binaries with nearly equal primary and secondary eclipse depths will have V-shaped eclipses, which is not necessarily reproduced in these tests. Finally, <ref type="bibr">we</ref> have not yet used these simulated data to train our model, as was done for the Robovetter (whose metrics were tuned for optimal performance on the simulated data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The performance of our model would likely substantially improve if we were to include these simulated data in our training set.</p><p>All in all, while our model in general performs well on these tests, it does not yet match the performance of the more mature Robovetter in identifying simulated false positives. The failure modes we have observed in these tests highlight limitations in our current model implementation, which will have to be addressed before our model is ready to blindly classify TCEs to determine planet occurrence rates. We are planning to work on improving our model's performance on these types of false positives, and we discuss some avenues for future work in Section 7. In the meantime, our model is still able to quite accurately sort true planets from planet candidates (even if it does require some human supervision to assure reliable classifications). We take advantage of this in Section 6 when we use our model to sort TCEs from a new transit search and identify the most likely new planets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1.">Robovetter</head><p>We computed the performance of the Robovetter on our test set as an additional way of comparing it with our model. To do this, we matched the latest Robovetter classifications from the DR25 Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) table <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Thompson et al. 2017</ref>) with our training labels from the DR24 Autovetter Planet Candidate Catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Catanzarite 2015)</ref>. Note that the Robovetter only promotes the most plausible subset of TCEs to <ref type="bibr">KOIs (Thompson et al. 2017</ref>), so the DR25 KOI table contains only a subset of our test set (661 out of 1,523). We assumed that all missing TCEs were classified by the Robovetter as false positives. However, it is possible that some of the missing TCEs were not detected by the DR25 version of the Kepler pipeline due to changes in its Transiting Planet Search module between DR24 and DR25. We tested this by computing the accuracy of the DR24 Robovetter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Coughlin et al. 2016)</ref>, and found that it was nearly identical to the value we compute for the DR25 Robovetter.</p><p>To compute the Robovetter's metrics, we assumed our training labels were the ground truth 11 . We used the Robovetter's "disposition score" to rank the TCEs and assumed that any TCEs missing from the DR25 KOI table were rejected by the Robovetter with disposition score zero. Under these assumptions, the Robovetter has AUC of 0.974 (compared to our model's 0.988) and accuracy of 0.974 (compared to our model's 0.960).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.2.">Autovetter</head><p>The Autovetter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McCauliff et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Catanzarite 2015</ref>) is a machine learning system for classifying Kepler TCEs into 3 classes (planet candidates, astrophysical false positives and non-transiting phenomena). Most of its input features are derived from outputs of the Kepler pipeline, including fitted transit parameters (e.g. period), stellar parameters (e.g. effective temperature), and signal-to-noise statistics (e.g. MES). An advantage of this approach is that features can be chosen that are known a priori to correlate with one of the output classes. For example, the Autovetter has a feature that indicates whether a TCE's period is close to the period of another TCE on the same star, which would indicate that the TCE is an astrophysical false positive caused by starspots or an eclipsing binary. A disadvantage is that the Autovetter depends on the Kepler pipeline. We could not have used the Autovetter to rank our new TCEs in Section 6 because we discovered those TCEs using an alternative detection pipeline.</p><p>Our approach differs from the Autovetter in that we directly model the shapes of light curves, rather than statistics derived from light curves and other sources. However, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive: the Autovetter includes the LPP metric ( <ref type="bibr">Thomp- son et al. 2015</ref>), which encodes information about light curve shape, and we intend to experiment with auxiliary input features in our model in the future (see Section 7.2).</p><p>The Autovetter's accuracy on its training set is 0.973, or 0.986 if its classification objective is simplified to "planet" versus "not planet" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Catanzarite 2015</ref>). This is not directly comparable to our model's test set accuracy because the Autovetter re-weights its random forest votes to minimize the total number of misclassifications across its training set <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Catanzarite 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McCauliff et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>Empirically, we found that the main difference between our model's classifications and the Autovetter's classifications is on the set of false positive TCEs whose signals originate on stars other than the intended target. We found that our model misclassifies many of these TCEs as planets (see Section 5.4.2), whereas the Autovetter correctly classifies them as false positives. The Autovetter has multiple features related to centroid shifts during transits, but our model does not currently take any information about the location of the transits on the pixels. We plan to incorporate this information into our model in the future (see Section 7.2). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Transit Search</head><p>We tested the effectiveness of our new vetting tools by conducting a search of known Kepler multi-planet systems for new TCEs and planet candidates. Known multitransiting-planet systems are fertile grounds for detecting new transiting planets. We know a priori both that these systems have edge-on inclinations and that the planets in these systems very likely have small mutual inclinations, as is required for the known planet candidates to transit. It is likely that in many of these systems there are undiscovered planets that have not yet been detected.</p><p>We chose to search a subset of the Kepler multi-planet candidates. We searched 455 two-candidate systems, 141 three-candidate systems, 50 four-candidate systems, 21 five-candidate systems, 2 six-candidate systems, and 1 seven-candidate system. We used light curves produced by the Kepler pipeline and processed by its Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) module. We performed the search using the transit search pipeline described by Van-derburg et al. (2016) for transit searches in K2 data 12 . In brief, our pipeline flattens the light curves by fitting a basis spline to the light curve with outlier rejection and uses a Box Least Squares (BLS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref> periodogram search to detect transiting planets. Our pipeline searches for points in the BLS periodogram with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than a pre-determined cutoff. If any part of the BLS periodogram has high enough signal-to-noise to warrant further scrutiny, the pipeline automatically tests for and rejects various types of false alarms before promoting detections to the status of TCEs. Upon detecting a TCE, the pipeline fits a transit model to the TCE, saves the best-fit parameters, and removes the region around transit from the light curve before re-calculating the BLS periodogram on the clipped light curve to attempt to detect additional TCEs around that same star.</p><p>We removed transits of previously known planets from the Kepler multi-planet system light curves and searched for new candidate signals. For this search, we set a signalto-noise (S/N BLS ) threshold for detecting and recording TCEs of S/N BLS = 5. This S/N BLS threshold is considerably more liberal than both thresholds typically used for transit searches in data from the K2 mission (which we normally set at S/N BLS = 9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Vanderburg et al. 2016)</ref>, and the threshold 13 used by the Kepler pipeline of MES = 7.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jenkins et al. 2002)</ref>. Traditionally, higher S/N BLS thresholds are used for two reasons: a) to prevent the number of spurious TCEs (caused by systematics or otherwise) from overwhelming the number of real detected planets, and b) to ensure that no TCEs produced by purely Gaussian fluctuations are detected (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jenkins et al. 2002)</ref>. The main benefit to using a cutoff as low as S/N BLS = 5 is that we greatly increase our sensitivity to TCEs with S/N BLS above more conservative cutoffs, because a variety of factors can cause S/N BLS to be underestimated and TCEs to be erroneously rejected (see Section 7.2). Therefore, our search had the potential to discover new planets with S/N BLS slightly above the traditional Kepler cutoff of 7.1.</p><p>The trade-off of choosing such a low S/N BLS cutoff is that we greatly increase the number of spurious TCEs returned by our transit search. We added post-processing logic to automatically remove two common sources of spurious detections:</p><p>1. We discarded any detected TCEs with transit duration less than 29.4 minutes (the spacing between consecutive Kepler data points). With a low S/N BLS threshold, our pipeline tends to find a large number of "transits" consisting of only a couple of points, which would translate to extremely short transit durations that are not physically realistic.</p><p>2. We discarded any TCEs with fewer than 3 complete transits. Often, one or two spurious events (like instrumental noise or cosmic ray hits) lined up with one or two gaps in the light curve, causing the 12 Because our pipeline was originally developed to search for planets in data from the K2 mission, it is optimized for detecting the shorter ( 40 days) period planets commonly found by K2, so most of our new detections were at short orbital periods. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Our calculation of S/N BLS is roughly equivalent to the MES calculated by the Kepler pipeline. BLS algorithm to detect a long-period TCE. We required TCEs to have at least 3 transits containing at least half the number of expected in-transit points. Even if some of these discarded TCEs were caused by real planets, we would not have been able to confidently validate them with fewer than 3 complete transits.</p><p>After discarding these types of false positives, our search of 670 stars returned 513 new TCEs 14 -nearly one TCE per star. While the number of TCEs produced by this search is still manageable because we only searched a relatively small number of stars, such a high TCE rate would make it impractical for manual vetting of a similar search of the entire Kepler dataset. Therefore, we used our neural network model to sort the TCEs by the probability of being planets. Out of the 513 TCEs produced by our search, our model only predicted 30 were planets with a score greater than 0.5. These 30 highly ranked TCE are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. We also inspected each TCE by eye to confirm that the ranking of TCEs by our model appeared reasonable. Empirically, our model did a good job of ranking the TCEs, with very few obvious errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Summary of New Highly-Ranked TCEs</head><p>Of the 30 TCEs our model classifies as more-likelythan-not planets, we give more serious consideration to the 9 TCEs with planet predictions above 0.8. On our test set, the signals our model classified as planets with probability greater than 0.8 turned out to be planets or candidates 94% of the time. We calculated the signal-tonoise ratio (S/N) of these TCEs by measuring the mean depth of transit, dividing by the scatter of each individual point, and multiplying by the square root of the number of points in transit. All of the TCEs with scores above 0.8 have S/N above the traditional Kepler cutoff of 7.1. We summarize these these TCEs with predictions greater than 0.8 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> and give a brief description of each below.</p><p>• KIC 11442793. This system hosts seven transiting planets, ranging from slightly larger than Earth to Jupiter-sized planets, all of which have been either validated or confirmed via transit-timing variations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cabrera et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schmitt et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lissauer et al. 2014</ref>).

This system hosts two planetsone previously validated Earth-sized planet <ref type="bibr">(Mor- ton et al. 2016</ref>) and one candidate super-Earth in periods of 16.2 days and 29.7 days respectively. We detect an additional TCE at S/N = 8.4 with a period of 10.9 days.</p><p>• KIC 11568987. This system hosts one validated super-Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. 2016</ref>) and one candidate Earth-sized planet in 16 and 7.3 day periods, respectively. We detect a new TCE with a period of 27.1 days, S/N = 9.8 and a depth corresponding to a roughly Earth-sized planet.</p><p>• KIC 4852528. This system hosts five confirmed small planets, the outer four of which are in a rare dynamical configuration with the middle three planets and the outer three planets each locked in a three-body resonance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mac- Donald et al. 2016</ref>). We find a new TCE with a period of 14.64 days at S/N = 8.6 exterior to all five previously known planets.</p><p>• KIC 5972334. This system has two validated planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. 2016</ref>) and two candidates, including a warm Jupiter, an ultra-short-period planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014</ref>), and a superEarth in between, giving it a distinct architecture reminiscent of the 55 Cnc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Nelson et al. 2014</ref>) and WASP-47 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Becker et al. 2015</ref>) planetary systems. We detect a strong (S/N = 10.2) TCE with a period of 6.02 days which, if real, would have a radius a bit larger than that of the Earth. We see extra scatter in the light curve during the transit of this new TCE, however, which needs to be better understood before this TCE can be considered a good candidate.</p><p>• KIC 10337517. This system hosts a sub-Earthsized validated planet in a 4.3 day orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. 2016</ref>) and a super-Earth-sized planet candidate in a 7 day orbit. We detect an additional TCE in an 11.1 day orbit, which also would likely be sub-Earth-sized.</p><p>• KIC 11030475. This system has 4 planet candidates, none of which have been validated. We detect a new TCE at an orbital period of 4.75 days and S/N = 8.7, with the same time of transit, depth, duration, and exactly half the period of a previously detected candidate, KOI 2248.02. This "new" TCE, therefore, appears to be the true period of the candidate KOI 2248.02.</p><p>• KIC 4548011. This system hosts one validated planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. 2016</ref>) in a 6.3 day period and one additional candidate in a 9.1 day period. We detect a new TCE with a period of 13.95 days with a relatively strong S/N = 9.7, which if real, would likely be a sub-Earth-sized planet. Subsequently, this signal was also detected by the Kepler pipeline and included in the DR25 release of the Kepler planet candidate catalog as KOI 4288.04.</p><p>• KIC 3832474. Four of these new TCEs were predicted to be planets by our model with probability 0.9 or greater. We consider this to be a very confident prediction -among those objects in our test set to which our model assigned a planet probability greater than 0.9, 96% turned out to be correctly classified as planets. Given our model's high confidence in these four new candidates, and the fact that they all have signal-to-noise ratios greater than the traditional Kepler threshold of S/N = 7.1, we subject these four new TCEs to additional scrutiny in order to validate them as bona fide exoplanets. We describe our additional tests and calculations to this end in the following subsections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Nearby Stars to the New TCE Hosts</head><p>First, we attempted to identify whether any stars have been detected close on the sky to the host stars of our four new TCEs with planet predictions greater than 0.9. It is important to identify nearby stars and rule out the possibility that these companion stars are the sources of the new transit signals we see. To do this, we used information uploaded to the Kepler Community Followup Program (CFOP) webpages 15 for these four targets.</p><p>CFOP reports that there is a companion star about seven arcseconds south of Kepler-90, detected in imaging from the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT). This star is bright enough to potentially be the source of the transit, and its nearby position overlaps Kepler-90's point spread function, so it could in principle be the source of the new shallow transit signal we see. Similarly, UKIRT revealed a faint companion about 7 arcseconds southeast of Kepler-647 which could contribute the transit signal. Near Kepler-534, there are six stars within three Kepler pixels that could in principle contribute the transit signals we see, and Howard Isaacson reports on CFOP the detection of a faint secondary set of spectral lines in a high resolution spectrum taken at Keck Observatory (these lines were identified using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kolbl et al. 2015</ref>). Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kraus et al. (2016)</ref> report that Kepler-80 hosts two faint companions to the Southone at a distance of 1.7 arcseconds, and one at a distance of 3.9 arcseconds, both of which could in principle be the sources of the new transit signal we see.</p><p>Most of these detected companions, in particular, the ones detected visually in UKIRT or adaptive optics imaging, are at projected distances far enough from the Kepler target stars that we can either show that they are the sources of the transits we see, or rule them out as the sources of the transits. The spectroscopically detected companion to Kepler-534, however, is apparently close enough to the target star that it a) contributed light to the Keck HIRES spectrograph's slit, and b) was not detected with Robo-AO and Palomar Observatory adaptive optics imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Ziegler et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wang et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Furlan et al. 2017</ref>). Since we do not know this secondary star's angular separation, we therefore cannot rule it out as the source of the new transiting signal we see, and we do not proceed to statistically validate this TCE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Image Centroid Analysis</head><p>Each of the three remaining high-quality TCE hosts have nearby visually detected companions within their target apertures that might cause the transits. In this subsection we use the lack of apparent motion of the positions of the target stars in the Kepler images to show that the transits must be co-spatial with the target stars and cannot be contamination from these nearby visually detected companions.</p><p>We started by downloading the long-cadence target pixel time-series files for these three objects. For each of the roughly 60,000 images for each of the three stars, we measured the position of the target star by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian to the image, and recorded the best-fit center position in both the X and Y dimensions. This yielded a time series of X and Y positions for the entire four years of the Kepler mission. About every 90 days, Kepler rotated to keep its solar panels pointed towards the sun, which meant that the stars fell on different cameras and the pixels were in different orientations every 90 days <ref type="bibr">16</ref> . We therefore transformed the X and Y pixel time series into Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Dec.) time series. We high-pass-filtered the R.A. and Dec. time series for each star, identified the points that occurred during the transits of the three TCE signals, and calculated the average change in R.A. and Dec. for the target star during transit of the new TCEs.</p><p>For all three of our targets, we found no significant motion of the centroid during transit. For Kepler-80, we calculated a mean shift during transit in R.A. of 0.1 milliarcseconds and a shift in Dec. of 0.05 milliarcseconds, each with uncertainties of 0.13 milliarcseconds. If the transits, which have a depth of about 250 parts per million, were in fact coming from the closest visually detected companion at a distance of 1.7 arcseconds, the expected centroid shift would be 1700 milliarcseconds ×2.5 × 10 −4 = 0.42 milliarcseconds, smaller than what we measure. We conclude the new TCE around Kepler-80 is co-spatial with the target star (with an uncertainty of about 0.6 arcseconds). Similarly, we find no shift in the centroid position of Kepler-90 during the transit of the new TCE with uncertainties of about 0.1 milliarcsecond. Therefore, a roughly 90 ppm transit like our new <ref type="bibr">16</ref> These 90 day periods are called "quarters". TCE must come from a co-spatial source with uncertainties of about 1 arcsecond, which excludes the closest detected companion star (7 arcseconds distant) as the potential source of the transits. Finally, we confirm that the source of the new TCE around Kepler-647 must be co-spatial with the target star with an uncertainty of roughly 1.5 arcseconds -much closer than the closest detected companion at a distance of 7 arcseconds.</p><p>We therefore conclude that none of the visually identified companions to the three stars hosting new highquality TCEs are the sources of the new transit signals we see.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.3.">Photometric Tests</head><p>In this subsection, we describe the tests and checks we performed on the Kepler light curves of the TCE host stars to make sure that the TCE signals are not due to instrumental artifacts or other false positive scenarios. In particular, we performed the following checks and tests:</p><p>1. Secondary eclipse search. We inspected the phase-folded Kepler light curves for hints of a secondary eclipse. Detecting a secondary event would indicate that the TCE is likely due to the decrease in light caused by a faint, co-spatial star that happens to be an eclipsing binary. We see no evidence for a significant secondary eclipse for any of our targets.</p><p>2. Different apertures. We produced light curves from the pixels outside of the optimal Kepler aperture for each of our targets and inspected these light curves folded on the period of the TCE signals. If the transits are present in the background pixels with a depth considerably greater than we see in the on-target pixels, the signals are likely being introduced to the targets through scattered background light. In all three cases, we found that the background pixels showed no significant signals, so the TCEs are consistent with having their source on or near the target star.</p><p>3. Even-odd transits. We checked to make sure that the depths, timings, and shapes of even and odd-numbered transits were consistent. Detecting a significant difference between even and odd numbered transits would indicate that the signal is caused by a fainter eclipsing binary star with twice the period that we detect, and with slightly different primary and secondary eclipses. We see no evidence for even/odd differences in the three targets we inspected.</p><p>4. Consistency between quarters. We checked that the transit signals did not change significantly depending on which CCD module the target stars were observed. Every quarter during its original mission, Kepler rolled to keep its solar panels facing the sun, so every roughly 90 days, the stars fell on different positions on the CCD array. Sometimes, contaminating signals could be introduced into the light curve more strongly in some positions on the CCD than others, causing differences in the strengths and depths of transit signals on each CCD. We saw no evidence for these quarterly transit depth differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Consistency over mission lifetime.</head><p>We checked that the transit signals did not change significantly between the first and second halves of the Kepler mission. Sometimes, contamination can be caused by a process called "charge transfer inefficiency", or "column anomaly" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Coughlin et al. 2014</ref>). In this scenario, a variable star (likely an eclipsing binary) that happens to be on the same CCD column as the target star can bleed signal during readout of the images. This effect often worsens over time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>), so often, the transit depths at the beginning of the mission are considerably shallower than the transit depths at the end of the mission (see, for example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures  5 and 6</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gaidos et al. 2016</ref>). We see no significant differences in transit depth in the light curves of the new TCEs around <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80 and Kepler-90</ref>, making it unlikely these two TCE signals are caused by column anomaly. However, we do see a possible increase in transit depth for the new TCE around Kepler-647. We fit the increase in transit depth as a linear function of time, and determined a slope of about 13 ± 5 ppm per year -inconsistent with a constant transit depth with about 2.6σ confidence. While the detected slope is weak, and could plausibly be due to red noise in the light curve or underestimated uncertainties in the transit depths, out of an abundance of caution, we choose not to validate this TCE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Ephemeris matching.</head><p>We searched for "ephemeris matches," or other targets with nearly identical periods and times of transits either observed by Kepler or falling near the Kepler field in the sky. Finding an ephemeris match is an indication that a signal is likely caused by contamination from either the matched source, or from another unknown astrophysical source. We searched through the list of periods and transit times collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref>. We found no plausible other sources for the TCE signals in question (including the TCE around Kepler-647, which we suspect might be due to column anomaly).</p><p>7. Simple Aperture Photometry. We confirmed that the transit signals were still present in the raw Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) time series, and that their characteristics did not substantially change between the SAP photometry and the photometry corrected for systematics via PDCMAP. This shows that the transit signals are likely not residuals of larger systematic errors in the Kepler light curves that were partially corrected by PD-CMAP.</p><p>In the end, we find that the two new TCE signals around <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80 and Kepler-90</ref> appear to be astrophysical and not caused by Kepler systematics, and we find no evidence that these TCEs are associated with other known astrophysical signals from elsewhere in the Kepler field of view. We therefore consider these two signals to be planet candidates. While the TCE around Kepler-647 passes most tests, we find that the transit depth appears to increase over the course of the mission -a possible sign that this signal is an astrophysical false positive caused by column anomaly. While this candidate could still be a planet, we are not confident enough in this interpretation to validate it with high confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">False Positive Probability Calculations</head><p>After we vetted the two candidate signals around <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80 and Kepler-90</ref> to rule out various instrumental and astrophysical false positive scenarios, we calculated the probability that these two signals are caused by other astrophysical false positive scenarios that are indistinguishable from the signals we see, given the data at our disposal. We performed this calculation using vespa <ref type="bibr">(Morton 2015)</ref>, an open source code library that implements the methodology described by Morton (2012) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. (2016)</ref>. In brief, vespa considers the possibility that the signal is caused by a transiting planet, as well as several different astrophysical false positive scenarios, including the possibility that the signal is caused by a binary star eclipsing the target, or that the signal is caused by some binary star around another, fainter star nearby on the sky to the target. After measuring basic transit parameters and fitting the host star's spectral energy distribution, vespa calculates how well these parameters match the various scenarios it considers, and calculates the relative likelihood of each scenario using priors based on observational constraints and the characteristics of the host star.</p><p>We ran vespa on the new candidates around <ref type="bibr">Kepler- 80 and Kepler-90</ref>. We included as constraints the contrast curves from speckle imaging observations uploaded to CFOP by Mark Everett (two observations taken at 692 and 880 nm at Gemini-N Observatory of Kepler-90 and one observation taken at 880 nm at the WIYN telescope of Kepler-80). We imposed constraints on the depths of putative secondary eclipses by calculating the 3σ limit based on the scatter in the phase-folded light curve on each candidate's period binned to the transit duration. We used our constraints from the image centroid analysis to specify the 3σ maximum radius at which a contaminating star could contribute the transit signal. We used the spectroscopic parameters from <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">MacDonald et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Petigura et al. (2017)</ref> as inputs for Kepler-80 and Kepler-90 respectively, and we included near infrared photometry from the 2MASS survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>). Recently, it has been shown that systematic photometric uncertainties and/or offsets between photometric datasets between can cause vespa to mis-classify planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr">Shporer et al. 2017, Mayo et al., in prep)</ref>, so we avoided this issue by only including the high-quality 2MASS photometry.</p><p>Based on these inputs, vespa calculated that the new candidate around Kepler-80 has a false positive probability of about 0.002, and the new candidate around Kepler-90 has a false positive probability of about 0.005. Both of these false positive probabilities are quite low, below the 1% threshold often used to validate planets in Kepler (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Morton et al. 2016</ref>), thanks to the well characterized stars, high-resolution imaging, and tight constraints on the source of the transits from our centroid analysis. The vespa anaysis assumes that the candidates being validated are the only candidates in their systems, but these two candidates are found multi-planet systems. Candidates in multi-planet systems are a priori significantly less likely to be false positives than candidates in single-planet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. (2012)</ref> estimate that candidates in systems with at least three planets are about 50 times more likely to be real planets than the average planet. When we factor in this multiplicity "boost", the false positive probabilities of our two candidates decrease to less than 10 −4 . We therefore consider these two new candidates to be validated as bona fide exoplanets, and designate them Kepler-80 g and Kepler-90 i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Transit Fits</head><p>After statistically validating the two newly discovered planets around <ref type="bibr">Kepler-80 and Kepler-90</ref>, we fit the full Kepler long-cadence light curves with <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> models to determine planet and orbital parameters and uncertainties. We explored parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with affine invariant ensemble sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Goodman &amp; Weare 2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Newly Validated Planets</head><p>We identified two new exoplanets by conducting a transit search and using our new machine learning planet candidate vetting pipeline. Both of these planets are in high-multiplicity systems (there are five and seven other planets in the Kepler-80 and Kepler-90 systems, respectively), which are interesting to study because of our fine understanding of their architectures. In this subsection, we comment on each of these two planets individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1.">Kepler-80 g</head><p>Kepler-80 g is the outermost planet in its system. Previously, five planets were known, with orbital periods of 0.98, 3.07, 4.65, 7.05, and 9.52 days. The outer four 17 of these planets are in a rare dynamical configuration called a resonant chain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">MacDonald et al. 2016</ref>). The orbital periods of each pair of adjacent planets are close to an integer ratio (in this system, either 2:3 or 3:4), and the orbital periods of consecutive trios of planets satisfy the Laplace relationship:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p P 1 − p + q P 2 + q P 3 ≈ 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where p and q are integers, and P i are the orbital periods of the three planets. Kepler-80 d,e, and b satisfy this relationship with (p, q) = (2, 3), and Kepler-80 e,b, and c satisfy this relationship with (p, q) = (1, 2). Satisfying the Laplace relationship is equivalent to the fact the TTV "super-period" for adjacent planets in the chain is nearly the same for each pair of planets. In the Kepler-80 system, the super-period of each adjacent pair of planets is close to 192 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">MacDonald et al. 2016</ref>). The superperiod is the time it takes for the orbital angle at which two adjacent planets line up in conjunction circulates about the orbit -that is, for planets in the Kepler-80 system, two adjacent planets which happen to transit simultaneously will repeat this every 192 days. The superperiod, P super , for two planets close to a first order mean motion resonance is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P super = 1 | j+1 P2 − j P1 | (5)</formula><p>where j is an integer and P i are the orbital periods of the two planets. Resonant chains like the one around Kepler-80 are extremely finely tuned, specifying orbital periods to high precision. Recently, this fact was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Luger et al. (2017)</ref> to predict and recover the orbital period of the planet TRAPPIST-1 h using data from the K2 mission. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Luger et al. (2017)</ref>, we calculated the orbital periods of putative additional outer planets in the Kepler-80 system under the assumption that they happened to be in a three-body resonance with Kepler-80 b and c. After rearranging Equation 4 and plugging in values of p and q between 1 and 3 (inclusive), we identified possible orbital periods of 14. <ref type="bibr">64671, 11.54078, 10.77887, 31.72031, 12.41860, and 20</ref>.04003 days. For p = q = 1, the period predicted by the Laplace relation is within 100 seconds of the measured orbital period (14.64558± 0.00012 days) of the newly discovered planet -agreement to within one part in 10,000. Kepler-80 g orbits just outside a 2:3 period ratio with the 9.52 day planet, and these two planets have a super-period of 192 days, matching the super-periods of other planet pairs in the system. Kepler-80 g therefore almost certainly is part of the chain of three-body resonances around Kepler-80, bringing the total number of planets in the chain to 5, and the total number of planets in the system to six. The fact that we can so accurately predict the orbital period of Kepler-80 g through resonance arguments is strong independent confirmation that the signal is indeed caused by an exoplanet, and a validation of our methods from end-to-end.</p><p>Kepler-80 g warrants further study for several reasons. First, although the orbital period we found makes it extremely likely this newly discovered planet is the outer link in a chain of three-body resonances, the system requires further dynamical analysis to confirm the resonant state. Even though its low signal-to-noise ratio will make it difficult, it could be worthwhile to search for Kepler-80 g's transit timing variations, perhaps by measuring the timing of many transits averaged together (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mills et al. 2016</ref>). Finally, it will be important to assess the impact of a new planet in the resonant chain on the Kepler-80 TTV mass measurements made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">MacDonald et al. (2016)</ref>. In principle, if some of the TTV signal measured in the 9.52 day Kepler-80 c was caused by Kepler-80 g, that would impact the measured mass of Kepler-80 b, and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2.">Kepler-90 i</head><p>Kepler-90 is a star that was previously known to host seven transiting planets. Planetary systems with this many known planets are very rare.

As more data became available, additional searches <ref type="bibr">(Cabr- era et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burke et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schmitt et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lis- sauer et al. 2014</ref>) identified additional shorter-period and smaller transiting planet candidates, bringing the total number of planets to seven. Kepler-90 hosts two planets about 1.5 times larger than Earth in 7 and 8.7 day orbits, three planets about three times the size of Earth in 59.7, 91.9, and 124.9 day orbits, and two giant planets in 210.6 and 331.6 day orbits.</p><p>The newly discovered planet, Kepler-90 i, falls in the  largest gap in orbital-period space in the Kepler-90 system between Kepler-90 c (8.7 days) and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-90 d (59.7 days)</ref>. With a period of 14.4 days and a radius of 1.3 R ⊕ , Kepler-90 i fits in well with Kepler-90 b and c, the two shortest period planets in the system, which have radii comparable to Kepler-90 i of 1.4 and 1.6 R ⊕ respectively. Kepler-90 b, c, and i all have radii small enough that they are either likely or might be rocky <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Rogers 2015)</ref>. It is striking that the planets around Kepler-90 are so well sorted by radius and orbital period, with small planets orbiting close-in and giant planets orbiting farther from the star, although it is possible that this is a detection bias. Kepler-90 i is just barely above Kepler's detection limits, so we would be unlikely to detect any similarly small planets orbiting farther from Kepler-90 than this.</p><p>Another particularly striking feature of the Kepler-90 system is how orderly it appears to be. The transit durations t 1,4 of the seven previously known Kepler-90 planets scale quite well with period P (where t 1,4 ∝ P 1/3 ).</p><p>Kepler-90 i appears to somewhat buck that trend. While the mean stellar density derived from Kepler-90 i's transit is still consistent with the other planets and Kepler-90's spectroscopic density, Kepler-90 i's transit duration of about 2.8 hours is shorter than we expect (about 5 hours) assuming circular and co-planar orbits. Therefore, Kepler-90 i is likely slightly inclined away from our line of sight. If the orbit of Kepler-90 i is perfectly circular, its impact parameter would have to be about 0.85, giving it an orbital inclination of about 88 degrees, compared to the other seven planets in the system, which all likely have orbital inclinations 89 degrees or higher. There are reasons to expect that the Kepler-90 system should host some planets with slightly higher inclinations than are determined for the seven previously known planets - <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker &amp; Adams (2016)</ref> showed that the Kepler-90 system was among the Kepler multi-planet systems where self-excitation of mutual inclinations was most likely to occur. The addition of an eighth planet would make it even more likely that planets might be excited to impact parameters of ≈ 0.85 as we see for Kepler-90 i.</p><p>The addition of an eighth planet makes Kepler-90 a record-setter as the first exoplanetary system known to have eight planets, and along with the Sun, only one of two stars known to host this many planets. Finding systems with this many planets and learning about their sizes and orbits is a unique window into their formation. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cabrera et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schmitt et al. (2014)</ref>, Kepler-90 has an architecture reminiscent of the Solar system, with smaller planets orbiting close to the host star, and larger planets orbiting at larger distance. Unlike the Solar system, however, the entire Kepler-90 system is packed within about the orbital radius of Earth. This compact architecture suggests the Kepler-90 planets may have formed like the Solar system planets, with the more distant planets forming beyond the snow-line, where heavy volatile elements like water are in solid phase, and with the smaller planets forming closer to the star, where heavy volatile elements are in gaseous phase, limiting their growth. Then, unlike the solar system, Kepler-90 may have undergone disk migration to bring it into its current flat, compact, and orderly configuration. If this is true, then there might be more un-detected transiting planets orbiting Kepler-90, which have radii too small or orbital periods too long to detect without more Kepler-like observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Looking Ahead</head><p>The goal of the Kepler mission was to study Earthsized planets orbiting Sun-like stars. However, even with 4 years of continuous data, these planets are difficult to detect because: a) their smaller radii and the relative dimness of their stars means the dips caused by their transits are likely to be relatively shallow compared to the scatter of their light curves, and b) they are likely to have long orbital periods, so we can only detect at most a handful of transits in a 4 year window. These effects imply that Earth-like planets are more likely to have signal-to-noise ratios and multiple event statistics near or below the detection limit of the Kepler pipeline. The probability of the Kepler pipeline missing these planets is high -it recovers only 26% of injected transits 19 with expected MES between 7.1 and 8, despite these signals being strong enough (in principle) to rule out being fluctuations of pure random noise. There are many reasons that real transiting planets above the MES threshold of 7.1 can be rejected: residual non-Gaussian noise (like systematics and cosmic ray hits) can artificially reduce the apparent MES, light curve detrending can make transits appear shallower, and quantization in the grid search can cause slight mismatches in the detected period, epoch, and transit duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Christiansen 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We can recover some of these lost planets by reducing the signal-to-noise threshold of the detection pipeline (e.g. Kepler pipeline or BLS algorithm) to allow lesssignificant signals to become TCEs. As we showed in Section 6, this increases the recovery rate of planets at signal-to-noise above more conservative thresholds, but at the cost of detecting a large number of false positive TCEs that cannot practically be examined by eye. Therefore, a thorough study of the low signal-to-noise regime of Kepler data would require an automatic vetting system that can accurately separate plausible planet candidates from false positives.</p><p>Our neural network model for automatic vetting can quite accurately distinguish real planet signals from false positives caused by astrophysical and instrumental phenomena. 98.8% of the time it ranks planet candidates higher than false positives in our test set. When testing our model on simulated data, we found that while our model recovers simulated true planets at a good rate, our current implementation does not yet match the performance of the more mature Robovetter system at identifying certain classes of simulated false positives, such as weak secondary eclipses and spurious detections. Nonetheless, when we applied our model to new Kepler planet candidates, we found that it does a good job of ranking these TCEs by the probability of being a planet with very few obvious errors. We discovered several real new planets at the top of our model's rankings, which validates both the effectiveness of our model and our motivation for exploring the lower signal-to-noise region of Kepler data. The immediate impact of this work is the discovery of several new Kepler planets and planet candidates, including the exciting discovery of an eighth planet in the Kepler-90 system.</p><p>At a higher level, a technique like ours could be used in the future to make more accurate estimates of planetary occurrence rates. In particular, the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets, colloquially called "η-Earth", is one of the most important and exciting open questions in exoplanet research -it is directly proportional to the es-in principle, by using robust means instead of medians in our input representation, we could boost the S/N the model sees by up to 25%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a method for automatically classifying Kepler transiting planet candidates using deep learning. Our neural network model is able to accurately distinguish the subtle differences between transiting exoplanets and false positives like eclipsing binaries, instrumental artifacts, and stellar variability. On our test set, our model ranks true planet candidates above false positives 98.8% of the time. On simulated data, while it recovers simulated planets at a good rate, our model is not yet as effective as the more mature Robovetter system at rejecting certain types of simulated false positives, such as weak secondary eclipses. We are planning on improving our model in the future to address the failure modes we observed in simulated data, with the ultimate goal of using our model to calculate the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the galaxy.</p><p>We tested the ability of our model to identify new planet candidates by conducting a search of known Kepler multi-planet systems. We conducted our search at a lower signal-to-noise threshold than traditionally used, allowing a high rate of spurious false positives in order to discover new candidates that were not recovered by previous searches. Our detection rate of almost one event per star would have produced too many candidates to examine manually in a full search of the ∼ 200, 000 Kepler target stars. We used our model to rank the new candidates by likelihood of being a real planet and discovered several plausible planet candidates at signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold of 7.1. We statistically validated two of these new candidates: Kepler-80 g, which is part of an interesting five-planet resonant chain, and Kepler-90 i, which is now the eighth confirmed planet in the Kepler-90 system. This paper brings Kepler-90 into a tie with our Sun as the star known to host the most planets. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-A fully connected neural network.
