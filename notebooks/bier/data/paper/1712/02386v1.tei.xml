			<abstract>
				<p>The aim of our study is to investigate the dynamics of possible comets in the HD 10180 system. This investigation is motivated by the discovery of exocomets in various systems, especially β Pictoris, as well as in at least ten other systems. Detailed theoretical studies about the formation and evolution of star-planet systems indicate that exocomets should be quite common. Further observational results are expected in the foreseeable future, in part due to the availability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Nonetheless, the Solar System represents the best studied example for comets, thus serving as a prime motivation for investigating comets in HD 10180 as well. HD 10180 is strikingly similar to the Sun. This system contains six confirmed planets and (at least) two additional planets subject to final verification. In our studies, we consider comets of different inclinations and eccentricities and find an array of different outcomes such as encounters with planets, captures, and escapes. Comets with relatively large eccentricities are able to enter the inner region of the system facing early planetary encounters. Stable comets experience long-term evolution of orbital elements, as expected. We also tried to distinguish cometary families akin to our Solar System but no clear distinction between possible families was found. Generally, theoretical and observational studies of exoplanets have a large range of ramifications , involving the origin, structure and evolution of systems as well as the proliferation of water and prebiotic compounds to terrestrial planets, which will increase their chances of being habitable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Comets appear to constitute a crucial component of many (or most) star-planet systems as informed by the structure of the Solar System as well as observations of the environments of stars other than the Sun. There are also theoretical studies, which tend to indicate that comets might be a quasi-universal phenomenon, especially regarding the environments of solar-type main-sequence stars (see below). As identified in the Solar System, comets are relatively small icy objects, often only a few kilometers in extent (i.e., ∼0.1 to ∼100 km in diameter) that formed in the outer Solar System where temperatures have been (and still are) sufficiently low to allow for frozen water. Comets thus represent leftovers from the early Solar System, closely associated with its formation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brasser 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cook et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>This picture has detailed implications for Earth (and possibly Mars, if considered in an exobiological context). Based on detailed studies on the early history of the Solar System, the inner part of the protostellar disk, due to its proximity to the Sun and hence shaped by both high temperatures and high solar wind pressure, contained a relatively high concentration of silicates and heavy elements. On the other hand, icy particles and water in notable quantities could only have existed relatively far away from the Sun (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martin &amp; Livio 2014)</ref>. Considering that the Earth is assumed to have formed in the inner, dry part of the disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martin &amp; Livio 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rubie et al. 2015</ref>), most of its water had to be delivered to it (and to Mars) from beyond the snowline, i.e., ∼3.1 au <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Martin &amp; Livio 2012</ref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, underlying scenarios, including those considering the efficiency of water transport by planetesimals, asteroids and comets, are still subjects of ongoing research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Genda &amp; Ikoma 2008)</ref>. Recent observations of comets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hartogh et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altwegg et al. 2015</ref>) reinforce that the D/H ratio of the Solar System comets agrees with or exceeds the D/H ratio found in Earth's oceans. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bockelée-Morvan et al. (2012)</ref> measured, by using the Herschel Space Observatory, the 16 O/ 18 O and D/H ratios for the Oort Cloud comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd), whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altwegg et al. (2015)</ref> focused on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a Jupiter family comet. Another pivotal aspect of that latter comet is its organic-rich surface as seen by VIRTIS/Rosetta ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Capaccioni et al. 2015</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rickman et al. 2015</ref>). Note that some of these concepts, including those based on results from spectroscopy, are also relevant for studies beyond the Solar System.</p><p>There are also significant findings based on theoretical work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stern (1990)</ref>, for instance, assumes that comets are a natural product of planetary system formation as is the Oort Cloud. Simulations of planet formation for our own Solar System show that during the formation process of the gas giants frequent ejection of icy planetesimals from the planetary region took place. Some of those led to the formation of the Oort Cloud while most of them escaped to the interstellar space. Based on the Nice model of planet migration, Brasser (2008) investigated the possible two-stage formation of the Oort Cloud in the Solar System.</p><p>Their model showed a possible mass for the outer Oort Cloud in the range of 0.5 to to 1 M ⊕ with a most likely value close to 0.9 M ⊕ , in agreement with observational estimates. This finding is also relevant for the possibility of comets in exosolar systems.</p><p>In fact, it is noteworthy that pivotal evidence has been obtained that comets exist around stars other than the Sun as well; they are also referred to as exocomets or Falling Evaporating Bodies (a somewhat more generic term). The first system named to harbor exocomets is β Pictoris, an A6 main-sequence star. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beust et al. (1990)</ref> were first to analyze the metallic absorption lines found in the stellar spectrum and to create a model of evaporation, which fitted the behavior of the Ca II. They argued that frequent infalls could be the result of a perturbing action of an (at that time) protoplanetary body embedded in the disk. Furthermore, they related the dynamics of the exocomets-as-indicated to a major planet in the β Pictoris system, which was not known at the time, but has been found later (β Pictoris b).</p><p>A larger array of observational results regarding comets in the β Pictoris system has recently been given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kiefer et al. (2014)</ref>. This work made use of more than 1,100 spectra (Ca II H, K) obtained between 2003 and 2011 by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) instrument. In fact, as described by the authors, the β Pictoris system appears to contain two families of exocomets, i.e., one consisting of exocomets producing shallow absorption lines, attributable to old exhausted comets trapped in a mean motion resonance with a massive planet (as previously indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beust et al. (1990)</ref>), and one family of relatively recent comets associated with the fragmentation of one or a few parent bodies. Based on results by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zuckerman &amp; Song (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Welsh &amp; Montgomery (2013)</ref>, comets have also been found in other exoplanetary systems as well. One example is 49 Ceti, a relatively young (40 Myr) A-type main-sequence star. Additional examples are HD 21620, HD 42111, HD 110411, HD 145964, and HD 183324 (among others), which increases the total number of stars with indications of exocomets to (at least) 10. Several of these cases have been identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Welsh &amp; Montgomery (2013)</ref> who studied Ca II K absorption profiles from 21 nearby A stars with circumstellar gas debris disks. They found weak absorption features, which appear only sporadically and show radial velocities in the range of ±100 km s −1 , which the authors interpret as firm indications of exocomets. The indicated exocomets are around mainly young stars (∼5 Myr); these stars are supposedly in the phase of planet formation.</p><p>There are also significant astrobiological implications to the study of exocomets, which are closely related to the possible habitability of terrestrial planets in exosolar systems. A highly significant aspect is that exocomets are able to deliver both liquid water and basic organic substances from regions beyond the snowline to the inner domains of star-planet systems where terrestrial planets with features in supportive to habitability reside; see, e.g., observational results and analyses for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Capaccioni et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rickman et al. (2015)</ref> based on Rosetta. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bosiek et al. (2016)</ref> argued that the ability of comets and comet-like asteroids to foster prebiotic chemistry as well as their available energy may be relevant for facilitating habitability in various exosolar systems.</p><p>A more stringent perspective has previously been conveyed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wickramasinghe et al. (2009)</ref> and Wickramasinghe (2010). They discussed the possible existence of liquid water in comets, including the general potential for panspermia (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoyle &amp; Wickramasinghe 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">von Bloh et al. 2003</ref>). Based on the temperature and radiative environments, transient melting in comets in inner stellar systems might be able to occur. Supposed that comets were seeded with microbes at the time of their formation from prebiotic material, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wickramasinghe et al. (2009)</ref> conjectured that there would by sufficient time available for exponential amplification and evolution within the liquid interiors. From a terrestrial point of view, certain kinds of extremophiles have been identified (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rothschild &amp; Mancinelli 2001)</ref>, which could potentially exist and flourish in such extreme environments.</p><p>The general aspect of our work is to explore based on theoretical orbital simulations whether in exosolar systems as, e.g., HD 10180 (where the center star has properties akin to the Sun) comets happen to exist in different families similar to the ones observed in the Solar System, namely, the Halley comets (HC) and the Jupiter family comets (JFC).</p><p>However, it turned out that for HD 10180 no clear separation of cometary families could be identified. In Section 2, we discuss our theoretical approach, including comments about the HD 10180 system itself with focus on the Neptune-type planets considered for our time-dependent simulation. We also describe the methods as used and the numerical set-up.</p><p>Our results and discussion are given in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, we present the summary and conclusions of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The HD 10180 System</head><p>HD 10180 is located in the southern-sky constellation of Hydrus at a distance of 39.0 ± 0.6 pc from the Sun (van <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leeuwen 2007)</ref>. Based on the Hipparcos catalog (ESA 1997), the stellar spectral type is given as G1 V ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nordström et al. 2004</ref>), which makes HD 10180 an almost-twin to our Sun (G2 V). The stellar effective temperature is given as spectrograph, which led to the discovery of a planetary system consisting of at least five Neptune-mass planets with minimum masses ranging from 12 to 25 m ⊕ (i.e., planet c, d, e, f, and g). They also found tentative evidence for an inner Earth-mass planet (HD 10180 b) with a minimum mass of 1.35 ± 0.23 M ⊕ as well as more substantial evidence for an outer, more massive planet (HD 10180 h) with a minimum mass of 65 m ⊕ located at a distance of 3.42 +0.12 −0.13 au, and with an approximate orbital period of 2248 days; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for details. In a succeeding study, Tuomi (2012) found two statistically significant signals corresponding to two additional planets in close circular orbits (i.e., HD 10180 i and HD 10180 j) with Reasons for us to choose HD 10180 as system of study include the striking similarity of the host star to the Sun and, even more importantly, the system's general composition:</p><p>The most massive planet HD 10180 h is located outside of all other planets at a distance of ∼3.4 au from the central star with a mass of ∼64.4 m ⊕ ; all inner planets, including the five Neptunian planets have masses m &lt; 26 m ⊕ and four of them orbit inside of 1 au. Although there are notable differences to the Solar System, there are general properties where the system of HD 10180 and that of the Sun agree: in the Solar System, Jupiter, the most massive planet (317.8 m ⊕ ), acts as the main perturber for asteroidal and cometary objects, thus deflecting them to reach the terrestrial planets located inside of its orbit. Therefore, in the HD 10180 system, we expect HD 10180 h to play a similar role resulting in deflecting and capturing comets.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, further information is given about the four outer planets HD 10180 e to h considered in our computations. The Hill radius of HD 10180 h extends to 20 × 10 6 km (i.e., 53 times the Earth-Moon distance). Jupiter in our Solar System, with a semi-major axis of 5.2 au and about 4 times the mass of HD 10180 h has a Hill radius R Hill ≃ 52 × 10 6 km. In the following, two different densities are assumed for the planets of HD 10180, which are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ρ 1 = 1 g cm −3</formula><p>and ρ 2 = 2 g cm −3 ; the assumed density values are relevant for investigating close comet-planet encounters. Here ρ 1 is set to be very close to the numerical average between the densities 1 of Jupiter and Saturn, whereas ρ 2 is chosen as the approximate upper limit of medium-sized gas planets as, e.g., Neptune. The choices for ρ 1 and ρ 2 are also consistent with empirically deduced values for gaseous exoplanets obtained by Guillot (1999) and subsequent work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Methods and Numerical Setup</head><p>Guided by the structure of the Solar System, we assume that the system of HD 10180 might also harbor an Oort-type cloud of comets far from the star, and perhaps other comets in closer stellar vicinity (i.e., comets up to 1000 au from the star and Kuiper belt comets).</p><p>It is further assumed that every now and then the comets are gravitationally disturbed by, e.g., a passing star or a cloud of interstellar matter. The focus of our study is to investigate how those comets are disturbed or captured by one of the close-in planets, or even forced to escape from the system. When referring in our study to comets as captured, we address comets that are for a certain timespan in an orbit of small eccentricity and semi-major axis.</p><p>Our computations take into account a total of four planets (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), considering that the inner planets (with the closest planet having a semi-major axis of only a ≃ 0.06 au)</p><p>are not expected to noticeably change our statistical results. A more comprehensive approach based on additional planets would be without an obvious impact on the outcome, as our test computations have shown. It is evident that the outermost planet (i.e., HD 10180 h), considered in our simulations, is expected to be the dominant planet affecting the exocomets' orbital motions, a role played by Jupiter in the Solar System.</p><p>In our study, we used extensive numerical integrations for tens of thousands of fictitious comets (assumed as massless) for the HD 10180 system. The method of integration for the equations of motion is based on Lie-transformation, which is known to be a fast and efficient tool. This method has been successfully used since many years for different problems in astrodynamics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dvorak 1986)</ref>. Comparisons with other methods have shown that this method is especially adapted to model close encounters of celestial bodies as well as collisions. The reason is that this method utilizes an automatic step-size control connected to the chosen precision selected for solving the differential equations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eggl &amp; Dvorak 2010)</ref>; it was also compared to other methods in numerous ways.</p><p>Our integration scheme encompasses the central star of the HD 10180 system, the four system's outer planets (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) as well as 100 fictitious exocomets at an initial distance of a = 89 au, assumed as massless. The comets were assumed to originate from an Oort Cloud analogue and therefore have been placed in nearly hyperbolic orbits. The initial semi-major axis of 89 au was chosen to be close enough to allow interactions with the system's inner planets, but, on the other hand, also set to be well beyond the outermost system planet, HD 10180 h. Different initial semi-major axes were used in test simulations for some of the initial conditions. However, no discernible differences in the final statistics for the comets were found.</p><p>The initial inclinations and eccentricities are chosen as follows: initial inclinations from the plane (i = 1 • ) with ∆i = 10 • extending till retrograde orbits for 100 different perihelion longitudes and initial eccentricities ranging from e 0 = 0.905 to 0.99. Furthermore, the longitude of the ascending node Ω was set to the same angle as the inclination and the mean anomaly M was always set to 1 • . With these choices of initial conditions the number of integrated fictitious cometary orbits was more than 30,000, namely 19 (i) × 100 (ω) × 16 (e) and we were able to cover all the possible directions of incoming comets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>The integration time was set to 1 Myr; in a few cases of special interest, we continue to 5 Myr (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3 and 4</ref>).</p><p>It could be argued that in our Solar System many of the comets have orbits of low inclination -so why consider an isotropic influx of comets in HD 10180? The reason is that without detailed information of possible exocomets in that system, an isotropic angular distribution for the initial conditions appears to be the most appropriate default assumption. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of comets in the inner Solar System on hyperbolic or nearly parabolic orbits, which can then be readily observed. The results from the SOHO satellite are indicating that there are two cometary families: the Kreutz sungrazers as well as the Meyer group of comets. Other comets entering the Solar System seem to be randomly distributed over the sphere. As part of our study, we wish to identify the prevailing patterns of comets for HD 10180.</p><p>During orbital evolution, the orbits of the exocomets undergo close encounters with the planets. This behavior sometimes led to captures into low-eccentric orbits (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref> and 4) or to ejections from the system; in a few cases, collisions with the host star occurred.</p><p>Whenever a comet was ejected from the system, we inserted another one with the same 'initial' conditions as the escaper. Since at the time of insertion the configuration of the planets has changed, the newly inserted comet will exhibit a different dynamics. Based on this procedure, we will always keep the number of fictitious exocomets equal to 100.</p><p>As part of our numerical simulation, we counted the unstable comets for the various eccentricities and inclinations; the respective values are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. If all comets stayed on stable orbits -they could still be captured as periodic comets (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>) or assume a chaotic but still stable orbit -the number of ejected comets in the respective table is zero. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows very well the regime of stable orbits for comets of initial inclinations 100 • &lt; i &lt; 160 • and eccentricities e 0 &lt; 0.99 surrounded by areas of initial conditions where many orbitally unstable comets found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">General Case Studies</head><p>By making use of Lie-series (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gröbner 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stumpff 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dvorak et al. 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delva 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eggl &amp; Dvorak 2010</ref>, for background information) close encounters of the incoming comets with the planets are calculated with a sufficiently high precision.</p><p>Due to close planetary encounters, some of the comets are captured, whereas others are ejected from the system. In the Solar System, captured comets form families due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Our simulations show that the outermost planet (i.e., HD 10180 h) is able to change the orbits of incoming comets most profoundly when arriving with high speeds from the outskirts of the system. Moreover, close encounters also occur with respect to the inner planets as considered (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>The number of ejected comets increases more significantly for comets of larger eccentricities and smaller inclinations, owing to the fact that (1) for smaller inclinations, the number of encounters and consequently escapers is larger and (2) with larger eccentricities, there is a an increased likelihood that the comets enter the inner region of the system and undergo relatively early encounters resulting in escape.</p><p>The combined preliminary results for inclinations from i 0 = 0 • to 90 • are shown in <ref type="table">Tables 3 and 4</ref> (prograde orbits), as well as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 5</ref> from i 0 = 100 • to 170 • (retrograde orbits) and in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. It is found that for large eccentricities many more escapes from the system occur. The border between completely stable and escaping orbits is not a sharp one; in fact, at the interface separating the two regions, there is a small band characterized by statistical number fluctuations. However, there are no escapers for retrograde orbits up to e 0 = 0.94; hence, we don't show this regime in a separate table. Also, this 'mixed' band is still under investigation, as well as the computations for i 0 = 180 • . But even when there is no immediate crossing of the cometary orbit with the planet, the impact of secular resonances can lead to changes in a comet's orbit that close encounters with the planets are possible. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> reveals that the orbit for e 0 = 0.935 (dark blue line) is in terms of its perihelion distance still far away from the orbit of HD 10180 h (&gt; 2 au), but nevertheless at a later time, this orbit is changed so that close encounters with the planets lead to the comet's escape from the system. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that a total of 104 comets have been ejected from the system (first line for i 0 = 0 • and e 0 = 0.935).</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref> to 11 we show orbital properties of comets populating orbits of capture, depending on their initial conditions. Only for a few cases it is possible that comets of The effect of the most massive planet, HD 10180 h (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), on comet scattering seems obvious. Nonetheless, the second massive planet, HD 10180 g, located at about half the distance from the star, could potentially also have a non-negligible influence on cometary orbits. This can be seen in the graphs of <ref type="figure">Fig. 8, which</ref> show the main outcome of our simulations. In the lower left panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> (integration done without planet HD 10180 h) and <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> upper right panel (integration done without planet HD 10180 g) the differences are well pronounced. When planet h is excluded, only the comets with initial eccentricity of e &gt; 0.98 are able to reach the orbit of planet g and thus get scattered and ejected from the system. The influence of planet g, on the other hand, is not that big.</p><p>Comparing the two upper panels of <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> shows that they look almost identical, which means that taking out planet g does not have a noticeable effect on the scattering process.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is still a difference in the maximal number of ejected comets. Taking out planet g reduces the total number of ejected comets. Integrating the system for 5</p><p>Myr (shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> in the lower right panel) demonstrates that only the total number of ejected comets increases. However, the overall picture of stability does not noticeably change from a statistical point of view. Comets with initially high eccentricity and low inclination e 0 &gt; 0.5 and 0 • &lt; i 0 &lt; 40 • tend again to become unstable, whereas the main regime of initial conditions (e 0 , i 0 ) leads to stable cometary orbits. These comets stay in the system for the entire integration time of 5 Myr.</p><p>Figures. 9 to 11 show the properties of captured comets based on 1 Myr computations by depicting various orbital elements, which are: eccentricity, semi-major axis, and inclination (see color code). While for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref> all 4 planets were included, planet g was excluded from the simulations depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 10</ref> and planet h was excluded for the simulations of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 11</ref>. It is found that the difference in the scattering outcome for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 10</ref> is relatively minor. Comets with eccentricities as shown are able to reach the inner parts of the planetary system and interact with the planets; in fact, they are scattered to orbits with eccentricities of e &lt; 0.6 and semi-major axis as small as 5 au. Interestingly, the inclinations of the final orbits of comets can remain high, especially for comets with initially high eccentricities. This behavior is revealed by the orange color of the dots in the lower right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figs. 9 and 10</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 11</ref>, however, indicates a completely different outcome. For the integrations as depicted, planet h has been excluded from the computations. It can be seen that comets of relatively low initial eccentricity (e 0 =0.965) are unable to reach the orbit of planet g, which is now the outermost planet able to influence the orbits of incoming comets. Thus, the comets stay on their highly eccentric orbits far away from the planetary system. Increasing the initial eccentricity shows that comets can now approach planet g and can be scattered to orbits farther inward, i.e., a &lt; 60 au. Note that only comets with an eccentricity as high as 0.99 can be scattered to orbits with e &lt; 0.6 and a &lt; 5 au. Nevertheless, the number of comets ending up in such orbits is small compared to the number of comets based on the integration for the whole system versus the system with planet g excluded. This leads again to the conclusion that the influence of the most massive planet h on comet scattering is clearly dominant.</p><p>Furthermore, when considering the interval of 0.1 &lt; e &lt; 0.7 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figs. 9 and 11</ref>, one can see that with planet h included, more comets are scattered into orbits with an eccentricity of that range. However, with planet h excluded, the comets are not able to reach a planetary orbit, which would influence them gravitationally and scatter them to orbits of smaller eccentricity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 11</ref>). The significant influence of planet HD 10180 h on the scattering of the comets, especially on comets of higher initial inclination, can be explained by the size of its Hill sphere. Due to its bigger mass and its orbit, the Hill sphere of planet HD 10180 h has a radius of 0.1379 au, which is more than three times larger than that of planet g, given as 0.04 au (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, comets interacting gravitationally with planet h have a lower velocity, which results in a longer period during which planet h is able to affect the comet's orbit. Comets encountering planet g are closer to their perihelion and thus have a higher velocity, which further reduces the duration of stay in the sphere of influence of planet g. Thus, taking out planet HD 10180 h has a profound influence on the scattering process. Additionally, it is found that the influence of planet g on the comets is relatively weak because of its position compared to planet h.</p><p>We also explored the probability of comets to be captured into orbits with moderate values for the semi-major axis and eccentricity, i.e., e &lt; 0.7 and a &lt; 10 au. This was done for two cases: first, with all four planets included in the calculations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12</ref>) and second, for a system with planet HD 10180 h excluded (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 13</ref>). It was found that the highest probability of capture occurs for comets with an initial eccentricity between e 0 = 0.985 and 0.97 combined with an initial inclination close to 0 • . The next highest peak, albeit significantly lower, was found for comets with an initial inclination of 30 • .</p><p>Furthermore, for comets with initial eccentricities below 0.97, no significant captures occurred. Additionally, it was found that the overall picture did not change much when excluding planet h, except that for comets with an initial eccentricity of 0.985 the small peaks showing a capture probability of ∼ 5% for comets with an initial inclination of 30 • , 90 • , and 120 • disappeared. Hence, we conclude that planet g is responsible for the capture of comets with this particular initial condition.</p></div>

Additionally, within the same time interval (τ &lt; 1 Myr) the comet's eccentricity drops from almost parabolic (e ≃ 1.0) to close to circular (e ≃ 0.0) (green in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3)</ref>. Thereafter, the comet's semi-major axis increases within a relatively short time frame to up to about a = 15 au, followed by some fluctuations between 9 and 15 au (blue in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). The decrease of the comet's semi-major axis (shown in blue in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> can be explained by jumping from one resonance to another.</p><p>Note that the same behavior was previously observed for the Solar System comet Halley <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dvorak &amp; Kribbel 1990</ref>).</p><p>Subsequently, the semi-major axis settles at a = 13 au due to a close encounter with planet HD 10180 b at 1.3 Myr.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>The purpose of this work is to explore the orbital dynamics of possible exocomets in the HD 10180 star-planet system. Exocomets appear to constitute a significant component of stellar systems as informed by previous theoretical and observational studies. Besides the Solar System, the best studied case so far is β Pictoris ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kiefer et al. 2014</ref>), which appears to host two families of comets of different histories and degrees of fragmentation. Previous theoretical work about the detectability of exocomets include estimates by Hainaut (2011), who scaled realistic and extreme cases of the Solar System to the distance of neighboring stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cook et al. (2016)</ref> discussed the detectability of close interstellar comets in consideration of previous estimates by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moro-Martín et al. (2009)</ref>; this study is expected to be helpful for future searches. Generally speaking, the study of exocomets, either belonging to the environments of stars or being interstellar in nature, carries significant information about planet formation and the prospects of habitable domains. Current work mostly focuses on young A-type stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zuckerman &amp; Song 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Welsh &amp; Montgomery 2013</ref>), but more comprehensive search missions are anticipated in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In the present work, we consider the system of HD 10180. The center star is of spectral type G1 V, and is strikingly similar to the Sun regarding mass, surface temperature, metallicity and age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lovis et al. 2011</ref>, and references therein), with some of the data even agreeing with solar values within their error bars. Based on the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lovis et al. (2011)</ref> and Tuomi (2012) we know that the HD 10180 system is rich in planets as it may host up to nine planets (or even more, notwithstanding future detections), which makes it the present-time record holder, thus surpassing the Solar System. However, the planetary system of HD 10180 is much more compact than the Solar System. The outermost planet HD 10180 h has a distance from its star comparable to the big gap for Solar System asteroids between the 2:1 and 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stern (1990)</ref> proposed that based on the detection rate of interstellar comets one could draw conclusions about the rate of planetary formation in the galaxy. In our study, we did not investigate the influence of planet formation or, e.g., the impact of giant planet migration on the comet ejection rates. Nevertheless, we found that due to gravitational interaction with the planets a substantial number of comets were ejected from the system, which allows us to conclude that not only planet formation mechanisms, but also the influence of passing stars with ensuing interactions of the comets with the planets and subsequent ejection from the system can account for a large number of interstellar comets (e.g., see <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> lower right panel).</p><p>Our simulations also showed that planet HD 10180 h dominates the cometary scattering process depending on the comets' initial conditions. It is also governing the orbital dynamics of exocomets considered in our study; a feature also shared by Jupiter in the Solar System. Our simulations took into account more than 30,000 comets as part of the initial orbital integration scheme, which included comets of different initial eccentricity and inclination (also encompassing comets in retrograde orbits). Our study shows different kinds of outcomes such as encounters with the planets, captures, escapes, and secular comet-planet resonances. The integration process itself included the four outer planets of the system, i.e., planet e, f, g, and h (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Generally, comets with relatively large eccentricities were able to enter the inner region of the system, thus facing early close planetary encounters. Owing to our theoretical approach, the number of ejected comets considered in our simulation readily increased over time.</p><p>It was also found that for comets with large eccentricities many more escapes from the system occurred. However, the border between completely stable and escaping cometary orbits is not a sharp one; in fact, at the interface separating the two regions, there is a small band characterized by statistic fluctuations. Moreover, there are no ejections for retrograde orbits up to eccentricities of e 0 = 0.94. Nonetheless, even without crossings of cometary orbits with any of the planets, the impact of secular resonances can lead to changes in cometary orbits so that close planetary encounters are possible. We also showed how comets of initially planar orbits, in the context of our simulations, are spread evenly to also include retrograde orbits and could also be in long-term stable orbits around the host star (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref>).</p><p>Even though the idea of finding families of comets in the HD 10180 system was a key motivation for this work, we were unable to determine any dynamical families, although a very large number of captured comets has been identified through our numerical integrations. We think that the reason why no families of comets in the HD 10180 system were found is because of the system's architecture, which aside from the many affinities to the Solar System still exhibits decisive differences. For example, in our system beyond the most massive planet Jupiter other massive planets exist able to influence the orbits of incoming objects, whereas in the HD 10180 system, the most massive planet h constitutes the system's outermost planet.</p><p>A particular focus of our work concerned the role of the comet's initial eccentricity and inclination regarding capture, evolution of orbital elements, or the comet's escape. In the future, we plan to extend our studies of comets to other exoplanetary systems including systems with compositions akin to the Solar System as well as systems with notably different structures. Moreover, we consider our work as part of the bigger picture associated with the study of comets, pertaining to the Solar System as well as to exosolar systems.</p><p>Studies about exocomets yield a large range of implications, involving the origin, structure and evolution of systems as well as the proliferation of water and prebiotic compounds to terrestrial planets, which will increase their chances of being habitable. This latter aspect has been showcased by results from Rosetta (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Capaccioni et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rickman et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bosiek et al. 2016)</ref>, which indicate the pivotal role of comets regarding prebiotic chemistry and potential exobiology.</p><p>To consider the importance of exocomets for possible life in exosolar systems another possible extension of our future work will include the detailed study of encounters and collisions with planet HD 10180 g located at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, comparable to the position of Mars in the Solar System. This exosolar planet is Neptune-like; therefore, not being able to host life. However, an exomoon or a Trojan-type object associated with HD 10180 g could still be habitable.

The y-axis shows the perihelion distance (blue), the eccentricity (green), and the close encounters with planet h (red) in units of its Hill radius (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The stable period between 1 and 2.5 Myr is well pronounced. After this period, another time interval exhibiting low eccentricities follows. These periods are bounded by close encounters with the most massive planet in the system, planet h. Gravitational interactions during these encounters lead to visible changes in the cometary orbit. system. The y-axis shows the semi-major axis (blue) and the inclination (green). The comet enters the inner region and is captured in a stable orbit with a ∼ 14 au for approximately 1.5 Myr (see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref>). Another stable period, even closer to the star (∼4 au) follows.</p><p>After a close encounter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref>), the orbit becomes chaotic again and the comet may leave the inner planetary system once more. with the planets and thus stay in the system. Only the ones with initial eccentricities of &gt; 0.98 reach the orbit of planet g and thus can be ejected from the system. Lower right:</p><p>The calculation of the whole system (with 4 planets) for an integration time of 5 Myr shows almost the same pattern as the two panels in the upper row. The total number of ejected comets is higher, however, as expected. comets could potentially form a Jupiter family analogue in the HD 10180 system. However, no clear distinction between short-and long-period comets could be identified. Nevertheless, most comets are captured in highly eccentric orbits and will probably be ejected from the system later on. The higher the initial eccentricity e 0 , the less probable it is for a comet to be captured in an orbit with moderate values for its semi-major axis and eccentricity.</p><p>Interestingly, some comets, especially those with large initial eccentricity (e 0 &gt; 0.97 ), are scattered to inclinations of up to 60 • . slightly with increasing initial eccentricities, which allows comets to penetrate into the inner planetary system and to start interacting with planet HD 10180 g. For comets with initial eccentricity of e 0 = 0.98, it is possible for them to be captured on orbits with semi-major axes a &lt; 40 au, but the eccentricity for these orbits still remains high, which makes a permanent capture unlikely. Based on the result of this figure with planet HD 10180 h omitted, as well as the comparisons to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 10</ref>, we can conclude again that planet HD 10180 h definitely plays the main role in capturing comets.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">. 12</ref>). Thus, we can conclude that the combination of the scattering given by planet g and h plays a prevalent role for comets with this particular initial eccentricity.</p><p>Noting that the probability for a capture for comets with e 0 =0.99 remains about the same, leads to the conclusion that for comets in highly eccentric orbits planet g plays the main role in the scattering process. On the other hand, comets with lower initial eccentricities, i.e., e &lt; 0.985, have a perihelion distance beyond the orbit of planet g and thus cannot be majorly affected by this planet, which is why the probability for them to be captured is zero.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>5911</head><label></label><figDesc>±19 K, and its luminosity and mass are identified as 1.49 ±0.02 L ⊙ and 1.06 ±0.05 M ⊙ , respectively; see Lovis et al.

Tuomi (2012) also confirmed the existence of the five Neptunian planets (with minor revisions concerning the previously reported parameters) as well as the existence of HD 10180 h and found evidence for two additional planets. Thus, based on the work by Lovis et al. (2011) and Tuomi (2012), it can be concluded that HD 10180 is a tightly packed system with six or possibly nine planets; eight of those are spaced between 0.02 and 1.42 au from the star and another planet is located at ∼3.40 au. If all of these planets are verified, it would make HD 10180 the present-time record holder with more planets in orbit than there are in the Solar System! Note that the semi-major axes are fairly regularly spaced on a logarithmic scale, thus exhibiting an approximate Titius-Bode-type law. Other examples of planetary systems exhibiting quasi-logarithmic spacing have previously been explored by, e.g., Cuntz (2012) and Bovaird &amp; Lineweaver (2013). Lovis et al.
