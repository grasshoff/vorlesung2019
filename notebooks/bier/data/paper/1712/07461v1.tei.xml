				<p>Context. The Kepler object KOI 2700b (KIC 8639908b) was discovered recently as the second exoplanet with a comet-like tail. It exhibits a distinctly asymmetric transit profile, likely indicative of the emission of dusty effluents and reminiscent of KIC 12557548b, the first exoplanet with a comet-like tail. Aims. The scientific goal of this work is to verify the disintegrating-planet scenario of KOI 2700b by modeling its light curve and to put constraints on various tail and planet properties, as was done in the case of KIC 12557548b. Methods. We obtained the phase-folded and binned transit light curve of KOI 2700b, which we subsequently iteratively modeled using the radiative-transfer code SHELLSPEC. We modeled the comet-like tail as part of a ring around the parent star and we also included the solid body of the planet in the model. During the modeling we applied selected species and dust particle sizes. Results. We confirmed the disintegrating-planet scenario of KOI 2700b. Furthermore, via modeling, we derived some interesting features of KOI 2700b and its comet-like tail. It turns out that the orbital plane of the planet and its tail are not edge-on, but the orbital inclination angle is from the interval [85.1, 88.6] deg. In comparison with KIC 12557548b, KOI 2700b exhibits a relatively low dust density decreasing in its tail. We also derived the dust density at the beginning of the ring and the highest optical depth through the tail in front of the star, based on a tail-model with a cross-section of 0.05 × 0.05R ⊙ at the beginning and 0.09 × 0.09R ⊙ at its end. Our results show that the dimension of the planet is R p /R s ≤ 0.014 (R p ≤ 0.871R ⊕ , or ≤ 5551 km). We also estimated the mass-loss rate from KOI 2700b, and we obtained ˙ M values from the interval [5.05 × 10 7 , 4.41 × 10 15 ] g.s −1. On the other hand, we could not draw any satisfactory conclusions about the typical grain size in the dust tail.</p>

In certain cases the mass loss from the exoplanet may cause formation of a comet-like tail. The hypothesis that a close-in exoplanet may have a comet-like tail was suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schneider et al. (1998)</ref> and was revisited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mura et al. (2011)</ref>. The transit light curve of dusty extra-solar comets was investigated, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lamers et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (1999)</ref>. The first good evidence for exocomet transits was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rappaport et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The first exoplanet with a comet-like tail, KIC 12557548b, was discovered from Kepler long-cadence data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref>, and was found to be a close-in exoplanet with an extremely short orbital period of P orb ≃ 0.65356 days. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref> suggested that the planet's size is not larger than Mercury. The light curve of this planet was studied in more detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kawahara et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Croll et al.

Gravity of the more massive planets would provide too deep a potential barrier for the wind. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Garai et al. (2014)</ref> searched for comet-like tails in a sample of 20 close-in exoplanet candidates with a period similar to KIC 12557548b from the Kepler mission, however, none of the exoplanet candidates showed signs of a comet-like tail. This result is in agreement with the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, two more exoplanets have been discovered, KOI 2700b and K2-22b, whose transit shapes show evidence of a comet-like tail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015</ref>). The Kepler object KOI 2700b (KIC 8639908b) was discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref> as the second exoplanet with a comet-like tail. It exhibits a distinctly asymmetric transit profile, likely indicative of the emission of dusty effluents and reminiscent of KIC 12557548b. The orbital period of KOI 2700b was determined by the discoverers using Lomb-Scargle analysis (P orb = 0.910023(4) days) and χ 2 minimization (P orb = 0.910022(5) days). The host star has T eff = 4435 K, M ≃ 0.63M ⊙ and R ≃ 0.57R ⊙ , comparable to the parameters ascribed to KIC 12557548. The upper limit of the planet radius R p ∼ 1.06R ⊕ , determined by the same authors, is in agreement with the theory of the thermal wind and planet evapora- In this paper we aim to verify the disintegrating-planet scenario of KOI 2700b by modeling its light curve and put constraints on various tail and planet properties, as was done in the case of KIC 12557548b. The light curve of the object was analyzed similarly as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>, however, in comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>, in this work the light-curve modeling process is more sophisticated. We first improved the orbital period and constructed the phase-folded and binned transit light curve of KOI 2700b using long-cadence Kepler observations from the quarters 1 -17 (Sect. 2). Subsequently, we searched for long-term orbital period variations (Sect. 3). We then calculated phase functions and used the radiative-transfer code SHELL-SPEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Budaj &amp; Richards 2004</ref>). We applied this code iteratively to model the observed light curve of KOI 2700b. Mie absorption and scattering on spherical dust grains with realistic dust opacities, phase functions, and finite radius of the source of the scattered light were taken into account (Sect. 4). The resulting parameters and model light curves are described and discussed in Sect. 5. Our findings are concluded in Sect. 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Observations</head><p>We used the publicly available Kepler data from the quarters 1 -17 in the form of Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) fluxes. Pre-search Data Conditioning Simple Aperture Photometry (PD-CSAP) fluxes often deliver over-corrected light curves, in which the astrophysical signal is reduced or even canceled, hence we avoided using these data. A comparison between the SAP and PDCSAP Kepler phase-folded and binned transit light curves of KOI 2700b is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1.</ref> Only the long cadence data were used to construct the light curve. These are 64 842 observations with an exposure time of about 30 min. Kepler observations were reduced in a similar manner to in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Garai et al. (2014)</ref>.   <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Results of the period analysis of KOI 2700b. We searched for periodicities from 1 min to 1 hour using the method of phase dispersion minimization (see Sect. 3), but we did not find any significant frequency in this interval. See the text.</p><p>Each quarter has a different flux level. Consequently, fluxes within each quarter were normalized to unity. We then improved the orbital period of the exoplanet found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. For this purpose we used the method of phase dispersion minimization described in Sect. 3. First we phased the data with the orbital period of P orb = 0.910023 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. 2014</ref>). We used the phase 0.5 for transits. Subsequently, data were cut into segments each covering one orbital period. Each segment of data was fitted with a linear function. During the fitting procedure the part of the data between phases 0.45 and 0.65, covering the transit, was excluded from the fit. Consequently, the linear trend was removed from each chunk of data (including the transit data). This method can effectively remove the long term variability (mainly variability of the host star due to spots and rotation) while it does not introduce any nonlinear trend to the phased light curve. The final value of the orbital period was then found in these detrended data. We found the orbital period of P orb = 0.9100259(15) days via the phase dispersion minimization method, which is in good agreement with the period presented by the discoverers. Finally, the data were phased with this new orbital period. Subsequently, we checked our result using the Fourier method <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deeming 1975)</ref> and found P orb = 0.910042(7) days. This method confirmed the orbital period resulting from the phase dispersion minimization method. We estimated the error by performing Monte Carlo simulations generating and analyzing 100 artificial datasets.</p><p>To reduce the noise, the phased light curve was subjected to an averaging. We first applied the running window averaging technique. We used a window with the width in units of phase of 0.00075 (1-min width, negligible in comparison with the exposure time), 0.005 (6.5-min width, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>), 0.011 (15-min width, about 1/2 of the exposure time) and 0.023 (30-min width, comparable with the exposure time). The step was set as 1/10 window width in every case. Since the obtained averaged light curves showed systematic fluctuations at short timescales (about 20 -30 min), easily visible, for example, in the light curve smoothed using the 15-min-width window ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref>, we performed period analysis with the main aim to explore its nature, using the method of phase dispersion minimization (see Sect. 3). For this purpose we used the available short cadence SAP Kepler detrended data, and searched for periodicities from 1 min to 1 hour. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that there are no significant frequencies in this interval, indicating that the observed systematic fluctuations of averaged light curves may be due to poor SNR or to the exposure time. Subsequently, we applied averaging via data binning. Instead of stable window width, this technique uses a certain number of data points per bin. We examined the cases from 500 to 1500 data points per bin with a step of 50 data points per bin, and finally we selected the case of 1000 data points per bin, according to the minimum scatter and relatively good coverage of the phased light curve with averaged data points. The obtained light curve is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, as well as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 (SAP flux)</ref>. No systematic fluctuations are visible in this case and, if not mentioned otherwise, we used this averaged light curve in our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Comparison with the light curve of KIC 12557548b</head><p>The light curve of the exoplanet KOI 2700b is peculiar and very interesting. It exhibits a distinctly asymmetric transit profile with a sharp ingress followed by a short sharp egress and a long smooth egress; reminiscent of the light curve of the exoplanet KIC 12557548b. The observed light curve of the exoplanet KOI 2700b might show a relatively weak pre-transit brightening (see for example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), however, we could not statistically identify this light-curve feature, previously found at KIC 12557548b as  significant. This latter exoplanet also exhibits a relatively weak post-transit brightening <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5)</ref>. These brightenings are caused by the forward scattering on dust particles in the tail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj 2013)</ref>. The light curves have one more similarity. The transit ingress begins at an orbital phase of about 0.45 and the transit egress ends at an orbital phase of about 0.65 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.  5)</ref>. The transit duration in phase units is 0.2 in both cases. The transit depth, however, is very different. KIC 12557548b has an average transit depth of about 0.005 in flux (i.e., 0.5%), while KOI 2700b has about ten times shallower average transit depth, 0.0004 in flux (i.e., 0.04%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Evolution of the light curve</head><p>The relatively shallow average transit depth of the exoplanet KOI 2700b (∼ 0.04%) makes it difficult to study possible transit-totransit variations in the transit depth, as was done in the case of KIC 12557548b. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref> reported that the transit depth appears to decrease systematically with time during the Kepler mission. During this step we first divided our detrended data into five approximately equal segments (in time) and each segment of data was subsequently phased with the orbital period of P orb = 0.9100259 days (Sect. 2.1), found A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. KOI2700b via the method of phase dispersion minimization (see Sect. 3).</p><p>Since we used less data points per light curve (approximately 13 000 vs. 64 000), we applied 200 data points per bin (instead of 1000 data points per bin) during the data averaging. The resulting phased light curves are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>. Based on our analysis we can confirm the result concerning decreasing transit depth, found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. On the other hand, we can also conclude that this depth decreasing is not monotonical. The last three light curves have approximately the same transit depth, which may indicate the possibility of a long-term periodic variability as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang (2013)</ref> suggest that disintegrating planets undergo negligible orbital period variations due to the evaporation process. During this step we examined this prediction via searching for possible long-term changes of the orbital period of KOI 2700b. For this purpose we used the method of phase dispersion minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stellingwerf 1978)</ref>, application PDM2, version 4.13 1 , which uses bin structure 50/2. The detrended data were used for this purpose (see Sect. 2.1). We assumed that the period changes linearly:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Search for long-term orbital period variations</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">P = P 0 + βt,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where β is a dimensionless value, but is often expressed in days/million years (d/Myr). The output from the analysis is a curve ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7)</ref>, which shows the dependence of Θ min as a function of β. The term Θ min is a dimensionless statistical parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stellingwerf 1978)</ref>. The minimum value of Θ min indicates the speed of the period change -β. We fitted a parabola to this curve and obtained β = 1.3 ± 3.2 d/Myr, which means that there is no significant evidence for the long-term orbital period change during the time span of the Kepler observations. This result is in agreement with the prediction, presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang (2013)</ref>. The error was estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We generated and analyzed 100 artificial datasets with the same standard deviation as the original data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Calculation of the optical properties of the dust</head><p>According to van <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lieshout et al. (2014)</ref>, the comet-like tail of KOI 2700b may consist of dust grains composed of corundum (α-Al 2 O 3 ) or iron-rich silicate minerals. Therefore during the modeling we applied selected species, which have similar chemical composition: γ-alumina, enstatite, forsterite, olivine (with 50% magnesium and 50% iron) and pyroxene (with 40% magnesium and 60% iron). Aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase as the mineral corundum, which is α-alumina. Aluminum oxide also exists in many other phases; each has a unique crystal structure and properties. In our model we applied cubic γ-Al 2 O 3 . Enstatite is the magnesiumrich end-member of the pyroxene silicate mineral series enstatite (MgSiO 3 ) -ferrosilite (FeSiO 3 ). Forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4 ) is the magnesium-rich end-member of the olivine solid solution series. It is isomorphous with the iron-rich end-member, fayalite. Besides forsterite, in our model we also applied olivine with 50% magnesium and 50% iron. The pyroxenes are a group of minerals with the general formula XY(Si,Al) 2 O <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . The group has 20 endmembers and one of the end-members is enstatite (see above). Pyroxenes are, however, usually isomorphous mixtures of some end-members. Therefore, in our model we also applied a pyroxene with 40% magnesium and 60% iron. Calculating the optical properties (i.e., opacities and phase functions, see below) of the dust grains composed of a mineral is relatively difficult and requires a lot of computing time. That is why <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Budaj et al. (2015)</ref> prepared tables of phase functions, opacities, albedos, equilibrium temperatures and radiative accelerations of dust grains in exoplanet systems. The tables cover the wavelength range of 0.2 to 500 microns and 21 particle radii from 0.01 to 100 microns for several species. Their assumptions include spherical grain shape, Deirmendjian particle size distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deirmendjian 1964)</ref> and Mie theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Budaj et al. (2015)</ref> used a widely available Mie scattering code CALLBH-MIE 2 , which calls iteratively the Mie scattering subroutine BH-MIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bohren &amp; Huffman 1983)</ref>. The tables are freely available on the web 3 and are applicable for our purposes in the code SHELLSPEC. From these tables we selected opacities and phase functions for γ-alumina, enstatite, forsterite, olivine (with 50% magnesium and 50% iron) and pyroxene (with 40% magnesium and 60% iron). In our model we applied the following particle radii: 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micron.</p><p>Dust can absorb the impinging radiation and convert it directly into heating of the grains. This process is called absorption or true absorption and it is quantified by the absorption opacity. Dust can also scatter radiation in a process called scattering without being heated. This process is quantified by the scattering opacity. The sum of the absorption opacity and the scattering opacity is the total opacity (or simply the opacity). Furthermore, scattering can be highly asymmetric, a property that is described by means of the phase function, which depends on the scattering angle (the deflection angle from the original direction of the impinging radiation). The most prominent feature is a strong forward scattering, when the scattering angle is nearly zero. Brightenings on the light curve of KIC 12557548b are also caused by the forward scattering on dust particles in the tail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj 2013</ref>). We also have to take into account the fact that from the viewpoint of dust particles the parent star has a non- <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The code is available on the web-page https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/geoffc/Mie/bhmie-f/callbhmie.fnegligible angular dimension on the sky. Dust particles of KOI 2700b in the distance of a = 3.363R ⊙ from the parent star view this star as a disk with an angular diameter of about 19.4 deg. The true dimension of this star is R s = 0.57R ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. 2014</ref>). To take this effect into account we have to split the stellar disk into elementary surfaces and integrate the phase function over the disk. We calculated phase functions with a very fine step in the interval <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref> deg, because of the strong forward scattering and, consequently, the disk averaged phase function with a very fine step near the edge of the stellar disk. For this purpose we applied the software DISKAVER 4 . It assumes a quadratic limb darkening of the stellar surface:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I ν = I ν (0)[1 − u 1 (1 − cos θ) − u 2 (1 − cos θ) 2 ],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where <ref type="formula">I</ref>  An illustration of such phase functions, which take into account the finite dimension of the source of light, is depicted in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>. Corresponding phase functions without taking into account the finite dimension of the source of light are also shown. These exhibit a strong peak near phase angle zero, which is the so-called forward-scattering peak. Larger particles and/or shorter wavelengths tend to have a stronger and narrower forward-scattering peak than smaller particles and/or longer wavelengths. Therefore, taking into account the finite dimension of the source of light is important mainly for larger particles and/or shorter wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model and light-curve modeling</head><p>The phased and averaged transit light curve of the exoplanet KOI 2700b <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4</ref>) was in principle modeled using the radiativetransfer code SHELLSPEC 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Budaj &amp; Richards 2004</ref>  For our purpose we used an optional object in the form of a ring, which we subsequently modified. From the transit shape we can conclude that transits are caused primarily by the comet-like tail, and not by the solid body of the planet. We can model such a comet-like tail as part of a ring with a non-negligible thickness around a central star. Therefore during our calculations we assumed a spherical and limb-darkened central star (using the coefficients u 1 = 0.622 and u 2 = 0.113 from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>), with a radius of R s = 0.57R ⊙ , mass of M s = 0.632M ⊙ and effective temperature of T eff = 4433 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. 2014</ref>), located in the geometrical center of our ring. We modeled the comet-like tail as part of a ring with a radius of a = 3.363R ⊙ . Its geometrical cross-section is monotonically enlarging from the planet to the end of the ring, which is located at 60 deg behind the planet. At this point the ring is truncated. In our calculations we applied the same length of the tail as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>, because the transit duration in phase units is very similar in both cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5)</ref>. The cross-section of the ring C and dust density along the ring ρ are allowed to change with the angle t [rad]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ(t) = ρ(0) C(0) C(t) (|t − t(0)|/π + 1) A1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>or</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ρ(t) = ρ(0) C(0) C(t) e (|t−t(0)|A2)/π ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>end. These values are also in agreement with the escape velocity from a Mercury-sized small planet (a few km.s −1 ). We note that in certain cases the chosen cross-section of the tail can affect the results about the grain size; for example, at higher inclinations (i &lt; 78 deg) large amounts of dust will not transit the parent star and this can affect the identification of the typical particle radii of the tail (described in Sect. 5.2). However, as we described in Sect. 5.1, we obtained i in the range [85.1, 88.6] deg (the average value is i = 87.06 deg), that is, the latter situation is not the case here. The ring was located in the orbital plane of the planet. On the other hand, based on the transit depth, we can assume that there is still ample room for a contribution to the light curve from the solid body of the planet. Therefore, we also included the solid body of the planet in the model, defined as a dark, non-transparent sphere and located at the beginning of the ring. The dimension of the planet was parametrized as R p /R s (ratio of the radii). Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref> present the formal upper limit of the planet radius of R p ≤ 1.06R ⊕ (2σ limit), which roughly corresponds to R p /R s ≤ 0.017, based on the theory of the thermal wind and planet evaporation (Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2013) we can expect that the planet itself must be Mercury-sized, or smaller than Mercury, which corresponds to R p /R s ≤ 0.006.</p><p>In For the modeling process we generated and used an iterative procedure, which applied the SHELLSPEC code as a subroutine, and searched for the best fit parameters. Four free parameters were adjusted simultaneously during the fitting procedure -the orbital inclination angle i [deg], the dust density at the beginning of the ring ρ(0) [g.cm −3 ], the ratio of the radii R p /R s , and the density exponent A2. Since model light curves calculated using A1 and A2 differed only slightly, we decided to use the density exponent A2 during the modeling, because it explains the dust destruction in the tail better than A1. One more free parameter -the transit midpoint phase shift of the synthetic light curve with respect to the observed light curve (∆ϕ 0 ) -was adjusted only before the modeling process and then was kept fixed to its best value. This parameter reflects the unknown midtransit time of the planet. Every synthetic light curve was shifted in phase by ∆ϕ 0 = −0.235. The advantage of this treatment is that it saves computing time; on the other hand we cannot exclude the possibility that uncertainties on the resulting parameters are underestimated. We prepared a parameter space with a certain stepping, composed from the above-mentioned four free parameters and limited based on the previous step-wise test calculations as follows. The parameter i: <ref type="bibr">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr">80]</ref> deg; the parameter ρ <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(0)</ref> . During the fitting procedure all combinations of free parameters were examined and the observed light curve was compared with the corresponding model light curve. A formal, quantitative goodnessof-fit was measured via determination of reduced χ 2 (χ 2 red ). The best fit corresponds to the minimum value of χ 2 red . During the next iteration we reduced the range of the parameters and at the same time we used a finer stepping in the parameter space to fit the observed transit light curve better. As the first iteration we used the above-mentioned range of the parameters and the stepping as follows. The parameter i: 2.0 deg; the parameter ρ(0): 0.0100 ×10 −15 g.cm −3 ; the parameter R p /R s : 0.004; and the parameter A2: 4.0. We selected the best value of a given parameter, found in the previous iteration, as a median ( ˜ x par ) value of the new parameter range. As the second iteration we used the following range/stepping of the parameters: ˜ x i ± 2.0, stepping 1.0 deg; ˜ x ρ(0) ± 0.0100 ×10 −15 , stepping 0.0010 ×10 −15 g.cm −3 ; ˜ x R p /R s ± 0.004, stepping 0.002; and˜xand˜ and˜x A2 ± 4.0, stepping 1.0 and during the last (third) iteration, similarly: ˜ x i ± 1.0, stepping 1.0 deg; ˜ x ρ(0) ± 0.0010 ×10 −15 , stepping 0.0001 ×10 −15 g.cm −3 ; ˜ x R p /R s ± 0.002, stepping 0.001; and˜xand˜ and˜x A2 ± 1.0, stepping 0.5. To obtain final results we applied these three iterations. In this way we reduced the computing time.</p><p>To derive uncertainties on the resulting parameters we applied Monte Carlo simulations. First, we generated an artificial dataset with the same standard deviation as the observed data. Then, the artificial data were fitted with a model light curve and the best fit parameters were determined. The range of the parameters and the stepping corresponded to the range and stepping used in the last (i.e., in the 3rd) iteration (see the end of the previous paragraph). We note that the full procedure is not needed in this case, since the artificial data differ only slightly from the observed data. This process was repeated 100 times and, subsequently, to estimate the uncertainty in the given parameter the standard deviation was calculated.</p><p>We executed 15 joint fitting procedures -one for each combination of species and dust particle size. When describing our main results in Sect. 5 we use the average value (without uncertainties) and the obtained range of the given parameter (including uncertainties). For individual values of parameters we refer the reader to Table 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Inclination of the tail</head><p>The orbital inclination angle i is a very important system parameter. We first assumed that the orbital plane of the exoplanet and its tail have an inclination of i = 90 deg with respect to the plane of the sky. Our expectations, however, were not confirmed. During the modeling process it turned out that the transit of KOI 2700b is not edge-on, but based on our models, the orbital inclination angle is very probably close to the value of i = 87 deg. We obtained i in the range [85.1, 88.6] deg 7 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for individual values). We obtained the value of i ≈ 88 deg in the cases of 0.1-micron γ-alumina grains, 1-micron forsterite grains Z.

Similarly, we obtained a value of i ≈ 86 deg in the cases of 0.01-micron γ-alumina grains and 1-micron pyroxene grains. In other cases we obtained for this parameter the value of i ≈ 87 deg. The resulting parameter values are, however, in agreement within a 1σ limit (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Properties of the dust</head><p>A decrease in dust density was detected in the comet-like tail of KIC 12557548b by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>. This feature of the tail is described by the density exponent A1 or A2 (see Eqs. 3 and 4). As mentioned in Sect. 4.2, for our purposes we used the density exponent A2. It is one of the most important free parameters in our model. We first assumed that the dust density decreases along the tail of KOI 2700b in a similar manner to KIC 12557548b, with the exponent −20 or −25. Based on our fitting procedure, however, we obtained A2 in the range <ref type="bibr">[−6.5, −8.2]</ref> (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for individual values). The average value of the parameter is A2 = −7.13. In the case of 1-micron γ-alumina grains the resulting parameter value was A2 ≈ −8.0, and in the cases of 1-micron enstatite grains and 1-micron forsterite grains we obtained A2 ≈ −7.5. For other dust particle sizes and species we obtained A2 ≈ −7.0 as a resulting parameter value. We note that the range of values found for the parameter A2 is in good agreement with the exponential decay factor value (S ), found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. Ignoring the C(t) dependence of the dust density in the tail, the density exponent A2 can be converted to the exponential decay factor as S = −A2/π; hence the range of A2 values ( <ref type="bibr">[−6.5, −8.2]</ref>; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for individual values) corresponds to S of about [2.1, 2.6]. The exponential decay factor value, found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>, is S = 2.4 ± 1.0.</p><p>The density exponent A2 needs a certain density at the beginning of the ring ρ(0) to fit the transit depth properly at each chemical composition and dust particle size. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> we present the resulting values for this free parameter and also the resulting values for the derived parameter τ max , which is the highest optical depth through the tail in front of the star, and which follows from ρ(0). These values were derived based on a tail model with a cross-section of 0.05×0.05R ⊙ at the beginning and 0.09×0.09R ⊙ at its end. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>  Based on modeling of the transit we cannot determine the chemical composition of the dust ejected by KOI 2700b. That is why we applied selected species, according to van <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lieshout et al. (2014)</ref>. Theoretically, the situation in the case of particle sizes is slightly better. We can estimate the typical particle size in the dust tail based on part of the light curve of KOI 2700b, where a pre-transit brightening is expected or possible, as was done at KIC 12557548b by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>. This brightening is caused by forward scattering on dust particles in the tail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. 2012</ref>; Budaj 2013) and the forward scattering is sensitive to the dust particle size <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8)</ref>. Therefore, we can compare our model light curves with observations, especially in phases between 0.40 and 0.45, where the pre-transit brightening was detected at KIC 12557548b (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>), and search for the particle size, which satisfies the observed light curve of KOI 2700b better. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures  9 -11</ref> show that this part of the model light curve is sensitive to the dust particle size, however, differences between the model pre-transit brightenings are not enough to draw any satisfactory   conclusions on the typical grain size in the dust tail. Since every model pre-transit brightening satisfies the observations, we cannot select a model with appropriate grain size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">The dimension of the planet solid body</head><p>The dimension of the solid body of KOI 2700b was a key point in our model. It was parametrized using the following free parameter: the ratio of the radii (R p /R s ). Based on the results of Rappaport et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2014)</ref>, we selected the value of R p /R s = 0.017 as an upper limit for this free parameter. However, as these authors pointed out, the corresponding value, R p = 1.06R ⊕ , needs to be improved. Therefore, we strongly expected that the planet radius would be smaller, R p /R s ∼ 0.006, which corresponds to a Mercury-sized planet. The parameter value R p /R s ≤ 0.006 is also predicted by the theory of the thermal wind and planet evaporation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2013</ref>). The resulting parameter values confirmed our expectations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows that in the cases of 1-micron γ-alumina, enstatite, and forsterite grains, we obtained R p /R s ≈ 0.007, in the cases of 0.01-micron enstatite and forsterite grains we obtained R p /R s ≈ 0.008, and in other cases the resulting parameter value was 0.009. The average value of the parameter is R p /R s = 0.008 (R p = 0.497R ⊕ , or 3172 km). We obtained R p /R s in the range [0.0, 0.014] (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Ta- ble 1</ref> for individual values), hence we can consider the value of R p /R s = 0.014, which corresponds to R p = 0.871R ⊕ (or 5551 km), as an upper limit on the radius of the planet solid body of KOI 2700b. The upper limit of the planet radius is in agreement with the theory of the thermal wind and planet evaporation and is also derived with higher accuracy than the result found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. A comparison of the observed light curve with the solid-body transit light curve of KOI 2700b is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>. For a comparison, we also plotted the transit light curve of an Earth-size and a Mercury-size planet. The light curves were modeled using the software JKTEBOP 8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Southworth et al. 2004</ref>) and its task No. 2. We applied i = 87 deg (according to the average of listed values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>) and in the case of KOI 2700b the value of R p /R s = 0.008 (the average value of the parameter) and R p /R s = 0.014 (the upper limit of the planet radius).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Comparison with KIC 12557548b</head><p>Since the first exoplanet with a comet-like tail, KIC 12557548b, was analyzed similarly by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>, it is very interesting to compare his results with the results obtained in this work. Unfortunately, we cannot compare the typical grain size of the tail, which we could not derive in the case of KOI 2700b, and the dimension of the planet solid body, which was not included in the model of KIC 12557548b, used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>. On the other hand, an upper limit on the radius of the planet solid body of KIC 12557548b was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref> and by van <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Werkhoven et al. (2014)</ref>, which we can use for our comparison. Similarly, the mass-loss rate from KIC 12557548b was calculated, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref>. KOI 2700b and KIC 12557548b have very similar lightcurve shape with some peculiarities. Mainly, the light curve displays a sharp ingress, followed by a short sharp egress and a long Article number, page 9 of 11 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. KOI2700b The tails are 60 deg long in both models, that is, in this work and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Budaj (2013)</ref>. The cut-off at this distance from the planet is an assumption of the model. The dust density in the tail decreases in both cases with the distance from the planet; however, these density decreasings are not similar. The dust density in the tail of KIC 12557548b decreases rapidly along the tail, which is well defined by the density exponent A2 ≈ −20 or A2 ≈ −25. This may produce the week, but still observable posttransit brightening at KIC 12557548b. In comparison with this planet, KOI 2700b exhibits a relatively low dust density decreasing in its tail, which is defined by the density exponent A2 ≈ −7. Therefore, in this case we cannot expect any post-transit brightening.</p><p>KOI 2700b and KIC 12557548b may have a planet solid body radius less than ∼ 1R ⊕ . Since we obtained R p /R s in the range [0.0, 0.014] (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for individual values), we can consider the value of R p /R s = 0.014, which corresponds to R p = 0.871R ⊕ , or 5551 km, as an upper limit of the planet radius of KOI 2700b. In comparison with KOI 2700b, KIC 12557548b may have a slightly bigger radius as well, up to ∼ 1R ⊕ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref> present the value of R p = 1.15R ⊕ and van <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Werkhoven et al. (2014)</ref> the value of R p = 0.72R ⊕ as an upper limit for the radius of the planet solid body of KIC 12557548b, which corresponds to about 7300 km and 4600 km, respectively.</p><p>Although both planets are disintegrating and losing material, neither KOI 2700b nor KIC 12557548b show any evidence of a significant long-term orbital period variability. This is in agreement with the prediction, presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang (2013)</ref>, which suggests that disintegrating planets undergo negligible orbital period variations due to the evaporation process. A significant variability is observable in the light-curve shape of the planets. In the case of KIC 12557548b there is a short-term periodic variability in the transit core <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>) and a long-term periodic variability in the egress (Budaj 2013). KOI 2700b exhibits only a long-term variability in the transit core, which may be periodic as well.</p><p>Based on our estimations, the mass-loss rate from KOI 2700b may be from 5.05 × 10 7 to 4.41 × 10 15 g.s −1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Our main scientific goal was to verify the disintegrating-planet scenario of KOI 2700b by modeling its light curve and put constraints on various tail and planet properties. The orbital period of the planet was improved based on the Kepler data from quarters 1 -17. We obtained the value of P orb = 0.9100259(15) days, which is in good agreement with the orbital period presented by the discoverers. We also searched for long-term orbital period changes of KOI 2700b, however, in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang (2013)</ref>, we found no significant evidence. We can confirm the decrease in transit depth of the exoplanet found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the transit depth varies periodically over a long-term time span longer than the available Kepler quarters.</p><p>We obtained the phase-folded and binned transit light curve of KOI 2700b, which we iteratively modeled using the radiativetransfer code SHELLSPEC. Mie absorption and scattering on spherical dust grains with realistic dust opacities, phase functions, and finite radius of the source of the scattered light were taken into account. During the modeling we applied selected species (γ-alumina, enstatite, forsterite, olivine with 50% magnesium and 50% iron and pyroxene with 40% magnesium and 60% iron) and dust particle sizes (0.01, 0.1 and 1 micron in radii). We executed 15 joint fitting procedures -one for each combination of species and dust particle size. We modeled the comet-like tail as part of a ring around the parent star. The geometrical cross-section of the ring is monotonically enlarging from the planet to the end of the ring. Since this modified ring model of the tail satisfies the observations well, we confirm the disintegrating-planet scenario of KOI 2700b.</p><p>Furthermore, via modeling, we derived some interesting features of KOI 2700b and its comet-like tail. We first assumed that the orbital plane of the exoplanet and its tail had an inclination of i = 90 deg with respect to the plane of the sky, however it turns out that the orbital plane of the planet is not edge-on, but the orbital inclination angle is very probably close to the value of i = 87 deg. We obtained i in the range [85.1, 88.6] deg. KOI 2700b exhibits a relatively low dust density decreasing in its tail, which is defined by the density exponent A2 ≈ −7. During our modeling process, we obtained this parameter in the range <ref type="bibr">[−6.5, −8.2]</ref>, which is in good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al. (2014)</ref>. We also derived the dust density at the beginning of the ring (ρ(0)) and the highest optical depth through the tail in front of the star (τ max ), based on a tail model with a crosssection of 0.05 × 0.05R ⊙ at the beginning and 0.09 × 0.09R ⊙ at its end. The average values of the parameters are ρ(0) = 0.1667 × 10 −15 g.cm −3 and τ max = 5.24 × 10 −3 , and we obtained these parameters in the range [0.0151, 0.3333] × 10 −15 g.cm −3 and [4.28, 7.43] × 10 −3 , respectively. Since there is still ample room for a contribution to the light curve from the solid body of the planet, we also included it in the model. Our average value for the dimension of the planet is R p /R s = 0.008 (R p = 0.497R ⊕ , or 3172 km). Since we obtained this parameter in the range [0.0, 0.014], we can consider the value of R p /R s = 0.014, which corresponds to R p = 0.871R ⊕ (or 5551 km), as an upper limit on the radius of the planet solid body of KOI 2700b. The upper limit of the planet radius is in agreement with the theory of the thermal wind and planet evaporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2013)</ref> and is also derived with higher accuracy than the result found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport et al.

The code enables the user to look on the grid from different points of view and to calculate the cor- responding flux. The flux is always calculated in the observer's line of sight. The orbital inclination angle i corresponds the in- clination of the intrinsic rotation axis of the model to the line of sight. At each point of view we calculated the final flux as (s + r)/s = f , where s means modeling the flux from the par- ent star, s + r means modeling the parent star with the ring and planet, and f is the final and normalized flux from the system. In this way we also eliminated fluctuations due to the grid structure of objects in our model. To speed up the computation process, we reduced the number of points by selecting the near-transit part of the light curve. We calculated 33 artificial data points per synthetic light curve, between phases 0.25 and 0.75, in the same phases as per the observed light curve. This cropping of the syn- thetic light curve is justified, since we are interested only in the near-transit region. The synthetic light curves were subsequently convolved with a box-car with a width of 30 minutes, simulating the integration time of the Kepler long cadence exposure. Con- volved light curves were used for comparison with the observed light curve.</figDesc></figure>

smooth egress. The light curve of KIC 12557548b shows a rel-
atively significant pre-transit brightening as well, which in the 
light curve of KOI 2700b is not significant or even present at all. 
A relatively weak post-transit brightening is visible only in the 
light curve of KIC 12557548b. The transit duration in phase units 
is also very similar. The transits of the planets are very probably 
not edge-on. It seems that KOI 2700b has an orbital inclination 
angle of i ≈ 87 deg, while KIC 12557548b has i ≈ 82 deg. On 
the other hand, the transit depth of the planets is very different, 
KOI 2700b has an average transit depth about ten times shal-
lower. Due to the similar light curves, the modified ring model 
of the tail fits the observations in both cases well.

			<note place="foot">where ρ(0), C(0), and t(0) are the dust density, cross-section, and phase angle of view at the beginning of the ring and A1, A2 are the density exponents to model the dust destruction in the tail. We can see that there is a strong degeneracy between the crosssection and the dust density at a certain phase angle. In general, if we increase the cross-section and we want to obtain an appropriate model of the observed light curve, the result is that we need to decrease the dust density. There is a degeneracy relation Cρ = const. Since the dimension of the dust tail of KOI 2700b is unknown, we arbitrarily defined a geometrical cross-section of the tail, which was preferable for our computation process (in terms of the grid density, grid dimension, and computing time). Therefore, in our calculations we assumed a dust tail with a crosssection of 0.05 × 0.05R ⊙ at the beginning and 0.09 × 0.09R ⊙ at its Article number, page 5 of 11</note>
