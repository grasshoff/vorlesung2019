			<abstract>
				<p>The discovery of the exoplanet Proxima b highlights the potential for the coming generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) to characterize terrestrial-potentially habitable-planets orbiting nearby stars with direct imaging. This will require continued development and implementation of optimized adaptive optics systems feeding coronagraphs on the GSMTs. Such development should proceed with an understanding of the fundamental limits imposed by atmospheric turbulence. Here we seek to address this question with a semi-analytic framework for calculating the post-coronagraph contrast in a closed-loop AO system. We do this starting with the temporal power spectra of the Fourier basis calculated assuming frozen flow turbulence, and then apply closed-loop transfer functions. We include the benefits of a simple predictive controller, which we show could provide over a factor of 1400 gain in raw PSF contrast at 1 Î»/D on bright stars, and more than a factor of 30 gain on an I = 7.5 mag star such as Proxima. More sophisticated predictive control can be expected to improve this even further. Assuming a photon noise limited observing technique such as High Dispersion Coronagraphy, these gains in raw contrast will decrease integration times by the same large factors. Predictive control of atmospheric turbulence should therefore be seen as one of the key technologies which will enable ground-based telescopes to characterize terrrestrial planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The quest to characterize Earth-like planets was brought into sharp focus by the discovery of a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting the nearest star, Proxima Centauri. 1 With a maximum projected separation of around 36 mas, Proxima b could in principle be characterized with current generation instruments, 2 and will be readily studied with next generation giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) such as the 25 m Giant Magelllan Telescope (GMT), 30 m Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), and 39 m Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Indeed, such observations are recognized as one of the key science goals of the GSMTs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and Proxima b will not be the only target. Results from the Kepler mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> have made it clear that small planets occur frequently around low-mass stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In addition to Proxima b, the recent discoveries of Ross 128 b, 8 LHS 1140 b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and the seven terrestrial planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 10 likewise point to a high frequency of terrestrial planets in low-mass star systems near the Earth.</p><p>While some nearby planets, such as those orbiting TRAPPIST-1 and LHS 1140 b, will be amenable to atmospheric characterization with the transit spectroscopy technique, the low a priori transit probability means that the majority of nearby planets will have to be characterized with resolved direct imaging. Low-mass stars present unique challenges and opportunities. With lower stellar luminosity, planets with the same equilibrium temperature occur closer to the star. This results in a significant improvement in contrast between the planet and the star, but also results in needing large diameter telescopes to resolve planets at such small separations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> This places such observations in the realm of ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics (AO) and coronagraphs.</p><p>The analysis presented here is motivated by the question: what are the fundamental limits of ground-based high-contrast coronagraphic imaging of terrestrial exoplanets? Here we attack one part of this complicated issue: finding the fundamental limit imposed on coronagraphic contrast by residual atmospheric turbulence behind a closed-loop AO control system.</p><p>Much previous work has been done modeling AO performance in the spatial-frequency domain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> This technique treats the AO system as a spatial filter, casting time and temporalfrequency domain processes (such as measurement noise and control filtering) into the the spatial domain as filters, and analyzing the effect of the combined AO system on the input turbulence power spectral density (PSD).</p><p>The previous analytic treatment of AO performance most closely related to our treatment here is <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guyon (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Using the correspondence between Fourier modes and speckle amplitude, coupled with straightforward scaling from the input PSD, a derivation of the post-coronagraph contrast and its dependence on various AO system parameters was developed. The resulting scaling laws are readily applicable to system design and analysis, and have proven to be useful in placing results from RV and transit surveys in context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> The goal of this study is to present a way to analyze the achievable contrast in a closed-loop AO system, including both current generation telescopes and future giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs). To do this we develop a semi-analytic framework in the temporal frequency domain. That is, we explicitly calculate temporal PSDs rather than using the spatial-filtering approach. At least in the frozen-flow regime, these should produce nearly identical results. Our exploration of this method was motivated by the fact that actual AO systems must be optimized and controlled in the time and temporal-frequency domains.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we state our entering assumptions. In Section 3 we lay out our notation and physical description of the problem, including the statistics of the Fourier basis. In Section 4 we derive a coronagraph model and deal with a subtle detail depending on how residual variance is calculated. In Section 5 we calculate the temporal PSDs of Fourier modes assuming von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n turbulence in frozen flow. In Section 6 we review the standard model of AO control with optimal gains, and present a predictive controller based on the Linear Prediction formalism. Then, in Section 7 we use the previous results to predict the post-coronagraph contrasts for 6.5 m and 25.4 m telescopes for a range of guide star magnitudes, and compare optimal integrator and linear predictive controllers. We discuss our results in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Assumptions</head><p>This analysis is concerned with AO in the "extreme" regime: high actuator counts (â¼2000 on a 6.5 m aperture, â¼21,000 on a 25.4 m), and high loop speeds (â¼2000 Hz or more). Furthermore, we are mainly interested in the coronagraphic raw contrast, that is the ratio of the intensity of the PSF at some separation from the star, to the intensity at the peak of the star's image or the point spread function (PSF). Such extreme-AO (ExAO) systems are typically constructed for the purpose of high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and other narrow-angle circumstellar targets.</p><p>We do not seek to describe any particular ExAO system, nor address the details of design. Rather, our goal is to assess what can be achieved with an ideal system limited only by the reality of atmospheric turbulence. As such, or main assumptions are as follows:</p><p>1. We consider only on-axis guide stars, and neglect anisoplanatism. This is of minor concern at the small angular separations we are concerned with for exoplanet imaging.</p><p>2. Our analysis will be monochromatic. We do not consider the effects of atmospheric dispersion or chromaticity of the air index of refraction or scintillation within the wavefront sensor (WFS) band. We also assume that the WFS and science wavelengths are the same, ignoring differential chromatic effects.</p><p>3. We ignore WFS aliasing. This is an approximation, but with justification: we analyze a pyramid WFS (PyWFS), which is less susceptible to aliasing than the Shack-Hartmann WFS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Furthermore, a spatial filter 18 could be incorporated in a PyWFS essentially eliminating aliasing from concern.</p><p>4. We assume perfect knowledge of the AO system components. This means we neglect errors in calibration (e.g. WFS gain) and assume that we know the spatial and temporal transfer functions of all components.</p><p>5. We will ignore all non-Kolmogorov wavefront error sources. This means we do not consider static and non-common path errors within the coronagraph, nor do we analyze telescope error sources (e.g. vibrations). We also consider only free atmosphere turbulence, that is we do not consider dome seeing. Such error sources are ultimately important in real systems, however free atmosphere turbulence is the dominant term which must be dealt with first.</p><p>6. We will not consider changes in turbulence, e.g. changes in the wind velocity or changes in seeing.</p><p>7. We will not consider details of coronagraphic architecture. However, we do show that our idealized model is representative of real-world coronagraphs.</p><p>Thus, what follows can be taken as goal setting: we desire to know how well a coronagraph could perform if limited only by atmospheric turbulence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">The Fourier Basis</head><p>Here we develop a real-valued form of the Fourier basis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">The Wavefront in the Fourier Basis</head><p>We denote the wavefront phase as Î¦( q, t), which has units of radians.

Poyneer and Veran <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> showed that the Fourier basis can be used for analysis and synthesis, even though it is not orthogonal on an aperture.

From now on we will drop the p superscript except where it is explicitly needed.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we show the modal variance vs spatial frequency. This was calculated using numerical integration in double precision with the GNU Scientific Library (GSL 26 ) routines gsl_integration_qagiu (for the radial integral) and gsl_integration_qag (for the azimuthal integral). We found that an absolute tolerance of 10 â10 and a relative tolerance of 10 â4 gave good results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> also shows the naive result using Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. The simple estimate based on the PSD is significantly below the true variance.</p><p>One might guess that AO correction will reduce or eliminate this discrepancy. A simple way to estimate the effect of AO control on these statistics is to assume frozen flow and apply a scaling for the time-delay error. Following Guyon 15 (as modified in Appendix B) the corrected PSD is approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">P cor ( k, Î») â P Î¦ ( k) (2ÏV k) 2 Ï 2 tl , k â¤ D 2d P Î¦ ( k), k &gt; D 2d (30)</formula><p>where V is the wind speed, Ï tl is the total latency in the control system, and d is the actuator spacing projected on the aperture. We next recalculated the modal variances with the corrected PSD, using V = 10 m/s, Ï tl = 1.25 ms, and d = 13.5 cm on a D = 6.5 m aperture.</p><p>The variance with and without the aperture is also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Though the discrepancy is reduced, the simple estimate based on the PSD is still below the true variance. This means that the variance of a Fourier mode is not simply proportional to the PSD when it is sampled by the aperture.</p><p>The discrepancy is due to the aperture: there is a convolution inherent in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref> not addressed by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. We show how to address this, and discuss its implications for various coronagraph models, in Section 4 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Correlation</head><p>We next calculated the covariance of pairs of Fourier modes according to <ref type="bibr">Equation (25)</ref>. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for uncorrected von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n turbulence, and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for the corrected case. In the figure we show the covariances normalized by the modal variances, that is the correlation. There is significant correlation between various modes in the uncorrected case, but an AO system acts to suppress this. In the following section we show that this correlation between Fourier modes can be accounted for by convolving the PSF with the PSD.</p></div>

The black curves are for uncorrected turbulence, and the red curves are for a simple treatment of AO correction. The discrepancy between the solid and dashed curves is due to the convolution on the aperture, which is neglected in the simple estimate.

Now, we seek the long exposure, or expected, value of this expression. Though this appears quite intractable, we see that this will require evaluating covariances of the form &lt; h p mn h p m n &gt;. So, to proceed we make the ansatz that we can temporarily ignore the aperture as in Section 3.4.1. The effect of this assumption is that all covariances are 0, which leads directly to</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">I Î¦,mn ( r) = P Î¦ ( k mn , Î») D 2 PSF( r â k mn Î») + PSF( r + k mn Î»)<label>(38)</label></formula><p>for a single term in the sum on the first line of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref>. This is the classic result of a Fourier aberration producing a pair of symmetric speckles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> We illustrate this in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>.

This step accounts for the effect of the aperture. In the AO corrected regime, it increases the intensity by as much as 50%, explaining the discrepancies in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Now we apply the lesson of Section 3.4.2 above. If we instead use the variance calculated with Equation (28) , then we can skip the convolution and arrive directly at</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">I Î¦ ( r) = 2Ï Î» 2 |h mn | 2 PSF( r â k mn Î») + PSF( r + k mn Î») .<label>(40)</label></formula><p>This is an assertion that the the complete evaluation of Equation 37 in the long exposure limit is equivalent to the modal variance calculation on the aperture with Equation 28.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Numerical Verification</head><p>We conducted a set of numerical experiments to verify our long exposure coronagraph model, compare it to other models, and to assess its relevance to real-world coronagraphy. Five distinct model coronagraphs were considered, in each case both for phase aberrations only and with the amplitude errors included.</p><p>The first comparison coronagraph model was the so-called "perfect coronagraph". 32 In this model the complex plane wave which minimizes the energy in the pupil is subtracted, and the result is propagated to the image plane. It has been shown that analysis with the perfect coronagraph produces results which match the real-world Four Quadrant Phase Mask (4QPM) coronagraph. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> The second coronagraph model consisted of propagating the complex wavefronts using Equation (34) directly, employing the FFT. The phase and amplitude components were treated separately, then combined after taking the modulus squared.</p><p>The third coronagraph model corresponds to the measurement error and time delay limited contrast C 2 of Guyon, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> combined with the contrast from uncorrected amplitude C 1 due to atmospheric scintillation. In Appendix B we present a derivation of C 2 utilizing our present notation and generalizing it for arbitrary parameters. This method uses the residual PSD, as in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(27)</ref>, and so requires a convolution. Hence this tests the convolution solution for the discrepancy between the true variance and the simple PSD estimate highlighted above.</p><p>The fourth model consisted of directly measuring the variance of each modal coefficient. The coefficient of each mode was measured by inner product with the mean-subtracted phase and amplitude on the aperture for each randomly generated screen. In this case, the aperture is already taken into account so Equation (40) describes the results.</p><p>The final comparison coronagraph was an Apodized Pupil Lyot Complex Mask Coronagraph (APLCMC 33 ). We included this as an example of a coronagraph which can be implemented in the real world. In this case, the focal plane mask (FPM) was 1.29 Î»/D in diameter at 800 nm, with a complex transmission of -0.458. The optimum pupil apodization gave a net intensity throughput of 0.587.</p><p>We generated a series of phase screens from the von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n PSD using Fourier-space convolution of the PSD with Gaussian white noise fields. Scintillation was included by multiplying the PSD by the X and Y functions, Equation (12), resulting in phase and amplitude screens. AO correction of the phase was approximated as in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref>. We used a Fried parameter of r 0 = 0.2 m, an outer scale L 0 = 25 m, and windspeed of V = 10 m/s. The total time delay was set to 2.5 frames at 2000Hz (1.25 ms). We set telescope diameter to D = 6.5 m and actuator spacing to d = 13.5 cm (48 across), and assumed a wavelength of Î» = 800 nm. The phase screens were 2048 pixels across, and we used a circular unobstructed aperture 128 pixels across. We assumed an arbitrarily bright star so WFS measurement noise was ignored. Strehl ratio of a non-coronagraphic image with these parameters was â¼94%.</p><p>10,000 realizations of the AO corrected phase and uncorrected amplitude were generated. For each realization we applied the five comparison coronagraph models. The results for these coronagraphs are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, where we see that, in general, these various coronagraph models match the APLCMC. We note that the "perfect Coronagraph" and direct propagation using Equation (34) are nearly identical to each other. The residual-PSD+convolution analysis also matches well. So does the direct calculation of modal variance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Long-Exposure Contrast and the PSD</head><p>We can summarize the results of this section with the following points:</p><p>â¢ The post-coronagraph contrast is not simply the residual PSD, due to the effect of the aperture. This is easily addressed by an unnormalized convolution with the PSF.</p><p>â¢ If the variance is calculated with the aperture included, then the convolution is not needed.</p><p>â¢ Ideal coronagraph models are valid in the regime of ground-based, well-corrected, AO-fed coronagraphy, and are useful proxies for real-world coronagraphs.</p><p>Our result that the post-coronagraph long exposure image is a convolution of the PSF with the residual PSD is nearly identical to that developed by Herscovici-Schiller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> It is fully equivalent if one uses a position dependent PSF and includes internal aberrations, both details we neglect since we are analyzing an ideal system. The difference between this case, and the case when the aperture is included, is important when the modal variances are individually calculated as we do in the following sections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Numerical Calculation</head><p>The improper integral in Equation (46) does not in general have a simple closed-form solution, so we must calculate it numerically. In this work we used the GSL gsl_integration_qagi 4 routine. We found that a relative tolerance of 10 â4 and an absolute tolerance of 10 â10 in double precision gave good results. Though these choices noticeably extend calculation time, less demanding tolerances can produce numerically unsatisfying results. For example, modes with similar spatial frequencies should have similar total variance (integral of the PSD), but setting numerical tolerance too low can introduce occasional 50% jumps.</p><p>We also find that temporal frequency sampling is important, settling on âf = 0.1 Hz as the largest sampling that should be used in general. Larger samplings tend to also produce jumps, caused by moving on and off sharp peaks associated with individual wind-layers. If such a peak falls between two frequencies and the sampling is too coarse, the power in the peak will be missed.</p><p>We illustrate calculations of multi-layer turbulence using a seven layer turbulence model based on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) site survey at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> The parameters of this profile are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.

To estimate the PSF contrast at other wavelengths all of these results can be scaled by 1/Î» 2 . The figure shows, as expected, deeper contrasts on brighter stars. The SI controller (left hand column) exhibits the well known "wind butterfly", and we see that the gain optimization process turns off modes on fainter stars, changing the shape of the dark hole. The LP controller does not show the "wind butterfly", rather predictive control essentially eliminates it. It also results in deeper contrasts. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the PSF contrast profiles both along and across the wind direction.</p><p>The same calculations were made for the 25.4 GMT-like telescope, shown in Figures 13 and 14. The results are qualitatively similar, but show a nearly Ã10 improvement due to the larger aperture. This can be understood as the larger diameter causing the spatial-frequency sampling interval, 1/D 2 , to impose less power per Î»/D, resulting in less residual power per mode. For both the 6.5 m and the 25.4 m telescopes, the gain in contrast at small separations provided by the LP controller is remarkable. On the 6.5 m observing a 0 mag star, the LP contrast is over 200 times better at 1 Î»/D, and is nearly 10 times better for an 8th mag star. On the 25.4 m the LP contrast is over 1400 times better at 1 Î»/D on a 0 mag star, and is over 30 times better for an 8th mag star.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Predictive Control</head><p>Predictive control has been discussed in many other studies. Here we used a relatively simple form of it, rather than more sophisticated options. The LP controller provides a conceptually simple extension of the integrator controller, and provides an efficient and easy to understand method for calculating its coefficients since we know the open-loop PSD. However, it is not the most sophisticated method proposed to-date in the literature and our intent here is not to propose it as the best one.</p><p>Dessenne et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref>, 49 presented a method using a linear filter, essentially identical to the technique we used. Their method for optimizing the parameters was based on an explicit least squares   Here we compare results for the simple integrator (SI) and linear predictor (LP) controllers, for 5th, 8th, and 10th magnitude stars. As we do not address chromaticity here, the WFS and observation wavelengths are both 800 nm.  Here we compare results for the simple integrator (SI) and linear predictor (LP) controllers, for 5th, 8th, and 10th magnitude stars. Note that the color scale is x10 lower than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. As we do not address chromaticity here, the WFS and observation wavelengths are both 800 nm. minimization using past data, rather than the PSD, and allowed the coefficients a and b to differ. This technique was demonstrated on sky.</p><p>We recently presented a related predictive control strategy, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> EOFs are essentially a time-and-space KarhunenLÃ² eve basis, and this method allows for including non-WFS measurements, such as accelerometers. Filter optimization is done on past time-domain data. We found essentially the same level of improvement in simulations.</p><p>Johnson et al. 51 developed a control strategy based on predicting the wind-driven translation of turbulent layers. With simulations incorporating on-sky data from the ViLLaGEs AO system 52 they showed significant increase in Strehl on fainter stars, and predicted large gains in Strehl for larger telescopes.</p><p>Much recent work has been in the area of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers. Poyneer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> proposed a Fourier-mode by Fourier-mode optimization of a Kalman filter controller, and using end-to-end simulations showed large gains in contrast similar to what we have shown. They presented their method as a control filter much as we did here. They pointed out that any filter could be cast in the direct form as in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(59)</ref>, though it is then subject to errors due to numerical precision if actually used to implement the filter.</p><p>More broadly, the determination of optimum control filters is of great interest in the AO-related literature. In the context of AO this has been studied extensively for LQG controllers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> See also the review of various system identification strategies presented in <ref type="bibr">KulcsÃ¡r et al. 55</ref> While this paper was under review, Correia et al. presented an analysis of predictive control using the distributed Kalman filter method. 14 Their analysis employed the spatial filtering method (as opposed to our temporal frequency method), and showed post-coronagraph contrast gains for the Keck AO system at least as large as we show here.</p><p>Any of these control methods can be represented by their temporal transfer functions, and so could be included in further studies using our technique. In summary, the LP is not the only, nor the most advanced, technique we have available, but it is apparent that predictive control offers significant gains for high contrast imaging of exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Sensitivity to Frozen Flow</head><p>Our model of input turbulence was based on the frozen flow model. However, our semi-analytic method does not require frozen flow. That is, any source of the temporal PSDs could be used as input to the analysis. We could incorporate boiling, or disturbances derived from telescope models (e.g. vibrations due to wind shake). This could also be extended to assess the impact of timevariable turbulence profiles.</p><p>It should be expected that inclusion of additional sources of error will reduce projected performance. In the case of, e.g., telescope vibrations this is simply because there is more variance in the system. In the case of time-variable turbulence, i.e. changing wind and seeing, the reduced performance will result from sub-optimality of the filter coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Impact on Exoplanet Characterization</head><p>Our motivation for this study was to analyze the limits of ground-based coronagraphic exoplanet characterization, and to assess the impact that predictive control will have on it. Consider the coupling of an ExAO-fed coronagraph to a high-dispersion spectrograph, 56 a technique recently dubbed "high dispersion coronagraphy" (HDC). 57, 58 We focus on this technique because it is, in principle, photon-noise limited, meaning we do not have to consider speckle noise. Neglecting detector and background noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the HDC technique is given by 56</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">S/N = F p ât F * ât C N lines .<label>(74)</label></formula><p>Where F p is the photon rate from the planet and F * is the photon rate from the star (both in one spectral resolution element), and N lines is the number of resolved lines in the planet spectrum used for cross-correlation template matching. C is the raw PSF contrast as we have derived here. ât is the integration time needed to reach a desired S/N. This leads directly to</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">ât â âC .<label>(75)</label></formula><p>So, in terms of required integration times the potential benefits of predictive control are quite profound. Using just the relatively simple form of it considered in this study, we find that predictive control of atmospheric turbulence could make a GSMT up to 30 times more efficient at exoplanet characterization around a star as bright as Proxima Centauri, and up to 1400 times more efficient on brighter stars.</p></div>

It is written in c++, is highly parallelized, and compiles to a command line application which accepts configuration files to set up the analysis. It depends on the library available at https://github.com/jaredmales/mxlib, as well as several easily available open-source libraries. No licenses are needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We have developed a semi-analytic framework for predicting the raw PSF contrast in an AOfed coronagraphic image under closed-loop control. Instead of the usual spatial-filter analysis, we explicitly calculated temporal PSDs and analyzed AO performance in the temporal-frequency domain. Our technique takes into account closed-loop dynamics as well as a multi-layer frozenflow turbulence model. We also analyzed performance of ideal coronagraphs, showing how to account for the subtle difference between the residual PSD and the residual modal variance on an aperture. Using our model, we showed that predictive control will improve raw contrast by up to a factor of 1400 on bright stars, and by a factor of 30 on 8th magnitude stars, compared to the simple integrator control law. Assuming a photon-noise limited observation, the exposure time required to characterize an exoplanet will decrease by the same large factors. This has significant implications for the potential of the coming ground-based GSMTs to search for life outside our Solar System, and makes predictive control one of the key techniques that must be perfected for exoplanet characterization.</p></div>
