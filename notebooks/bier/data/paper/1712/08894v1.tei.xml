				<p>The fields of astronomy and astrophysics are currently engaged in an unprecedented era of discovery as recent missions have revealed thousands of exoplanets orbiting other stars. While the Kepler Space Telescope mission has enabled most of these exoplanets to be detected by identifying transiting events, exoplanets often exhibit additional photo-metric effects that can be used to improve the characterization of exo-planets. The EXONEST Exoplanetary Explorer is a Bayesian exoplanet inference engine based on nested sampling and originally designed to analyze archived Kepler Space Telescope and CoRoT (Convection Rotation et Transits planétaires) exoplanet mission data. We discuss the EXON-EST software package and describe how it accommodates plug-and-play models of exoplanet-associated photometric effects for the purpose of ex-oplanet detection, characterization and scientific hypothesis testing. The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric orbits in conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, reflected light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss our new efforts to expand the capabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects involving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXON-EST inference engine design and introduce our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST software package over to the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer, which will be a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party plug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We are currently enjoying an unprecedented era of exploration and discovery. July of 2015 saw the New Horizons probe's fly-by of Pluto and Charon, which marked the end of mankind's initial exploration of the solar system. We are now beginning to explore the neighboring star systems by discovering and characterizing their planets (exoplanets). As stated in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan, "We are navigating a voyage of unprecedented scope and ambition: seeking to discover and study planets orbiting around other stars and to explore whether they could harbor life" NASA <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>. To date, we have identified 4496 exoplanet candidates of which 3502 are confirmed planets in over 1648 star systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Caltech (2017)</ref>.</p><p>One of the most successful missions to date is the Kepler Space Telescope (Kepler), which was designed to monitor the light intensity (photometry) from approximately 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Borucki et al. (2010)</ref>. While the characterization of exoplanets in terms of the chemistry and the detection of life will require a serious commitment to spectroscopic studies, photometry will continue to play an important role in exoplanet detection and characterization. Future surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ricker et al. (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Placek et al.

We are currently focused on porting and expanding the MATLABbased EXONEST software package into the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer software package, which will accommodate multiple planet systems, three-body and multi-body orbital mechanics, as well as more subtle photometric effects. The Exoplanetary Explorer will be a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party plug-andplay models of exoplanet-related photometric effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">EXONEST</head><p>The EXONEST software package <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) was originally developed as a part of Ben Placek's Ph.D. thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Placek et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Placek (2014)</ref>. Written in MATLAB, EXONEST consists of a core set of stellar and planetary models, a nested sampling-based Bayesian inference engine that can utilize the original nested sampling algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Skilling (2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Skilling ( , 2006</ref>); <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sivia and Skilling (2006)</ref>, the MultiNest variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Feroz et al.

EXONEST can also accept a set of plug-and-play models, which consist of orbital models, instrument likelihood functions, transit models, a set of photometric models and any additional user-defined models. This is currently implemented by modifying the code by calling one or more subroutines.

We will then conclude by discussing the Bayesian inference engine and the need for improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Orbital Models</head><p>EXONEST incorporates an efficient orbit integrator that can accommodate both circular and elliptical orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brown (2009)</ref>, known as Keplerian orbits, producing both the star-planet distance r(t) and the orbital phase θ(t) as a function of time. The current implementation of EXONEST is designed to accommodate one exoplanet per system so that only one period of the orbit need be integrated. The data are phase-wrapped to decrease computation time. The planet moves on an elliptical orbit with the star located at one focus. The semimajor axis, a, of the ellipse is used to characterize the star-planet distance. The argument of the periastron, ω, is the angle describing how the periastron (point of closest approach) is rotated with respect to the observer. The true anomaly, ν, describes the position of the planet along the orbit in the frame of the host star with the origin at the periastron. (B) The angle θ(t) indicates the orbital phase, which is defined as the angle between the planet-star vector and the planet-Earth vector.</p><p>The basic anatomy of a Keplerian orbit is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The star is situated at the focus of the elliptical orbit. The periastron (point of closest approach) may be rotated by an angle ω, which is called the argument of the periastron, and the position of the planet along the orbit is designated by the angle from periastron, ν, which is called the true anomaly. The length of the semimajor axis, a, is used to characterize the star-planet distance, r(t), which varies as a function of the true anomaly according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r(t) = a(1 − e 2 ) 1 + e cos (ν(t)) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where e is the eccentricity of the orbit. The upcoming re-write of the EXONEST code will accommodate multiple exoplanets in different orbits. This is accomplished by integrating a single period of each exoplanet orbit and labeling the time series of the data in terms of the orbital phase of each orbit.</p><p>A full three-body orbital model has been implemented for EXONEST. The model can handle cases where the planets do or do not orbit in a common plane. Despite its utility, the model is computationally expensive as the initial conditions of each planet must be fully parameterized, thus significantly increasing the number of parameters to be estimated. In addition, orbits in three-body situations are, in general, not periodic. Unlike two-body periodic elliptical (Keplerian) orbits, which need only be integrated over a single period to make predictions for the entire dataset, three-body orbits must be integrated over the entire length of the dataset, dramatically increasing the computations necessary to generate the predicted photometric flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Photometric Effects</head><p>In this section, we consider the main photometric effects that are detectable with instruments exhibiting precision ranging from 10 parts per million to 30 parts per million. These photometric effects include both planetary components and stellar components. We will begin with the planetary components by discussing transits, which produce relatively large photometric signals. This is followed by a discussion of reflected light, thermal emissions, refracted light, and atmospheric effects. We then conclude with the stellar components, which consist of Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the recorded data and light curve fit from the exoplanet HAT-P-7b <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. (2009)</ref>. The primary and secondary eclipses are clearly seen at orbital phase zero days and 1.1 days, respectively. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>, planetary flux variations, such as reflected light, are evident in the sinusoidally-varying flux and in the presence of the secondary eclipse as the planet passes behind the host star. The fact that the flux during the secondary eclipse dips below the baseline (red line) indicates that the planet is also emitting a great deal of thermal radiation, which is hidden as the planet passes behind the host star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Transits and Eclipses</head><p>The most prominent photometric effect is known as the transit or primary transit, which occurs when the planet passes in front of the host star blocking a fraction of the starlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Seager and Mallěn-Ornelas (2003)</ref>. The primary transit of the exoplanet HAT-P-7b can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> at an orbital phase of zero days and again at 2.2 days, which is its orbital period. The bottoms of the primary transits are typically rounded because the light emitted by the star is not uniform across the stellar disk, but is darker near the limbs as one is looking through the cooler upper regions of the photosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mandel and Agol (2002)</ref>. This effect, known as limb darkening, is illustrated by the coloration of the stars on the left side of <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>,B. The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the planet and star:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Rp 2 RS 2 ,</formula><p>where Rp is the radius of the planet and RS is the radius of the star. Transits are relatively rare since the planet must pass between the stellar disk and the observer. Borucki and Summers found the probability that a distant observer could witness an exoplanetary transit to be R S a Borucki and Summers <ref type="bibr">(1984)</ref>. This expression was found by considering the solid angle subtended by the exoplanet's shadow in a circular orbit. Here, we consider eccentric orbits with eccentricity e, and more-or-less follow the derivation by Barnes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes (2007)</ref>, taking care to rigorously treat the The plot in (C) illustrates the residual, which is the difference between the data and the model. The lack of obvious structure in the residual indicates that most of the effects have been well modeled.</p><p>probability distribution associated with the true anomaly, the argument of the periastron and the inclination.</p><p>To find the probability of a transit, we first consider circular orbits and work out the prior probability of observing a planet at a given angular position defined by the true anomaly and the inclination, (ν, i). It is expected that there is no preferred orientation for the inclination of a planet's orbital plane. Moreover, for a circular orbit, the planet orbits at a constant speed so that the prior probability of the true anomaly is also constant. As a result, the joint prior probability is constant, P r(ν, i|I) = 1 C , where it should be noted that in our expressions for the probability, P r, we adopt the convention of Jaynes Jaynes (2003) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sivia and Skilling Sivia and Skilling (2006)</ref> in which all probabilities are written as being conditional on all of the prior information I about the problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 = π 0 di sin (i) 2π 0 P r(ν, i|I) dν = 1 C π 0 di sin (i) 2π 0 dν = 2π C π 0 di sin (i) = 4π C<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A B <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The range of geometries of a planet illuminated by a star. (A) A planet orbits an average star at a great distance. The star's rays are more or less parallel, so that one-half of the planet is in illuminated daylight and the other half is in night. (B) A planet in a close-in orbit around a giant star is more than 50% illuminated with a full daylight zone, a penumbral zone and a night zone.</p><p>so that: P r(ν, i|I) = 1 4π .</p><p>In the case of eccentric orbits, one must also consider the argument of the periastron ω since:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P r(ν|I) = 2π 0 dω P r(ν, ω|I) = 2π 0 dω P r(ν|ω, I)P r(ω|I),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and the speed of the planet changes as it orbits so that the probability density of finding the planet at a true anomaly of ν varies with ν in an elliptical orbit: P r(ν|ω, I) = P r(ν |ω, I) where ν = ν. Consider a change in the viewing angle by φ, so that ν → ν = ν + φ and ω → ω = ω + φ. It is then clear that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P r(ν|ω, I) = P r(ν |ω , I).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Moreover, since:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P r(ω|I) = P r(ω |I) = 1 2π ,</formula><p>and since P r(ν|ω, I) is periodic, the two integrals over a single period:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P r(ν|I) = 2π 0 dω P r(ν|ω, I) P r(ω|I)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P r(ν |I) = 2π+φ</formula><p>φ dω P r(ν |ω , I) P r(ω |I)</p><p>are equal so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P r(ν|I) = P r(ν |I) = P r(ν + φ|I)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>for arbitrary angle φ. This implies that P r(ν|I) is constant so that (3) is generally true with:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P r(ν, i|I) = 1 4π (9)</formula><p>for both circular and elliptical orbits. The planet will be observed as transiting only for inclinations between imin ≤ i ≤ imax where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">imin = cos −1 + RS r and imax = cos −1 − RS r ,</formula><p>and r is the star-planet distance. Therefore, the probability of a transit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P r(transit|I) = P r(imin ≤ i ≤ imax|I),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>which is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P r(imin ≤ i ≤ imax|I) = imax i min di sin (i) P r(i|I) = 2π 0 dν imax i min di sin (i) P r(ν, i|I) = 2π 0 dν imax i min di 1 4π sin (i) = 1 4π 2π 0 dν (cos (imax) − cos (imin)) = 2 4π 2π 0 dν RS r .</formula><p>Now, using the fact that the star-planet distance r varies as a function of the true anomaly ν as described in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, the equation above becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P r(imin ≤ i ≤ imax) = 1 2π 2π 0 dν RS(1 + e cos (ν)) a(1 − e 2 ) . = RS a(1 − e 2 ) ,</formula><p>so that in the case of an eccentric orbit, the probability of observing the transit of a planet for which the eccentricity e &lt; 1 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P r(transit) = RS a(1 − e 2 ) ;<label>(11)</label></formula><p>whereas for a circular orbit, or an orbit for which the eccentricity is zero, e = 0, the transit probability is: One can now compute the probability that a distant observer would view a planet in a circular orbit as transiting its host star. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists these probabilities for several planets in our solar system for which the Sun has a radius of RS = 0.0046 AU. According to <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>, these probabilities fall off as 1/a, indicating that the transit method of exoplanet detection is heavily biased toward the detection of closely-orbiting exoplanets.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P r(transit) = RS a . (12)</formula><p>The probability of an alien civilization being able to observe Earth transiting the Sun (within the Earth transit zone (ETZ)) is only 0.46%. Since the average stellar density in the galactic neighborhood surrounding the Sun is approximately 0.004 stars per cubic light year <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gregersen (2010)</ref>, there are about 17,000 stars within 100 LY of the Sun. Of these 17,000 stars, only about 78 of them are positioned so that Earth could be observed transiting the Sun. A recent study utilized the Hipparcus database to identify 37 K and 45 G dwarf stars in the ETZ within 1000 parsecs (≈3261 LY) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Heller and Pudritz (2016)</ref>.</p><p>The secondary eclipse is similar to the transit. It occurs when the planet passes behind the host star so that the planetary flux, which is composed of both reflected light and thermal emissions, is blocked. The magnitude of the secondary eclipse is dependent on the magnitude of the planetary flux, which, for a relatively cool planet, is bounded by the maximum amount of reflected light <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">F secondary &lt; Ag Rp 2 a 2 FS = Ag RS 2 a 2 Fprimary,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where we are considering a circular orbit of radius a, Ag is the geometric albedo, Rp is the radius of the planet, RS is the radius of the host star and FS is the stellar flux. Since typically RS a, secondary eclipses are not always detectable in the recorded data. EXONEST models secondary eclipses using the methodology developed by Mandel and Agol Mandel and Agol (2002) applied to a uniform source. An example of a secondary eclipse can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> at the orbital phase of 1.1 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reflected Light</head><p>Planets reflect light both from cloud tops and from solid or liquid surfaces, and the degree to which they reflect light is quantified by their albedo <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jenkins and Doyle (2003)</ref>; Seager (2010); Perryman (2011); Placek (2014); <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Placek et al. (2014)</ref>. EXONEST employs the simplest model for reflected light in which the planet is assumed to be diffusely isotropically reflecting, so that the brightness does not depend on the angle of observation. In addition, it is assumed that the planet is situated sufficiently distant from the host star that the starlight impinges on the planet in parallel rays so that half of the planet is in daylight and the other half of the planet is in night. Given these assumptions, the stellar flux reflected by the planet can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sobolev (1975)</ref>; Carter (ress):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Φ ref = Ag Rp 2 r 2 (π − θ(t)) cos(θ(t)) + sin(θ(t)) π ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where Rp is the radius of the planet, Ag is the geometric albedo and θ(t) is the time-varying orbital phase angle. This result appears to work well for many exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Efforts to Properly Model Reflected Light</head><p>However, it is known that a significant number of planets (mainly hot Jupiters) closely orbit giant stars so that the assumption that the starlight impinges on the planet in the form of parallel rays is false. Instead, the planet can be divided into three zones. The first zone is that of full daylight where the entire apparent disk of the star can be seen from the surface. The second zone is a penumbral zone where only a portion of the star is visible as it appears to be setting or rising. The third zone is the night zone where the star is not visible. There are a number of cases in which the penumbral zone extends well into what would normally be the night zone. For example, as much as 70% of Kepler-91b's surface is lit by starlight. This situation is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>. This has significant implications for the primary transit since a fraction of the backside of the planet may be partially illuminated in the penumbral zone, thus compensating somewhat for the reduced starlight due to the transit. As a result, unless the illumination geometry is properly modeled, primary transit depths will be less extensive resulting in an under-estimation of the planetary radius or an over-estimation of the nightside thermal flux followed by an over-estimation of nightside temperatures.

As a result, stars with planets tend to wobble. This is the basis of the radial velocity technique in which the radial velocity of the star is carefully measured using spectroscopy and knowledge about the Doppler shift to detect the presence of planets. While the radial velocity technique relies on spectroscopy, there is a photometric component that arises due to relativistic considerations related to stellar aberration in which an object that radiates light uniformly at rest will, in motion, tend to radiate more light in the direction of motion and less light opposite that direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rybicki and Lightman (2008)</ref>. This effect is called Doppler boosting or Doppler beaming.</p><p>The effect can be derived using special relativity resulting in the following formula for the boosted flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rybicki and Lightman (2008)</ref>; Placek (2014); <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Placek et al.

Since the motion of the star will involve velocities no more than 100-1000 m/s (β ≈ 10 −5 ), it is perhaps surprising that this relativistic effect could be detectable. However, the fact that the star is approximately 10 6 -times brighter than the reflected light from a planet means that this effect can be on the order of that of reflected light.

Note that when the inclination of the orbital plane is zero, i = 0, the orbit is face on (in the projected plane of the sky), and both the radial velocity semiamplitude and the radial velocity are zero, resulting in no Doppler effect. Furthermore, as the planet orbits the star, the true anomaly ν(t), which is an angle, advances. There will be two times per orbital period at which the trigonometric factor goes to zero, resulting in zero radial velocity and therefore zero Doppler effect. This is most easily seen by considering a circular orbit for which the eccentricity is zero, e = 0, and the argument of the periastron is zero, ω = 0. In the case of this circular orbit, the radial velocity is zero when the true anomaly is ν = π 2 and ν = 3π 2 , which occurs when the planet is moving in the projected plane of the sky. Since the Doppler boosting effect involves both the mass of the planet and the inclination angle of the orbital plane, this phenomenon facilitates the estimation of these two quantities.</p></div>

In addition, new planetary models are being developed that are relevant to rapidly rotating planets with shapes ranging from that of an oblate ellipsoid to pyriform shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abraham and Shaw (1983)</ref> and synestias <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lock and Stewart (2017)</ref>. These features are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. While it is true that by adding more parameters, one can over-fit the data by increasing the likelihood, for this reason, EXONEST employs Bayesian model testing, which enables one to evaluate the significance of each photometric effect. The model testing capabilities of EXONEST were demonstrated on Kepler Space Telescope of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-76. Kepler-76b</ref> was demonstrated to exhibit several photometric effects: reflected light, Doppler boosting, ellipsoidal variations and atmospheric superrotation. Parameter estimates were reported that are in agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Faigler et al. (2013);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angerhausen et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Esteves et al. (2015)</ref> using both radial velocity and photometric data. In addition, the model testing capabilities of EXONEST enable one to test photometric models against one another.</p><p>Future missions promise instruments of increasing sensitivity and detail with multiple spectral bands. Despite this, photometry will continue to be a valuable resource until detailed direct imaging is possible. In the meantime, we aim to include more relevant photometric effects into EX-ONEST and to develop the software package to work in conjunction with The secondary eclipse can be observed at an orbital phase of 0.5, which is shifted from the peak of the reflected light component (dashed curve) by 8.53 • ± 0.12 • , which most likely is due to atmospheric superrotation.</p><p>future multispectral studies. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: This table lists the modeled effects considered in this paper and indicates which effects are currently implemented ('X') in EXONEST, and which are currently under development ("D") or being refined ("R") or studied ("S") for potential inclusion in the next generation of our software. Effects marked with an "M" are being or will be evaluated using Bayesian model testing. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An illustration of the structure of the EXONEST software package.</figDesc></figure>
