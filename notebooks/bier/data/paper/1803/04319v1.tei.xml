<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Technical Description</head><p>Theory: A wave-theoretical description of the SGL <ref type="bibr">(Turyshev &amp; Toth, 2017)</ref> demonstrates that it possesses a set of rather remarkable optical properties. Specifically, the SGL amplifies their brightness of light from distant, faint sources by a factor of ~2GM/(c 2 l) ~ 10 11 (for l = 1 µm), which is an enormous magnifying power not easily feasible with conventional astronomical instruments.</p><p>Moreover, the SGL has extreme angular resolution of l/D0 ~10 -10 arcseconds (with D0 being the diameter of the Sun), which makes it exceptionally well-suited for imaging distant objects. The angular diameter of an Earthlike exoplanet at 30 pc is 1.4 × 10 −11 rad. To resolve the disk of this planet as a single pixel, a telescope array with a baseline of ~74.6 km would be needed. Resolving the planet with 10 3 linear pixels would require a baseline ~1×10 5 km (~12RÅ), which is not feasible. In contrast, a 1-m telescope, placed at the focal line of the SGL at 750 AU from the Sun, has a collecting area equivalent to a diffraction-limited telescope with diameter of ~80 km and the angular resolution of an optical interferometer with a baseline of 12RÅ. While building an instument with the SGL's capabilities is far beyond our technological reach, we can use the SGL's unique capabilities to capture megapixel images of exoplanets. Recent efforts have produced a better understanding of the optical properties of the SGL. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the lens' point-spread function (PSF), resolution, magnification, all of which helps in the design of the large scale astronomical facility that would benefit from the SGL. Imaging concept: The image of an exo-Earth, say at 30 pc, is compressed by the SGL to a cylinder with a diameter of ~1.3 km (corresponding to the Einstein ring around the Sun with the same 1.3 km thickness) in the immediate vicinity of the fictitious focal line. Imaging an exo-Earth with 10 3 ´ 10 3 pixels requires moving the spacecraft within the image plane in steps of 1.3 km /10 3 ~ 1.3 m while staying within the ~1.3 km diameter cylindrical volume. So, each ~1 m pixel in the image plane corresponds to a pixel diameter of 13´10 3 km/10 3 ~ 10 km on the surface of the planet. The challenge comes from recognizing the fact that the PSF of the SGL is quite broad (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>), falling off much slower than the PSF of a typical lens. Consequently, for any pixel in the image plane, this leads to combining light from a particular pixel on the surface of the exoplanet but also from many pixels adjacent to it. This admixing of light leads to a significant blurring of the image. To overcome this impediment, imaging must be done on a pixel-by-pixel basis by measuring the brightness of the Einstein ring at each of the image pixels. The knowledge of the PSF's properties, makes it possible to apply deconvolution algorithms that enable reconstruction of the original image efficiently. To make this process work, a significant signal to noise ratio (SNR) is required. Fortunately, the SGL light amplification capability provides a SNR of over 10 3 given a 1 second of integration time. This is sufficient for nearly noiseless deconvolution.  Across the image plane, the amplification oscillates quite rapidly. For small deviations from the optical axis, θ ≈ ρ/z. Using this relation in (140), we see that the first zero occurs quite close to the optical axis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ρSGL0 ≃ 4.5 λ 1 µm z z0 cm, or, equivalently, ρSGL0 ≃ 4.5 λ 1 µm b0 R⊙ cm.<label>(142)</label></formula><p>(Note in (142) the inverse ratio of z vs. z0 and b0 vs R⊙.) Equation (142) favors larger wavelengths and larger heliocentric distances or, similarly, impact parameters. Thus, we have established the basic optical properties of the solar gravitational lens. By achromatically focusing light from a distant source <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">34]</ref>, the SGL provides a major brightness amplification and extreme angular resolution. Specifically, from (135) for λ = 1 µm, we get a light amplification of the SGL of µ ≃ 1.2 × 10 11 , corresponding to a brightness increase by δmag = 2.5 ln µ = 27.67 stellar magnitudes in case of perfect alignment. Furthermore, (140) gives us the angular resolution of the SGL of θSGL ≃ 1.1 × 10 −10 arc seconds.</p><p>We note that if the diameter of the telescope d0 is larger than the diffraction limit of the SGL (i.e., larger than the diameter of the first zero of the Airy pattern), it would average the light amplification over the full aperture. Such an averaging will result in the reduction of the total light amplification. To estimate the impact of the large aperture on light amplification, we average the result (135) over the aperture of the telescope:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¯ µz = 4 πd 2 0 d0 2 0 2π 0 µ(ρ)ρd0ρd0φ = 4π 2 1 − e −4π 2 rg/λ rg λ J 2 0 π d0 λ 2rg z + J 2 1 π d0 λ 2rg z .<label>(143)</label></formula><p>For an aperture of d0 = 1 m at z = 600 AU, this results in the reduction in light amplification by a factor of 0.025, leading to the effective light amplification of ¯ µz = 2.87 × 10 9 (i.e., 23.65 mag), which is still quite significant. The effect of the large aperture is captured in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, where we plot the behavior of each of the two terms in curly braces in (143) and also their sum. Although each term oscillates and reaches zero, their sum never becomes zero.</p><p>As seen from a telescope at the SGL, light from a distant target fills an annulus at the edge of the Sun, forming the Einstein ring. At a distance z on the focal line, an observer looking back at the Sun will see the Einstein ring with an angular size that is given by αER = 2b0/z = 4rg/b0. Using this equation, we determine the angular size of the ring as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">αER ≃ 3.50 ′′ z0 z , or, equivalently, αER ≃ 3.50 ′′ R⊙ b0 .<label>(144)</label></formula><p>A telescope with aperture d0, placed at the heliocentric distance z on the optical axis, receives light from a family of rays with different impact parameters with respect to the Sun, ranging from b0 to b0 + δb0.

Taking the ratio of α2/α1, we can determine the relation between δb0 and the telescope diameter, d0, which, to first order, is given as δb0 = d0.</p><p>As a result, the area of the Einstein ring that is seen by the telescope with aperture d0, to first order, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">AER = π((b0 + δb0) 2 − b 2 0 ) ≃ 2πb0d0.</formula><p>For different impact parameters the area behaves as Across the image plane, the amplification oscillates quite rapidly.

As a result, using (122) for the argument of the Bessel function, we can present the components of the Poynting vector (129)-(131) in the following most relevant form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">AER ≃ 4.37 × 10 9 d0 1 m b0 R⊙ m 2 .<label>(145)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">¯ Sz = c 8π E 2 0 4π 2 1 − e −4π 2 rg/λ rg λ J 2 0 2π ρ λ 2rg z ,<label>(134)</label></formula><p>with ¯ Sρ = ¯ Sφ = 0 for any practical purposes. Note that in the case when rg → 0, the Poynting vector reduces to its Euclidean spacetime vacuum value, namely ¯ S → ¯ S0 = (0, 0, (c/8π)E 2 0 ), which may de deduced from (53) by taking rg = 0. Note that in the limit λ/rg → 0, (134) corresponds to the geometric optics approximation which yields a divergent intensity of light on the caustic.</p><p>Result (134) completes our derivation of the wave-theoretical description of light propagation in the background of a gravitational monopole. The result that we obtained extends previous derivations that are valid only on the optical axis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>) to the neighborhood of the focal line and establishes the structure of the EM field in this region. As such, it presents a useful wave-theoretical treatment of focusing light by a spherically symmetric mass, which is of relevance not only for the SGL discussed here but also for microlensing by objects other than the Sun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. TOWARDS A SOLAR GRAVITATIONAL TELESCOPE</head><p>We now have all the tools necessary to establish the optical properties of the SGL in the region of interference, i.e., at heliocentric distances z ≥ z0 = R 2 ⊙ /2rg = 547.8 AU on the optical axis. First, given the knowledge of the Poynting vector in the image plane (134), we may define the monochromatic light amplification of the lens, µ, as the ratio of the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector of the lensed EM wave to that of the wave propagating in empty spacetime µ = ¯ S/| ¯ S0|, with | ¯ S0| = (c/8π)E 2 0 .

As such, it presents a useful wave-theoretical treatment of focusing light by a spherically symmetric mass, which is of relevance not only for the SGL discussed here but also for microlensing by objects other than the Sun.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-D Airy pattern of the SGL</head><p>Light contamination from the parent star is a major problem for all modern planet-hunting concepts. However, for the SGL, due to its ultrahigh angular resolution (~10 −10 arcsec) and very narrow field of view, the parent star is completely resolved from the planet with its light amplified ~10 4 km away from the planet's optical axis, making the parent star contamination issue negligible. Instrument: Thanks to the large photometric gain of the SGL, its high angular resolution and strong spectroscopic SNR (10 3 in 1 sec), a small diffraction-limited high-resolution spectrograph is sufficient for the unambiguous detection of life ( <ref type="bibr">Turyshev et al., 2018)</ref>. As the instrument ultimately determines the size of the spacecraft and, thus, its motion in the image plane, recently we addressed the issues of coronagraph design. For this, we require the coronagraph to block solar light to the level of the solar corona brightness at the location of the Einstein ring. At 1 µm, the light amplification of the SGL is ~2´10~2´~2´10 11 (equivalent to −28.2 mag), so an exoplanet, which initially is seen as an object of 32.4 mag now becomes a ~4.2 mag object. However, when averaged over a 1-m telescope, light amplification is reduced to ~2´10 9 (−23.25 mag), the exoplanet becomes a 9.2 mag object, still sufficiently bright. However, the image will include noise in the form of light from the solar corona, the residual solar light, and the zodiacal light. To validate our design assumptions, we performed a preliminary coronagraph design and simulations. Suppressing the Sun's light by a factor of 10 −6 when imaging with the SGL is significantly less demanding than the requirements for modern-day exoplanet coronagraphs, which must suppress the parent star's light by a factor of 10 −10 to detect an exoEarth at least as a single pixel. We evaluated the performance of the coronagraph with a Fourier-based diffraction model. The Sun is modelled as a dense collection of incoherent point sources with its corona at the relevant heliocentric ranges obeying ~r −3 power law profile. Design parameters include telescope size, distance to the SGL, occulter mask profile and Lyot mask size. The full width at half maximum of the Gaussian soft edge has a significant impact on the coronagraph's performance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 2)</ref>. Defining contrast as brightness normalized to peak brightness without coronagraph, we achieved a total planet throughput of ~10%. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref> shows the contrast at the image plane after the coronagraph. At a contrast of 2 × 10 −7 , the leaked solar light is ~5 times lower in intensity than the corona, satisfying the stated objectives for imaging with the SGL ( <ref type="bibr">Turyshev et al., 2018)</ref>. Image Reconstruction: Creating a megapixel image requires ~10 6 separate measurements. For a typical CCD photography, each detector pixel within the camera is performing a separate measurement. This is not the case for the SGL. Only the pixels in the telescope detector that image the Einstein ring measure the exoplanet, and the ring contains information from the entire exoplanet, due to the disproportional image bluring by the SGL and also due to the relative distribution of different regions of the exoplanet to different azimuths of the ring. To evaluate the imaging performance of the SGL, we used a technique of rotational deconvolution. The idea is that the Einstein ring seen by the imaging telescope is actually a collection of ringlets formed by light from individual pixels on the exoplanetary surface. Each of these ringlets contains a highly aberrated image of that particular surface pixel. Thus, the entire Einstein ring contains highly blurred light from the entire planet. The planetary rotation allows for different parts of the planet to rotate in/out of the view, leading to brightness variations. Thus, one can reconstruct an albedo map of the planet by using 1-day light curves while performing longitudinal deconvolution. To implement this approach, we used images of the Earth taken by the EPIC camera on the DSCO 1 spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point. The raw data is available as near real-time images of Earth 2 . The input data was used to produce an albedo map parameterized by longitudes and latitudes. The half of the planet that is visible at any given time is integrated to produce a light curve representing the variation of the total flux, as would be seen by the SGL ( <ref type="bibr">Turyshev et al., 2018</ref>). This light curve was inverted using a straightforward pseudo-inverse procedure, producing a longitudinal map of the planet. If the planet's spin axis is not aligned with its orbital axis, then over the course of a year the illumination over latitude also changes. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the input albedo map and the output of the 2D rotational deconvolution. This type of deconvolution requires a very high photometric SNR. The SNR loss during deconvolution is roughly proportional to the number of pixels. For instance, given 100 pixels in latitude and 300 in longitude, the resulting 3 ´ 10 4 pixel albedo map will have ~3´10~3´~3´10 4 hits on the photometric SNR. Fortunately, the very large effective collecting area of the SGL makes possible a sufficiently large SNR. What is encouraging is that the temporal variability in cloud cover helps the deconvolution. Assuming N ~ 50 observations of every pixel, the effect of clouds is suppressed after ~10 observations. If spectroscopic data is also used, the contribution of cloud cover can be further suppressed, allowing us to "see through" the clouds. The rotational deconvolution of the EPIC camera data lets us see the surface of the Earth using data comprising a few months. With direct deconvolution, we show that with a 1-m telescope, it would take ~2 years to build a 500´500500´500´500-pixel image. Two factors that can reduce the integration time by a factor of up to 100 are i) the number of image pixels, N, and ii) the telescope diameter. The higher the desirable resolution the longer is the integration time, T, scaling as T ~ N D 4 , where D is the distance to the target. Another scaling law is related to the telescope diameter, d. A telescope with double the aperture will collect four times as many photons. Its diffraction pattern will be twice as narrow and, thus, it will collect half as many photons from the solar corona photons. The integration time scales as T ~ d −3 . Thus, a larger image of 10 3 ´ 10 3 pixels may be produced in ~4 years if a 2-m telescope is used. However, T may be reduced if there are time-varying features in the planetary albedo (regular features and/or cloud pattern, etc.). The time is also reduced by ~n −1 if n imaging spacecraft are used. Other helpful factors are i) the rotational motion of a crescent exo-Earth, and ii) increase in heliocentric distance and the resulting improvements in coronagraphic performance. We have shown ( <ref type="bibr">Turyshev et al, 2018</ref>) that imaging with the SGL, although complex, has no fundamental "show-stoppers." Given the enormous light amplification provided by the SGL, spectroscopic investigations, even spectro-polarimetry could be viable. Ultimately, what could be obtained is not just an image, but a spectrally-resolved image over a broad range of wavelengths, characterizing the atmosphere, surface materials and biological processes on that exo-Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusion</head><p>By detecting numerous potential Earth-like exoplanets, the Kepler mission has raised the possibility of existence of another Earth-like world. Follow-ups on Kepler candidates with other current exoplanet characterization technologies may yield unresolved images at low spectral resolution (typically R&lt;100). The next steps include TESS (2018), which will extend Kepler's work by performing an all-sky survey to find additional exoplanets, including Earth-like ones; JWST (2019), which will be used for targeted follow-up on candidate planets. There are also missions yet in formative stages, such as the Exo-C, Exo-S, HabEx, and LUVOIR concepts ( <ref type="bibr">Turyshev et al, 2018</ref>). However, there is no concept for direct multi-pixel imaging of an exoplanet. All the exoplanet imaging concepts currently studied by NASA, aim to capture light from an unresolved Earth-like exoplanet as a single pixel. These missions would provide globally averaged measurements of the atmosphere, identify major biomarkers, etc. But, SGL will open up scientific questions to the exoplanet community that are currently only possible by planetary scientists with the solar system planets (e.g., studying surface landforms to evaluate the geologic evolution of the planet). In addition, a spatially resolved spectroscopic image allows us to probe small structures and detect weak features that would be lost in a global average (e.g., surface volcanism, land/water interactions, spatially limited biosignatures). Also, the SGL provides the opportunity to make a direct detection of life, as opposed to the indirect detection from a globally averaged spectroscopic biomarkers. This work is of major interdisciplinary importance. Just getting out to the SGL provides lots of interesting collaborations with heliophysics and astrophysics <ref type="bibr">(Stone et al., 2015)</ref>. Also, there is more direct interdisciplinary nature of planetary scientists and exoplanet scientists. Although, this connection is growing there is still a major chasm between the rich observations that planetary scientists use versus the few globally averaged parameters that astronomers are using with exoplanets. We note that mission to the SGL is a long term objective that requires some planning and work now with some of the technical issues involving propulsion, communication, autonomy <ref type="bibr">(Turyshev et al., 2018)</ref>. However, once/if we find Earth-like planets with biosignatures, a spatially resolved spectroscopic observation is THE imperative next step and the easiest path to that is the SGL. Therefore, we ask the NAS Committee on an Exoplanet Science Strategy to consider mission concepts capable of exploiting the remarkable optical properties of the SGL for direct high-resolution imaging/spectroscopy of a potentially habitable exoplanet. Such missions could allow exploration of exoplanets relying on the SGL capabilities decades, if not centuries, earlier than possible with other extant technologies. We also ask that the Committee recommends NASA to consider investing in technologies needed for missions to reach and operate at the relevant heliocentric distances.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
