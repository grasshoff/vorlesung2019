				<p>The identification of mean motion resonances in exoplanetary systems or in the Solar System might be cumbersome when several planets and large number of smaller bodies are to be considered. Based on the geometrical meaning of the resonance variable, an efficient method is introduced and described here, by which mean motion resonances can be easily find without any a priori knowledge on them. The efficiency of this method is clearly demonstrated by using known exoplanets engaged in mean motion resonances, and also some members of different families of asteroids and Kuiper-belt objects being in mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Neptune respectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As a result of the ongoing discoveries, the number of exoplanets is continuously growing; up to now more than 3500 planets are known in more than 2600 planetary systems. These numbers indicate that a significant amount of planets form multi-planet systems, in which at least two planets are revolving around a central star. Planets form in gas rich protoplanetary disks, therefore beside gravity, forces arising from the ambient gaseous material play important role as altering typically their semi-major axes during a process called orbital migration. If the orbital distance between two planets decreases in time due to their migration, the planets can be orbitally locked at certain ratio of their semi-major axes, where the ratio of the mean angular velocities (mean motions) can be expressed as a ratio of small positive integer numbers. If certain dynamical conditions are fulfilled, a resonant capture may happen meaning that the ratio of the semi-major axes and that of the mean motions does not change during the further migration of the planets.</p><p>Before the Kepler-era, mean motion resonances (MMRs) outside the Solar System have been detected between giant planets. One of the most remarkable resonant systems discovered at that time is around the M dwarf star GJ 876 in which two planets are in 2:1 MMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Marcy et al. 2001</ref>). Later on three planets in Laplace-type resonance have been identified ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rivera et al. 2010)</ref>, being the first known resonant chain of exoplanets resembling to the Jupiter's Galilean satellites Io-Europa-Ganymede. Other examples for the 2:1 MMR are the system HD 128311, in which E-mail: E.Forgacs-Dajka@astro.elte.hu two massive planets are in resonance but with only one critical argument librating ( <ref type="bibr">Vogt et al. 2005</ref>), and HD 73526, also with one librating critical argument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tinney et al. 2006</ref>). In the system HD 60532 two giant planets are in 3:1 MMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Desort et al. 2008)</ref>. A further example for a planetary system that might be in the Laplace resonance is the system HR 8799 in which three massive planets are orbiting around an A-type star <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski &amp; Migaszewski 2014</ref>). More recently, more planets have been discovered to be dynamically locked in chains of MMRs among the Kepler systems. In Kepler-60 three planets with masses around ∼ 4M ⊕ are in a 5:4:3 Laplace-type MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski et al. 2016</ref>). The four Neptune-mass planets in Kepler-223 have periods in ratios close to 3:4:6:8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mills et al. 2016</ref>) being another clear indication of planetary migration.</p><p>Beside the exoplanetary systems, mean motion resonances also play an important role in shaping the dynamics of the Solar System bodies. Mean motion resonances in the Solar System usually occur between a planet and small bodies: e.g. the members of the Hilda group of asteroids are in a 3:2, while the Trojan asteroids are in a 1:1 MMR with Jupiter. MMRs between terrestrial planets and particular members of the asteroid family Hungaria can also be found. Moreover, as the existence of the Kirkwood gaps clearly indicates, the dynamical structure of the main belt is shaped by the MMRs between the asteroids and Jupiter (though their depletion is not only due to MMRs). Regarding larger objects, between Neptune and the dwarf planet Pluto there is a 3:2 MMR, which is a protective resonance keeping them on non-near-approaching orbital positions. This is of high importance, since due to the high eccentricity of Pluto's orbit (e = 0.25) the projection of its perihelion to Neptune's orbital plane lies inside the orbit of Neptune thus the two orbits are crossing each other (in projection). Interestingly, there are many other Kuiper-belt objects that are locked in the 3:2 MMR with Neptune, these are the plutinos sharing their orbits with Pluto.</p><p>When studying the dynamics of exoplanetary systems with planets engaged in chains of mean motion resonances, or the motion of small celestial bodies, asteroids or transNeptunian objects (TNOs), one often finds the problem how to identify the possible mean motion resonances among the bodies involved. For example, during the formation of the dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian region, resonances swept through the primordial disk due to the migration of the planets, and planetesimals were captured into mean motion resonances. Modelling this process, a monitoring is necessary to see how the captures take place, which planetesimals are captured to which resonances <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hahn &amp; Malhotra 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Levison et al. 2008</ref>). Similarly, studying the dynamical evolution of an asteroid family, one has to check possible resonances with the planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Galiazzo et al. 2013</ref>). This needs the computation of the resonance variables, to check their possible libration, for all reasonable (often very high order) resonant ratios of the mean motions of all small bodies with all considered planets, and this has to be repeated several times during the investigated time-span resulting in a considerable computational workload.</p><p>In order to make easier the identification of the different mean motion resonances, we present a method we name FAIR (as FAst I dentification of mean motion Resonances) that is easy to use and by which the identification of the MMRs is possible without any a priori knowledge on them. Our paper is organized as the following: in the next section we introduce FAIR for inner and outer type MMRs, then in two further sections particular examples are presented for Solar System objects, and for known exoplanetary systems, also including the study of resonant chains of planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE METHOD FAIR</head><p>Let us denote by a, a the semi-major axes of two celestial bodies locked in a MMR, and by n, n the corresponding mean motions. For the sake of simplicity let us deal with the situation of an asteroid and a planet, in this case the primed quantities refer to the planet. This notation enables us to distinguish between inner and outer resonances from the point of view of the asteroid. In the case of two giant planets neither of the bodies are in such distinguished positions, the non-primed quantities refer to the planet being the body to which respect the MMR is studied.</p><p>Considering an asteroid and a planet, they can be either in (i) inner mean motion resonance, if a &lt; a and the ratio of the mean motions is approximately n n = p + q p ,</p><p>or in (ii) outer mean motion resonance, if a &gt; a and approximately</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n n = p + q p ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where p and q are relative prime integers. Here q is the order of the resonance. The resonant perturbations are proportional to the qth power of the orbital eccentricities, thus for small eccentricities low order resonances are the most important. However, for large eccentricities high order resonances can also be significant. (These refer to the so-called eccentricity-type resonance, when the longitudes of the perihelion are also involved, as in the cases studied below.) Resonances can be studied by using resonance variables. For a given mean motion resonance there can be several types of resonance variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Murray &amp; Dermott 1999</ref>). From among them we consider those for which the method FAIR is applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Inner resonance</head><p>Since beside the selected asteroid and planet there are also other planets in a planetary system, we should also take into consideration the secular rates , of the perihelion longitudes, caused by the mutual gravitational perturbations.</p><p>In this case one can obtain the following resonance variables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ 1 ≡ (p + q)λ − pλ − q,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ 2 ≡ (p + q)λ − pλ − q ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where λ = M + , = ω + Ω, λ is the mean orbital longitude, M the mean anomaly, ω the argument of perihelion, Ω the longitude of the ascending node, the longitude of the perihelion of the asteroid. The primed variables refer to the planet with similar meaning. Eqs (3) and (4) refer to the case of exact resonance. Near a resonance, Eqs (3) and (4) are satisfied approximately, and the resonance variables oscillate (librate) around a mean value, which is usually 0 • or 180 • , with amplitudes ∆θ &lt; 180 • .</p><p>Actually, in the neighbourhood of a resonance, the behaviour of a resonance variable can be quite complex. Depending on the actual system and initial conditions, it can exhibit libration, circulation, alternation between libration and circulation, or chaotic fluctuations. When searching for resonance, our aim is to establish that the resonant ratio of the mean motions (or their combinations with the secular frequencies) is maintained and the corresponding resonance variable librates. These are necessary and sufficient conditions that a resonance exist. We note that the above introduced resonance variables appear as critical arguments in the series expansion of the perturbed two-body potential in terms that contain the qth powers of e and e . There are mixed types of eccentricity-type resonances too, corresponding to critical arguments (and resonance variables) that contains coefficients of ee type. In this work, however, we do not consider the latter cases of mixed eccentricity-type resonances. Now let us consider Eq. (3) in two cases. First, when λ = λ , that is at the conjunction of the asteroid and the planet, it follows from (3) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ c = q(λ − ) = qM,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where θ c is the value of θ 1 at conjunction. Writing ¯ θ = θ 10 and denoting the amplitude of θ 1 by ∆θ, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">¯ θ − ∆θ ≤ θ c ≤ ¯ θ + ∆θ, it follows that ¯ θ − ∆θ ≤ qM ≤ ¯ θ + ∆θ.</formula><p>Here M is the mean anomaly of the asteroid at the moment of conjunctions, and qM should be taken mod 2π. Thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">¯ θ + k2π − ∆θ q ≤ M ≤ ¯ θ + k2π + ∆θ q ,</formula><p>where k is an integer. This gives q centres</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">¯ θ q + k 2π q , k = 0, 1, . . . , q − 1</formula><p>along the orbit of the asteroid around which the conjunctions of the asteroid with the planet can take place within regions of half-size ∆θ/q. For example, for q = 3 and ¯ θ = 0 • the centres are at 0 • , 120 • , and 240 • , while for ¯ θ = 180 • these are at 60 • , 180 • , and 300 • .</p><p>In the second case, when M = 0 • , that is at the perihelion of the asteroid, = λ, and it follows from (3) that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">θ p = (p + q)(λ − λ),</formula><p>where θ p is the value of θ at the perihelion. Since</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">¯ θ − ∆θ ≤ θ p ≤ ¯ θ + ∆θ, it follows that ¯ θ − ∆θ ≤ (p + q)(λ − λ) ≤ ¯ θ + ∆θ.</formula><p>As before, it also follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">¯ θ + k2π − ∆θ p + q ≤ λ − λ ≤ ¯ θ + k2π + ∆θ p + q giving p + q centres ¯ θ p + q + k 2π p + q , k = 0, 1, . . . , p + q − 1</formula><p>around which in regions with half-size ∆θ/(p+ q) the asteroid can be found with respect to the planet when the former is at perihelion. The previous considerations can be summed up in stating that plotting λ −λ against M in a rectangular coordinate system with M as horizontal and λ − λ as vertical axis, there will be q centres on the horizontal, and p + q centres on the vertical axis.</p><p>The same reasoning can be repeated with Eq. (4), concluding to that plotting λ − λ against M there will be q centres on the horizontal, and p centres on the vertical axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Outer resonance</head><p>In the case of an outer resonance, the resonance variables for the eccentricity-type resonances are</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">θ 3 = (p + q)λ − pλ − q,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">θ 4 = (p + q)λ − pλ − q .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>By similar considerations as before, it follows from Eq. (6) that plotting λ − λ against M, there will be q centres on the horizontal, and p centres on the vertical axis. In the case of </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">inner (p + q)λ − pλ − q λ − λ vers M q p + q inner (p + q)λ − pλ − q λ − λ vers M q p outer (p + q)λ − pλ − q λ − λ vers M q p outer (p + q)λ − pλ − q λ − λ vers M q p + q</formula><p>Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(7)</ref>, plotting λ − λ against M , there will be q centres on the horizontal, and p + q centres on the vertical axis. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives a summary of the different cases in the inner and outer resonances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Inclination-type resonances of inner and outer type</head><p>We have investigated the eccentricity-type resonances so far, however, it can be easily shown that with minor modifications, the method FAIR also works for inclination-type resonanances. Let us consider the non-mixed inclination-type resonances of order q, where the critical arguments appear in terms containing the qth power of either I or I (being the inclinations of the body and of the perturber, respectively) as coefficients in the series expansion of the perturbing potential:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">θ I,1 = (p + q)λ − pλ − qΩ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">θ I,2 = (p + q)λ − pλ − qΩ ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where Ω and Ω are the longitude of nodes of the body and the perturber, respectively. Equating the mean longitudes, λ = λ , similarly to Equation (5), conjunctions happen when</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">θ I,c = q(λ − Ω) = q(ω + M).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>This suggests that in the inclination-type resonances one should replace M with M + ω, and by a similar argumentation to the eccentricity-type resonances, there will be q centres on the horizontal, and (p + q) centres on the vertical axis when plotting λ − λ versus M + ω in a rectangular coordinate system. The above considerations can also be applied to the outer inclination-type resonances, when λ − λ should be plotted either versus M + ω or M + ω . Thus by replacing in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> M and M with M + ω and M + ω , moreover and with Ω and Ω respectively, one can easily obtain the resonance variable of the corresponding inclination-type resonance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IDENTIFICATION OF RESONANCES</head><p>The properties of the resonance variables, described in Section 2, can be used to find easily whether a resonance exists between a planet and an asteroid. Deciding from the semimajor axes that the looked for resonance is inner or outer, then searching for inner resonances, one plots λ − λ versus M and M , (or in the cases of inclination-type MMRs versus M + ω and M + ω ) computed by numerical integration of the equations of motion for sufficiently long time. If there is a resonance, some stripes will appear on the plots (see the examples below), and counting the number of their intersections with the horizontal and vertical axis will provide the p and q values of the resonance. Searching for outer resonances, the procedure is the same with plotting λ − λ versus M and M and counting the numbers of intersections on the horizontal and vertical axis. Since in the case of a resonance the appearance of the proper number of intersections is a necessary condition, once p and q are found, the ratio of the mean motions and the libration of the resonance variable should be checked with them.</p><p>When processing the above plots, there can be raised two technical questions: (i) how long the numerical integrations should be carried out, and (ii) how frequently should the points be plotted in order to obtain good quality plots suitable for determination of a MMR. Without giving a definite answer, we have empirically found that regarding the plotting frequency, the one hundredth of the period of the inner body certainly will give good result when using an integration time that corresponds to one hundred periods of the outer body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Solar System examples</head><p>In this section we provide a few examples for the application of the method FAIR to Solar System bodies involved in various mean motion resonances. The orbits have been numerically calculated by using an own-developed adaptive step size Runge-Kutta-Nystrom 6/7 N-body integrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dormand &amp; Prince 1978)</ref>. In our integrations all planets except Mercury have been taken into account, and as initial conditions we used heliocentric coordinates and velocities taken from JPL Horizons at the epoch JD 2457754.50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">153 Hilda -Jupiter 3:2 MMR</head><p>The main dynamical characteristic of the Hilda group of asteroids (named after 153 Hilda) is that its members are locked in a 3:2 MMR with Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brož &amp; Vokrouhlick´yVokrouhlick´y 2008)</ref>. As a first example on how the method FAIR works is given by plotting λ − λ versus M (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, left panel), where λ is the mean longitude of the perturbing body (Jupiter, in this case), and λ, M are the mean longitude, and mean anomaly of the asteriod 153 Hilda, respectively. Since this is a MMR of inner type, and λ − λ is plotted against M, according to the first row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> the counting of the number of intersecting stripes with the horizontal and vertical axis gives q = 1 and p + q = 3, see the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Thus, the ratio of the mean motions is (p + q)/p = 3/2, and the corresponding resonance variable (or resonant angle) is θ 1 = 3λ − 2λ − , librating in this case around 0 • as shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We note that in this case, the ratio of the mean motions and the resonance variable are determined solely by counting the crossings of the stripes with the horizontal and vertical axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Neptune -Pluto 3:2 MMR</head><p>As a further well known example, we consider the case of Neptune and Pluto, being in a 3:2 MMR <ref type="bibr">(Cohen &amp; Hub- bard 1965)</ref>. In this case, the more massive Neptune (the perturber) orbits closer to the Sun, thus the MMR under study is of outer type. In the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> we displayed λ − λ versus M. Since this is a MMR of outer type, according to the third row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> the counting of the crossings of the stripes with the horizontal and vertical axis gives q = 1 and p = 2. Thus the ratio of the mean motions is (p + q)/p = 3/2, and the corresponding resonance variable,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">θ 3 = 3λ − 2λ − librates around 180 • .</formula><p>We note that although the above two well known mean motion resonances can be identified easily without the application of the method FAIR, we were able to identify them without knowing their character. In what follows, we show some more sophisticated cases, in which the identification of the resonances and the corresponding resonance variables might be more complicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Neptune -2005 TN 74 5:3 MMR</head><p>2005 TN 74 is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sheppard et al. (2005)</ref>. In order to demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the method FAIR, let us forget for now that this body is in a 5:3 MMR with Neptune. The only information we suppose to have is that this TNO orbits outside Neptune, therefore when seeking for a resonant behaviour we should consider a MMR of outer type. To do so we display the plot λ − λ versus M, where λ is the mean longitude of Neptune, while λ and M are the mean longitude and mean anomaly of 2005 TN 74 , respectively. Studying the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref>, we can count the numbers of crossings of the stripes with the axes, yielding q = 2 and p = 3 (see the third row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>). Thus the ratio of the mean motions is (p + q)/p = 5/3, and the resonance variable θ 3 = 5λ −3λ −2 librates around 180 • , see the right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>

This is a 5th order MMR, and its identification might not be too straightforward being the ratio of the mean motions close to the 2:1 ratio. Seeking a resonant behaviour with Neptune of outer type, we plot λ−λ against M, see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. As usual, λ refers to Neptune's mean orbital longitude, while the non-primed quantities to Haumea's orbital elements. <ref type="figure">Investigating Fig- ure 4</ref>, one can identify q = 5 crossings with the horizontal, and p = 7 crossings with the vertical axis. This yields to a mean motion ratio of (p + q)/p = 12/7, and a resonance variable θ 3 = 12λ − 7λ − 5 librating around approximately 120 • . <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Neptune -2001 QR 322 1:1 MMR</head><p>The method FAIR can also be applied to Trojan-type motions. The main characteristic of the Trojan-type, or in other words co-orbital motion is the 1:1 MMR meaning that the bodies involved are sharing similar orbits. The best known examples for Trojan-type motion are the Trojan asteroids populating the neighbourhood of the stable triangular Lagrangian points L 4 and L 5 of the Sun-Jupiter system. The resonance variable in these cases is λ − λ which librates either around 60 • , or 300 • depending on whether the asteroid is in the vicinity of the L 4 , or L 5 point. In the λ − λ versus M plots of the Neptune's Trojan 2001 QR (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, left panel) we find one strip parallel to the horizontal axis of the coordinate system yielding q = 0 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, first row), e.g. a zeroth order resonance. The only crossing with the vertical axis means p + q = 1, that is p = 1. Thus the resonance is (p + q)/p = 1/1, and the resonance variable is θ = λ − λ, librating around 300 • ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, right panel).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">HD 60532</head><p>Until the discovery of the system around HD 60532, an Ftype star with mass M * = 1.44 M by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Desort et al. (2008)</ref>, there were not known any giant planets involved in the 3:1 MMR. The final confirmation that giant planets can be in the 3:1 MMR was given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Laskar &amp; Correia (2009)</ref>, while a formation study favouring a migration based scenario was performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sándor &amp; Kley (2010)</ref>. In the latter study the authors demonstrated that the convergent migration, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. The resonant pairs of the system Kepler 60, the three planets being in 5:4:3 Laplace-type MMR thus capture in the 3:1 MMR was only possible for larger planetary masses corresponding to Fit II of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Laskar &amp; Correia (2009)</ref>. In this work we checked both Fit I with low and Fit II with high planetary masses to show the efficiency of the method FAIR. Our results are displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, where in the upper left panel the (λ − λ) versus M plot is displayed for Fit I, while in the bottom left panel for Fit II. These resonances are of inner types (as the primed orbital elements are refering to the outer giant planet), and by calculating the number of the crossings of the strips with the horizontal and vertical axis we have (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, first row) q = 2 and p + q = 3. Thus p = 1, and the ratio of the mean motions is (p+q)/p = 3/1. This means that without any a priori knowledge, just by a careful analysis of the (λ − λ) versus M plot we could identify the mean motion resonance, and also write down the corresponding resonant variable, which in these cases is θ 1 = 3λ − λ − 2, librating around 180 • <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>, right panels). It is noteworthy that due to the relatively large libration amplitude, the strips in the (λ − λ) versus M plot are quite broad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Kepler 60</head><p>As we have already mentioned, there are planetary systems, typically discovered by the Kepler mission, in which the planets are captured in chains of mean motion resonances. A prominent example of these systems is Kepler 60, where three planets with masses around 4 M ⊕ are in the 5:4:3 Laplace-type MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski et al. 2016</ref>). Here we apply the method FAIR to the Fit II of the cited paper, in which the pairs of the planets in MMRs are investigated. First, without any a priori knowlegde on the MMRs, we can study planets b and c. We display λ 1 − λ 2 as the function of M 1 , see the upper left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. We note that the index 1 stays for the inner, while index 2 for the outer planet, planets b and c in this configuration. Considering that λ, , M correspond to λ 1 , 1 , M 1 and λ , , M correspond to λ 2 , 2 , M 2 , and that this is an outer type MMR, according to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (third row) the numbers of crossings with the horizontal and vertical axis give q = 1 and p = 4. The mean motions ratio in this case is thus (p + q)/p = 5/4 corresponding to a resonant variable θ 3,12 = 5λ 1 − 4λ 2 − 1 , librating around 180 • (see the upper right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref>). As a next step, we can also check, whether the planets c and d are in a MMR too. To do so, we plot λ 2 − λ 3 as the function of M 2 , shown in the middle left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref>. Now the non-primed elements correspond to those with index 2, and the primed ones to those with index 3. According to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (third row), we have q = 1 and p = 3, that is there is a (p + q)/p = 4/3 MMR with a resonant variable θ 3,23 = 4λ 2 − 3λ 3 − 2 , librating around 180 • (middle right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we also plot λ 1 − λ 3 as the function of M 1 (bottom left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Counting the numbers of crossings of the stripes with the axes, we find q = 2 and p = 3 corresponding to a mean motion ratio (p + q)/p = 5/3, and indeed, the resonant variable θ 3,13 = 5λ 1 − 3λ 3 − 2 1 librates around 225 • (bottom right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Thus using the system Kepler 60, we gave an evidence that the method FAIR is also applicable for a quick identification of MMRs between pairs of exoplanets being in resonant chains. The above analysis can also be performed for inner type resonances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Application of the method FAIR to inclination-type MMR</head><p>Similarly to the eccentricity-type MMRs, the method FAIR can also be applied to detect inclination-type resonances. The best known example for inclination-type MMR in the Solar System is between the Saturnian satellites Mimas and Thetis corresponding to a 2:1 commensurability. Inclinationtype MMRs can also be developed between migrating giant planets if the eccentricity damping of the outer migrating planet is modest, allowing the rapid growth of the inner planet's eccentricity. This can additionally lead to the fast growth of the inner planet's inclination (see <ref type="bibr">Libert &amp; Tsiga- nis 2009</ref>). Here we consider the following example that leads to a 3:1 MMR: the inner planet with mass m 1 = 1M J (where M J is the mass of Jupiter) is started from 5 au from nearly circular and planar, initially non-migrating orbit. An outer planet with mass m 2 = 2M J is started from 16.5 au from a circular orbit with negligible inclination with respect to the plane of reference of the coordinate system, and is forced to migrate in timescale of τ a = 7 × 10 5 years, with the same eccentricity damping timescale. According to <ref type="bibr">Libert &amp; Tsiga- nis (2009)</ref>, the two planets enter first into a 3:1 eccentricitytype, and later on into an inclination-type MMR, as the libration of the following eccentricity-type and inclination-  type variables clearly indicates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">θ 1 = 3λ 2 − λ 1 − 2 1 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">θ I,1 = 3λ 2 − λ 1 − 2Ω 1 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The resonance variable θ 1 begins its libration roughly after t ∼ 3.5 × 10 5 years being the time when the resonant capture happens (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8)</ref>. Interestingly, the center of libration is shifted from 180 • to lower values between 100 • − 150 • . The inclination of the inner planet gets excited around t ∼ 9.5×10 5 years, that coincides to the libration of the resonance variable θ I,1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref>). After this epoch the system is both in 3:1 eccentricity-type and inclination-type MMR, see the right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 8 and 9</ref>. Studying the left panels of these figures that display the plots (λ 2 − λ 1 ) versus M 1 for the eccentricity-type, and (λ 2 − λ 1 ) versus (M 1 + ω 1 ) for inclination-type MMRs, one can see that the method FAIR is able to identify both eccentricity-type and inclination-type MMRs providing the correct resonance variables. We note that the plots have been made for the whole timespan of the numerical integration, also before the planets are got captured in resonances, thus there are scattered points in the figures being not yet settled in the stripes indicating the MMRs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Temporary capture into a MMR</head><p>Finally, we also show that the method FAIR is able to detect temporary capture into a MMR. It can happen, for instance, that during their migration planets enter into a MMR, see our results in the previous part. The left panels of Figures 8 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Temporary capture of 2007 RW 10 into a 1:1 MMR, being a co-orbital companion of Neptune for a while. and 9 contain scattered points corresponding to that epochs when the planets are not engaged into the 3:1 MMR. On the other hand it is important that the scattered points should not repress those settled in the stripes. Beside the cases of migrating planets, there are examples of temporary capture of bodies in co-orbital orbits, too. This happens to the asteroid 2007 RW 10 , which was assumed as Neptune Trojan (de la Fuente Marcos &amp; de la Fuente Marcos 2012). The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the temporary libration of the synodic longitude λ − λ, around 300 • . The left panel of this figure shows the (λ − λ) versus M plot, in which one parallel stripe to the horizontal axis becomes visible around λ − λ = 300 • among the scattered points indicating the case of the 1:1 MMR, see additionally <ref type="figure">Figure  5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we presented a novel method which is suitable to easily decide whether two planets are involved in some mean motion resonance, being either of eccentricity or inclination type, without any a priori knowledge of its character. Based on the geometrical meaning of the resonance variables, first we described in detail how our method works. Next we demonstrated through a few examples of real bodies of the Solar System and of exoplanetary systems, involved in various MMRs, the straightforward applicability and efficiency of the method FAIR. We have found that this method is able to detect MMRs also in those cases when the involved bodies are only temporarily captured, such as migrating pairs of planets or co-orbital companions to giant planets. Our method can also serve as a practical help for future analysis of celestial bodies which may be envolved in mean motion resonances.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
