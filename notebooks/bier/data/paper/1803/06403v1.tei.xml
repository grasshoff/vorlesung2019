			<abstract>
				<p>Space-based high contrast imaging mission concepts for studying rocky exoplanets in reflected light are currently under community study. We develop an inverse modeling framework to estimate the science return of such missions given different instrument design considerations. By combining an exoplanet albedo model, an instrument noise model, and an ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, we explore retrievals of atmospheric and planetary properties for Earth twins as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution (R). Our forward model includes Rayleigh scattering, single-layer water clouds with patchy coverage, and pressure-dependent absorption due to water vapor, oxygen, and ozone. We simulate data at R = 70 and R = 140 from 0.4-1.0 µm with SNR = 5, 10, 15, 20 at 550 nm (i.e., for HabEx/LUVOIR-type instruments). At these same SNR, we simulate data for WFIRST paired with a starshade, which includes two photometric points between 0.48-0.6 µm and R = 50 spectroscopy from 0.6-0.97 µm. Given our noise model for WFIRST-type detectors, we find that weak detections of water vapor, ozone, and oxygen can be achieved with observations with at least R = 70 / SNR = 15, or R = 140 / SNR = 10 for improved detections. Meaningful constraints are only achieved with R = 140 / SNR = 20 data. The WFIRST data offer limited diagnostic information, needing at least SNR = 20 to weakly detect gases. Most scenarios place limits on planetary radius, but cannot constrain surface gravity and, thus, planetary mass.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The scientific field of exoplanets has been rapidly advancing since the hallmark discovery of the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>. Following the launch of NASA's Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borucki et al. , 2011</ref>), the field has seen the discovery of thousands of transiting exoplanets and the exciting result that planets with radii between 0.75-2.5 R ⊕ are common around solar-type stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burke et al. 2015</ref>). Only within the last decade have observational studies for exoplanet atmospheric characterization seen substantial development, starting with the first detection of an exoplanet's atmosphere by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref>.</p><p>To date, the majority of exoplanet atmospheric characterization investigations have focused on transiting worlds. Hot Jupiters, owing to their large sizes and short orbital periods, are typically emphasized as tar-gets for these studies. Characterization of small, potentially rocky exoplanets is limited to worlds with cool stellar hosts (K and M dwarfs), which offer favorable planet-to-star size ratios. Recently, de <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wit et al. (2016)</ref> studied the combined transmission spectra of two transiting Earth-sized planets orbiting the ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 using the Hubble Space Telescope. While no gas absorption features were detected by de <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wit et al. (2016)</ref>, this work highlights the improvements in signal size when terrestrial-sized transiting planets are studied around low-mass stars. Additionally, since the Habitable Zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>) around a low-mass star is relatively close-in, characterization studies of potentially habitable exoplanets around cool stars can benefit from the frequency of transit events. However, for Sunlike hosts, the planet-to-star size ratio is much less favorable and the Habitable Zone is located far from the star, thus severely limiting the potential for atmospheric characterization.</p><p>Direct, high-contrast imaging has now emerged as an essential technique for studying the atmospheres of planets at larger orbital separations from their host star (i.e., at orbital distances 1 au). Thus far, high-contrast imaging has been proven successful in studying atmospheres of young, self-luminous gas giants in the nearinfrared and mid-infrared (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ske- mer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Macintosh et al. 2015</ref>). These worlds, owing to their intrinsic brightness, have typical contrast ratios of 10 −4 with respect to their hosts. A true Jupiter analog at visible wavelengths, by comparison, would have a contrast ratio of 10 −9 , while an Earth analog would have a contrast ratio of order 10 −10 . Reflected light in the visible probes to atmospheric depths of up to ∼ 10 bar for giant planets ), which is complimentary to the relatively low pressures probed in transit observations (typically less than 10-100 mbar). Additionally, the wavelength range of 0.4-1.0 µm holds rich information about a planet's atmosphere, including signatures of methane, water vapor, and haze <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In spite of the incredible technological challenges, there are multiple planned or in-development space-based missions that would be capable of high-contrast imaging of exoplanets in reflected light. First among these will be NASA's Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Spergel et al. 2013</ref>), which was identified as the top priority space mission in the 2010 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics 12 . The WFIRST mission will carry a Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) with imaging capability and a visible-light integral field spectrograph of wavelength resolution ∼ 50 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Noecker et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Trauger et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Seo et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cady et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balasubramanian et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Groff et al. 2018</ref>). Although envisioned primarily as a technology demonstrator, it may study the atmospheres of relatively cool gas giant exoplanets that have been previously detected using the radial velocity technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Traub et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While WFIRST could also have some capability to survey stars in the solar neighborhood for lower-mass planetary companions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burrows 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Greco &amp; Burrows 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Spergel et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Savransky &amp; Garrett 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson et al. 2016</ref>), it is anticipated that the core optical throughput of the WFIRST CGI will be low for planetary signals. This stems primarily from the complexities of accommodating for WFIRST's on-axis secondary mirror and support structures within the highcontrast instruments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Traub et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krist et al. 2016</ref>). Low throughput drives long requisite integration times, thereby likely making spectroscopic observations of smaller, less-bright worlds (such as super-Earth exoplanets) unfeasible except around the very closest stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Robinson et al. 2016</ref>). However, if the WFIRST spacecraft were to be paired with an external starshade <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cash 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kasdin et al. 2012</ref>), the CGI can be operated in a direct mode without coronagraphic masks, substantially increasing throughput. High-contrast imaging of sub-Neptune and terrestrial-sized exoplanets may then become possible. The feasibility of a starshade "rendezvous" with the WFIRST spacecraft is under active investigation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Seager et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crill &amp; Siegler 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In advance of the 2020 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey, several large-scale space-based mission concepts are being studied <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . Of these, two have a strong focus on the characterization of rocky exoplanets with direct imaging: the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission ( <ref type="bibr">HabEx;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mennesson et al. 2016</ref>) and the Large UltraViolet/Optical/InfraRed Surveyor (LUVOIR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Peterson et al. 2017</ref>). HabEx and LUVOIR are incorporating aspects of design that would allow the detection of water vapor and biosignatures on planets in the Habitable Zones of nearby Sun-like stars. It is therefore timely and critical that we explore observational approaches that maximize science yield during the development of these large-scale mission concepts as well as the WFIRST ren-12 http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/bpa_049810 13 https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/ 2020-decadal-survey-planning dezvous concept. To accomplish this, we must perform atmospheric and instrument modeling to simulate the types of spectra we can expect to measure, and we must develop tools to infer planetary properties from these simulated observations. Traditionally, the comparison to a limited range of forward models has been used to infer atmospheric properties (such as temperature structure and gas abundances) from spectral observations. This involves iterating to a radiative-convective solution for a given set of planetary parameters (e.g., gravity, metallicity, equilibrium abundances, incident flux), and can include detailed treatment of aerosols, chemistry, and dynamics within the model atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marley &amp; Robinson 2015)</ref>. The goal is to generate a spectrum that matches available data and, thus, offers one potential explanation for the world's atmospheric state (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Konopacky et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Macintosh et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barman et al. 2015)</ref>. A more data-driven interpretation of atmospheric observations is accomplished through inverse modeling, or retrievals. Developed for Solar System studies and remote sensing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rodgers 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Irwin et al. 2008)</ref>, retrievals have become a valuable tool in constraining our understanding of the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. Early exoplanet retrieval work invoked grid-based optimization schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009)</ref>, while subsequent works have taken advantage of Bayesian inference with methods such as optimal estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lee et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benneke &amp; Seager 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Line et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Several studies have examined the hypothetical yield from characterizing giant exoplanets observed with a space-based coronagraph (such as WFIRST ) with retrieval techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Marley et al. (2014)</ref>, for example, modeled spectra we could expect from known radial velocity gas giants if observed by the WFIRST CGI. Given the diversity of cool giant planets, the model spectra have a variety of input assumptions for clouds, surface gravity, and atmospheric metallicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Marley et al. (2014)</ref> then applied retrieval methods to these synthetic spectra, enabling the exploration of how well atmospheric parameters are constrained under varying quality of data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref> further investigated the feasibility of characterizing cool giant planet atmospheres through retrieval, focusing on the ability to constrain the CH 4 abundance and cloud properties. The systematic study of the impact of conditions like signal-to-noise ratios or wavelength resolution is essential to quantifying the scientific return of these reflected-light observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. (2017)</ref> considered the impact of an unknown phase angle on the inference of properties such as planet radius and gravity. In all of these studies, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data has a significant influence on the constraints of atmospheric properties.</p><p>Previous work on smaller planets in the context of possible future space missions includes von <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Paris et al. (2013)</ref>, who synthesized infrared emission observations of a cloud-free, directly-imaged Earth-twin, and employed a least-squares approach and χ 2 maps to perform retrievals and explore parameter space (considering the effects of instrument resolution and SNRs). A collection of recent studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wang et al. 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mawet et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wang et al. 2017a</ref>) examined atmospheric species detection using "High Dispersion Coronagraphy", which couples starlight suppression technologies with high resolution spectroscopy. In these studies, simulated observations (typically at spectral resolutions, R = λ/∆λ, of many hundreds to tens of thousands) are cross-correlated with template molecular opacity spectra to explore the feasibility of species detection. While this novel approach can yield detections of key atmospheric constituents, the abundance of these these atmospheric species cannot be robustly constrained.</p><p>To date, there still does not exist a systematic study of atmospheric characterization of small exoplanets using retrieval techniques on reflected light observations at spectral resolutions relevant to WFIRST rendezvous, HabEx, and LUVOIR. Motivated by this need, we present here our extension of Bayesian retrieval techniques into the terrestrial regime. We construct a forward model suitable for simulating reflectance spectra of Earth-like planets in the visible wavelength range of 0.4 µm to 1.0 µm. We explore retrievals of planetary and atmospheric properties from simulated data sets at varying spectral resolutions and SNRs. A retrieval framework such as this allows us to quantify uncertainties we expect for key planetary parameters given certain observing scenarios. Thus, our approach enables us to search for the minimal observing conditions that achieve the scientific goal of identifying traits associated with habitability and life. In particular, we are interested in our ability to detect and constrain abundances of molecules such as water, oxygen, and ozone, characterize basic properties of a cloud layer, and measure bulk parameters such as radius.</p><p>In section 2, we describe our forward model and construction of simulated data. In section 3, we validate our forward model by building up retrieval complexity (i.e., number of retrieved parameters). We perform a study of retrieval performance with respect to spectral resolution and SNR in section 4, with implications for HabEx/LUVOIR. We also study the retrieval performance for data sets expected from a WFIRST rendezvous scenario, where the CGI would provide modestresolution spectroscopy in the red (600-970 nm) and photometry in the blue (480-600 nm). We present our discussion and conclusions in sections 5 and 6, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>The observed quantity for a directly imaged exoplanet in reflected light at a given phase (i.e., planet-starobserver) angle, α, is the wavelength dependent planetto-star flux ratio,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F p F s = A g Φ(α) R p r 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A g is the geometric albedo, Φ(α) is the phase function, R p is the radius of the planet, and r is the orbital separation. The phase function (which depends on wavelength) translates the planetary brightness at full phase (i.e., where α = 0 • ) to its brightness at different phase angles. The wavelength dependent geometric albedo is the ratio between the measured flux from the planet at full phase to that from a perfectly reflecting Lambert (i.e., isotropically-reflecting) disk with the size of the planet. We denote the product of the geometric albedo and the phase function as the phase dependent "reflectance" of the planet. In general, the geometric albedo encodes information about the composition and structure (i.e., "state") of an atmosphere, while the phase function is strongly related to the scattering properties of an atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows 2014</ref>).</p><p>To understand the information contained in direct imaging observations of exoplanets in reflected light, we employ a retrieval (or inverse analysis) framework that consists of several linked simulation tools and models. Of central importance is a well-tested three-dimensional albedo model-described in greater depth below-that computes a reflectance spectrum at high resolution for a planet given a description of its atmospheric state ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">McKay et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. 2017)</ref>. When coupled with a simulator for degrading a high resolution spectrum to match the resolution of an instrument, we refer to these two tools as the "forward model." By adding simulated noise to forward model spectra, we generate faux "observations" of worlds as would be studied by future highcontrast imaging missions. To create "observed" spectra, we adopt a widely-used direct imaging instrument simulator ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson et al. 2016</ref>) that generates synthetic observations given an input, noise-free spectrum.</p><p>Given an "observed" planet-to-star flux ratio spectrum, our inverse analyses use a Bayesian inference tool that compares the observation to forward model outputs to sample the posterior probability distributions for a collection of atmospheric state parameters. In other words, our inverse analyses indicate what range of atmospheric state parameters (e.g., gas abundances) adequately describe a direct imaging observation. Our Bayesian parameter estimations use an open-source affine invariant Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler-emcee <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goodman &amp; Weare 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Foreman- Mackey et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>In this work, retrieval analyses generally proceed by first simulating a noise-free spectrum of a world with a known atmospheric state (e.g., Earth). We then add simulated observational noise to this spectrum to create a synthetic observation. Following Bayesian parameter estimation on this synthetic observation, we can compare a retrieved atmospheric state to the original, known atmospheric state, thereby allowing us to understand how observational noise affects our ability to deduce the true nature of an exoplanetary atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Albedo Model</head><p>Our three-dimensional albedo model (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>) divides a world into a number of planeparallel facets with coordinates of longitude (ζ) and colatitude (η), with the former referenced from the subobserver location and the latter ranging from 0 at the northern pole to π at the southern pole. A single facet has downwelling incident stellar radiation from a zenith angle µ s = cos θ s = sin η cos (ζ − α), where, as earlier, α is the phase angle. The facet reflects to the observer in a direction whose zenith angle is given by µ o = cos θ o = sin η cos ζ. Note that, at full phase (where the geometric albedo is defined) the observer and the source are colinear such that µ o = µ s for all facets.</p><p>The atmosphere above each facet is divided into a set of pressure levels, and we perform a radiative transfer calculation to determine the emergent intensity. With the intensities calculated for an entire visible hemisphere, we follow the methods outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Horak (1950) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Horak &amp; Little (1965)</ref> to perform integration using ChebychevGauss quadrature, thus producing the reflectance value at a given wavelength. We repeat this procedure at each of the wavelength points within a specified range to build up a reflectance spectrum.</p><p>Taking I(τ, µ, φ) to be the wavelength-dependent intensity at optical depth τ in a direction determined by the zenith and azimuth angles µ and φ, we ultimately need to determine the emergent intensity from each facet in the direction of the observer, I(τ = 0, µ o , φ o ). Thus, for each facet we must solve the one-dimensional, planeparallel radiative transfer equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µ dI dτ = I(τ, µ, φ) − S(τ, µ, φ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where S is the wavelength dependent source function. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meador &amp; Weaver (1980)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Toon et al. (1989), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marley &amp; Robinson (2015)</ref>, the source function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(τ, µ, φ) = ¯ ω 4π F s · p(τ, µ, φ, −µ s , φ s ) · e −τ /µ + ¯ ω 2π 0 dφ 1 −1 dµ 4π · I(τ, µ , φ ) · p(τ, µ, φ, µ , φ ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ¯ ω is the single scattering albedo, F s is the incoming stellar flux at the top of the atmosphere (which we normalize to unity so that emergent intensities correspond to reflectivities), φ s is the stellar azimuth angle, and p is the scattering phase function. Note that our source function does not include an emission term since we are not computing thermal spectra. Recall that the first term in Equation 3 describes directly scattered radiation from the direct solar beam while the final term describes diffusely scattered radiation from the (µ , φ ) direction scattering into the (µ, φ) direction.</p><p>Like most standard tools for solving the radiative transfer equation, we separate treatments of directlyscattered radiation from diffusely-scattered radiation, and, for both, it is convenient to express the scattering phase function in terms of a unique scattering angle, Θ. As single scattered radiation typically has more distinct forward and backward scattering features, we choose to represent the scattering phase function for the direct beam with a two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) phase function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kattawar 1975)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p TTHG (Θ) = f p HG (g f , Θ) + (1 − f )p HG (g b , Θ)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where p HG is the Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function with,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p HG = 1 4π 1 − ¯ g 2 (1 + ¯ g 2 − 2¯ g cos Θ) 3/2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Recall that a TTHG phase function can represent both forward and backward scattering peaks, while the (one term) Henyey-Greenstein phase function only has one peak (typically in the forward direction). In the previous expressions, ¯ g is the asymmetry parameter, f is the forward/backward scatter fraction, g f is the asymmetry parameter for the forward-scattered portion of the TTHG, and g b is the asymmetry parameter for the backwardscattered portion of the TTHG. For the forward and backward scattering portions of the TTHG phase function, we use g f = ¯ g, g b = −¯ g/2, and f = 1 − g 2 b . Substituting these into the TTHG phase function expression yields,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p TTHG = ¯ g 2 4 p HG (−¯ g/2, Θ) + (1 − ¯ g 2 4 )p HG (¯ g, Θ). (6)</formula><p>For radiation that is single-scattered from the solar beam to the observer, the scattering geometry is fixed by the planetary phase angle such that Θ = π − α. Our choice of parameters, and their relation to ¯ g, in the TTHG was designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> to roughly reproduce the phase function of liquid water clouds. This parameterization, however, is different from that proposed by <ref type="bibr">Kat- tawar (1975)</ref>. We do not expect our results to be sensitive to the details of a particular phase function treatment as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al.

In this case, the diffusely-scattered component of the source function is azimuthally averaged. Combined with our representation of the directly-scattered component, we have,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S(τ, µ, µ s , α) = ¯ ω 4π F s · p TTHG (µ, −µ s ) · e −τ /µs + ¯ ω 4π 1 −1 I(τ, µ )p(µ, µ )dµ ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the azimuth-averaged phase functions are given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p(µ, µ ) = 1 2π 2π 0 p(µ, φ, µ , φ)dφ .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>We represent the azimuth-averaged scattering phase functions as a series of Legendre polynomials, P l (µ), expanded to order M with,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p(µ, µ ) = M l=0 g l P l (µ)P l (µ ) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where the phase function moments, g l , are defined according to,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">g l = 2l + 1 2 1 −1 p(cos Θ)P l (cos Θ)d cos Θ .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The first moment of the phase function is related to the asymmetry parameter, with ¯ g = g 1 /3.

The scattering optical depth has contributions from Rayleigh scattering and clouds, so that τ scat = τ Ray + ¯ ω cld τ cld , where ¯ ω cld is the cloud single scattering albedo. The single scattering albedo for a layer is then ¯ ω = τ scat /τ . We determine the asymmetry parameter, ¯ g, with an optical depth weighting on the Rayleigh scattering asymmetry parameter (which is zero) and the cloud scattering asymmetry parameter, yielding ¯ g = ¯ g cld (τ cld /τ scat ). When representing the second moment of the phase function, we use g 2 = 1 2 (τ Ray /τ scat ) so that g 2 tends towards the appropriate value for Rayleigh scattering (i.e., 1/2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Travis 1974)</ref> when the Rayleigh scattering optical depth dominates the scattering optical depth.</p><p>2.2. Model Upgrades As compared to prior investigations that have used the <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> albedo tool (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. 2017</ref>), we have updated the model to include an optional isotropically-reflecting (Lambertian) lower boundary (mimicking a planetary surface), and have added pressure-dependent absorption due to H 2 O, O 3 , O 2 , and CO 2 . CH 4 remains a radiatively active species in the model, as in previous studies. We also include Rayleigh scattering from H 2 O, O 2 , CO 2 , and N 2 (in addition to H 2 and He from previous studies). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref>, we allow for an extended grayscattering cloud in our atmospheres.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref>, their two-layer cloud model atmosphere includes a deeper, optically thick cloud deck that essentially acts as a reflective surface. Unlike the gas giants within that study, though, terrestrial planets have a solid surface we can probe. We characterize our isotropically-reflecting lower boundary using a spherical albedo for the planetary surface, A s , which represents the specific power in scattered, outgoing radiation compared to that in incident radiation. For this study, we simply adopt gray surface albedo values, which reduces complexity and computation time. For the inhomogeneous surface of a realistic Earth, featuring oceans and continents, the surface albedo is wavelength-dependent, and we hope to investigate the significance of such surfaces in future work.</p><p>We undertook a test to check our reflective lower boundary condition in the limit of a transparent atmosphere. Without atmospheric absorption or scattering, our assumption of a Lambertian surface would imply that the reflectivity (or phase function) determined by our albedo code should follow the analytic Lambert phase function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Φ L (α) = sin α + (π − α) cos α π .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Figure 1 compares the model phase function with the analytic phase function and shows complete agreement, confirming that our treatment of the surface is correct.</p><p>Previous work featuring the albedo model adopted here used a pre-defined atmospheric pressure grid. To accommodate the finite surface pressures of rocky planets as well as the various combinations of cloud parameters our retrievals will explore, we instead establish an adaptive method of determining the pressure grid. Here, we divide the atmosphere into a pressure grid of N level , bounded by P = P top at the top of the atmosphere and P = P 0 at the surface. In a cloud-free scenario, we simply divide the atmosphere evenly in log-P space.</p><p>For our simulations that include a single cloud deck, we adaptively determine the pressure value at each level depending on the location, thickness, and optical depth of the cloud. The quantities that define the cloud deck are p t , the cloud-top pressure, dp, the atmospheric pressure across the cloud, and τ , the cloud optical depth. We begin by assigning a number of layers to the cloud, imposing two conditions: (1) there should be at least three model pressure layers to each atmospheric pressure scale height (perH = 3), and (2) the cloud optical depth in a layer must remain below at most 5 (maxtau = 5). This allows us to avoid any one layer from spanning a large extent within the atmosphere, and also avoids cloud layers that have extremely large scattering optical depths.</p><p>When beginning our gridding process, we propose an initial number of cloud layers, N c = perH × numH, where numH = ln pt+dp pt is the number of e-folding distances through the cloud (serving as a proxy for scale height). The aerosol optical depth for each pressure layer within the cloud would then simply be ∆τ = τ Nc . However, if ∆τ &gt; maxtau, we adjust the cloud resolution by increasing N c by a factor of ∆τ maxtau and then round up to the nearest integer. In other words, we increase the resolution of the pressure grid through the cloud until the layer optical depth is under maxtau. We determine successive pressure level values through the cloud with</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p[i] = p[i−1]+∆ ln p,</formula><p>where ∆ ln p = ln (pt+dp)−ln pt Nc , starting from the top of the cloud. We divide the remaining N level − N c levels in uniform ln p space on either side of the cloud, weighted by the number of pressure scale heights above (N t ) and below (N b ) the cloud. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> visualizes the three portions of the atmosphere.</p><p>For simplicity, we assume an isothermal atmosphere (at T = 250 K), as temperature has little effect on the reflected-light spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Robinson 2017)</ref>. Pressure, however, has a strong impact on molecular opacities, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. We incorporated high-resolution pressuredependent opacities for all molecules in our atmosphere. The absorption opacities are generated line-by-line from the HITRAN2012 line list ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rothman et al. 2013</ref>) for seven orders of magnitude in pressure (10 −5 − 10 2 bar) at T , spanning our entire wavelength range at &lt; 1 cm −1 resolution. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> also illustrates how absorption features of H 2 O, O 2 , and O 3 change when in an atmosphere of 1 bar versus one of 10 bar.</p><p>We interpolate our high-resolution opacity tables to the slightly lower resolution of the forward model in order to maintain short model runtimes while not affecting the accuracy of the output spectra. For each model layer, we interpolate over the opacities from our table given the pressure. The chemical abundances in our forward model atmosphere are constant as a function of pressure, and we also adopt a uniform acceleration due to gravity. We have also added an option to include partial cloudiness across a planetary disk, whose fractional coverage is described by f c . To mimic partial cloudiness as we see on Earth, we call the forward model twice. We use the same set of atmospheric and planetary parameters for both calls, except for the cloud optical depth. "Cloudy" is the call that has a non-zero cloud optical depth, while "cloud-free" is the call where we set cloud optical depth to zero. Each call returns a geometric albedo spectrum, and we combine the two sets with the fractional cloudiness parameter such that the combined spectrum follows f c × cloudy + (1 − f c )× cloud-free.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Albedo Model Fiducial Values and Validation</head><p>The generalized three-dimensional albedo model described above can simulate reflected-light spectra of a large diversity of planet types, spanning solid-surfaced worlds to gas giants with a variety of prescribed atmospheric compositions. For the present study, however, we choose to focus on Earth-like worlds, which are described in detail below. Thus, we define a set of fiducial model input parameters that are designed to mimic Earth and thereby enable us to generate simulated observational datasets for an Earth twin. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes the fiducial model parameter values adopted for our Earth twin. Also shown are the priors for these parameters, which we use when performing retrieval analyses. For an Earth-like setup, the surface atmospheric pressure is P 0 = 1 bar and we adopt a surface albedo of A s = 0.05, which is representative of mostly ocean-covered surface. We adopt a uniform acceleration due to gravity of g = 9.8 m s −2 and set the planetary radius to R ⊕ . For convenience, we sometime refer to these four variables (P 0 , A s , g, and R p ) as the bulk planetary and atmospheric parameters.</p><p>We focus on molecular absorption due to H 2 O, O 3 , and O 2 . While our albedo model includes opacities from CH 4 and CO 2 as well, we omit these two species as the reflected-light spectrum of Earth in the visible contains no strong features for these molecules. The input values for the molecular abundances (or volume mixing ratios) are H 2 O = 3 × 10 −3 , O 3 = 7 × 10 −7 , and O 2 = 0.21. These abundance values are based on column weighted averages from a standard Earth model atmosphere with vertically-varying gas mixing ratios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McClatchey et al. 1972</ref>). The primary Rayleigh scatterer and background gas in our fiducial model is N 2 , whose abundance makes up the remainder of the atmosphere after all other gases are accounted for (i.e., roughly 0.79). Rayleigh scattering is treated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Travis (1974)</ref> with constants to describe the scattering properties of N 2 , O 2 , and H 2 O from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen &amp; Cox (2000)</ref>. We do not include polarization or Raman scattering effects.</p><p>Our cloud model was designed to be minimally parametric while still enabling us to sufficiently reproduce realistic spectra of Earth. Our single-layer gray H 2 O cloud has ¯ ω = 1 and ¯ g = 0.85, which are characteristic of water clouds across the visible range. These two parameters were fixed to minimize retrieval model complexity, as we believe that water is the most likely condensate for worlds in the Habitable Zone. Nevertheless, future studies may not wish to assume values of ¯ ω and ¯ g a priori. Cloud top pressure (p t ) and fractional coverage (f c ) are set at 0.6 bar and 50%, respectively, which are roughly consistent with observations of optically thick cloud coverage on Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Stubenrauch et al. 2013</ref>). Cloud thickness (dp) and optical depth (τ ) were set to 0.1 bar and 10, respectively, based on results from the MODIS instrument (http://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov) used in <ref type="bibr">Robin- son et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>With fiducial values chosen, we validate our forward model against a simulated high-resolution diskintegrated spectrum of Earth at full phase, as shown in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> at P = 1 bar and P = 10 bar. For each spectrum here, the atmosphere only contains the stated molecule and a radiatively inactive filler gas to match the pressure. 1996). Intensities from this solver are integrated over the pixels with respect to solid angle, thereby returning a disk-integrated spectrum.</p><p>The sophistication of the Robinson et al. (2011) model makes it unsuitable to retrieval studies, however, as model runtimes are measured in weeks for the highestcomplexity scenarios. This, in part, justifies our adoption of a minimally-parameteric albedo model (whose runtime is measured in seconds). Furthermore, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, our efficient albedo model reproduces all of the key features of the Robinson et al. (2011) model. The most notable differences-that the efficient model, as compared to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Robinson et al. (2011)</ref> model, is more reflective in the blue and less reflective in the red-are simply due to our adoption of a gray surface albedo. Land and plants, which cover roughly 29% of Earth's surface, are generally more reflective in the red than in the blue. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> also compares a spectrum from our forward model against a spectrum of a partially clouded ocean planet generated with the Robinson et al. (2011) model. This ocean world is identical to Earth except for the fact that its surface is covered entirely by an ocean, with no land present. The surface albedo in the ocean model is gray beyond 500 nm; shortward of this the reflectivity increases, likely leading to the discrepancy in our comparison at the bluest wavelengths. Still, with a more accurate match to a planet that has a nearly gray albedo through the visible, we consider our assumption of gray surface albedo to be the main reason for the discrepancies when compared to the Robinson et al. (2011) realistic model. Finally, in our albedo model we set 100 facets for the visible hemisphere and calculate a high-resolution geo-metric albedo spectrum at 1000 wavelength points between 0.35µm and 1.05µm. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref>, we only consider a planet at full phase (α = 0 • ). While direct imaging missions will not obtain observations of exoplanets at full phase, this assumption makes little difference for our results as we are not computing integration times and only work in SNR space. Additionally, as Nayak et al. (2017) followed up <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref> by retrieving phase information from giant planets in reflected light, we anticipate performing a similar expansion in the future. Our forward model has 61 pressure levels in an isothermal atmosphere of 250 K, bounded below by a reflective surface. The top of the atmosphere is set at P top = 10 −4 bar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Retrieval Setup and Noise Model</head><p>We convert a high resolution geometric albedo spectrum to a synthetic planet-to-star flux ratio spectrum given the resolution of an instrument and a noise model. We then apply a Bayesian inference tool on the synthetic data set to sample the posterior probability distributions of the forward model input parameters. To perform Bayesian parameter estimation, we utilize the open-source affine invariant Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler emcee <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goodman &amp; Weare 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). Ensemble refers to the use of many chains, or walkers, to traverse parameter space; as a massively parallelized algorithm, it is computationally efficient. Affine-invariance refers to the invariant performance under linear transformations of parameter space, enabling the algorithm to be insensitive to parameter covariances <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). With a cloudy retrieval, we can expect complex correlations that a sampler should be able to reveal. As it is more agnostic to the shape of the posterior, we choose emcee following <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. (2017)</ref> over Multinest, another sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref> considered that yielded consistent results. The albedo model is coded in Fortran; we convert it into a Python-callable library with the F2PY package. Each call to the forward model takes approximately 10 seconds of clock time on an 8-core processor. To visualize the MCMC results, we utilize the corner plotting package developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Foreman-Mackey (2016)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists the priors for our parameters. We offer a generous range on the molecular abundances; we allow O 2 in particular to be able to dominate the atmospheric composition. Our choice of radius range (0.5-12 R ⊕ ) reflects the range of of planetary sizes from Mars to Jupiter. Also, when performing retrievals, we impose two limiting conditions to maintain physical scenarios. First, we limit the mixing ratio of N 2 , f N2 = 1 − (gas abundances), to be between 0 and 1. Second, for the cloud pressure terms, we reject any drawn value that does not satisfy 10 pt + 10 dp &lt; 10 P0 (i.e., that the cloud base cannot extend below the bottom of the atmosphere). Note that for the purposes of the retrieval, we consider pressures in log space.</p><p>We simulate noise in our observations following the expressions given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson et al. (2016)</ref>. For simplicity, we include only read noise and dark current, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Robinson et al. 2016)</ref> showed that detector noise will be the dominant noise source in WFIRST -type spectral observations of exoplanets. Detector and instrument parameters for the HabEx and LUVOIR concepts are only loosely defined, and advances in detector technologies for these missions may move observations out of the detector-noise dominated regime. In the detector-noise dominated regime the signal-to-noise ratio is simply,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">SNR = c p × t int (c d + c r ) × t int<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where t int is the integration time, c p is planet count rate, and c d is the dark noise count rate, and c r is the read noise count rate. More rigorously, it can be shown that, at constant spectral resolution, SNR ∝ qT A g Φ(α)B λ λ, where q is the wavelength-dependent detector quantum efficiency, T is throughput, and B λ is the host stellar specific intensity (taken here as a Planck function at the stellar effective temperature). We use a stellar temperature of 5780 K for the blackbody. When the SNR at one wavelength is specified, this scaling implies that the the calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio at other wavelengths is independent of the imaging raw contrast of the instrument. We can expect the noise at the redder end of our range to be large, as the detector quantum efficiency (taken to be appropriate for the WFIRST/CGI) rapidly decreases. Since we treat only SNR rather than modeling exposure times, the exact mix of noise sources is not relevant (so that, e.g., dark current and readnoise are indistinguishable). The key relevant properties of the noise model is that it is uncorrelated between spectral channels and its magnitude only depends on wavelength via a dependence on point spread function area (Robinson et al. 2016, their Equation 26), which will be true for detector-limited cases but may not be true for largeaperture instruments limited by speckle noise. For our study, we will consider multiple wavelength resolutions, R, and SNRs. Working in SNRs (instead of integration times) makes our investigations independent of telescope diameter, target distance, and other system-specific or observing parameters. Because the SNR is dependent on wavelength, we reference our values to be at V-band (550 nm) for all resolutions for HabEx/LUVOIR. Since the WFIRST/CGI spectrograph is currently planned to only extend to 600 nm at the blue end, we opt to reference our WFIRST SNRs to this wavelength. Unlike previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. 2017</ref>), our simulated WFIRST rendezvous data include two photometric points in the blue, which is consistent with current CGI designs. We set the SNR in the WFIRST filters to be equal to that at 600 nm.</p><p>Our simulation grid setup is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, where the spectral resolutions and SNRs assumed for different observing scenarios are indicated. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates the WFIRST rendezvous scenario data along with R = 70 and R = 140 data points (for HabEx/LUVOIR) plotted over the forward model spectrum before noise is added. The scaling of SNR with wavelength for WFIRST rendezvous (normalized to unity at 600 nm) as well as our R = 70 and R = 140 cases (normalized to unity at 550 nm) is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The impact of the host stellar SED sets the overall shape of the SNR scaling, with additional influence from atmospheric absorption bands detector as well as quantum efficiency effects (that have strong impacts at red wavelengths).

Previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. 2017)</ref> have generated a single, randomized dataset for a given SNR. The placement of a single spectral data point is determined by randomly sampling a Gaussian distribution whose width is determined by the wavelength-dependent SNR. While this treatment can accurately simulate a single observational instance, it also runs the risk (especially at lower spectral resolution and SNR) of biasing retrieval results, as the random placement of only a small handful of spectral data points can significantly impact the outcome. Given this, it is ideal to retrieve on a large number ( 10) of simulated data sets at a given spectral resolution and SNR, where a comprehensive view of all the posteriors from the collection of instances will indicate expected telescope/instrument performance. Unfortunately, given the large number of R/SNR pairs in our study (10) and the long runtime of an individual retrieval (of order 1 week on a cluster), running ∼10 noise instances for each of our R/SNR pairs is computationally unfeasible (requiring ∼100 weeks of cluster time). Thus, we opt for an intermediate approach that maintains computational feasibility and avoids potential bi-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>ases from individual noise instances. Here, we run only a single noise instance at a given R/SNR pair, but we do not randomize the placement of the individual spectral points. In other words, the individual simulated spectral points are placed on the "true" planet-to-star flux ratio point and are assigned error bars according to the SNR and noise model. While this approach prevents having a small handful of randomized data points from biasing retrieval results, it does lead to likely optimistic results, especially at modest SNR (i.e., SNR∼10), since data point randomization is, in effect, an additional "noise" source that we are omitting. This means that the posterior distributions will usually be centered on the true values in an unrealistic fashion. However, the width and shape of the posterior covariances will be representative of real observations, so the fidelity of retrievals can be assessed. We keep this optimism in mind when discussing results in later sections; in particular, we compare the performance <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.-Scaling of SNR with wavelength for WFIRST rendezvous, R = 70, and R = 140 cases. The WFIRST curve is normalized to unity at 600 nm while the R = 70 and R = 140 curves are normalized to unity at 550 nm, following our definite of simulation SNR at these respective wavelengths.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RETRIEVAL VALIDATION</head><p>Before using our framework on simulated data, we validate its accuracy and examine its performance. For this initial validation, we use non-randomized, wavelengthindependent noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 for a spectrum at a resolution of R = 140. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> lists our four validation model variants, each increasing in complexity as we systematically explore how the addition of retrieved parameters influences the posterior distributions and correlations. In Model I, we fix all parameters except P 0 and A s . In Model II, we add g and R p ; in Model III, we then add in gases as retrieved parameters (H 2 O, O 3 , O 2 ); and in Model IV, we add all cloud parameters. Incrementally increasing the number of free parameters (from 2 to 11) allows us to see the interconnections between them, and helps us understand how clouds can obscure our inferences.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>, we present the posterior distributions for Model I. In the two-dimensional correlation histogram, a higher probability corresponds to a darker shade. With all else held constant, we see narrow posterior distributions and a slight correlation between P 0 and A s . For lower values of surface pressure, which controls the turn off of the Rayleigh scattering slope, we need a brighter surface to maintain the measured brightness, especially in the red end of the spectrum, and vice versa. We mark the 16%, 50%, and 84% quantiles in the marginalized one-dimensional posterior distributions. The posterior distributions for Model II are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, and are generally narrow (as only four parameters are being retrieved). There are two key correlations, one between g and P 0 , and one between R p and A s . Both gravity and surface pressure influence the column mass, so that, when attempting to fit a spectrum, we can trade a larger gravity with a larger surface pressure and maintain a similar column mass (which controls, e.g., the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, where we fix all parameters but P 0 and As. We retrieve on R = 140, SNR = 20 data with wavelength-independent noise. Overplotted in solid light-blue color are the fiducial parameter values. The 2D marginalized posterior distribution, used in interpreting correlations, is overplotted with the 1-, 2-, and 3-σ contours. Above the 1D marginalized posterior for each parameter, we list the median retrieved value with uncertainties that indicate the 68% confidence interval. Dashed lines (left to right) mark the 16%, 50%, and 84% quantiles.</p><p>Rayleigh scattering feature). Additionally, we can trade off a larger reflecting surface area (i.e., larger R p ) with a darker surface (lower A s ), which is a statement of the typical "radius/albedo degeneracy" problem. The posterior for surface albedo is now an upper limit instead of a constraint. As a result, the radius posterior distribution appears truncated at larger values given the tight correlation between these two parameters. The correlation seen originally in Model I, between P 0 and A s , then acts as a chain between the other two, more prominent, correlations to induce correlations between parameters such as A s and g or R p and P 0 .</p><p>Once we allow gases to be free parameters in Model III <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 9</ref>), the P 0 and A s correlation becomes diminished as H 2 O, due to its numerous bands across the spectral range, becomes a primary control of brightness. The significant impact of H 2 O on the spectrum leads to a strong, positive correlation between H 2 O abundance and planetary size, as additional water vapor absorption can be compensated by a larger planetary size to maintain fixed brightness. We now see gravity linked to the molecular abundances, which is expected as surface gravity directly influences the column abundance of a species. This key correlation also causes the individual gas abundances to be correlated with each other. The main correlations from Model II are still present. We note once more that we do not have constraint on the surface albedo, again leading to an asymmetric distribution for radius. Thus, from the strong correlation of H 2 O with with R p , and the fundamental correlation between R p and A s , we see correlations between planetary radius, surface albedo, and all gas abundances. Weak correlations between surface pressure and the gas abundances are due to column abundance effects.</p><p>Finally, as shown by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we retrieve on the data with the full forward model, adding in the cloud parameters p t , dp, τ , and f c . This version of the model is what we apply when simulating direct-imaging data in the upcoming sections, and represents our most realistic (i.e., true to the actual Earth) scenario. The optical depth is shown to only have a lower limit constraint. Thus, the retrieval detects a cloud but cannot constrain the optical depth beyond showing that the cloud is optically thick. There is an expected correlation between τ and f c ; a higher cloudiness fraction can complement a less optically thick cloud, and vice versa. There is only an upper limit to dp, which is a result of the lack of vertical sensitivity given the constant-with-pressure abundance distributions. The posterior distribution for O 2 becomes a lower limit instead of a constraint as in Model III. Surface gravity is less precisely and less accurately constrained compared to the previous, less complex renditions of the model.</p><p>For optically thin clouds, we expect to better constrain surface albedo; however, we do not consider this scenario in our study. We examined instead the performance of a completely cloud-free model on data generated with our cloudy model. We find that while the model can fit the data and return accurate estimates of e.g., the mixing ratios, we get inaccurate estimates of the surface albedo and the surface pressure. These two parameters are biased, with lower surface pressure paired with higher surface albedo as the preferred configuration in the cloudfree case. As a result, we move forward with utilizing our cloudy forward model on our simulated data. However, we note that in realistic cases where we do not know the true state of a planet's atmosphere, we could obtain complementary information relating to the presence of clouds (e.g., variability) such that we may choose the most appropriate forward model.</p></div>

We use the term "constraint" to indicate a detection whose posterior distribution has 1-σ width smaller than an order of magnitude. A non-detection would be indicated by a flat posterior distribution across the entire (or nearentire) prior range. For planetary radius, which is not retrieved in logarithmic space, we distinguish between a "detection" and a "constraint" when the 1-σ uncertainties are small enough to firmly place the planet in the Earth/super-Earth regime (i.e., with a radius below 1.5R ⊕ , Rogers 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chen &amp; Kipping 2017)</ref>.

As SNR increases to 10, the O 3 posterior distribution has a weak peak near the fiducial value, and the gas is only weakly detected. Once the SNR is equal to 15, we weakly detect H 2 O, O 3 , and O 2 . At a SNR of 20, it is possible to detect each of H 2 O, O 3 , and O 2 . At this SNR, the oxygen mixing ratio is estimated to be above roughly 10 −3 , indicating that we are unable to determine if O 2 is a major atmospheric constituent (i.e., present at the 1% level or more). Gravity (and, thus, planetary mass) remain undetected at all SNRs, similar to the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref>. The surface albedo is unconstrained (or worse) at all SNRs, but shows a weak bias toward a higher value of A s ≈ 0.3 (log A s ≈ −0.5) at the highest SNRs, which is likely due to the relatively large error bars at red wavelengths (driven primarily by low detector quantum efficiency) where we have the most sensitivity to the surface. We are able to get weak detections of τ and f c , which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> to be correlated. Yet, with these posteriors, we cannot rule out scenarios without cloud cover. We note the drop-off in the posteriors of p t and dp at higher pressure values likely result from the limiting conditions that the cloud base cannot extend below the surface pressure and the upper limit of the P 0 prior. The improved signal-to-noise ratio leads to a posterior more concentrated around the true value for p t , dp, and R p . For improved constraints on cloud properties, it may be beneficial to observe time variability with photometry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ford et al. 2001</ref>) or use polarimetry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rossi &amp; Stam 2017)</ref>.</p></div>

Moving to SNR = 15 adds a constraint to R p , P 0 , and O 3 , as well as weak detections of cloud parameters. Increasing the SNR to 20 does not dramatically change the posterior distributions, although the posteriors for H 2 O and O 2 become narrow enough to offer constraints. Here, the constraint on O 2 suggests it is a major constituent in the atmosphere. In spite of the generous SNR, though, the 1-σ uncertainties on the gas mixing ratios are not more precise than roughly an order of magnitude (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>).</p><p>Considering both R = 140 and R = 70, we see that SNR = 5 data offer very little information about the planetary atmosphere. In the case of R = 140, SNR = 10 data offer detections but no constraints, and SNR = 20 data are required to constrain all included gas species. In other words, the conclusions we would draw about the planet (e.g., the amount of gases, the bulk and cloud properties) improve significantly between SNR = 10 and SNR = 20. With R = 70, the boost from SNR = 10 to SNR = 15 provides weak detections of key atmospheric and surface parameters, and SNR = 20 data offer detections but few constraints (i.e., except on planetary radius).</p><p>For the WFIRST rendezvous data sets, we are able to infer very little information at a SNR of 5 or 10 except for weak detection of surface pressure and a detection of the planetary radius. All gases remain undetected at these SNRs. The posterior distributions for most parameters do not vary much as SNR improves, although there are weak detections of cloud optical depth and fractional coverage at the highest SNRs. Like all previous cases, we do not detect the surface gravity. At SNR = 15, 20, the detection of f c is unable to rule out scenarios with little cloud cover.

While this comparison sheds light on the corresponding trade-off in terms of parameter estimation for the same SNR, these cases do not represent equal integration times, which scales with resolution and SNR. If the dominant noise source does not depend on resolution (e.g., detector noise), the cases of R = 140 at SNR = 10, R = 70 at SNR = 20, and R = 50 at SNR = 28 would be roughly equal in integration times. However, if the dominant noise source does depend on resolution (e.g., exozodiacal dust), the cases of R = 140 at SNR = 10, R = 70 at SNR = 14, and R = 50 at SNR = 17 would roughly have equivalent integration times.

The noticeable difference is a weak detection of O 3 with R = 70. Because we adopt the photometric setup from WFIRST Design Cycle 7 through the shorter wavelengths, the data do not provide complete spectroscopic coverage across the significant O 3 feature from 0.5 − 0.7 µm, as in the case of HabEx/LUVOIR simulated data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the sampling of the forward model spectrum for the three types of data sets we considered.

To work within our computational restric-tions, we realized that cases such as R = 70 with SNR = 5 yielded little detection information for any parameter even in the ideal scenario of non-randomized data. We then decided to focus on two "threshold" cases based on the results from the non-randomized data: R = 140 with SNR = 10 and R = 70 with SNR = 15. We ran 10 noise instances of these two cases where it is likely the optimistic non-randomized data makes the difference between detection and constraint for several parameters (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 7 and 8)</ref>.</p><p>Each noise instance is run for at least 10000 steps in emcee. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows all the individual posteriors for the gas mixing ratios from each noise instance for R = 70, SNR = 15. We highlight the posteriors from one "outlier" case where there is no oxygen detection. The corresponding set of data points are shown as well. This highlights the fact that single noise instances can mislead our interpretation and the benefit of having many noise instances run to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the state of an atmosphere.</p><p>To summarize the noise instance results, we concatenate samples from the last 1000 steps in each noise instance and construct an averaged set of posteriors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Implications for Future Direct Imaging Missions</head><p>Future space-based direct imaging missions will have a diversity of goals for exoplanet studies, and will likely emphasize the detection and characterization of Earthlike exoplanets. For the detection of oxygen and ozonewhich are key biosignature gases-in the atmospheres of Earth twins, our results indicate that spectra at a minimum characteristic SNR of 10 will suffice if at R = 140, while data at SNR of at least 15-20 would be needed at R = 70. For a WFIRST rendezvous-like observing setup, these gases would only be weakly detected even at a SNR of 20. Methane, which is another important biosignature gas, has no strong signatures in the visible wavelength range for the modern Earth, so we did not consider detection of this gas. Thus, we could not use our simulated data and retrievals to argue for detections of atmospheric chemical disequilibrium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sagan et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Krissansen-Totton et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Key habitability indicators include atmospheric water vapor and surface pressure. Detecting the former requires a SNR of 15-20 at R = 70, but only a SNR of 10 at R = 140. Surface pressure can be constrained to within an order of magnitude for SNR 15 at R = 140, although the overall lack of temperature information in these reflected-light spectra would make it impossible to use pressure/temperature data to argue for habitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Robinson 2017</ref>). Surface temperature information may then need to come from climate modeling investigations that are constrained by retrieved gas mixing ratios.</p><p>For all of our observing setups, the data yield detections of, and in some cases constraints on, the planetary radius. Except at SNR of 20 for R = 70 or SNR &gt; 15 for R = 140, the posterior distributions are not wellenough constrained to distinguish a Earth/super-Earth (R p &lt; 1.5 R ⊕ ) from a mini-Neptune based on size alone, although the data do rule out planetary sizes larger than Neptune. Additional atmospheric information (e.g., composition) could potentially be used to help distinguish between terrestrial planets and mini-Neptunes. These findings are consistent with the gas giant-focused work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. (2017)</ref>, who note that observations at multiple phase angles can also help to better constrain planetary size. Our overall lack of surface gravity constraints, paired with the weak constraints on planet size, implies that we do not have a constraint on the planetary mass. Follow-up (or precursor) radial velocity observations (or, potentially, astrometric observations) could offer additional constraints on planet mass.</p><p>We can make rough comparisons of our R/SNR results to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brandt &amp; Spiegel (2014)</ref>, who used minimally parametric models to investigate detections of O 2 and H 2 O for Earth twins. These comparisons are not direct, however, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brandt &amp; Spiegel (2014)</ref> were fitting for fewer parameters (8 versus our 11) and also only assumed that SNR was proportional to planetary reflectance (versus our more complicated scaling, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). <ref type="bibr">For O 2 , Brandt &amp; Spiegel (2014)</ref> find R = 150 and SNR = 6 for a 90% detection probability, which is consistent with our R = 140 posteriors moving from a nondetection at SNR = 5 to a detection at SNR = 10. When investigating H 2 O, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brandt &amp; Spiegel (2014)</ref> find R = 40 and SNR = 7.5 or R = 150 and SNR = 3.3 for a 90% detection probability. Using <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> to scale our SNRs to 890 nm (i.e., to the continuum just shortward of 950 nm water vapor band), at R = 50 we only find a weak detection of H 2 O for SNR 890 nm = 10, and at R = 140 we transition from a water vapor non-detection to detection between a SNR 890 nm of 2.5-5. Taken altogether, these comparisons indicate that we agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brandt &amp; Spiegel (2014)</ref> at higher spectral resolution (R = 140-150), but that detection of H 2 O at lower spectral resolution (R = 50) will likely require higher SNRs than originally indicated.</p><p>The discussion above emphasizes mere detections, not constraints (which, again, we define as having peaked posterior distributions with 1-σ widths less than an order of magnitude).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Impacts of Model Assumptions</head><p>Several key assumptions adopted in this study warrant further comment. First, as noted earlier, we do not retrieve on planetary phase angle and planet-star distance, both of which influence the planet-to-star flux ratio. Thus, in effect, we are assuming that the planetary system has been revisited multiple times for photometric and astrometric measurements, such that the planetary orbit is reasonably well-constrained (i.e., that the orbital distance and phase angle are not the dominant sources of uncertainty when interpreting the observed planet-to-star flux ratio spectrum). If the orbit is not well-constrained, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. (2017)</ref> showed that strong correlations can exist between the retrieved phase angle and the planet radius.</p><p>Second, we have assumed detector-dominated noise and a quantum efficiency appropriate for the WFIRST/CGI for all of our observational setups. While this is likely a fair assumption for our WFIRST rendezvous studies, it is likely that detector development will lead to major improvements in instrumentation for a HabEx/LUVOIR-like mission. Here, the rapid decrease into the red due to detector quantum efficiency may not be as dramatic, implying that spectra would have relatively more information content at red wavelengths as compared to the present study. Furthermore, a HabEx/LUVOIR-like mission may no longer be in the detector-dominated noise regime. In the limit of noise dominated by astrophysical sources (e.g., exo-zodiacal light or stellar leakage), the SNR only varies as √ qT B λ . Finally, we adopt a relatively simple parameterization of cloud three-dimensional structure. Specifically, we allow for only a single cloud deck in the atmosphere, and we then permit these clouds to have some fractional cover- Noise instance median Non-random median Input Non-random Combined (c) R = 140, SNR= 10: Combined gas mixing ratio posteriors from 10 noise instances <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 18</ref>.-The combined posteriors distributions from 10 noise instances of R = 140, SNR= 10 compared to the posteriors from the non-randomized data set (see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>).

This parameterization of fractional cloudiness implies uniform latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of patchy clouds. In reality, clouds on Earth have a complex distribution in altitude, latitude, and longitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Stubenrauch et al. 2013</ref>), and variations in time also have an observational impact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cowan et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cowan &amp; Fujii 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY</head><p>We have developed a retrieval framework for constraining atmospheric properties of an Earth-like exoplanet observed with reflected light spectroscopy spanning the visible range (0.4 − 1.0µm). We have upgraded an existing, well-tested albedo model to generate high-resolution geometric albedo spectra used to simulate data at resolutions and quality relevant to future telescopes, such as the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts. We combined our albedo model with Bayesian inference techniques and applied MCMC sampling to perform parameter estimation. The data we considered were for WFIRST paired with a starshade (i.e., the rendezvous scenario), R = 70, and R = 140 at SNR= 5, 10, 15, 20. We validated our forward model, and we demonstrated the successful application of our retrieval approach by gradually adding complexity to our inverse analyses.</p><p>Following work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lupu et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nayak et al. (2017)</ref>, who have constructed a retrieval framework for gas giants in refleted light, we made several modifications to the albedo model featured in these previous studies. Our model has a reflective surface, absorption due to water vapor, oxygen, and ozone, Rayleigh scattering from nitrogen and other key gases, pressure-dependent opacities, an adaptive pressure grid, and a single-layer water vapor cloud layer with fractional cloudiness. We performed our retrievals with the goal of estimating our ability to detect and constrain the atmosphere of an Earth twin. We found that R = 70, SNR = 15 data allowed us to weakly detect surface pressure as well as water vapor, ozone, and oxygen. At R = 140, we found that SNR = 10 was needed to more firmly detect these parameters. At R = 140, a SNR of 20 was needed to constrain key planetary parameters, and R = 70 data at this SNR offered extremely few constraints. A WFIRST rendezvous scenario, with its photometric points and lower resolution spectrum (R = 50), is only able to offer limited diagnostic information. For example, at SNR = 10, we only weakly detect and detect surface pressure and planetary radius, respectively. To weakly detect the gases, WFIRST rendezvous data needed to be at least SNR = 20. Throughout our runs, we found that we are unable to accurately constrain surface albedo or place estimates on the surface gravity, although we can straightforwardly rule out planetary sizes above roughly the radius of Uranus or Neptune.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that direct imaging of Earthlike exoplanets in reflected light offers a promising path forward for detecting and constraining atmospheric biosignature gases. Instrument spectral resolution for future missions strongly impacts requisite SNRs for detection and characterization, and this must be taken into consideration during mission design. Thus, the scientific yield of future space-based exoplanet direct imaging missions can only be maximized by simultaneously considering mission characterization goals, integration time constraints, and instrument spectral performance.</p><p>YKF is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant DGE1339067.
