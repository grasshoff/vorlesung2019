<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Progress since "New Worlds, New Horizons"</head><p>The hunt for exomoons started more intensively around 10 years ago and was boosted by the launch of the Kepler mission (e..g, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipping 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kipping et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heller et al., 2014</ref>). Constraints on the presence of Gailean-sized moons interior to 1 AU is one of the results of this search, together with the finding of the best exomoon candidate found so far, Kepler-1625 b-i ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Teachey et al. 2018</ref>). When it comes to trojans, the large amount of data gathered so far to detect extrasolar planets and to precisely measure their properties has also allowed a search for trojan bodies using different techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ford et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford et al., , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leleu et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leleu et al., , 2017</ref> The presence of hot and cold gas in the system, as well as evidence of material surrounding the star such as the infrared excesses produced by debris disc can also probe the presence of exocometary material (Rebollido 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key scientific questions for the next decades</head><p>Despite the progress done so far and very briefly summarized in the previous section, still many scientific questions remain unanswered. In most cases, this is due to the inability of current technology to easily detect these minor bodies as we have started to do with planets.</p><p>In the following, we identify some of the most relevant scientific challenges related to the three main types of minor bodies present on planetary systems that remain unsolved and that would need intense observational and theoretical effort within the next decades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exomoons:</head><p>• Formation pathways for large moons.-Regular satellites, such as those of Jupiter, are thought to have formed in-situ, which is hypothesized to limit their growth to ~10,000 th the mass of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Canup &amp; Ward 2002)</ref>, but an extrasolar observational test of this remains absent. Other mechanisms clearly exist too, such as captures and impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor et al. 2010</ref>). Here, it is not well-understood how large such moons could become. Extrasolar examples would strongly inform the viable pathways building large, potentially habitable, moons and even the possibility of binary planets.</p><p>• Survival statistics.-It has become clear that both within the Solar System and beyond, planetary migration is likely a universal and critical process behind the observed architectures. The survival of moons in such systems is far less well studied and empirical studies using Kepler data suggest that Gailean-sized moons seem not to be common interior to 1 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Teachey et al. 2018</ref>). Under what conditions and via what mechanism are they lost? What possibly multi-variate boundary which delineates their survival?</p><p>• Exomoon properties.-In the Solar System, the majority of moons have higher ice contents than that of the terrestrial planets due to their location beyond the snow line. Further, only Titan possesses a thick atmosphere. Are these patterns typical? Almost everything about the planets in the Solar System appear to buck the trends of typical exoplanets and there appears no clear basis to believe exomoons will not similarly surprise us. Also, tidal heating plays a central role for moons such as Io and Europa and may even permit habitability under certain conditions. Could tidally heated moons be another unusual quirk of the Solar System?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exotrojans:</head><p>• Formation.-Several formation mechanisms have been proposed in the past decades.(mainly in situ formation and capture; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Laughlin &amp; Chambers, 2002</ref>, and references therein). However, none of them seem to be predominant in the Solar System. So, what is the predominant mechanism (if any) in general? When are they formed?</p><p>• Properties.-The properties of trojan bodies are presumably related to their formation mechanism. Is it possible to form planet-or moon-size trojans? Under which conditions can they remain stable? Can we expect larger trojans in other systems?</p><p>• Habitability.-Trojan co-orbiting with massive planets in the habitable zone (currently some tens of planets discovered are in the conservative and optimistic HZ) could potentially be also habitable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dvorak et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2016)</ref>. Several additional questions need to be addressed before considering trojans as potential habitable worlds. Assuming they can grow up to moon or planet-size, can they form and retain an atmosphere? what would be the source of the atmospheric components (e.g., impacts with other smaller trojans, outgassing from vulcanism processes, etc.)? At first, these questions need to be addressed theoretically. Observationally, the detection of the first exotrojans and their atmospheric characterization (as we will do with Earth-analogs using the forthcoming instrumentation as JWST or E-ELT) can provide hints to theoretical models. Additionally, trojans can be trapped into spin-orbit resonances different from the synchronous state thanks to the co-orbital motion. This implies that even if the habitable zone of a star is located within the area when we believe that the planet would be tidally locked in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (like most of TRAPPIST-1 planets), the co-orbital motion can actually allow the repartition of the insolation on the entire surface of the planet (creating day/night cycles), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia &amp; Robutel (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Leleu et al. (2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exocomets:</head><p>• Formation and evolution: Comets might be a result of either the interruption of pebble accretion process or the leftovers of a destructive collision between planets or protoplanets. But, when do comets appear the in the systems and how long they survive? • Exocometary environments: Exocomets are found around 20 stars, most of them A-type. Is this an observational bias? Further investigation in a range of stellar temperatures and also theoretical models of comet survival and gas removal are still needed. Also, the necessity of photometric follow up of those targets could be satisfied with the new upcoming missions for exocomet survey. A combined spectroscopic and photometric observations of exocometbearing stars in order to better constrain the system's properties would be extremely helpful since transits allow a better determination of the mass of the comets, while spectroscopic follow up could determine the orbits and the composition.</p><p>• Upcoming missions : Since exocomets are only found in bright, hot stars, they can't be observed with Kepler or Gaia. Upcoming missions like TESS and Plato, will allow a much lower magnitude range (up to 4 mag), making it possible to observe some of these stars in photometry from space. Also, JWST will allow observations of much fainter debris disc, since its much larger aperture increases several orders of magnitude its sensitivity. Ground based telescopes like E-ELT harboring high-resolution spectrographs will also enhance the sample of exocomet-bearing stars. These new missions will allow to investigate a possible relation between the presence of exocomets and planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key technological challenges for the next decades</head><p>In order to achieve the above scientific goals, besides the theoretical works, new instrumentation and new technology is required to routinely detect these minor bodies in extrasolar planetary systems. Given the expected sizes of exomoons and exotrojans (from Moon to Earth radii), we foresee the transit technique to be the most efficient one. Since these bodies will be searched in known planetary systems, the advantage is that we can constrain the locations where to look for. In this regard, the technological stoppers at present are: the photometric precision that we can achieve and the time span of the monitoring. Kepler was sensitive enough to see Earth-sized moons in most cases ( <ref type="bibr">Kipping et al., 2017)</ref> and Galileansized moons when planets were stacked together into similar-type bins ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Teachey et al., 2018)</ref>. But detecting a single Europa-sized moon around a typical gas giant remains far too challenging for either Kepler or TESS. The photometric precision needed to detect such small bodies goes below the 1 part per million (ppm), around one order of magnitude smaller than Kepler, TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO (a Moon-size body eclipsing a solar-like star induces 6 ppm). Reaching such precision we can measure precisely planet radii and consequently planet densities that will better constrain planet composition in the rocky regime.</p><p>Regarding the RV technique, the effect of exomoons on the RV of the star is several orders of magnitude smaller than the current foreseen precision of state-of-the-art instrumentation (like ESPRESSO). As proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cabrera et al. (2007)</ref>, the only foreseeable option to detect the radial velocity effect of an exomoon would be to see the planet-moon system as a binary (e.g., the Saturn-Titan system would have 2 m/s variations). This would require detecting the planet reflection with very high signal-to-noise ratio and fed its light to high-resolution spectrographs. The instrumentation necessary to reach these goals is now getting into place by combining instruments like SPHERE and ESPRESSO or GPI and HIRES but still few targets will be accessible even with the extremely large (40m-class) telescopes. In the case of trojans and comets, however, high-resolution spectroscopy can detect very small bodies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leleu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lillo-Box et al., 2018)</ref>. The limitation here is the amount of available time.</p><p>To detect a significant amount of these objects, large surveys or dedicated missions should be planned. In particular, multi-object high-resolution spectroscopy from space to achieve highprecision RVs in all-sky surveys (the radial velocity counterpart of the Kepler mission) would be a major step and would open a new era in the exploration of planetary systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Minor bodies of our Solar System are thought to be crucial to understand life emergence and evolution on Earth, and they are a key components of our planetary system. Consequently their search around other stars (now that we have crossed the crystal roof of rocky planet detection) becomes a natural next step in exoplanet exploration. It is important to understand that despite having make an enormous improve in the study of planetary systems, the questions answered so far are still general and the starting point to many detailed studies, while being fundamental to the understanding of the emergence of life on Earth. As an example, the existence of the Moon is listed as one of the key factors for the stabilization of the precession over long time-scales and the evolution of life. Of course, the forthcoming missions planned to be launched (in particular JWST and TESS) in the following years will also push the limits of our understanding of planetary systems in all these questions. The next generation of space-based missions and technology should address the different limitations we will still have after the planned missions, such us better photometric precision (down to 1 ppm), multi-target high-precision radial velocity measurements or long-baseline optical and radio interferometry from the space. These three requirements would be key to be able to continue our search for life in the Solar neighborhood and beyond.</p></div>		</body>
