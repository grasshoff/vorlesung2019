			<abstract>
				<p>Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here, we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 µm stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find stellar contamination can be more than 10× larger than transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1&apos;s rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions f spot = 8 +18 −7 % and faculae covering fractions f f ac = 54 +16 −46 %. The associated stellar contamination signals alter transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15 × the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of ∆(ρ) = −3 +3 −8 % , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.</p>

During a transit, exoplanets appear larger at some wavelengths due to absorption or scattering of starlight by their atmospheres. The scale of the signal depends inversely on the square of the stellar radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Miller-Ricci et al. 2009</ref>), prompting a focus on studying exoplanets around M dwarf stars.</p><p>A rapidly growing number of exciting M dwarf exoplanet systems hosting super-Earth and Earthmass planets have been discovered to date, including GJ 1132b ), LHS 1140b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dittmann et al. 2017)</ref>, and the TRAPPIST-1 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gillon et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luger et al. 2017)</ref>, an ultracool dwarf only 12 parsecs away hosting a system of seven transiting Earth-sized planets. The low densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets may indicate high volatile contents, and as many as three of them may have surface temperatures temperate enough for long-lived liquid water to exist ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>). Frequent flaring ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vida et al. 2017</ref>) and strong XUV radiation from the host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wheatley et al. 2017</ref>), however, can lead to significant water loss for these planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bolmont et al. 2017)</ref>, and 3D climate modeling suggests TRAPPIST-1e provides the best opportunity for present-day surface water and an Earth-like temperature in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wolf 2017)</ref>.</p><p>While M dwarf exoplanets provide an excellent opportunity to study small and cool exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barstow &amp; Irwin 2016)</ref>, they also represent a significant challenge. Spots with covering fractions as low as 1% on M dwarfs introduce radial velocity jitter that can mask the presence of habitable zone Earth-sized exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andersen &amp; Korhonen 2015)</ref>. Variability monitoring suggests 1-3% of M dwarfs have spot covering fractions of 10% or more ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Goulding et al. 2012</ref>). In addition to radial velocity jitter, unocculted spots also introduce errors in wavelength-dependent planetary radii recovered from transit observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pont et al. 2008</ref>). Given the dependence of density calculations on measurements of exoplanet radii (ρ ∝ R −3 ), any errors in radius determinations are amplified by a factor of 3 in the estimate of the exoplanet bulk density and can lead to significant consequences for the development of accurate exoplanet models.</p><p>Unocculted spots are one manifestation of a generic issue with transit observations that we term the transit light source effect <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>): Any transmission spectroscopic measurement relies on measuring the difference between the incident and transmitted light to identify the absorbers present in the media studied (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sea- ger &amp; Sasselov 2000)</ref>. The level of accuracy with which the incident spectrum is known will directly determine the level of accuracy with which the transmitted light is understood. In the transiting exoplanet case, the incident light is measured by observing the disk-integrated stellar spectrum before the transit (e.g., Brown 2001), the assumption being that the disk-integrated spectrum is identical to the light incident on the planetary atmosphere. However, this is only an approximation: the planet is not occulting the entire stellar disk but only a small region within the transit chord at a given time. Thus, the light source for the transmission measurement is a small time-varying annulus within the stellar disk defined by the planet's projection, the spectrum of which may differ significantly from the disk-averaged spectrum. Such differences are expected due to the fact that stellar atmospheres are rarely perfectly homogeneous, as illustrated by spatially resolved observations of the Sun (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Llama &amp; Shkolnik 2015</ref>. Cool stellar spots (umbra and penumbra), hot faculae, and even latitudinal temperature gradients will result in a spectral mismatch, even if some of these will not be evident in broad-band photometric light curves.</p><p>The Sun displays a clear latitudinal dependence of active regions that gives rise to the so-called butterfly diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Maunder 1922;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Babcock 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mandal et al. 2017</ref>). Transiting exoplanets have been proposed to be tools to probe the latitudinal and temporal distributions of active regions in other stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dittmann et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Llama et al. 2012</ref>). High-resolution transit observations can be used to spatially resolve the emergent stellar spectrum along the transit path of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cauley et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dravins et al. 2017a,b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Morris et al. (2017)</ref> recently utilized the highly misaligned exoplanet HAT-P-11b to probe the starspot radii and latitudinal distribution of its K4 dwarf host star and found that, much like the Sun, spots on HAT-P-11 emerge preferentially at two low latitudes. In general, however, orbital planes of transiting exoplanets tend to be more aligned with stellar rotation axes than that of HAT-P-11b, displaying obliquities of 20 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al. 2017</ref>). To complicate matters further, unlike the Sun and HAT-P-11, M dwarfs may exhibit spots at all latitudes ( ). Thus, stellar latitudes sampled by transit chords may not provide a representative picture of photospheric active regions.</p><p>Correcting transmission spectra for photospheric heterogeneities within the transit chord, such as spots (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pont et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Llama &amp; Shkolnik 2015</ref>) and faculae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Oshagh et al. 2014</ref>), is possible, provided they are large  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A Schematic of the Transit Light Source Effect. During a transit, exoplanet atmospheres are illuminated by the portion of a stellar photosphere immediately behind the exoplanet from the point of view of the observed. Changes in transit depth must be measured relative to the spectrum of this light source. However, the light source is generally assumed to be the disk-integrated spectrum of the star. Any differences between the assumed and actual light sources will lead to apparent variations in transit depth.</p><p>enough to produce an observable change in the light curve during the transit. Modulations in the shape of the transit light curve can be used to constrain the temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sing et al. 2011</ref>) and size <ref type="bibr">(Béky et al. 2014</ref>) of the occulted photospheric feature, which determine its contribution to the transmission spectrum, or more simply, time points including the crossing event may be excluded from the transit fit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Carter et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Narita et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Unocculted heterogeneities, however, represent a more pathological manifestation of the transit light source effect because they do not produce temporal changes in the observed light curve. Previous attempts to correct for unocculted photospheric features have largely relied on photometric monitoring of the exoplanet host star to ascertain the extent of photospheric heterogeneities present ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pont et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pont et al. , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berta et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Désert et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Knutson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Narita et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nascimbeni et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zellem et al. 2015</ref>). This approach is limited in two respects: 1) rotational variability monitoring traces only the non-axisymmetric component of the stellar heterogeneity (Jackson &amp; Jeffries 2012), i.e., any persistent, underlying level of heterogeneity will not be detectable with variability monitoring; and 2) the source of the variability is commonly assumed to be a single giant spot, the size of which scales linearly with the variability amplitude, an assumption which provides only a lower limit on the extent of active regions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Zellem et al. (2017)</ref> present a novel method to remove relative changes in the stellar contribution to individual transits utilizing the out-of-transit data flanking each transit observation. The strength of this approach lies in that it does not require additional measurements to provide a relative correction for differences in spot and faculae covering fractions between observations. However, as with other variability-based techniques, this approach cannot correct for any persistent level of spots or faculae that may be present in all observations and can strongly alter transmission spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McCullough et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rackham et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Useful constraints on spot and faculae covering fractions are hindered by observational and theoretical limits on our knowledge of stellar photospheres. On the Sun, the disk passage of sunspots can produce relative declines in the solar total irradiance in the range of ∼ 0.1% to 0.3% (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kopp et al. 2005</ref>). By contrast, field mid-to-late M dwarfs (M &lt; 0.35 M ) with detectable rotation periods display rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of 0.5-1.0% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Newton et al. 2016</ref>), corresponding to peak-to-trough variability fullamplitudes of 1-2%. Thus, variability amplitudes in M dwarfs are roughly an order of magnitude larger than in the Sun.</p><p>Despite the clear importance of constraining spot and faculae covering fractions for exoplanet host stars, a systematic attempt to connect observed variabilities to covering fractions and thus stellar contamination signals is absent in the literature on transmission spectroscopy.</p><p>In this work, we employ a forward modeling approach to explore the range of spot covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for field M dwarf stars and their associated effects on visual and nearinfrared (0.3-5.5 µm) planetary transmission spectra. In Section 2, we detail our model for placing constraints on spot and faculae covering fractions and their associated stellar contamination spectra. Section 3 provides the modeling results. We place our results in the context of observational attempts to constrain stellar heterogeneity and examine their impact on transmission spectra and density estimates of M dwarf exoplanets in Section 4, including a focused discussion of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Synthetic stellar spectra</head><p>We employed the PHOENIX ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Husser et al. 2013</ref>) and DRIFT-PHOENIX ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Witte et al. 2011</ref>) stellar spectral model grids to generate spectra for the immaculate photospheres, spots, and faculae of main sequence M dwarfs with spectral types from M0V to M9V. Both model grids are based on the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hauschildt &amp; Baron 1999)</ref>, with the DRIFT-PHOENIX model grids including additional physics describing the formation and condensation of mineral dust clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Woitke &amp; Helling 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Helling &amp; Woitke 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Helling et al. 2008a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Witte et al. 2009</ref>) that is applicable to late M dwarfs and brown dwarfs. We considered models with solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.0) and no alpha-element enrichment ([α/Fe] = 0.0). We linearly interpolated between spectra in the grids to produce 0.3-5.5 µm model spectra for the surface gravities and temperatures we required.</p><p>The implicit assumption with this approach is that the emergent spectrum from distinct components of a stellar photosphere, such as the immaculate photosphere, spots, and faculae, can be approximated by models of disk-integrated stellar spectra of different temperatures. This approximation is commonly used in transit spectroscopy studies to constrain the contribution of unocculted photospheric heterogeneities to exoplanet transmission spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huit- son et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jordán et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pont et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fraine et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sing et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rackham et al. 2017</ref>). However, this simplification neglects the dependence of the spectra of photospheric heterogeneities on magnetic field strength and limb distance, both of which modulate the emergent spectra of magnetic surface features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Norris et al. 2017</ref>). Nonetheless, we adopt the simplifying assumption of parameterizing component spectra by temperature and note that future efforts may benefit Note-The photosphere temperature T phot , spot temperature Tspot, facula temperature T f ac , and surface gravity log g we adopt for each M dwarf spectral type are listed.</p><p>from the increased realism of 3D magnetohydrodynamics models. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists our adopted stellar parameters. For each spectral type, we calculated the surface gravity g from the stellar masses and radii summarized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kaltenegger &amp; Traub (2009)</ref> and adopted the stellar effective temperature from that same work as the photosphere temperature T phot . Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afram &amp; Berdyugina (2015)</ref>, we adopted the relation T spot = 0.86 × T phot , in which T spot is the spot temperature. We adopted the scaling relation T f ac = T phot +100 K (Gondoin 2008) for the facula temperature. Although there are uncertainties in the scaling relations of starspots and faculae, we do not expect our general results to be sensitive to the adopted relations. The temperature ranges of the spectral grids allowed us to simulate photosphere, spot, and facula spectra for spectral types M0V-M5V with the PHOENIX model grid and M5V-M9V with the DRIFT-PHOENIX model grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Spot covering fraction and variability amplitude relation</head><p>We explored the range of spot covering fractions consistent with an observed 1% I-band variability fullamplitude for each spectral type. We modeled the stellar photosphere using a rectangular grid with a resolution of 180 × 360 pixels. We initialized the model with an immaculate photosphere, setting the value of each resolution element to the flux of the photosphere spectrum integrated over Bessel I-band response <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Likewise, when adding spots or faculae to the model, we utilized the integrated I-band fluxes of their respective spectra.</p><p>We considered four cases of stellar heterogeneities by varying two parameters: spot size and the presence or absence of faculae. In terms of spot size, we examined cases with smaller and larger spots, which we deem the "solar-like spots" and "giant spots" cases. In the solarlike spots case, each spot had a radius of R spot = 2 • , covering 400 ppm of the projected hemisphere and representing a large spot group on the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mandal et al. 2017</ref>). In the giant spots case, each spot had a radius of R spot = 7 • , covering 5,000 ppm of the projected hemisphere and corresponding roughly to the largest spots detectable on active M dwarfs through molecular spectropolarimetry (Berdyugina 2011). For cases with faculae, we included faculae at a facula-to-spot area ratio of 10:1, following observations of the active Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shapiro et al. 2014</ref>). Thus, the stellar heterogeneity cases we considered were the following: solar-like spots, giant spots, solar-like spots with faculae, and giant spots with faculae.</p><p>For each spectral type and stellar heterogeneity case, we examined the dependence of the variability on the spot covering fraction through an iterative process. In each iteration, we added a spot to the model photosphere at a randomly selected set of coordinates 2 , recorded the spot covering fraction, and generated a phase curve. In cases including faculae, we added half of the facular area at positions adjacent to the spot and half in a roughly circular area at another randomly selected set of coordinates. We allowed spots to overwrite faculae but not vice versa in successive iterations to ensure the spot covering fraction increased monotonically. We generated a phase curve by applying a double cosine weighting kernel to one hemisphere of the rectangular grid (180 × 180 pixels), summing the flux, and repeating the process for all 360 x-coordinates ("latitudes") in the model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2)</ref>. We recorded the variability fullamplitude A as the difference between the minimum and maximum normalized flux in the phase curve at each iteration. This approach assumes the stellar rotation axis is aligned well with the plane of the sky. As the presence of transits ensures that the planetary orbital plane 1 http://www.aip.de/en/research/facilities/stella/ instruments/data/johnson-ubvri-filter-curves 2 We assumed no latitudinal dependence for the spot distribution. This assumption is good for active M dwarf stars ( ), but may not hold for earlier spectral types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Morris et al. 2017</ref>). We will examine the additional complication of latitudinal dependence of photospheric features in a future paper.</p><p>is nearly edge-on, and obliquities between the stellar rotation axis and planetary orbital plane are generally 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">• (Winn et al. 2017</ref>), this assumption is good for most transiting exoplanet systems. Following this procedure, we added spots to the immaculate photosphere iteratively until reaching 50% spot coverage.</p><p>We repeated this procedure 100 times for a given set of stellar parameters and heterogeneity case to examine the central tendency and dispersion in modeling results. In each trial, we recorded the minimum spot covering fraction that produced a variability full-amplitude of 1% (A = 0.01). Using the results of the 100 trials, we calculated the mean spot covering fraction f spot,mean corresponding to A = 0.01 and its standard deviation. We defined the spot covering fractions 1σ below and above the mean as f spot,min and f spot,max , respectively.</p><p>As spots were allowed to overwrite faculae in our model but not vice versa, the facula-to-spot area ratio drifted from its original 10:1 value as spots were added to the model. Thus a distribution of facularcovering fractions existed for each spot covering fraction of interest. Accordingly, to quantify the central tendency and dispersion in results for models including faculae, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of facular-covering fractions in the 100 trials for each spot covering fraction of interest. We defined f f ac,mean as the mean facular-covering fraction corresponding to f spot,mean , f f ac,min as the mean facular-covering fraction corresponding to f spot,min minus one standard deviation of that distribution, and f f ac,max as the mean facular-covering fraction corresponding to f spot,max plus one standard deviation of that distribution.</p></div>

For each heterogeneity case, we provide the mean covering fractions of spots (and faculae, if possible) consistent with a 1% I-band rotational variability across all spectral types considered. The error bars on these values refer to the means of the fspot,min, fspot,max, f f ac,min , and f f ac,max parameters defined in Section 2.2. Also included is the average transit depth change produced by all models across the 0.3-5.5 µm wavelength range and a qualitative assessment of the photospheric heterogeneity that dominates the contamination spectrum.  a given spot covering fraction, the number density of spots is lower in the giant spots case than the solar-like spots case, leading to more concentrated surface heterogeneities and larger variability signals. A single spot, for example, will always lead to rotational variability, while the variability signals from multiple spots positioned around the photosphere can add destructively, leading to a lower observed variability full-amplitude. The solar-like spots case demonstrates this effect. It includes the same spot covering fraction as the giant spots case but produces a markedly lower level of variability. While chromospheric diagnostics may be used to distinguish active and quiet stars, variability monitoring can only place a lower limit on the spot covering fraction. In effect, the rotational variability full-amplitude reflects only the non-axisymmetric component of the stellar heterogeneity. The axisymmetric component, which can be larger than the non-axisymmetric one, does not contribute to the observed variability but will affect transmission spectra. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the results of our variability amplitude modeling efforts for the spots-only case. For each spectral type and spot size, the relationship between the spot covering fraction and observed I-band variability full-amplitude differs notably from a linear relation. Giant spots lead to overall larger variability full-amplitudes than solar-like spots do for the same spot covering fraction. With the exception of variability full-amplitudes ≤ 1% caused by giant spots, the linear relation is a poor approximation to the actual variability relation and underestimates the spot covering fraction. Instead, the variability full-amplitude grows asymptotically as a function of spot covering fraction.</p></div>

In effect, a given observed variability full-amplitude corresponds to a range of spot covering fractions, which widens further for larger variability full-amplitudes. Additionally, the solar-like spots case allows for still wider ranges of spot covering fractions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> provides the values of f spot,min , f spot,mean , and f spot,max (see Section 2.2) resulting from the set of 100 variability models we conducted for each spectral type.</p><p>Following the apparent square root dependence of the variability full-amplitude A on the spot covering fraction, we fit via least squares a scaling relation of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A = C × f 0.5 spot<label>(4)</label></formula><p>to each set of models, in which C is a scaling coefficient that depends on both the spot contrast and size.

In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, we provide the fitted values of C with an uncertainty determined by the 68% dispersion in model outcomes (i.e., the shaded regions in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the results of the variability modeling for the spots-and-faculae case. In contrast to the spots-only case, the addition of faculae leads to larger I-band variability full-amplitudes and a plateau in the relation for small spot covering fractions. As a result, a larger range of f spot corresponds to A = 0.01 than in the spots-only case. Variability full-amplitudes begin to grow asymptotically again for f spot &gt; 0.1 because the photospheres are nearly fully covered with faculae (due to the 10:1 faculae:spot ratio) and additional faculae do not contribute to the photospheric heterogeneity. Table 4 provides the range of f spot and f f ac in the spots and faculae case for each spectral type.</p><p>For both spots-only and spots-and-faculae models, the variability modeling results show that extrapolations assuming a linear relation between the observed variability and spot covering fraction tend to underestimate the true spot covering fraction. Additionally, there is not a one-to-one relation between the observed variability and the spot covering fraction; instead, each observed variability full-amplitude corresponds to a range of covering fractions. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the contamination spectra produced by the spots-only models for three representative spectral types. The shaded regions illustrate the range of contamination spectra possible due to the range of spot covering fractions allowed. Unocculted spots lead to an increase in transit depths across the full wavelength range studied, with the largest increases at the shortest wavelengths. Variations in transit depth due to differences in the molecular opacities between the photosphere and spots are also apparent. They are strongest for mid-M dwarfs and overlap with many regions of interest for exoplanetary transmission features. We find that while the spectral type determines the specific features present, the overall scale of the contamination spectrum is largely independent of spectral type.</p></div>

Considering the mean spot covering fractions consistent with a 1% variability full-amplitude, giant spots alter transit depths by an average of 0.4% across 0.3-5.5 µm wavelengths for M dwarf spectral types. Given the allowed range of spot covering fractions, however, the average change could be as low as 0.2% or as high as 0.9%.

In this case, the average change to transit depths at these wavelengths for the mean spot covering fraction is 5.0% and could be as low as 2.6% or as high as 16%, considering the allowed range of spot covering fractions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 7</ref> shows contamination spectra produced by the spots and faculae variability models. In the giant spots case, the contamination spectra for all M dwarf spectral types are dominated in the 0.3-5.5 µm wavelength range by the facular contribution, which reduces transit depths at these wavelengths. Comparing <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 3 and   4</ref> shows that spot filling factors in all giant spots cases are very low, typically 1%, but they are on average 2.2× smaller in the giant spots and faculae case than in the giant spots-only case. Thus, a general finding is that the facular component can dominate the visual and near-infrared contamination spectra for low spot covering fractions. On average, in the giant spots and faculae case, transit depths are decreased by 0.4% across this wavelength range for M dwarf spectral types.

The case of solar-like spots and faculae presents a challenge to our original assumption of an immaculate transit chord. The facular coverages determined in these models are typically &gt; 50% and range as high as 72%. If these facular coverages were indeed present, faculae would represent the dominant component of the stellar disk and likely the transit chord as well, precluding attempts to mask faculae crossings in light curves. Therefore, we assume in this case that the the faculae-covering fraction within the transit chord is roughly equivalent to that of the unocculted stellar disk and we calculate the contamination spectra shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 7</ref> without the contribution from a faculae heterogeneity. Nonetheless, the range of facular-covering fractions presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>, particularly for late M dwarfs, shows that facular coverages are largely unconstrained and thus a wide range of facular contributions to stellar contamination spectra are possible for the solar-like spots case.</p><p>Regardless of the precise contribution from faculae, the addition of faculae to the heterogeneity model for the solar-like spots case generally increases the spot covering fractions that are consistent with an I-band variability full-amplitude of 1% <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 4)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Comparison with empirical results</head><p>Active region properties such as fractional areal coverage are difficult to ascertain in spatially unresolved observations of stars. However, estimates can be made based on the unique properties of chromospheric line formation in the specific case of M dwarf stars. In brief summary, the Hα line appears only weakly in absorption in the cool photospheres of M dwarfs. However, as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cram &amp; Mullan (1979)</ref>, the onset of chromospheric heating leads first to an increase in absorption strength of the line. With further non-radiative heating the line eventually attains a maximum in absorption equivalent width. Enhanced heating causes Hα to become collisionally controlled and driven into emission as the defining observational characteristic of a dMe star.</p><p>Based on this general behavior of Hα line formation in M dwarfs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Giampapa (1985)</ref>  Wavelength [ m] <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

For specific M dwarf (non-dMe) stars with measurements available at that time, ranging in spectral type from M1.5 to M5.5, he deduced modelindependent filling factors of facular regions exceeding 10-26%. A more stringent inference of minimum filling factor can be obtained from calculations of the maximum Hα absorption equivalent width attained in M dwarf model chromospheres. Based on these computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cram &amp; Mullan 1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Giampapa (1985)</ref> found a range in the minimum active region filling factor of 31-67% in the case of non-dMe stars characterized by (R − I) K = 0.9, corresponding to about T ef f = 3500 K. Therefore, the fractional area coverage of faculae of even relatively quiescent M dwarfs is widespread.</p><p>In the case of dMe stars, more intense chromospheric heating gives rise to Hα emission which by itself does not lead to a direct estimate of facular area coverage. However, there is direct observational evidence for widespread, multi-kilogauss magnetic fields outside of spots in active M dwarfs (i.e., dMe stars) at high filling factors in excess of 50% based on the analysis of magnetically sensitive photospheric features <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Saar &amp; Linsky 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reiners et al. 2009</ref>). Furthermore, the absence of any reported rotational modulation of Hα emission in dMe stars is consistent with the occurrence of an azimuthally symmetric, spatially widespread presence of facular regions on their surfaces.</p><p>In addition to active regions characterized by bright chromospheric emission or, in the case of quiescent M dwarfs, chromospheric Hα absorption, the occurrence  of periodic or quasi-periodic light curve modulations in photometric bandpasses, indicative of the presence of cool spots, has an extensive record of observations. In a study of a compilation of extensive datasets, Newton et al. <ref type="bibr">(2016,</ref><ref type="bibr">2017</ref>) measured photometric semiamplitudes in the range of roughly 0.5-4% (Newton et al. 2017, <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). We can therefore infer minimum starspot filling factors f spot ∼ 1-8% of the visible stellar disk in the case of completely black spots. Estimates of starspot temperatures provide a further refinement of the minimum spot filling factor. In an investigation of the magnetic properties of spots on the active, early M dwarf AU Mic (dM1e), Berdyugina (2011) utilized polarimetric observations of temperature-and magnetically-sensitive diatomic molecules to find spot temperatures ∼ 500-700 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and with associated magnetic field strengths as high as 5.3 kG. With an effective temperature of 3775 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pagano et al. 2000)</ref>, the ratio of spot-to-stellar effective temperature is in the range of 0.81-0.87. In general, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afram &amp; Berdyugina (2015)</ref> find for M dwarfs that spot models tend to have a spot-tophotosphere temperature ratio of 0.86. Based on these measurements, for a semi-amplitude of ∼ 2% with a range of T spot /T ef f of ∼ 0.8 to 0.9 we estimate spot filling factors in the range of ∼ 7-12%. Given that the photometric modulation depends on both contrast and departures from a longitudinally symmetric surface distribution of spots, this spot filling factor estimate should be regarded as a minimum value since the observed light curve modulation could arise from departures from axial symmetry in an otherwise widespread and uniform distribution of small spots. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jackson &amp; Jeffries (2013)</ref> demonstrate that small-amplitude light curve modulation can arise from the combined effect of a random distribution of small spots characterized by a uniform size (i.e., scale length) and a plausible temperature contrast with the surrounding photosphere of 0.7. As an illustration, their Monte Carlo simulations of light-curve amplitudes due to a large number of randomly distributed spots with, say, a characteristic length scale of 3.5 degrees yield a mean amplitude of 1% with a filling factor of ∼ 30% (Jackson &amp; Jeffries 2013, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) in qualitative agreement with our variability modeling. Thus, in this context, we conclude that high filling factors of spots and faculae, such as those determined in this work, are a plausible interpretation of the observed light curve modulations seen in M dwarfs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Stellar contamination mimicking and masking exoplanetary features</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 6 and 7</ref>, stellar heterogeneity can introduce significant spectral features in visual and near-infrared transmission spectra. These deviations result from a difference in flux between the immaculate photosphere and heterogeneities such as spots and faculae (Equation 3). Unocculted spots introduce positive features in transmission spectra that may be mistaken for evidence of absorption or scattering in the exoplanet atmosphere. By contrast, unocculted faculae introduce negative features, which can mask genuine spectral features originating in the exoplanet atmosphere. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the effect of stellar contamination at visual and near-infrared wavelengths of interest for molecular features in exoplanetary atmospheres. In general, stellar contamination increases transit depths and may mimic exoplanetary features, with the exception in the case of giant spots and faculae, in which the contribution from faculae dominates and may mask exoplanetary features. Transit depth changes are largest and therefore most problematic for: 1) solar-like spots cases, 2) earlier spectral types, and 3) molecules with absorption bands at relatively short wavelengths, such as O 2 .</p><p>As a comparison for scale, the dashed horizontal line in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> indicates the 1.3% change in transit depth expected for a transiting Earth-twin (atmospheric mean molecular weight µ = 28.97 amu; equilibrium temperature T eq = 288 K) due to an atmospheric feature covering five pressure scale heights. In the giant spots cases, stellar contamination can alter transit depths at overlapping wavelengths by a non-negligible fraction of this amount, the effect of which is to boost the apparent size of features in the spots-only case and to weaken them in the giant spots and faculae case. Therefore, large unocculted spots can lead to a range of erroneous interpretations of transmission spectra: molecular abundances may appear enhanced or depleted and the presence of a obscuring haze layer can be masked or mimicked.</p><p>By contrast, solar-like spots cases increase transit depths by much more than an expected exoplanetary feature. For early spectral types, the increase in transit depth can be more than ten times that expected for planetary features. Such a strong feature could be easily identified as stellar in origin, though the scale of the feature, combined with the wide range of stellar contributions possible, would limit the accuracy of any determination of the underlying planetary feature. Later spectral types present a more pathological circumstance, as the magnitude of the transit depth change due to stellar contamination is comparable to that of a planetary atmospheric feature, allowing the signals to be easily mistaken. Therefore, constraining spot sizes and, by extension, spot covering fractions, will be essential for investigations of atmospheric features in transmission spectra of low-mass exoplanets around late M dwarfs, such as the TRAPPIST-1 system. We consider this topic in more detail in Section 4.5 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison to observational precisions</head><p>Thus far we have discussed the effect of stellar heterogeneity on transmission spectra in terms of relative transit depth changes. This approach is useful because the multiplicative change in transit depth produced by unocculted spots and faculae can be applied to any planetary transmission spectrum. However, it is also informative to convert these relative transit depth changes to absolute ones that can be compared to observational precisions afforded by current and near-future facilities.</p><p>To do this, we must adopt parameters for the transiting exoplanet. At a minimum, these are the planetary radius and the expected scale of a planetary atmospheric feature. We consider two end-member cases for this comparison: a hot Neptune and an Earth-twin. For the hot Neptune case, we adopt the parameters of GJ 436b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Butler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gillon et al. 2007</ref>), which is one of the largest and hottest planets known to transit an M dwarf and represents a more readily observable exoplanet atmosphere. Its near-infrared transmission spectrum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>) displays a weighted mean transit depth of D = 0.70% and a 200-ppm variation in transit depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>), which has been interpreted as an H 2 O absorption feature covering 0.46 ± 0.25 atmospheric scale heights <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crossfield &amp; Kreidberg 2017)</ref>. This feature produces a relative transit depth change of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p = ∆D D = 2.0 × 10 −4 7.0 × 10 −3 = 2.9%.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We adopt this observed relative transit depth change and the best-fit planetary radius of GJ 436b (R p = 3.95 R ⊕ ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gillon et al. 2007</ref>) for the hot Neptune case. The other end-member case we consider is that of a  Spectral Type <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Effect of stellar contamination at wavelengths of planetary absorption features. The change in transit depth integrated over wavelengths of interest for molecular species is shown as a function of spectral type. From top to bottom, the panels illustrate results for four cases: giant spots, solar-like spots, giant spots and faculae, and solar-like spots and faculae. Points correspond to the mean stellar contamination signal and error bars to the dispersion in the strength of the signal illustrated by the shaded regions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 6 and 7</ref>. Horizontal dashed lines show the expected transit depth change for a feature covering five scale heights in an Earth-like atmosphere, which is independent of stellar spectral type.</p><p>transiting Earth-twin (R p = 1.0 R ⊕ ; µ = 28.97 amu; T eq = 288 K), which produces a relative transit depth change of p = 1.3% for a 5-scale-height planetary feature and represents a larger observational challenge.</p><p>For each of these planetary cases, we calculate transit depths D and absolute transit depth changes due to planetary atmospheric features ∆D p as a function of M dwarf spectral type using the stellar radii provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. We also calculate the mean absolute transit depth change due to stellar heterogeneity ∆D s at wavelengths of interest for H 2 O absorption (as discussed in Section 4.2) for each of the four heterogeneity cases we consider. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Tables 5 and 6</ref> for the hot Neptune and Earth-twin cases, respectively. Comparing these values of ∆D p and ∆D s suggests that for hot Neptunes variations in transit depth due to the planetary atmosphere are roughly an order of magnitude larger than those due to stellar heterogeneity for giant spot cases. However, stellar signals are larger than planetary signals for all solar-like spot cases, with the largest difference between the signals for earlier spectral types. For Earth-twins transiting M dwarfs, in the case of giant spots, planetary signals are at least three times larger than stellar ones for all M dwarf spectral types. How-ever, as with the hot Neptune case, stellar signals due to solar-like spots are larger than planetary signals for all M dwarf spectral types.</p><p>The question remains, however, of how these planetary and stellar signals compare to observational precisions. The most precise transmission spectrum obtained with HST/WFC3 to date contains a typical uncertainty of 30 ppm on the transit depth in each wavelength channel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). This is similar to the noise floors for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST ) instruments adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Greene et al. (2016)</ref> for wavelength ranges of interest in this study: 20 ppm for NIRISS SOSS (λ = 1-2.5 µm) and 30 ppm for NIRCam grism (λ = 2.5-5.0 µm). We adopt 30 ppm as a fiducial noise floor for both HST and JWST observations. Considering this detection threshold, our results suggest that planetary atmospheric features are detectable for hot Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs of all spectral types (Table 5). The effects of unocculted giant spots and facular regions are detectable for host stars with spectral types of roughly M3V and later, while in the more problematic case of solar-like spots, the effects of unocculted spots and faculae are detectable for all M dwarf spectral types. In the case of a transiting Earth-twin <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 6)</ref>, we estimate that planetary atmosphere features are detectable for spectral types M6V and later. The effects of unocculted giant spots and facular regions may alter the strength of these features by ∼ 20% but will only independently reach the detection threshold of 30 ppm for M9V host stars. However, in the case of solar-like spots, we estimate that the effects of unocculted spots and faculae may be apparent in observations of spectral types as early as M3V or M4V.</p><p>In summary, we find that the most precise existing HST/WFC3 G141 transmission spectra as well as upcoming JWST transmission spectra of small planets around M dwarfs can be significantly influenced by stellar contamination; any analysis of such spectra should consider the possible range of systematic contamination due to the transit light source effect.</p></div>

With the exception of Kepler, which utilizes a broad, unfiltered visual bandpass, these surveys typically favor redder wavelengths such as I-band in order to minimize the contribution of stellar variability to measurements. The bulk density of an exoplanet calculated from discovery transits can provide a clue as to their volatile content, making it one of the primary factors affecting whether a planet is selected for follow-up observations. Furthermore, the unfiltered Kepler photometry often remains the most precise transit depth measurement for most small planets, and therefore its accuracy affects inferences made about individual planets as well as ensembles of planets.</p><p>Our work here, however, shows that the stellar contributions can be larger than previously suspected and may still contribute significantly even at red visual and near-infrared wavelengths, given the large range of stellar heterogeneity levels that may correspond to an observed rotational variability level. To determine the scale of the contribution, we calculated the range of radius and, by extension, density errors by integrating the contamination spectra presented in Section 3.2 over the Bessel I-band filter bandpass, which is similar to bandpasses used by ground-based transit surveys such as MEarth <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Nutzman &amp; Charbonneau 2008)</ref> and TRAP-PIST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gillon et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jehin et al. 2011</ref>), and the Kepler 3 and TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Ricker et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>) spectral responses.</p><p>The resulting systematic radius and density errors are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Positive radius errors, which indicate the apparent planetary radius is larger than the true planetary radius, correspond to negative density errors, which indicate that the apparent density is smaller than the true bulk density. We note that this systematic density error provides only a minimum estimate of the total error in planetary bulk density, to which the observational uncertainty in radius and any error in mass estimate must be also be added.</p><p>As with the investigation into false planetary absorption features, we find the primary determinant of the systematic density error to be the spot size. Small spots cases are the most problematic, with an average density error of 13% across all spectral types and bandpasses that we considered and a maximum of 29% for M1 dwarfs in the Kepler bandpass. In the giant spots cases, by contrast, density errors are 1% on average and the largest are 3%. Aside from spot size, spectral type is the second-largest determinant of the systematic error. Earlier M dwarf spectral types tend to produce density errors that are larger on average. Additionally, they demonstrate a larger dispersion in possible errors, as indicated by the error bars, given the wider range of Note-Listed are the planetary transit depth D, transit depth change due to planetary atmospheric features ∆Dp, and, for the four heterogeneity cases we consider, the transit depth change due to stellar heterogeneity ∆Ds (shown in bold for cases in which the stellar transit depth change is larger than that due to planetary atmospheric features). The scale of the stellar signal is smaller than that of a hot Neptune atmospheric feature for all giant spots cases, but it is generally larger than the planetary signal for cases with solar-like spots.</p><p>spot and faculae covering fractions corresponding to an observed variability (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 3 and 4)</ref>. Finally, we find that the systematic errors are generally larger for bluer observational bandpasses, though the effect of the bandpass is smaller than that of either the spot size or host star spectral type. To place the systematic radius errors in context, the difference in radius between an entirely rocky composition and a planet with 25% H 2 O by mass for planets with masses between 0.125 and 32 Earth masses is 10-12% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Zeng et al. 2016</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>), illustrated by the shaded regions in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. In terms of an observational comparison, we note that the 1-sigma uncertainty on the radius of LHS 1140b is 7.0% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dittmann et al. 2017</ref>), giving it one of the best constrained densities of a subNeptune exoplanet to date. Therefore, while the effect of unocculted giant spots is easily hidden within observational uncertainties, unocculted solar-like spots can introduce a systematic error in radius that is comparable to the total error combined from the observational uncertainties in the radial velocity and transit photometry measurements and can significantly alter interpretations of the volatile content of an exoplanet. We note that this applies to M dwarf planets that will be discovered by TESS, for which we predict sunspot-like spots will lead on average to systematic radii overestimates of 4.3% and density underestimates of 13%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Application to TRAPPIST-1 system</head><p>We utilized the approach detailed in Section 2 to place constraints on spot and faculae covering fractions for TRAPPIST-1 and their effects on observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We opted to explore the case of the TRAPPIST-1 planets because currently they represent the best examples of habitable zone, possibly rocky planets and these planets are also likely to be primary targets for in-depth JWST transit spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">Spot and faculae covering fractions</head><p>We adopted the stellar parameters for TRAPPIST-1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref>, including stellar mass, radius, effective temperature, and metallicity. With these parameters, we interpolated spectra covering 0.3-5.5 µm from the DRIFT-PHOENIX model grid. We set the photosphere temperature to the effective temperature and calculated the spot and faculae temperatures using the relations outlined in Section 2.1.</p><p>We integrated these spectra over the Bessel I-band response, similar to the I+z bandpass utilized by the TRAPPIST survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gillon et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. , 2017</ref>, to simulate the contributions of these spectral components to Note-Listed are the planetary transit depth D, transit depth change due planetary atmospheric features ∆Dp, and, for the four heterogeneity cases we consider, the transit depth change due to stellar heterogeneity ∆Ds (shown in bold for cases in which the stellar transit depth change is larger than that due to planetary atmospheric features). The scale of the stellar signal is smaller than that of an Earth-twin atmospheric feature for all giant spots cases, but it is larger than the planetary signal for all cases with solar-like spots.</p><p>photometric observations. From visual inspection of Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gillon et al. (2016)</ref>, we estimate the variability full-amplitude of TRAPPIST-1 to be 1 %.</p><p>Long-baseline monitoring of TRAPPIST-1 using the Spitzer Space Telescope, covering 35 transits, shows no definitive evidence of spot crossings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>). Likewise, no spot crossings are apparent in existing HST/WFC3 transit observations of TRAPPIST1b and TRAPPIST-1c covering 1.1-1.7 µm with the G141 grism (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wit et al. 2016)</ref>, though the precision of G141 observations has allowed for the detection of large spot crossing events in other M dwarf transit observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). Therefore, we assume that the presence of very large spots like those detected through molecular spectropolarimetry on active M dwarfs (Berdyugina 2011), each covering 0.5% of the projected stellar disk and comparable in size to the TRAPPIST-1 planets, is unlikely. Accordingly, we adopt a spot size of 2 • (400 ppm or 0.04% of the projected stellar disk), typical of large spot groups on the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mandal et al. 2017</ref>). Given the radius of TRAPPIST-1 (R = 0.117 ± 0.0036; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. 2017)</ref>, this translates to spots with a radius of R spot = 1.63 ± 0.50 × 10 3 km.</p><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 10</ref> displays the results of our variability modeling for both spots-only and spots and faculae cases. For both cases, we find a large range of spot covering fractions is consistent with the observed variability full-amplitude. We find f spot = 11 +18 −6 % for the spots-only case, in which the quoted value is the mean spot covering fraction and the uncertainty refers to 68% dispersion in model results. For the spots and faculae case, we find f spot = 8 +18 −7 % and f f ac = 54 +16 −46 %. By contrast, under the assumption that the distribution of photospheric heterogeneities is fully asymmetric, in which case the variability amplitude would scale linearly with the spot covering fraction with a slope determined by the spot and photosphere I-band fluxes, one would infer a spot covering fraction of 1.0%. We conclude that spot and faculae covering fractions for TRAPPIST-1 are largely unconstrained by the observed photometric variability amplitude, though the allowed range of fractions is typically much larger than one would infer by assuming a linear relation between spot covering fraction and variability amplitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.">Stellar contamination in transmission spectra</head><p>The visual and near-infrared contamination spectra produced by the wide range of spots we infer for TRAPPIST-1 are shown in the center panel of Spectral Type <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Effect of stellar contamination on planetary density calculation. The systematic radius error is shown as a function of spectral type. The corresponding density error is shown at right. Note the difference in sign. The panels illustrate results from four cases of heterogeneities as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.

The mean radius error is shown as a point and error bars correspond to the dispersion in the strength of the contamination signal (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 6 and 7)</ref>. The gray shaded region illustrates the relative difference in radius between an entirely rocky exoplanet and one with a significant volatile content for a range of masses between 0.125 and 32 Earth masses (see text).</p><p>spectrum (Equation 2). Thus, these relative transit depth changes are applicable to observations of each exoplanet in the TRAPPIST-1 system. As with the solar-like spot models in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 7</ref>, contributions from unocculted faculae are not included, given that faculae covering fractions in our models are typically &gt; 50% and are therefore likely to be distributed homogeneously throughout the stellar disk. However, we calculate the contribution of unocculted spots using the spot covering fractions determined by the spots and faculae models, which are generally smaller than those from the spotsonly models, to exploit the increased realism of the spots and faculae models. The solid line shows the contamination spectrum corresponding to the mean spot covering fraction and the shaded region the range of spectra for the 68% confidence interval on f spot . Compared to the contamination spectrum predicted by the fully asymmetric assumption, shown as a dash-dotted line, we find the level of stellar contamination to be roughly an order of magnitude larger. Integrating over wavelengths of interest for key planetary molecular features, we illustrate the practical im-    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 10</ref>. For all molecules considered, we find the mean relative transit depth change to be comparable to or larger than that produced by an exoplanetary atmospheric feature. The shaded region in this panel illustrates the range of feature scales for the six innermost TRAPPIST-1 planets, calculated using the planetary parameters from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref> and assuming an Earth-like atmospheric mean molecular weight (µ = 28.97 amu). They range from 0.8% for TRAPPIST-1g to 2.5% for TRAPPIST1d. Given the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, these correspond to absolute transit depth changes of 59 ppm (TRAPPIST-1g) to 168 ppm (TRAPPIST1b). Assuming the same 30 ppm detection threshold as in Section 4.3, atmospheric features with these scales are, in principle, detectable with both HST and JWST. In contrast to the planetary atmospheric signal, mean molecular feature errors produced by unocculted spots range from 2.1% for CO to 4.3% for O 2 . For the planet with the shallowest transit depth in this set, TRAPPIST-1d (D = 0.367±0.017 %; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>), a 2.1% relative change in transit depth corresponds to an absolute transit depth change of 77 ppm, which illustrates that the range of uncertainties we predict for all molecular features for the TRAPPIST-1 planets are above the fiducial 30 ppm noise floor. In other words, we predict stellar heterogeneity will significantly impact the interpretation of high-precision TRAPPIST-1 transmis- sion spectra. Errors are most pronounced for molecules with absorption bands at shorter wavelengths. Large uncertainties exist for each molecular feature error due to the wide range of spot covering fractions and accompanying contamination spectra possible.</p><p>Finally, we calculate density errors for the TRAPPIST-1 planets due to stellar contamination. Integrating the contamination spectra presented in the center panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 10</ref> over the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5-µm bandpass, we find an integrated systematic radius error of δ(R p ) = 1.1 +2.5 −1.0 %, in which the quoted value is the mean and the error refers to the 68% dispersion in modeling results. These values translate to density errors of ∆(ρ) = −3 +3 −8 %; in other words, overestimating the planetary radius leads to an underestimate of the planetary density. Such a systematic error in density measurements could lead to overestimates of the volatile content of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We provide updated densities for the six innermost TRAPPIST-1 planets in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 7</ref>, adjusting the values reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gillon et al. (2017)</ref> for the density error due to stellar contamination. Our analysis suggests that stellar contamination may be partially responsible for the relatively low densities reported for planets in this system. More generally, this effect will be an important consideration when selecting targets for characterization follow-up from among a photometrically detected sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented an examination of stellar contamination in visual and near-infrared (0.3-5.5 µm) transmission spectra of M dwarf exoplanets using model photospheres for M0-M9 dwarf stars with increasing levels of spots and faculae. Our key findings are the following.</p><p>1. For a given spot covering fraction, larger spots will produce a larger observed variability amplitude than that of smaller spots. Constraining the typical spot size for exoplanet host stars is therefore crucial, since it will mediate the relationship between spot covering fraction and observed variability amplitude.</p><p>2. The relationship between spot covering fraction and observed variability amplitude is non-linear, scaling generally like a square root relation (Equation 4) with a coefficient 0.02 &lt; C &lt; 0.11 that depends on spot contrast and size. As such, previous corrections that have assumed a linear relationship between these variables likely underestimate the true spot covering fraction and, therefore, spectral contamination due to unocculted spots. We will explore this further in an upcoming paper.</p><p>3. In contrast to the low levels of spot covering fractions (∼1%) used in the literature, we show that a given variability amplitude corresponds to a wide range of spot and faculae covering fractions. For example, assuming spot sizes similar to those of sunspots, we find a typical variability amplitude may correspond to spot covering fractions 0.14 &gt; f spot &gt; 0.44 and faculae covering fractions 0.56 &gt; f f ac &gt; 0.72 for M0 dwarfs and 0.01 &gt; f spot &gt; 0.24 and 0.08 &gt; f f ac &gt; 0.72 for M9 dwarfs. These wide ranges correspond to a similarly large uncertainty in the level of stellar contamination present in transmission spectra.</p><p>4. In stars with very large spots, the stellar contamination signal in the 0.3-5.5 µm wavelength range can be dominated by the contribution from unocculted faculae, thereby decreasing observed transit depths. However, for stars with solar-like spots and the same observed variability, we find facular coverage to be so widespread that faculae represent the dominate component of the photosphere and are not likely to contribute to a heterogeneity signal.</p><p>5. Depending on spot size, we find the stellar contamination signal can be more than 10× larger than transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. Stellar contamination is most problematic for 1) stars with solarlike spots, 2) early M dwarf spectral types, and 3) molecules such as O 2 with absorption bands at relatively short wavelengths.</p><p>6. We show that the stellar contamination is not limited to visual wavelengths but can also be very significant in the near-infrared bands, likely affecting upcoming James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets. In the case of a transiting Earth-twin, we find unocculted giant spots can alter the strength of planetary absorption features in transmission spectra by ∼ 20% and unocculted spots and faculae can produce features greater than 30 ppm for spectral types M3V and later.</p><p>7. We find that stellar spectral contamination across photometric bands due to unocculted starspots with sizes comparable to large sunspot groups can lead to significant errors in radius and therefore density, which may in turn lead to overestimates of planetary volatile content and introduce a stellar-type dependent bias in the density distribution of small planets. This result motivates a possible re-assessment of mass-radius relationships derived from Kepler data as well as calls for caution when interpreting upcoming broad-band TESS photometry-based exoplanet density measurements.</p><p>8. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we find spot covering fractions f spot = 8 +18 −7 % to be consistent with the variability reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gillon et al. (2016)</ref> when considering variability due to both spots and faculae. The associated stellar contamination signals in the optical and near-infrared alter transit depths at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15 × the strength of the planetary feature, significantly complicating James Webb Space Telescope follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, stellar contamination can cause bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets to be underestimated by 3 +8 −3 %, leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.</p><p>For TRAPPIST-1 and exciting M dwarf exoplanet hosts in general, tighter constraints on spot and faculae covering fractions are crucial for correct interpretations of high-precision visual and near-infrared transmission spectra from low-mass exoplanets. Stellar contamination is likely to be a limiting factor for detecting biosignatures in transmission spectra of habitable zone planets around M dwarfs. Conversely, exoplanet transit observations in multiple bands can be utilized as a spatial probe to infer the properties of stellar surface heterogeneities. This is particularly critical to achieving an accurate picture of the evolution of exoplanet system properties from young, active systems to those with older, more quiescent stellar hosts. In preparation for precise JWST observations probing for molecular features and potential biosignatures such as oxygen, water, and methane from small exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, we encourage the community to work towards an equally precise understanding of the stellar photospheres providing the light source for transit observations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
