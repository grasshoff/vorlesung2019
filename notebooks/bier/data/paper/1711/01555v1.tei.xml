				<p>Polarization during a lunar eclipse is a forgotten mystery. Coyne &amp; Pellicori (1970) reported the detection of significant polarization during the lunar eclipse on 1968 April 13. Multiple scattering during the first transmission through the Earth&apos;s atmosphere was suggested as a possible cause of the polarization, but no conclusive determination was made. No further investigations on polarization during a lunar eclipse are known. We revisit this mystery with an interest in possible application to extrasolar planets; if planetary transmitted light is indeed polarized, it may be possible to investigate an exoplanet atmosphere using &quot;transit polarimetry.&quot; Here we report results of the first spectropolarimetry for the Moon during a lunar eclipse on 2015 April 4. We observed polarization degrees of 2-3 % at wavelengths of 500-600 nm; in addition, an enhanced feature was detected at the O 2 A band near 760 nm. The observed time variation and wavelength dependence are consistent with an explanation of polarization caused by double scattering during the first transmission through the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, accompanied by latitudinal atmospheric inhomogeneity. Transit polarimetry for exoplanets may be useful to detect O 2 gas and to probe the latitudinal atmospheric inhomogeneity, and it is thus worthy of serious consideration.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Coyne &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Pellicori (1970)</ref> reported the detection of a ∼2 % polarization degree of the integrated lunar disk during the eclipse on 1968 April 13. According to them, polarization of the Moon during a lunar eclipse was reported at least twice before their detection. However, polarization of the eclipsed Moon is puzzling. A lunar eclipse takes place when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon are nearly aligned. In general, the emergence of polarization requires some sort of anisotropy with respect to the orientation of electromagnetic oscillation. Hence, such a straight optical path is hardly considered to produce polarization.</p><p>The eclipsed Moon is illuminated by sunlight transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere. Scattered light in the atmosphere may contribute to the brightness of the eclipsed Moon ( ), but single scattering with a scattering angle less than ∼2 • cannot account for the ∼2 % polarization degree reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Coyne &amp; Pellicori (1970)</ref>. They suggested multiple scattering, namely, double scattering, as a possible cause of polarization, though they did not reach a conclusion. To our knowledge, no further investigations on this phenomenon have been reported.</p><p>In light of recent progress in the science of extrasolar planets (exoplanets), lunar eclipse observations have been given a new role. The geometry of a lunar eclipse resembles that of an exoplanet transiting in front of its host star. Thus, lunar eclipses provide ground-based observers with opportunities to observe the Earth as a transiting exoplanet and to obtain Earth's transmission spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pallé et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vidal-Madjar et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yan et al. 2015</ref>). These results are valuable to assess the scientific importance and feasibility of future transit spectroscopy for Earth-like exoplanets. It should be noted that transit spectroscopy (or multiwavelength photometry) has already been conducted for giant exoplanets; some atmospheric species were successively detected (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tinetti et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McCullough et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>If transmission through a planetary atmosphere indeed polarizes incident stellar light, we may have "transit polarimetry" within our grasp as a new method to investigate the atmospheric properties of planets, because some information of the atmosphere must be imprinted into the polarization of the transmitted light. In order to explore the potential of transit polarimetry, we need to confirm and understand polarization during a lunar eclipse.</p><p>The rest of this article reports the results of our first spectropolarimetry for a lunar eclipse. Sections 2 and 3 describe our observations and data reduction method, respectively. The main results of our observations are provided in Section 4. Some possible causes of the observed polarization are discussed in Section 5. We give conclusions for this article in Section 6. Supplementary information with respect to the data recuction and the reliability of our results is provided in Appendixes A amd B. A detailed discussion of the first transmission through the Earth's atmosphere as one of the possible polarizing processes is given in Appendix C. A brief discussion of the expected fractional polarization during a transit of an Earth-like exoplanet is presented in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>We conducted the first spectropolarimetry for the eclipsed Moon on 2015 April 4, with an anticipation that the wavelength dependence and time variation of polarization would facilitate identification of the cause. The observations were made using the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kashikawa et al. 2000</ref>) mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope, located at Maunakea, Hawaii. The field of view was centered at Le Gentil A crater (lunar coordinates: 52.4 • W, 74.6 • S) near the southern edge of the lunar disk. The FOCAS is equipped with eight 20.6 ′′ -long slits, which are aligned in line with separations of 53.6 ′′ (between the central two slits) and 44.3 ′′ (between the others). The slits were kept in the north-south orientation throughout the observations. The northern four slits were placed on the Moon, whereas the other four were on the sky background ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). We selected 2.0 ′′ -wide slits for in-umbra observations, and 0.4 ′′ for out-of-umbra observations, respectively. The grating and filter setting was "300B" + "SY47," which provided a wavelength (λ) coverage of 500-800 nm and a wavelength resolution (λ/∆λ) of ∼200 for the 2.0 ′′ slits or ∼1000 for the 0.4 ′′ slits.</p><p>Light obtained through a slit is split by a Wollaston prism into ordinary and extraordinary spectra. A single dataset consists of four images obtained thorough a halfwave plate with its position angles of 0 • , 45 • , 22.5 • , and 67.5 • .</p><p>The partial eclipse began at 2015 April 4, 10:15 (UT), and the total eclipse occurred from 11:54 to 12:06 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table  1</ref>). The target region was in the umbra from ∼10:40 until ∼13:20. We continued observing the same region from ∼10:30 until ∼13:30 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. However, it became cloudy after the greatest eclipse, and thus we could not acquire effective data after the totality until the target's egress from the umbra. Note-The times with respect to the partial/total eclipse are the predictions by the Ephemeris Computation Office of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Observed region on the Moon and placement of the 2.0 ′′ -wide slits. This image was taken through the imaging mode of FOCAS. The diameter of the field of view is ∼6 ′ . The FOCAS detector consists of two chips; there is a ∼7 ′′ gap between the chips. The placement of the 0.4 ′′ slits is almost the same as that of the 2.0 ′′ slits, but shifted slightly to the north by ∼8.5 ′′ .</p><p>Bias counts in the raw data were subtracted using the images obtained without an exposure. Overscan regions on an image were trimmed using an IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tody 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tody , 1993</ref>) task called ovsub hpk in FOCASRED, 1 which is a software package prepared for FOCAS data. Flat-fielding was conducted with the use of dome flat images, which were obtained through a half-wave plate with its position angles of 0 • , 45 • , 22.5 • , and 67.5 • . The images with four position angles were combined to synthesize an unpolarized flat image.</p><p>Wavelength calibration was performed by referring to known emission lines on Th-Ar arc spectra. A twodimensional (function of position and wavelength) spectral image obtained thorough a slit was averaged into a one-dimensional (wavelength) intensity spectrum. Because the red end of spectra obtained through slits #1 and #8 were found to suffer from vignetting, data from these slits were excluded.</p><p>The intensity of sky background (which includes the light scattered during transmission through the telluric atmosphere on the path from the Moon to the telescope) was subtracted as described below. The sky intensity is greater when a slit position is nearer to the Moon ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The dependence of the intensity on the slit position is roughly linear. Thus, we linearly extrapolated the intensity spectra of the sky (slits #5 and #6) to the slit positions on the Moon (slits #4, #3, and #2). The estimated sky intensities on the lunar positions were subtracted from raw spectra of the Moon. Note that the subtraction was conducted spectrally (at each wavelength element) and separately for both the ordinary and extraordinary spectra.</p><p>The sky-subtracted intensity spectra on the Moon were, however, found to still have a systematic dependence of intensity on the slit position ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). This is probably due to the fact that the positional dependence of sky intensity is not exactly linear, and thus linear subtraction leaves a certain number of residual counts. Therefore, we again performed a fitting of a linear function αx + β to the sky-subtracted Moon spectra (on slits #4, #3, and #2), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, and then evaluated the residual counts by αx. Note that α is the slope of the fitted line and a function of wavelength. Subtraction of the residual counts reduced the systematic dependence of derived polarization degrees on slit position.</p><p>Although we made a conscientious effort to treat the sky subtraction, we will keep in mind the imperfection of our method and try to evaluate its impact later in this section. In addition, we try other sky subtraction techniques in Appendix A and check the reliability of our results from different perspectives in Appendix B. Stokes parameters (ratios) q 0 = Q/I and u 0 = U/I were derived from a set of intensity spectra observed with position angles of the half-wave plate of 0 • , 45 • , 22.5 • , and 67.5 • as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a q = I e (0 • ) I o (0 • ) I o (45 • ) I e (45 • ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">a u = I e (22.5 • ) I o (22.5 • ) I o (67.5 • ) I e (67.5 • ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">q 0 = 1 − a q 1 + a q ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">u 0 = 1 − a u 1 + a u ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where I(φ) represents intensity observed through a halfwave plate with its position angle of φ. The subscripts "o" and "e" stand for ordinary and extraordinary rays, respectively, which are split by a Wollaston prism. Note that calculations in equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> cancel out the telluric transmittance during a single exposure for I o (φ) and I e (φ); hence, in principle, the time variation of telluric transmittance between separate exposures does not alter q 0 or u 0 . The instrumental polarizations (q inst , u inst ) were measured by observing unpolarized standard stars (HD 94851 and HD 154892) and subtracted from q 0 and u 0 by q 1 = q 0 − q inst and u 1 = u 0 − u inst , respectively. Note that the instrumental polarization depends on the slit position. Hence, we obtained q inst and u inst for each slit. For the purpose of reducing random errors, the median values (¯ q 1 , ¯ u 1 ) were taken within several sets of successively observed (q 1 , u 1 ) data (two or three sets for the out-of-umbra spectra and five sets for the inumbra spectra), which resulted in 11 pairs of (¯ q 1 , ¯ u 1 ) median spectra in total, out of 46 (q 1 , u 1 ) datasets. The polarization degree (P ) and position angle of polarization (Θ 0 ) were derived by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P = ¯ q 2 1 + ¯ u 2 1 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">tan 2Θ 0 = ¯ u 1 /¯ q 1 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>sgn(cos 2Θ 0 ) = sgn ¯ q 1 ,</p><p>where sgn represents "sign of." The position angle of polarization was corrected by Θ = Θ 0 − ∆Θ, where ∆Θ is the difference in position angle origins between the instrumental and equatorial coordinates, which was measured using a strongly polarized standard star (HD 43384). Although the P and Θ spectra for all of slits #2, #3, and #4 were derived, we adopted the values from slit #4 as the final results. This is because slit #4 is the nearest to the sky <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), and thus the estimated (extrapolated) sky intensity for slit #4 should be more accurate than those for slits #3 and #2. The values from the other two slits were used to estimate the errors (see below). Random errors of q 1 and u 1 (σ rand q and σ rand u ) were calculated as rms within several sets of successively observed q 1 − ¯ q 1 and u 1 − ¯ u 1 . The typical level of systematic errors depending on the slit position (σ slit q and σ slit u ) was evaluated as rms of ¯</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q 1 (x n ) − ¯ q 1 (0) and ¯ u 1 (x n ) − ¯ u 1 (0)</formula><p>, where x n is the position of slit #n with respect to the position of slit #4 (¯ q 1 (0) and ¯ u 1 (0) are those derived from slit #4). The errors σ slit q and σ slit u include those by the imperfect sky subtraction and inhomogeneity in depolarization factors on the lunar surface because these effects cause differences in ¯ q 1 and ¯ u 1 for different slits. The error propagation to P from q and u was determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">σ P = q 2 σ 2 q + u 2 σ 2 u P ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>polarized lunar eclipse spectrum where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ q = (σ rand q ) 2 + (σ slit q ) 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">σ u = (σ rand u ) 2 + (σ slit u ) 2 .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In addition, we considered the imperfection in the correction of instrumental polarization (δ P ), which was measured as the difference between the observed P of the strongly polarized standard star (after correction of instrumental polarization) and P of the star in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hsu &amp; Breger 1982)</ref>. After all, the total errors in P and Θ were evaluated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ε P = σ 2 P + δ 2 P ,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">ε Θ = 28.65 • ε P P .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>4. RESULTS All of the deduced polarization degree spectra are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, we also show a typical spectrum observed when the target region was outside of the Earth's umbra (hereafter the "out-of-umbra" spectrum) and one obtained when the target region was inside of the umbra (the "in-umbra" spectrum), together with the errors defined by equation (11). The out-of-umbra spectrum is almost unpolarized over the whole wavelength range, whereas the in-umbra spectrum is significantly polarized for wavelengths shorter than 600 nm. The in-umbra polarization degrees at wavelengths 500-600 nm are approximately 2-3 %, which agrees with the report by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Coyne &amp; Pellicori (1970)</ref> (2.4 % in a broad band of 534 ± 28 nm). On the in-umbra spectrum, a strongly enhanced feature presents near 760 nm, which corresponds to oxygen (O 2 ) absorption wavelengths called the A band. Furthermore, another broader enhanced feature is noticeable at 560-580 nm, which corresponds to the absorption wavelengths of oxygen collision complexes (O 2 ·O 2 , or O 2 dimer; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pallé et al. 2009</ref>). Although buried in the error bars, two more features appear near 630 and 690 nm, which may also correspond to O 2 absorption wavelengths.</p><p>The time variation of the polarization degree is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> for all of the derived P spectra. The polarization degree in the V band (550.5 ± 41.4 nm) increased from the ingress time toward the mid-eclipse, whilst that in the R band (658.8 ± 78.4 nm) remained unpolarized. The time variation in the V band seems consistent with the observation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Coyne &amp; Pellicori (1970)</ref>, who reported that the polarization degree of the whole lunar disk decreased from 2.35 % during the totality to ∼0.5 % at the time of fourth contact (when the whole Moon exited from the umbra). They could not observe the ingress, owing to clouds. The polarization degree in the O 2 A band (averaged within 762.5 ± 1.5 nm) exhibited similar variation to that in the V band. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> presents the time variation of the polarization position angle for all of the derived Θ spectra. The position angle of the V-band polarization was virtually constant in ∼ 90 • , or the equatorial east-west direction. As shown in the figure, it appears to be independent of the position angle of the mean scattering plane defined by the Sun's center, Earth's center, and the target. As is the case with the polarization degree, the position angle of polarization in the O 2 A band was similar to that in the V band.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>What caused the observed in-umbra polarization? In a large sense, there are three different processes from which the observed in-umbra polarization may have arisen: (a) transmission through the Earth's atmosphere on the path from the Sun to the Moon, (b) reflection at the lunar surface, and (c) transmission through the Earth's atmosphere on the path from the Moon to the telescope. Below, we discuss each process separately. Sunlight transmits through the Earth's atmosphere twice before it is observed on the ground. In order to distinguish the two different paths of transmission, we often refer to (a) as the first transmission and (c) as the second transmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">First Transmission through the Earth's Atmosphere</head><p>In Appendix C, we discuss in detail the first transmission as a cause of polarization. Below, the essence of our discussion is summarized.</p><p>In analogy with Jupiter's limb polarization, we examine whether the Earth's limb can be polarized by double scattering during the first transmission. We have constructed a simple model to evaluate the doubly scattered flux in Appendix C.3. It shows that the doubly scattered flux emerges most effectively from a tangential altitude where the horizontal optical thickness is intermediate, or near unity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> in Appendix C; we refer to this altitude as the boundary altitude), which is ∼15 km for a wavelength of 550 nm. This can be interpreted as follows: within a horizontally thin layer, scattering becomes more effective with increasing atmospheric density (decreasing the altitudes). However, when the layer becomes horizontally thick, the scattered flux going through the atmosphere toward the Moon decreases with increasing the density owing to increasing extinction.</p><p>We examine an imbalance of fluxes emerging from the boundary altitude between beams that are scattered   twice in a horizontal plane and those in a vertical plane (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref> in Appendix C for a schematic illustration). The horizontal optical thickness at a certain tangential altitude is ∼75 times larger than the vertical optical thickness above the same altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fortney 2005</ref>). Hence, the horizontally scattered flux should be ∼75 times greater than the vertically scattered flux from the layer above the boundary altitude. Our model shows that the vertically scattered flux from the layer below the boundary altitude is comparable to that from the layer above. Consequently, the horizontally scattered flux is expected to overwhelm the vertically scattered flux (as the sum of those from both the upper and lower layers) by a factor of ∼30. This results in polarization in the vertical orientation because scattered light is usually polarized perpendicularly to the scattering plane that includes the incident and scattered rays. All of the overall wavelength dependence of the observed in-umbra polarization degree spectra ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>  During a lunar eclipse, the Earth is viewed as a ring of the bright limb from the Moon, as photographed by <ref type="bibr">Sur- veyor III (Shoemaker et al. 1968</ref>) and KAGUYA (SE-LENE) 2 . We expect the Earth's limb to have a radial pattern of polarization position angles, because each element is estimated to be polarized vertically with respect to the limb.</p><p>Some sort of latitudinal inhomogeneity in the polarized flux is required in order for the integrated Earth's limb to be polarized. Because the observed polarization position angles were nearly in the east-west orientation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7)</ref>, we expect an excess of polarized flux at the equatorial regions compared to that at the polar regions. Although we are yet to identify the cause of 2 http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2009/02/20090218_kaguya_e.html the inhomogeneity, we point to a few possible causes: a greater scale height of the atmosphere above the equatorial region (according to our model, the polarized flux is proportional to the scale height), and/or a greater cloud coverage above the polar regions at the time of our observation (Appendix C.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Reflection at the Lunar Surface</head><p>We examine the reflection at the lunar surface as another possible cause of the observed in-umbra polarization. Light reflected from some of the airless solid bodies in the solar system is known to exhibit a polarization surge at very small phase angles less than ∼2 • (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lyot 1929;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rosenbush et al. 2009</ref>). The polarization degree at the surge is typically 0.3-0.5 % ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rosenbush et al. 2009</ref>). This effect, called the polarization opposition ef-  . Time variation of polarization degree. The green circles, red triangles, and gray squares represent polarization degrees averaged within the V-band (550.5 ± 41.4 nm), Rband (658.8 ± 78.4 nm), and O2 A-band (762.5 ± 1.5 nm) wavelengths, respectively, where the signal counts are used as weights in the averaging. The vertical dashed lines show the approximate times of the target's ingress to and egress from the Earth's umbra. The vertical solid lines indicate the beginning and end times of the totality. Owing to clouds, we were not able to obtain effective data after the end of totality until the target egress (the errors in the V band are larger than 1.0 %).  <ref type="bibr">[observer]</ref> angle) was less than 1 • during our observations. According to a review by Hapke (2012), the polarization opposition effect for the Moon has never been reported, though a laboratory measurement of a lunar soil sample detected the effect with a polarization degree of ∼0.5 %.</p><p>The observed wavelength dependence of the polarization opposition effect for silicate-surface bodies is available only for asteroid 64 Angelina ( ) and Jupiter's satellite Io . The results of multiband polarimetry for these two objects hardly showed a wavelength dependence of the polarization degrees; the variation in the polarization degrees between wavelengths 500 and 800 nm was within a factor of two ( . In contrast, the in-umbra polarization degrees in the same wavelength range present a variation by a factor of 10 or more ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5)</ref>. Thus, the polarization opposition effect is inconsistent with our observed results with respect to the wavelength dependence of the polarization degrees.</p><p>Moreover, because the Moon has virtually no atmosphere, by no means can lunar reflection explain the presence of the strongly enhanced feature of the O 2 gas at wavelengths ∼760 nm. The polarization properties at the V band and the O 2 A band are very similar in terms of the degrees, position angles, and time variations <ref type="bibr">(Figures 5, 6, and 7)</ref>; this suggests that the mechanisms causing the polarization in the two bands are common. Therefore, the reflection at the Moon seems to have difficulty explaining polarization at the short-wavelength range (500-600 nm), as well as at the O 2 A band.</p><p>Considering the above-mentioned inconsistencies, we exclude reflection at the lunar surface as the cause of the in-umbra polarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Second Transmission through the Earth's Atmosphere</head><p>Finally, we discuss the second transmission through the Earth's atmosphere. Double scattering does occur during the second transmission, as well as the first one, though a flux imbalance between polarization states should become less significant as the incidence geometry transitions from grazing to vertical. However, the crucial difference between the two processes is the way of handling a scattering component. As is the case of usual astronomical polarimetry through the "second"-type transmission, a component of scattering within the telluric atmosphere is removed by the process of sky background subtraction (together with other background sources); we did conduct a sky subtraction procedure as described in Section 3. In contrast, a component of scattering during the first transmission is indistinguishably combined with the directly transmitted light; we count it as part of the true signals, not a contamination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Summary of the Discussion</head><p>We have discussed the three possible causes of the observed in-umbra polarization: (a) the first transmission through the Earth's atmosphere on the path from the Sun to the Moon, (b) reflection at the lunar surface, and (c) the second transmission through the Earth's atmosphere on the path from the Moon to the telescope. We have found (a) to be the most convincing. The observed polarization can be explained by a horizontal/vertical imbalance in double scattering during the first transmission, accompanied by some sort of latitudinal inhomogeneity. This explanation is consistent with the overall wavelength dependence, presence of molecular features, and the time variation of the observed polarization degree spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>We conducted the first spectropolarimetry for the eclipsed Moon on 2015 April 4 and detected 2-3 % polarization degrees at wavelengths 500-600 nm and at the O 2 A band near 760 nm. The observed polarization is most probably caused by double scattering during the first Earth transmission. This means that the transmitted light, as observed from the Moon or space, should be polarized by ∼6-9% at 500-600 nm and the O 2 A band, given that lunar reflection depolarizes incident polarized light by a factor of ∼1/3 (Dollfus 1957; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bazzon et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Our findings imply that transit polarimetry may be used to investigate the atmospheres of planets in the solar system and beyond, though detecting very small polarization during a transit of an Earth-like exoplanet is extremely challenging with current and near-future technologies (expected polarization degree of ∼ 10 −10 ; see Appendix D). For instance, the distinct feature at the O 2 A band can be used for detection of O 2 gas, which is a very important signature for the search for extraterrestrial life. The detection of O 2 by the usual intensity spectroscopy is extremely challenging on the ground, owing to the contamination by the telluric O 2 . Polarimetry may be advantageous because the telluric spectral transmittance, including that at absorption wavelengths, is virtually isotropic with respect to orientation of electromagnetic oscillation, and thus it does not alter the polarization degree spectrum of astronomical objects. In addition to O 2 detection, transit polarimetry may become a unique method to probe the latitudinal inhomogeneity of spatially unresolved planets because it is required for the emergence of polarization during a transit; it is probably the type of information that cannot be accessed solely by intensity observations. In order to evaluate the scientific importance and feasibility of transit polarimetry, further observational and theoretical studies are encouraged to fully understand polarization through planetary transmission.</p><p>This work is based on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. ATTEMPTS OF OTHER SKY SUBTRACTION TECHNIQUES</head><p>We explored the possibility of applying other sky subtraction techniques, which were previously established for lunar Earthshine observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Takahashi et al. (2013)</ref> conducted Earthshine spectropolarimetry and developed a method in which a sky intensity spectrum is replaced by a spectrum for Moonshine (the bright side of the Moon) in order to gain a better signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This method is made possible when the dominant source of sky intensity is Moonshine (i.e., the contribution from Earthshine and other light sources is negligible) and thus the sky spectrum is similar to that of Moonshine. Unfortunately, this is not the case with lunar eclipse observations. The sky around an eclipsed Moon, especially during a partial eclipse, is contributed from light on both the in-and out-of-umbra portions of the Moon; their intensity spectra are quite different from each other, as is obvious from their colors viewed with the naked eye (in-umbra area is much redder). A sky spectrum around an eclipsed Moon is a mixture of different-shaped spectra and thus cannot be replaced by a single spectrum. For this reason, we did not apply the method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Takahashi et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>We also attempted a technique inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hamdani et al. (2006)</ref> for lunar Earthshine intensity spectroscopy. Just as we did, they linearly extrapolated the sky intensity toward the Moon to estimate the background intensity to be subtracted from the raw intensity of the Moon. They found that the slope for the linear extrapolation is proportional to the intensity of the sky. Using this nature, they improve the S/N of the slope, especially at the wavelengths of strong absorption bands, by smoothing a spectrum of slope/intensity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hamdani et al. 2006</ref>). We checked a spectrum of slope/intensity for our data. However, the slope/intensity spectrum was not flat and retained features at the absorption bands. A simple mathematical examination showed that the slope is proportional to the intensity only when the sky intensity can be regarded as a sum of single-shaped spectra. As described in the previous paragraph, this is the case for Earthshine observations, but not for lunar eclipse observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. CREDIBILITY OF THE RESULTS</head><p>Here, we check the credibility of the derived results. Imperfect sky subtraction may lead to spurious results, because the sky intensities were comparable to the signals from the Moon, especially at the shortest wavelengths <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>) and because the sky intensity spectra have features of O 2 . As described in Section 3, we accounted for the errors by the imperfect sky subtraction in our error evaluation. The total errors are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>. Considering the errors, the highest polarization degrees on the in-umbra Moon are justifiably significant.</p><p>In order to discuss the reliability of our results in a different manner, we measure the polarization of the sky itself at slits #6 and #7, where the instrumental polarization was derived by observing unpolarized standard stars through these slits. Its polarization degree spectra around the time of totality, the time-series polarization degrees, and the time-series position angles are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 8, 9</ref>, and 10, respectively. The polarization degree spectra of the sky have a similar shape, though the degrees are suppressed, as compared to the in-umbra spectrum at the same time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). The time-series sky polarization degrees in the V band and O 2 A band exhibit gradual increases after the ingress time toward totality <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>), which are similar to those of the Moon <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 6</ref>). Based only on the snapshot polarization spectra, it is difficult to determine whether the sky polarization was attributed to the polarization of the eclipsed Moon or caused by scattering within the local atmosphere. However, the time variation of the sky polarization degrees is unlikely to be explained if the Moon was kept unpolarized because the relative positions of the slits to the Moon were fixed during our observations. It seems natural to interpret the sky polarization as originating from the polarization of the Moon, which varied with time as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>. This interpretation is consistent with the position angles of the sky polarization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Figure 10)</ref>, which approximately agree with those of the Moon <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7)</ref>. Based on our error estimates and the interpretation of the observed sky polarization, we judge that our results are legitimate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DETAILED DISCUSSION ON THE FIRST TRANSMISSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1. Analogy with Jupiter's Limb Polarization</head><p>We attempt to explain the observed polarization by multiple scattering, namely, double scattering, during the first transmission. This idea is noted in association with the polarization pattern on Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Coyne &amp; Pellicori 1970)</ref>. Since the pioneering observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lyot (1929)</ref>, Jupiter has been known to exhibit polarization enhancement on its limb, even though the phase angle is always small (&lt; 11 • ) when observed from the Earth. The degree of the limb polarization is up to 10 % in the visible wavelengths, whereas that at the center of the disk is less than 1 % ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gehrels et al. 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schmid et al. 2011</ref>). The position angles usually have a radial pattern, which is vertical to the limb. The emergence of the limb polarization was explained by an imbalance between (i) the contribution of light that first scattered to the vertical direction and then scattered to the observer, and (ii) the contribution of light that first scattered to  the horizontal direction and then scattered again to the observer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gehrels et al. 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schmid et al. 2011</ref>). Grazing incidence to the atmosphere on the limb produces an excess of (ii) over (i), which results in vertical polarization. Limb polarization was observed not only for Jupiter but also for Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schmid et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Schmid et al. , 2006</ref>). During a lunar eclipse, the Earth is viewed from the Moon as a ring of bright limb. There are considerable differences between an observation of the Earth's limb and that of Jupiter's limb (and limbs of the other outer planets): for instance, the Earth's limb was viewed as transmitted light, whereas Jupiter's limb is observed as reflected light. Nonetheless, the polarization of Jupiter's limb may be analogous to the polarization of the Earth's limb, if any, because the both have a common geometry of grazing incidence to the atmosphere.</p><p>Therefore, we examine whether the Earth's limb can be polarized by double scattering, in analogy with Jupiter's limb polarization. For this purpose, the light after the first Earth transmission is divided into two components, which we label straightforward and doubly scattered components. As described below through Appendix C, we expect that the former is almost unpolarized and the latter is significantly polarized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2. Straightforward Component</head><p>The straightforward component refers to the beams that propagate nearly straightforwardly through the atmosphere. This component contains the direct sunlight and singly scattered sunlight with a scattering angle less than ∼2 • (i.e., nearly forward-scattered light).</p><p>The straightforward beams (of whichever type) undergo extinction along the transmission through the atmosphere. The extinction has been considered to be isotropic with respect to the orientation of electromagnetic oscillations, hence producing no polarization. Although recent precise ground-based polarimetry discovered that the partially aligned dust in the telluric atmosphere polarizes the incoming stellar light, its degree was 0.005 % at the maximum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bailey et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Polarization by refraction of the direct sunlight is roughly evaluated for a uniform plane-parallel atmosphere with a refractive index of the standard air <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ciddor 1996)</ref>. The Fresnel equations give 0.03 % as the polarization degree of the refracted light in the visible wavelengths. The polarization by near-forward scattering is also very weak, namely, 0.06 % for a scattering angle of 2 • .</p><p>Considering the discussions above, we regard directly transmitted light as unpolarized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.3. Doubly Scattered Component</head><p>In this section, using a simple model, we will demonstrate that the doubly scattered component can be considerably polarized. As a preparation for our model, we introduce the vertical and horizontal optical thickness together with their ratio, following the formulation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fortney (2005)</ref>. The vertical optical thickness above an altitude z is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">τ V (z) = ∞ z σn z (z)dz = σn z (z)H, (C1)</formula><p>where σ is the molecular scattering cross section and n z (z) is the volume number density of molecules along a vertical line (the z-axis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref>), which is given by n z (z) = n z (0)exp(−z/H). H is the scale height derived from</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">H = kT mg , (C2)</formula><p>where k is Boltzmann's constant, g is the gravitational acceleration, m is the mean mass of an atmospheric molecule, and T is the temperature. H is approximately 7-8 km for the Earth. The horizontal optical thickness along a horizontal line with a tangential altitude of z (parallel to the x-axis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref>) is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">τ H (z) = ∞ −∞ σn x (x, z)dx = σn z (z) √ 2πRH,<label>(C3)</label></formula><p>where n x (x, z) is the density of molecules along the horizontal line, which is given by n x (x, z) = n z (z) exp −x 2 /2RH , where R is the Earth's radius. From Eqs. (C1) and (C3), we can derive the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical optical thickness by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">η ≡ τ H (z) τ V (z) = 2πR H . (C4)</formula><p>Here η is approximately 70-80, which means that τ H is much greater than τ V . τ V (0) is roughly 0.1 for clear atmosphere at λ = 550 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Coffeen 1979)</ref>, and thus the vertical optical thickness is always thin. In contrast, horizontal optical thickness can be either thin or thick depending on the altitude. Hereafter, we build a simple model to evaluate the doubly scattered fluxes. In order to derive the physical essence, we concentrate on horizontal and vertical double scattering with a scattering angle of ∼90 • , as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure  11</ref>. The scattering medium is assumed to be atmospheric molecules, and thus Rayleigh scattering is considered. The effects of clouds are not included in the model but will be briefly discussed.</p><p>First, the scattered fluxes are modeled for the situation in which τ H (z o ) is thin (&lt; 1), where z o is the tangential altitude from which the beam of interest exits <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 11</ref>). With Z 1 defined by τ H (Z 1 ) = 1, we can state z o &gt; Z 1 . For the purpose of keeping our model as simple as possible, we assume that the optically thin and thick natures are clearly divided at the thickness of unity, though we recognize that in reality the transition is continuous. The adequacy of this treatment will be checked later.</p><p>Let us consider a horizontally scattered beam, which is firstly scattered at point A with a position (x A , y A , z o ) and secondly at point B with a position (x A , 0, z o ) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11)</ref>. Both points are in a horizontal plane with an altitude z o . Note that a "point" here refers to a unit volume element of the atmosphere. The flux of the beam after the second scattering is given by F in cσn A c ′ σn B , where F in is the incident sunlight flux (in units of Wm −2 µm −1 , where µm −1 is the unit of wavelength intervals), c and c ′ are the fraction of perpendicularly scattered energy (in terms of per unit wavelength intervals) in the whole energy scattered by a molecule (c is for unpolarized incident light, and c ′ is for the completely polarized incident light), n A is the molecular density at point A, and n B is that at point B. We have n A = n x ( x 2 A + y 2 A , z o ) and n B = n x (x A , z o ). Because the total horizontally scattered flux emerging from an altitude z o (for z o &gt; Z 1 ) is the integrated flux of the beams via point A at any point in the horizontal plane, it is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">F thin H (z o ) = ∞ −∞ ∞ −∞ F in cσn A c ′ σn B dx A dy A = √ 2 2 F in cc ′ τ H (z o ) 2 .<label>(C5)</label></formula><p>Eq. (C3) is used for the transformation. It is reasonable that the flux of horizontal double scattering at a given altitude, F thin H (z o ), is proportional to the square of the horizontal thickness at the altitude, τ H (z o ) 2 . Evaluation of the vertically scattered flux for z o &gt; Z 1 can be done in a similar manner to the horizontally scattered flux, but requires separate treatments depending on the altitude of the first scattering point C with a position (x C , 0, z C ). When point C is within the horizontally thin layer, or for z C &gt; Z 1 , the vertically scattered flux is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">F thin1 V (z o ) = ∞ Z1 ∞ −∞ F in cσn C c ′ σn D dx C dz C = √ 2 2 F in cc ′ τ H (z o )τ V (Z 1 ),<label>(C6)</label></formula><p>where n C and n D are the molecular densities at the first and second scattering points, C and D, respectively. It is natural that the vertically scattered flux from the horizontally thin layer (z C &gt; Z 1 ) is proportional to the product of the horizontal thickness at a given altitude, τ H (z o ), and the vertical thickness of the layer, τ V (Z 1 ). When point C is within the horizontally thick layer, or for z C ≤ Z 1 , the incident sunlight can no longer penetrate through the atmosphere. With X u as the x coordinate where the horizontal optical depth reaches unity (thus Xu −∞ σn x dx = 1), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">F thin2 V (z o ) = Z1 0 Xu −∞ F in cσn C c ′ σn D dx C dz C ∼ = (− log u + u − 1)F in cc ′ τ H (z o )τ V (Z 1 ),<label>(C7)</label></formula><p>where u ≡ 2 − √ 2 /4 and thus − log u + u − 1 ∼ = 1.1. Here, for the reason of keeping our calculation analytical, we have replaced a Gaussian function exp −ax 2 by a rectangular function with a width of 2 π/a and a height of 1/2. This corresponds to a physical treatment in which we flatten the Gaussian distribution of n x with a constant value within a limited x range, whilst the total number of molecules is conserved.</p><p>By comparing Eq. (C6) with Eq. (C7), we find F thin1 V : F thin2 V ∼ = 1 : 1.5. Despite much greater molecular densities below Z 1 than those above</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Z 1 , F thin2 V is comparable to F thin1 V</formula><p>. This can be interpreted as follows: with the increasing τ H (decreasing z C ), X u moves toward the horizontal end (to the negative x direction or the left side in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11)</ref>; this means that the effective x range for the scattering point D becomes more limited, and thus the secondly scattered flux decreases with decreasing z C ; consequently, F thin2 V is not too great compared to F thin1 V .</p><p>Because the net flux of vertically scattered light is the sum of Eqs. (C6) and (C7), it is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">F thin V (z o ) ∼ = (− log u − u)F in cc ′ τ H (z o )τ V (Z 1 ),<label>(C8)</label></formula><p>where − log u − u is approximately 1.8. Next, we model the scattered fluxes when τ H (z o ) is thick (≥ 1), or for z o ≤ Z 1 . In this condition, light extinction during the propagation cannot be ignored. This effect diminishes the emergent scattered fluxes (for both horizontal and vertical scattering) by a factor of approximately exp (−τ H (z o )). With decreasing z o from Z 1 , the extinction becomes double-exponentially more effective. On the other hand, the scattered energy (or number of photons) migrated to the horizontal line with a tangential altitude of z o is almost saturated for z o &lt; Z 1 , and thus it does not vary much with decreasing z o . Therefore, the emergent scattered fluxes (F thick H (z o ), F thick V (z o ) for horizontal and vertical scattering, respectively) can be modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">F thick H (z o ) ∼ = F thin H (Z 1 ) exp (−τ H (z o )) ,<label>(C9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">F thick V (z o ) ∼ = F thin V (Z 1 ) exp (−τ H (z o )) .<label>(C10)</label></formula><p>F thin X (z) and F thick X (z) (X is H or V) are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> (hereafter z o is replaced by z). At z = Z 1 , there is a disconnection between F thin X (z) and F thick X (z). This is because we treated Z 1 as a clear divide between thin and thick layers and neglected light extinction for z &gt; Z 1 . In reality, however, extinction is effective for a z range where τ H (z) is intermediate, say, a few tenths to unity. In order to reduce the flux overestimate for optically intermediate altitudes, we apply a linear connection between Z 1 and Z 2 (defined by τ H (Z 2 ) = 1/e) as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we have horizontally and vertically scattered fluxes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">F H (z) =    F thin H (z) = √ 2 2 F in cc ′ τ H (z) 2 (z &gt; Z 2 ) F thick H (z) ∼ = F thin H (Z 1 ) exp (−τ H (z)) (z ≤ Z 1 ) ,<label>(C11)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F V (z) =    F thin V (z) ∼ = (− log u − u)F in cc ′ τ H (z)τ V (Z 1 ) (z &gt; Z 2 ) F thick V (z) ∼ = F thin V (Z 1 ) exp (−τ H (z)) (z ≤ Z 1 ) , (C12)</formula><p>respectively. For a range Z 1 &lt; z ≤ Z 2 , a linear connection is applied. By comparing Eqs. (C11) and (C12), we can derive the ratio of the horizontally scattered flux to the vertically scattered flux as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">F H (z) F V (z) ∼ =    τH(z) 2.5τV(Z1) ∼ = 30 τ H (z) (z &gt; Z 1 ) τH(Z1) 2.5τV(Z1) ∼ = 30 (z ≤ Z 1 ) . (C13)</formula><p>For z &lt; 5.5H ∼ = 40 km (for λ = 550 nm), F H is larger than F V . At z = Z 1 where both F H and F V are at the maximum (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12)</ref>, F H is approximately 30 times larger than F V . Note that the flux contribution from altitudes z ≥ 5.5H is negligible, as is obvious from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>. We calculate the vertically integrated emergent fluxes (in units of W m −1 µm −1 ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Φ H ≡ ∞ 0 F H (z)dz ∼ = √ 2 4 3 e + 2 e 2 F in cc ′ H, (C14) Φ V ≡ ∞ 0 F V (z)dz ∼ = 3(− log u − u) eη F in cc ′ H,<label>(C15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">where Z1 0 F thick X (z)</formula><p>dz is approximated by a triangular area with a base of F thick X (Z 1 ) and a height of 2H. We have Φ H /Φ V ∼ = 0.25η, which is approximately 20. Hence, Φ H is much greater than Φ V . The polarization degree of the doubly scattered component is estimated to be ∼90 % in our model. Because horizontally scattered flux is dominant, the emergent scattered flux is polarized in the vertical direction. Therefore, the ring of the Earth's limb as viewed from the Moon is expected to have a radial pattern of polarization.</p><p>The radial pattern of polarization is in common with Jupiter's limb, as described in section C.1. Our estimate also seems consistent with the polarization pattern of the sunlit sky viewed from the Earth ground ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berry et al. 2004</ref>): the observational and theoretical results had vertical polarization of the sky near the Sun on the horizon; the polarization of the sky near the Sun was explained by the effect of double scattering.</p><p>Although each element in the Earth's limb is expected to be polarized, the sum of the whole limb would be unpolarized if the all the limb elements had an equal polarized flux in terms of the absolute value (i.e., the vectors of the polarized flux had a perfectly point-symmetric pattern). Our detection of polarization on the eclipsed Moon requires some sort of inhomogeneity along the limb, because the observed light is a reflection of the integrated Earth's limb. As our observed position angle of polarization is roughly in the east-west orientation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7)</ref>, we expect an excess of polarized flux at the equatorial regions compared to that at the polar regions.</p><p>We have not yet determined for certain what causes the inhomogeneity of polarized flux. Although a fully quantitative discussion is the beyond the scope of this work, there are a few qualitatively possible explanations. From Eqs. (C14) and (C15), we obtain the polarized flux of scattered light from the atmosphere above a point on the limb:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">P db Φ db ≡ Φ H − Φ V ∼ = Φ l ightH,</formula><p>where P db and Φ db are the polarization degree and the flux of the doubly scattered component, respectively. Φ H is proportional to H (Eq. (C14)), which is proportional to the temperature T (Eq. (C2)). Hence, P db Φ db is estimated to be proportional to T . According to the April data in the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA-86), pressure-weighted vertically averaged temperatures at the equator (0 • latitude) and the poles (80 • N and 80 • S latitudes) are ∼265 K and ∼240 K, respectively. Therefore, we can expect an excess of ∼10 % of P db Φ db at the equatorial regions compared to that at the polar regions. The inhomogeneous polarized flux due to the latitudinal variation of temperature may account for part of the observed polarization.</p><p>Alternatively or additionally, local coverage of clouds, or any diffuse media, may also explain the inhomogeneous polarized flux along the limb. The photographs of Earth's limb taken by Surveyor III showed that the local clouds on the beam path strongly reduce the local brightness of the limb <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Shoemaker et al. 1968</ref>). Hence, if the cloud coverage near the poles was greater than that near the equator at the time of our observations, an excess of polarized flux at the equator may have been produced. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, the most contributing altitude to the polarized flux is z = Z 1 ∼ = 2H ∼ 15 km, which is in the lower stratosphere. Although the stratosphere is rarely cloudy owing to its dryness, the stratosphere above the polar regions is known to occasionally contain clouds, which are called polar stratospheric clouds or PCSs. We checked a global cloud map on our observing date (not exactly at the time of our observations), obtained by the MODIS instrument aboard the Terra satellite. 3 Visual inspection of the map suggested more clouds on the polar regions than the equator. This may support our hypothesis; nonetheless, more comprehensive investigation is necessary to prove it.</p><p>The latitudinal inhomogeneity may be either temporary or constant. Further monitoring of lunar eclipse polarization will help to identify the cause of the inhomogeneity. </p><formula xml:id="formula_30">z x y A B C D O z o F H (z o ) F V (z o )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.4. Consistency with the Observations</head><p>Overall, the observed in-umbra polarization degrees decrease with increasing wavelength ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). This wavelength dependence is consistent with our explanation of polarization caused by double scattering during the first transmission. Recall that the transmitted light is the sum of the unpolarized straightforward and polarized doubly scattered components. Hence, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">P e = P db Φ db Φ db + Φ fwd ∼ = Φ H Φ H + Φ fwd ,<label>(C16)</label></formula><p>where P e is the polarization degree of an element on the Earth's limb as observed from the Moon and Φ fwd is the vertically integrated flux of the straightforward component. We have P db Φ db ∼ = Φ db ∼ = Φ H . Eq. (C14) tells us that Φ H has the same wavelength dependence as the F in . As we have Φ fwd ∝ F in T , where T is the atmospheric transmittance, the wavelength dependence of the observed polarization can be expressed in the form P e (λ) = (1 + aT (λ)) −1 , where a is a wavelength-independent constant. Note that F in is canceled out. As is well known as the reason for the red color of the eclipsed Moon, T increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. Therefore, the polarization degree of the in-umbra Moon rapidly decreases with increasing wavelength ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>The existence of enhanced features on the in-umbra polarization degree spectrum ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>) is explained in the same manner as the overall wavelength dependence. At molecular absorption wavelengths, a T spectrum has a decreased feature. Therefore, as the inverse of the T spectrum, the polarization degree spectrum has an enhanced feature. The distinct contrast of the feature at the ∼760 nm O 2 absorption wavelengths is interpreted as follows. At the continuum wavelengths, unpolarized Φ fwd is dominant as compared to polarized Φ db , owing to a great atmospheric transmittance at the red wavelengths. In contrast, at the absorption wavelengths, the contribution of Φ db should be significant owing to the great depression of Φ fwd . Hence, the polarization degree at the continuum is very low, whereas that at the absorption band can be distinctively high.</p><p>The observed polarization degrees at the V band and the O 2 A band increased from the time of target ingress toward the time of the greatest eclipse ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>). This time variation is also consistent with our explanation. As the Moon moves deeper in the umbra, the Moon becomes darker. The V-band surface brightness of the eclipsed Moon darkens by a factor of tens with respect to the brightness at the ingress time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sekiguchi 1980)</ref>. The decrease in the brightness should be attributed to that of the straightforward component Φ fwd , rather than the doubly scattered component Φ db . As the Moon approaches the umbra center, Φ fwd decreases because the direct sunlight subcomponent traces a lower and thicker atmosphere, which is a result of the requirement of a greater refraction angle to be directed to the Moon. In contrast, Φ db should remain virtually constant during the movement of the Moon because the flux of Rayleigh scattering varies as little as 0.1 % with a direction change of a range of ∼2 • (Hapke 2012). Therefore, the observed increasing polarization degrees after the ingress time to the mid-time can be explained by the decreasing Φ fwd and the nearly constant Φ db ( ∼ = Φ H ) (see Eq. (C16)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.4.1. Limitations</head><p>We should mention some limitations of our simple model for double scattering. Because our model contains simplifications and approximations, it is not sufficient to be used for an estimate of absolute fluxes, namely, Φ H , Φ V , and Φ db . One of the concerns arising from this may be whether the polarized flux of double scattering can be significant enough within the total transmitted flux, which is considered here as the sum of direct, singly scattered, and doubly scattered components.</p><p>Although the direct sunlight transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere has been believed to be the dominant component in the brightness of the eclipsed Moon, recent studies showed that the singly scattered component can be comparable to, or even surpass, the direct component, especially at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm ( ). They did not consider any higher-order scattering, but an evidence suggesting the significance of double scattering is provided from facts on polarized sunlit sky observed from the ground. The polarization pattern over the sunlit sky cannot be explained by only single scattering, but the contribution of multiple scattering, namely, double scattering, is also required <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandrasekhar &amp; Elbert 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coffeen 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berry et al. 2004</ref>). The theoretical calculation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar &amp; Elbert (1954)</ref> showed that a sky region near the Sun on the horizon has a polarization degree of ∼20 %, which should be attributed to double scattering, because near-forward single scattering cannot produce such strong polarization. If we observe the sunlit sky from the Moon, the sky polarization may be larger owing to a larger optical thickness for the transmission than that for ground-based observations, which means singly and doubly scattered fluxes may be comparable. Combining previous knowledge about the brightness of the eclipsed Moon (possibly, direct sunlight ∼ single scattering) and polarization of sunlit sky (possibly, single scattering ∼ double scattering), we expect that fluxes of direct sunlight, single scattering, and double scattering can be comparable to each other and that their sum may have a polarization percentage of several tens, especially at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm.</p><p>Another limitation in our model is that we consider only Rayleigh scattering by gas molecules as the polarizing source. This assumption is reasonable because the polarization of the sunlit sky, as observed from the ground, is excellently reproduced by the theory based on Rayleigh scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandrasekhar &amp; Elbert 1954</ref>). Nonetheless, polarization by aerosol scattering may also explain the observed polarization. Φ db ( ∼ = Φ H ) in our model <ref type="bibr">(Eq. (C14)</ref>) is missing a term representing the wavelength dependence of Rayleigh scattering (namely, σ). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The wavelength dependence of the inumbra polarization degree is basically determined by that of the transmittance for unpolarized light Φ fwd . Therefore, our model does not exclude polarization by non-Rayleigh scattering as the cause of polarization. In the case where aerosol polarization is effective, the distribution of aerosols may explain the inhomogeneity of the polarized flux along the Earth's limb.</p><p>In spite of these limitations, our model for double scattering is useful to demonstrate the overwhelming excess of horizontally scattered flux over vertically scattered flux and to identify the determinant factors of the polarized flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. EXPECTED FRACTIONAL POLARIZATION DURING A TRANSIT OF AN EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANET</head><p>Based on our observed results, we make a rough estimate of fractional polarization during a transit of an Earth-like exoplanet. We detected 2-3 % polarization of the in-umbra Moon. Considering a depolarization factor of ∼1/3 (Dollfus 1957; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bazzon et al. 2013</ref>), polarization of the net (ring-integrated) transmitted light through the Earth's atmosphere should have been ∼6-9% if we had observed the Earth from the Moon. We assume a 10% polarization of the Earth's transmitted light (P earth ) for the following discussion.</p><p>According to a lunar eclipse observation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sekiguchi (1980)</ref>, the V-band surface brightness was darker by ∼10 mag when the Moon was in the umbra than when it was outside of the penumbra. This means F earth /F sun ∼ 10 −4 , where F earth is the net flux of Earth's transmitted light as observed from the Moon and F sun is direct sunlight (without transmission through the Earth's atmosphere). Hence, the ratio of the polarized flux to the sunlight is P earth F earth /F sun ∼ 10 −5 .</p><p>We need to be careful of a difference between the geometry of an Earth's transit as observed from the Moon and that of an exoplanet's transit as observed from the Earth. Let us imagine what would happen if we pushed the Moon further away from the Earth. As the original distance of the Moon from the Earth, l, becomes a larger distance, l ′ , the polarized flux observed from the Moon will decrease to P earth F earth (l ′ /l) −2 . In the meantime, the received solar flux will be F sun ((L + l ′ )/L) −2 , where L is the original distance between the Sun and the Moon. Hence, the ratio of the polarized flux to the solar flux, as observed from the further point, will be</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">P earth F earth F sun l ′ l L L + l ′ −2 .<label>(D17)</label></formula><p>An observation of an exoplanetary transit corresponds to a situation where l ′ → ∞; thus, the fractional polarization during the transit, P exo , can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">P exo = P earth F earth F sun L l −2 .<label>(D18)</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
