			<abstract>
				<p>We present sixteen occultation and three transit light curves for the ultra-short period hot Jupiter WASP-103b, in addition to five new radial velocity measurements. We combine these observations with archival data and perform a global analysis of the resulting extensive dataset, accounting for the contamination from a nearby star. We detect the thermal emission of the planet in both the z and K S-bands, the measured occultation depths being 699±110 ppm (6.4-σ) and 3567 +400 −350 ppm (10.2-σ), respectively. We use these two measurements together with recently published HST/WFC3 data to derive joint constraints on the properties of WASP-103b&apos;s dayside atmosphere. On one hand, we find that the z-band and WFC3 data are best fit by an isothermal atmosphere at 2900 K or an atmosphere with a low H 2 O abundance. On the other hand, we find an unexpected excess in the K S-band measured flux compared to these models, which requires confirmation with additional observations before any interpretation can be given. From our global data analysis, we also derive a broad-band optical transmission spectrum that shows a minimum around 700 nm and increasing values towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This is in agreement with a previous study based on a large fraction of the archival transit light curves used in our analysis. The unusual profile of this transmission spectrum is poorly matched by theoretical spectra and is not confirmed by more recent observations at higher spectral resolution. Additional data, both in emission and transmission, are required to better constrain the atmospheric properties of WASP-103b.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Transiting extrasolar planets are key objects for the understanding of worlds beyond our Solar System, as they provide a wealth of information about their systems. Thanks to their mospheric studies are conducted using mainly the transmission and emission (spectro)photometry techniques. During a transit, some of the starlight passes through the planetary atmosphere and, depending on the atmospheric extent, temperature, and composition, wavelength-dependent variations are seen in the amount of absorbed flux. Thus, from multiwavelength transit light curves, a transmission spectrum of the upper atmosphere at the day-night terminator region can be obtained (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Seager &amp; Sasselov 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">, Charbonneau et al. 2002</ref>. At the opposite conjunction, when the planet passes behind the star during a secondary eclipse (occultation), one can measure the flux drop caused by the elimination of the flux component originating from the dayside of the planet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deming et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref>). Using this technique at different wavelengths allows to probe the emission spectrum of the planet's dayside, from which insights on its atmospheric composition and vertical pressure-temperature (P − T) profile can be gained.</p><p>A broad diversity of transmission spectra has been found across the population of close-in transiting gas giant exoplanets (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sing et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Fu et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Tsiaras et al. 2017</ref>). Some planets have sufficiently clear atmospheres to allow detections of atomic and molecular species, in particular Na (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nikolov et al. 2014</ref>), K (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sing et al. 2011)</ref>, and H 2 O (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deming et al. 2013</ref>), while others appear to contain high-altitude clouds or hazes that completely mute the spectral features of the atmospheric components (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gibson et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Line et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Lendl et al. 2016</ref>). Even when detected, atmospheric spectral signatures are often less pronounced than predicted by theoretical models of clear atmospheres with solar abundances (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deming et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Madhusudhan et al. 2014</ref>), suggesting that an extra opacity source is still present, at some level, in otherwise predominantly cloud-free atmospheres. This picture is supported by evidences for high-altitude atmospheric hazes reported for several hot Jupiters (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Nikolov et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Sing et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Sing et al. 2016</ref>), based on their Rayleigh or Mie scattering signature in the planets' transmission spectra.</p><p>On the emission side, most observations gathered so far seem to indicate atmospheric vertical pressure-temperature profiles without significant thermal inversions. Temperature inversions were predicted by early theoretical studies of highly irradiated giant planets, that suggested two classes of hot Jupiters based on their degree of irradiation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hubeny et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Fortney et al. 2008</ref>; the hotter class was predicted to host thermal inversions in their atmospheres due to strong absorption of incident UV/visible irradiation at high altitude by high-temperature absorbers, such as gaseous TiO and VO (commonly found in low-mass stars and brown dwarfs), while cooler atmospheres were expected to be devoid of thermal inversions due to the condensation of these absorbing compounds. Thermal inversions have been previously claimed for several hot Jupiters based on Spitzer observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Machalek et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Knutson et al. 2009</ref>), but these detections have been seriously called into question since then (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Schwarz et al. 2015</ref>). It has been suggested that TiO and VO may not remain suspended in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters due to cold-trapping, that would occur either deeper in the dayside atmosphere or on the cooler nightside, and would cause their condensation and downward drag by gravitational settling (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>). Inversion-causing compounds may also be photodissociated by high chromospheric emission from the host star, so that the formation of inversions may be affected by stellar activity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. 2010)</ref>. Another important factor is the atmospheric chemistry; for example, the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) can control the abundance of TiO/VO, with a C/O ≥ 1 causing substantial depletion of TiO/VO, most available oxygen being taken up by CO molecules in this case thus leaving no oxygen for gaseous TiO/VO (Madhusudhan 2012). Alternatively, the apparently isothermal emission spectra observed for many hot Jupiters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>) may result from the presence of high-altitude cloud decks in their dayside atmospheres that could prevent some thermal inversions from being detected (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sing et al. 2013</ref>). Nevertheless, hottest planets are still the best candidates to look for thermal inversions. Indeed, the planets showing the strongest evidence to date for temperature inversions are WASP-33 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Haynes et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Nugroho et al. 2017</ref>) and WASP-121 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Evans et al. 2017)</ref>, which are among the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters currently known. In this work, we study the atmospheric properties of another ultra-hot gas giant, WASP-103 b ( <ref type="bibr">Gillon et al. 2014, hereafter G14)</ref>.</p><p>This extreme hot Jupiter, discovered by the WASP Collaboration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pollacco et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Collier Cameron et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Hellier et al. 2011</ref>), has a mass of ∼1.5 M Jup , an inflated radius of ∼1.6 R Jup , and is in an ultra-shortperiod orbit (∼22.2hrs) around a relatively bright (V = 12.1, K = 10.8) F8V star (G14). With an incident stellar flux of ∼9.1 × 10 9 erg s −1 cm −2 (∼9.1 × 10 6 W m −2 ), it is one of the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters known to date. Assuming a null Bond albedo, it is heated to an equilibrium temperature close to 2500 K. These properties make WASP-103 b an exquisite target for atmospheric characterization. Another interesting fact about this planet is that its orbital semi-major axis is also only ∼1.16 times larger than its Roche limit, meaning that the planet might be close to tidal disruption. WASP-103 b is thus also a favorable object for studying the atmospheric properties of hot Jupiters in the last stages of their evolution. <ref type="bibr">Southworth et al. (2015, hereafter S15</ref>) published highprecision follow-up transit photometry of WASP-103 b in several broad-band optical filters, which they used to refine the physical and orbital parameters of the system. They also detected a slope in the resulting broad-band transmission spectrum, larger values of the effective planetary radius being obtained at bluer wavelengths, which they found to be too steep to be mainly caused by Rayleigh scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Subsequent to their study, a previously unresolved faint star was found via lucky imaging by <ref type="bibr">Wöllert &amp; Brandner (2015, hereafter W15</ref>) at an angular separation of only 0.24 from WASP-103. This object, which was also recently imaged by <ref type="bibr">Ngo et al. (2016, here- after N16)</ref>, is significantly redder than WASP-103 and may be either gravitationally bound or simply aligned along the line of sight. Contamination from this redder star, if not accounted for, is expected to produce a blueward slope in the transmission spectrum of WASP-103 b, the transit signal being more strongly diluted at longer wavelengths than at shorter ones. This led <ref type="bibr">Southworth &amp; Evans (2016, here- after S16)</ref> to publish a reanalysis of the data presented in S15, accounting for the presence of the contaminating star.</p><p>They found the inclusion of contaminating light from the faint star in their analysis to have no significant effect on the derived system physical properties. They also reported a corrected broad-band transmission spectrum showing, instead of a steep slope, a minimum effective planetary radius around 760 nm and increasing values towards both bluer and redder wavelengths. This "V-shape" is not well reproduced by existing theoretical models of transmission spectra. Very recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lendl et al. (2017)</ref> reported an optical transmission spectrum of WASP-103 b obtained at medium spectral resolution between 550 and 960 nm using Gemini/GMOS. While they found signs of strong Na and K absorption, they did not observe any evidence for the V-shape pattern reported by S16.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr">Cartier et al. (2017, hereafter C17</ref>) presented near-infrared occultation spectrophotometry of WASP-103 b obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. After correction for flux contamination from the nearby star, they found the dayside emission spectrum of WASP-103 b to be indistinguishable from isothermal from 1.1 to 1.7 µm. They noted that several atmospheric models, besides an isothermal one, can result in an apparently isothermal emission spectrum across this wavelength range, for example an atmosphere with a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by their observations, an atmosphere with a monotonically decreasing temperaturepressure profile and a C/O&gt;1, or an atmosphere harboring clouds or hazes at high altitude. This highlights the need for additional eclipse observations at other wavelengths to help differentiate between these potential atmospheric scenarios.</p><p>To improve the atmospheric characterization of WASP-103 b, we carried out an intense ground-based photometric monitoring of its occultations, with the aim of probing its dayside emission spectrum in the z (0.9 µm) and K S (2.1 µm) bands. We complemented the data acquired in the frame of this program with some additional transit photometry and radial velocity (RV) measurements, combined all these new observations with the data previously published in G14 and S15, and performed a global analysis of the resulting extensive dataset, taking into account the contamination from the faint star. The Gemini/GMOS transmission and HST/WFC3 emission data were published during the final stages of the preparation of this manuscript, so we did not include them in our global analysis but we discuss these measurements along with our results in the scientific discussion. The paper is organized as follows. The new observations and their reduction are described in Section 2, as well as the archival data used in our global analysis. In Section 3, we present our detailed data analysis and results. We discuss these results in Section 4, before concluding in Section 5.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. We describe these new data in the sections below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">TRAPPIST eclipse photometry</head><p>We observed one transit and nine occultations of WASP-103 b using the 0.6m TRAPPIST robotic telescope and its thermoelectrically-cooled 2K×2K CCD (field of view of 22 ×22 , plate scale of 0.65 /pixel). For details of TRAP-PIST, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gillon et al. (2011a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jehin et al. (2011)</ref>.

EulerCam is a nitrogen-cooled 4K×4K CCD camera with a field of view of 15.68 ×15.73 at a plate scale of 0.215 /pixel. The transits were observed in a Gunn-r filter (effective wavelength = 664.1 nm) with an exposure time of 80s. The occultations were acquired through a Gunn-z filter (effective wavelength = 912.3 nm), with exposure times between 60s and 100s. A slight defocus was applied to the telescope to optimize the observation efficiency and to minimize pixel-to-pixel effects. This resulted in stellar PSFs with a typical FWHM between 1.1 and 2.5 . Here too, the positions of the stars on the detector were kept within a box of a few pixels throughout the observations, thanks to the "Absolute Tracking" system of EulerCam that matches the <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">CFHT/WIRCam occultation photometry</head><p>We observed one occultation of WASP-103 b with the Widefield InfraRed Camera (WIRCam, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Puget et al. 2004</ref>) on the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. WIRCam consists of four 2K×2K HgCdTe HAWAII-2RG arrays, arranged in a 2×2 mosaic. The instrument has a total field of view of 20.5 ×20.5 (with gaps of 45 between adjacent chips) at a scale of 0.3 /pixel. We used the K S broad-band filter, which has a bandwidth of 0.325 µm centered at 2.146 µm. The ob-servations took place on 2014 May 20 from 06:50 to 12:40 UT, covering the 2.6hrs long predicted occultation (assuming a circular orbit) together with 3.2hrs of out-of-eclipse observations. Conditions were photometric, with a median seeing of 0.6 , and airmass decreased from 2.4 to 1.09 during the run. The data were gathered in staring mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Devost et al. 2010)</ref>, with the target and reference stars observed continuously for several hours on the same pixels without any dithering. This mode has been used by other authors for similar observations with WIRCam (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wang et al. 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Croll et al. 2015</ref>) and has proven to yield an optimal photometric precision. The pointing was carefully selected to ensure that the target and reference stars did not fall near bad pixels, as well as to maximize the number of suitable reference stars located on the same WIRCam chip as WASP-103 (see below). The scientific sequence consisted of 1092 exposures, each 5s and read out with correlated double sampling 2 (CDS). A defocus of 2mm was applied to the telescope, in order to reduce the impact of imperfect flatfielding, inter-and intra-pixel variations on the photometry, as well as to keep the counts of the target and reference stars in the regime where detector non-linearity is minimized (linearity to within 1% below ∼10 kADU) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . This resulted in a ring-shaped PSF with a radius of ∼4.5 (∼15 pixels). A short set of dithered (ten offset positions) in-focus images was taken before and after the scientific sequence in order to construct a sky flat (see below). The data were reduced independently of the traditional WIRCam`Iìwi pipeline 4 , following the prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Croll et al. (2015)</ref> for the reduction of WIRCam staring mode data. We refer the reader to that paper for a detailed description of the reduction procedure and give here an outline of the main steps. The frames from each detector were reduced separately. In each image, the pixels with CDS values above 36 kADU were flagged as saturated. The data were corrected for the small non-linearity 3 present below 10 kADU, following the iterative approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vacca et al. (2004)</ref> for applying a non-linearity correction to CDS images. Each frame was dark subtracted and divided by a sky flat, which was created by taking the median stack of the dithered images acquired before and after the scientific sequence. A bad pixel map was constructed from this sky flat, where pixels flagged as bad were those that deviate by more than 2% from the median of the array. Finally, in each image, bad and saturated pixels had their value replaced by the median value of the adjacent pixels (provided that they were not themselves bad or saturated).</p><p>Aperture photometry was performed for the target and reference stars using iraf/daophot. Apertures were centered using intensity-weighted centroids. We tested a set of constant apertures, as well as apertures that varied from image to image as a function of the mean radius of the ringshaped stellar PSFs. The best result was obtained with a 2 A CDS image is constructed by subtracting a first read of the array, done immediately after reset, from a second read of the array, performed at the end of the exposure.  variable aperture of 1.1 times the mean radius. Using a variable photometric aperture, rather than a fixed one, allowed us to account for the varying atmospheric conditions, as well as to find for each individual image a balance between choosing a small aperture to minimize the sky noise and a large aperture to encompass all the stellar light. For other examples of exoplanet near-infrared photometry extracted using a variable aperture size, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lendl et al. (2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zhou et al. (2014)</ref>. The sky annulus was kept constant for all images, with an inner radius of 30 pixels and an outer radius of 50 pixels. Differential photometry of WASP-103 was finally obtained. We tested all possible combinations of stable reference stars having a brightness similar to the target. We found the best photometry using eight reference stars located on the same WIRCam detector as WASP-103. The resulting light curve is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>3.1 Contamination from the nearby star W15 reported the detection of a stellar object located 0.242±0.016 from WASP-103, fainter by ∆i = 3.11 ± 0.46 and ∆z = 2.59 ± 0.35. N16 presented further observations of this nearby star in the near-infrared and found magnitude differences with WASP-103 of ∆J = 2.427 ± 0.030, ∆H = 2.2165 ± 0.0098, and ∆K S = 1.965 ± 0.019. The astrometric measurements from these two studies are inconclusive as to whether this star is gravitationally bound to the planetary system or not. Due to the very small angular separation of WASP-103 and the nearby object, both stars are contained in all photometric apertures used to extract the eclipse light curves that we included in our global analysis (new and archival data). Although a detailed characterization of the nearby star is beyond the scope of this work, we must estimate the dilution correction factor</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(F W103 + F cont )/F W103 = 1 + F cont /F W103 (where F cont /F W103</formula><p>is the contaminant-to-target flux ratio) for each of the observed passbands, in order to account for this contamination in our data analysis.</p><p>To this end, we first derived the individual apparent magnitudes of WASP-103 and the nearby star in the J, H, and K S bands based on their combined 2MASS magnitudes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) and the magnitude differences reported by N16 in these bands. The resulting apparent magnitudes are given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. While the J − H, H − K S , and J − K S color indices of WASP-103 agree well with a F8V star, the colors of the nearby star suggest a spectral type comprised between K1 and M4 if it is on the main sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Straižys &amp; Lazauskait˙ e 2009)</ref>. We computed the flux ratios F cont /F W103 in the passbands of interest assuming each of these two spectral types for the contaminant. We used for this purpose PHOENIX model spectra ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Husser et al. 2013</ref>) of WASP-103 and the nearby star that we integrated over the passbands of interest. The flux ratio in a given passband can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F cont F W103 = f 2 M cont M W103<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where M W103 and M cont are the band-integrated model fluxes of WASP-103 and the contaminant, respectively, and f is a geometric factor defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f = R cont R W103 d W103 d cont<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with R W103 (resp.

For WASP-103, we used a model spectrum interpolated to the effective temperature T eff , sur-    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Ta- ble 4</ref>. The values derived in the i and z bands are consistent with the measurements from W15 in these two bands (0.0622 ± 0.0250 and 0.0969 ± 0.0302, respectively), but more precise (in the z -band). In the K S -band, we obtained a flux ratio of 0.1496 ± 0.0178, consistent with the value of 0.1637 ± 0.0029 measured by N16, but significantly less precise. For this passband, we thus used the measurement from N16.</p><p>In their reanalysis, S16 also estimated the contamination from the nearby star in the passbands observed in S15, using the near-infrared magnitude differences reported by N16. They obtained values in good agreement with ours, albeit with much smaller error bars (see the last column of their <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>). This is due to the fact that they only used the ∆J and ∆K S magnitude differences, thus discarding the H-band measurement, which results in a smaller uncertainty on the spectral type of the contaminating star. As we see no reason to discard any of the three measurements, we chose to adopt the safer procedure outlined above, giving equal weight to the three color indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Global data analysis</head><p>To obtain the strongest constraints on the system parameters, we performed a global Bayesian analysis of the whole dataset (41 eclipse light curves and 23 RVs). We used for this purpose the most recent version of the adaptive Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) code described in <ref type="bibr">Gillon et al. (2012, and references therein)</ref>, that derives the posterior probability distribution functions of the global model parameters, basing on stochastic simulations. Each UT time of mid-exposure was converted to the BJD TDB time-scale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eastman et al. 2010</ref>). To model the photometry, we used the eclipse model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> multiplied by a different baseline model for each light curve (see below), while the RVs were modeled using a Keplerian orbit (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Murray &amp; Correia 2010</ref>) combined to a systemic velocity. A quadratic limb-darkening law was assumed for the transits.</p><p>The photometric baseline models, different for each light curve, allowed to account for photometric variations not related to the eclipses but rather to external astrophysical, instrumental, or environmental effects. They consisted of different polynomials with respect to, e.g., time, airmass, PSF full-width at half maximum, background, stellar position on the detector, or any combination of these parameters. For each light curve, the optimal baseline function (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>) was selected by way of minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion <ref type="bibr">(BIC, Schwarz 1978)</ref>. For the TRAPPIST light curves, a normalization offset was also part of the baseline model to represent the effect of the meridian flip; that is, the 180 • rotation that the German equatorial mount telescope has to undergo when the meridian is reached. This movement results in different positions of the stellar images on the detector before and after the flip, and the normalization offset allows to account for a possible consecutive jump in the differential photometry at the time of the flip.</p><p>The jump parameters in our MCMC analysis (i.e. the parameters that are randomly perturbed at each step of the MCMC) were:</p><p>• the transit depth in the R-band dF R = (R p, R /R ) 2 , where R p, R is the planetary radius in the R-band and R is the stellar radius;</p><p>• the transit depth differences in the other wavelength bands ddF j = dF j − dF R (where j = g , r , BB, i , I, z );</p><p>• the occultation depths in the z and K S -bands, noted dF occ,z and dF occ,K S , respectively;</p><p>• the transit impact parameter in the case of a circular orbit b = a cos i p /R , where a is the orbital semi-major axis and i p is the orbital inclination;</p><p>• the transit width (from 1 st to 4 th contact) W;</p><p>• the time of mid-transit T 0 ;</p><p>• the orbital period P;</p><p>• the stellar effective temperature T eff and metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>;</p><p>• the parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K 2 = K √ 1 − e 2 P 1/3</formula><p>, where K is the RV orbital semi-amplitude and e is the orbital eccentricity;</p><p>• the two parameters √ e cos ω and √ e sin ω, where ω is the argument of the periastron;</p><p>• the linear combinations of the quadratic limbdarkening coefficients (u 1, j , u 2, j ) in each wavelength band, c 1, j = 2u 1, j + u 2, j and c 2, j = u 1, j − 2u 2, j (where j = g , r , R, BB, i , I, z ).</p><p>The baseline model parameters were not jump parameters; they were determined by linear least-squares minimization from the residuals at each step of the MCMC, thanks to their linear nature in the baseline functions. For this purpose, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method was used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Press et al. 1992</ref>). This approach allows to increase significantly the efficiency of the MCMC implementation by reducing the number of jump parameters and thus the dimension of the space to probe.</p><p>Normal prior probability distribution functions were assumed for T eff , <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  priors were based on the values reported in G14, with expectations and standard deviations corresponding to the quoted measurements and errors, respectively. As for the normal priors imposed on u 1, j and u 2, j , their parameters were interpolated from the theoretical tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011)</ref>. All these normal prior distributions are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>. Uniform prior distributions were assumed for the other jump parameters. At each MCMC step, a value for F cont /F W103 for each wavelength band was drawn from the normal distribution having as expectation and standard deviation the value and error given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> for this band, respectively. The dilution correction factor for each band was computed as 1+F cont /F W103 . The physical parameters of the system were deduced from the jump parameters at each step of the MCMC, so that their posterior probability distribution functions could also be constructed. At each MCMC step, a value for the stellar mean density ρ was first derived from the Kepler's third law and the jump parameters dF R , b , W, P, √ e cos ω and √ e sin ω (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn 2010)</ref>. This ρ and values for T eff and [Fe/H] drawn from their normal prior distributions were used to determine a value for the stellar mass M through an empirical law M (ρ , T eff , [Fe/H]) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Enoch et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Gillon et al. 2011b</ref>) that is calibrated using the set of well-constrained detached eclipsing binary (EB) systems presented by Southworth (2011). Here, we chose to reduce this set to the 116 stars with a mass between 0.7 and 1.7 M , the goal of this selection being to benefit from our preliminary knowledge of the mass of WASP-103 (S15 give M = 1.204 ± 0.089 M ) to improve the determination of the system parameters. In order to propagate correctly the error on the empirical law, the parameters of the selected subset of calibration stars were normally perturbed within their observational error bars and the coefficients of the law were redetermined at each MCMC step. We furthermore took into account the inability of the empirical law to perfectly reproduce the distribution of the stellar masses by determining at each step of the MCMC the quadratic difference between the RMS of the residuals of the modeling of the EB masses by the empirical law and the mean mass error for the EB sample. At each MCMC step, a new value for M was drawn from a normal distribution having as expectation and standard deviation the mass originally determined by the empirical law and the quadratic difference mentioned above, respectively. The stellar radius R was derived from M and ρ , and the other physical parameters of the system were then deduced from the jump parameters and stellar mass and radius.</p><p>Although the photometric errors were computed considering scintillation, sky, dark, readout and photon noises, they are known to be often moderately underestimated. A preliminary MCMC analysis, consisting of one chain of 50 000 steps, was performed to determine the correction factors CF to be applied to the error bars of each photometric time series, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref>. For each light curve, CF is the product of two contributions, β w and β r . On one side, β w represents the under-or overestimation of the white noise of each measurement. It is computed as the ratio between the standard deviation of the residuals and the mean photometric error. On the other side, β r allows to account for possible correlated noise present in the light curve. It is obtained by comparing the standard deviations of the binned and unbinned residuals for different binning intervals ranging from 5 to 120min, with the largest value being kept as β r . The values deduced for β w , β r , and CF = β w × β r for each light curve are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. Similarly, this preliminary analysis allowed us to assess the need to rescale the RV error bars, but it was unnecessary here (the best-fit RV model already gives a reduced χ 2 = 1.0).</p><p>With the corrected photometric error bars, two analyses were then performed: one assuming a circular orbit (e = 0) and one with a free eccentricity. Each analysis consisted of three chains of 100 000 steps, whose convergence was checked using the statistical test of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gelman &amp; Rubin (1992)</ref>. The first 20% of each chain was considered as its burn-in phase and discarded. A model comparison based on the Bayes fac- tor, as estimated from the BIC, strongly favored the circular model (Bayes factor of 4915 in its favor) over the eccentric one. We thus adopted the circular orbit as our nominal solution. The corresponding derived system parameters and 1-σ error bars are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>. The best-fit eclipse models are shown in Figs. 1 (third panel, occultation model in the K S -band), 3 (occultation model in the z -band), and 4 (transit models in each of the observed passbands), while the best-fit RV model is displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.</p></div>

For this purpose, we modeled the atmospheric spectra of WASP-103 b, both in thermal emission and in transmission, using an exoplanetary atmospheric modeling and retrieval method based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009</ref><ref type="bibr">) (also see Madhusudhan et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Madhusudhan 2012</ref>). Here, we briefly summarize the method. The model consists of a 1-D radiative transfer solver which computes the observed spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere for a given geometry, in transit or at secondary eclipse, assuming plane parallel geometry. The temperature profile and chemical composition of the atmosphere are free parameters of the model, with 6 parameters for the P − T profile and 4-6 free parameters for the chemical species; one parameter for each relevant atom/molecule. We include the major opacity sources expected in hot hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, namely H 2 O, CO, CH 4 , CO 2 , C 2 H 2 , HCN, TiO, VO, and collision-induced absorption (CIA) due to H 2 −H 2 , as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Madhusudhan (2012)</ref>. The model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and while computing thermal emission spectra ensures global energy balance with the incident radiation. The parametric temperature structure and molecular abundances in the model allow exploration of a wide range of temperature profiles and chemical compositions in search of the best-fit models to fit the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Emission spectrum</head><p>We clearly detect the thermal emission from the dayside of the planet in both the z (0.9 µm) and K S (2.1 µm) bands, the measured occultation depths being 699±110 ppm (6.4-σ detection) and 3567 +400</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>−350</head><p>ppm (10.2-σ detection), respectively. These two measurements suggest a peculiar feature. The occultation depth in the K S -band corresponds to a brightness temperature (T B ) of 3171 +144</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K.</head><p>Generally, for hot Jupiters, the T B in the z -band is found to be consistent with or higher than that in the K S -band (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al. 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lendl et al. 2013</ref> for WASP-19 b, Madhusudhan 2012 for WASP-12 b, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Haynes et al. 2015</ref> for WASP-33 b). This is because the z -band contains strong spectral features due to TiO. On the other hand, the K S -band is relatively devoid of strong spectral features due to TiO and other molecules relevant for hot Jupiters, with the exception of some weak features due to CO. Thus, when TiO is absent all the near-infrared ground-based photometric bands (z , J, H, and K S ) provide windows in atmospheric opacity and probe the temperatures in the deep atmosphere which tends to be isothermal for hot Jupiters. Therefore, the brightness temperatures in all these channels are expected to be similar, as observed for several hot Jupiters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Lendl et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Mad- husudhan 2012</ref>). On the other hand, in hot Jupiters where TiO is present, it can lead to a thermal inversion in the atmosphere (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) and cause spectral features in emission. In this case, the TiO features in the z -band lead to a higher T B in that band compared to that in the K S -band which still has limited opacity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Haynes et al. 2015</ref>). Therefore, it is rarely the case that the T B in the z - band is lower than that in the K S -band, assuming a solar composition atmosphere. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref> shows our occultation measurements along with model emission spectra of WASP-103 b. The HST/WFC3 measurements recently reported by C17 are also shown. We consider three model scenarios in order to explain the data. Firstly, we find that the z -band and WFC3 data are very well explained by a featureless blackbody spectrum, with a temperature of ∼2900 K (grey model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>). A blackbody spectrum is possible if either the atmosphere is isothermal, as shown here, or the metallicity is very low, i.e. providing very low molecular opacity irrespective of the temperature profile. However, the K S -band point is inconsistent with this blackbody model at ∼3-σ. Secondly, a model with a thermal inversion (green model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>) can fit the current data at nearly the same level as the blackbody. Here, the inversion model has a solar composition atmosphere, but with 0.1×solar TiO, and an inverted P − T profile shown in the inset of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>. The inversion model is able to achieve such a fit because the continuum of this model is at the same temperature as the blackbody model, with only a few strong emission features in the 1.4 µm H 2 O band due to a moderately steep P − T profile. Thirdly, a 0.5×solar non-inverted model (red model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>) provides a slightly worse fit to the data. The non-inverted model has a higher continuum than the blackbody and strong H 2 O absorption, neither of which is observed in the WFC3 spectrum. In summary, an isothermal temperature profile and/or a low H 2 O abundance atmosphere provide the best fits to the z -band and WFC3 data. A low H 2 O abundance is achievable with either a low metallicity or a high C/O ratio ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Madhusudhan 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Moses et al. 2013</ref>). Our model inferences are consistent with those of C17 who based their results on the WFC3 data alone.</p><p>On the other hand, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>, our K S -band data point is matched only at 2-3 σ by our current models. To reproduce this high K S -band flux, a strong source of opacity in this wavelength band would be needed. Such a scenario would also require a strong thermal inversion, as well as low H 2 O and TiO abundances. A thermal inversion would be needed to produce a K S -band emission feature from the above opacity source over the continuum blackbody which is required in the WFC3 band. And, the low H 2 O and TiO abundances would be required to satisfy the lack of features in the WFC3 and z -bands, respectively. However, as pointed out previously, the K S -band is not expected to contain strong spectral features due to any of the molecules relevant for a hot-Jupiter atmosphere, making the above scenario rather unlikely. Further observations in the K S -band are thus required to confirm our measurement, which is based on a single occultation light curve, before any adequate interpretation of the data can be given.</p><p>Additional data are necessary to better characterize the dayside atmosphere of WASP-103 b. Most notably, observations with Spitzer can distinguish between our three model scenarios. The Spitzer /IRAC photometric bands at 3.6 and 4.5 µm together should be able to provide strong constraints on the CO absorption versus emission features between the non-inverted and inverted models in the 4-5 micron region. The joint constraints on the CO and H 2 O abundances could then help constrain the C/O ratio of the dayside atmosphere (Madhusudhan 2012). As mentioned above, we also encourage further observations in the K S -band to confirm our high emission measurement in that band. On a longer time frame, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) should be able to provide conclusive constraints on the P − T profile and composition of this planetary atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Transmission spectrum</head><p>The planet-to-star radius ratios (R p /R ) obtained for each of the observed passbands are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> and shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref>. We find the same "V-shape" pattern as S16, with a minimum effective planetary radius around 700 nm and increasing values towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This pattern is however less significant in our transmission spectrum, due to our more conservative error bars (cf. Section 3.1).</p><p>We compared our broad-band measurements to different model transmission spectra of WASP-103 b, with the aim to derive constraints on the atmospheric properties of the planet at the day-night terminator region. The possible sources of opacity in the spectral range covered (0.4−1.0 µm) for a typical hot Jupiter in the temperature regime of WASP-103 b, with an equilibrium temperature of ∼2500 K are: (a) H 2 O at the redder wavelengths, (b) TiO and VO over the entire range, (c) Na and K doublet line opacity peaking at 0.59 µm and 0.78 µm, respectively, (d ) Rayleigh scattering due to H 2 , and (e) potential high-temperature refractory hazes, e.g. of Fe particles. Amongst all these sources of opacity, the most prominent sources are TiO and scattering. Given the broad-band photometric nature of the data, we are unable to resolve any particular spectral features. However, firstly, the prominent sources of opacity, e.g. TiO, are significantly  <ref type="bibr">TiO (green)</ref>, and a solar abundance model with enhanced scattering due to a possible haze with a scattering index of -3.5 (magenta). The colored circles give the band-integrated fluxes of the corresponding models in the observed photometric bands, for comparison to the data.</p><p>broad to influence the data. Secondly, the full visible coverage of the data allows us to investigate a possible blueward slope in the data which, in turn, could constrain the sources of scattering in the atmosphere, including the presence of hazes.</p><p>We explored the model parameter space of the opacity sources discussed above in search of models that can explain the data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref> shows three models with different degrees of fit:</p><p>• a fiducial model with solar abundance composition in thermochemical equilibrium (TE), but with no TiO (blue);</p><p>• a solar abundance model in TE with TiO (green);</p><p>• a solar abundance model with enhanced scattering due to a possible haze with a scattering index of -3.5, instead of -4 for H 2 Rayleigh scattering (magenta).</p><p>The corresponding χ 2 values are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 7</ref>. When considering the entire dataset, we find that the model with haze provides a better fit to the data than the two other models. However, we note cautiously that this result relies heavily on the high R p /R measured in the bluest wavelength band in our data, i.e. the g -band. When this data point is not considered, the best fit is obtained by the fiducial solarcomposition model without TiO <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 7</ref>, last column). It is clear however that none of these models match the data well.</p><p>During the refereeing process of this paper, a higher resolution optical transmission spectrum of WASP-103 b obtained with Gemini/GMOS was published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lendl et al. (2017)</ref>. These data, covering the wavelength range between 550 and 960 nm, do not show any signs of the V-shape pattern found in our measurements. Instead, they show increased absorption in the cores of the Na and K line fea-  tures, without any other evident trend, thus pointing to a rather clear atmosphere for WASP-103 b at the pressure levels probed (between 0.01 and 0.1 bar). We have no satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy at this point. Our transmission spectrum is mostly based on the dataset published by S15 and re-analysed by S16 (17 out of the 25 transit light curves we used). Our independent data analysis gives similar results to theirs, suggesting that the unusual profile of the measured transmission spectrum is intrinsic to the data and not related to the data analysis process. Extending WASP-103 b's measured transmission spectrum towards near-infrared wavelengths, for example with HST/WFC3, would allow a more detailed characterization of its atmosphere at the day-night terminator region by constraining its H 2 O abundance. Additional data at shorter wavelengths than the spectral range covered by the GMOS data (i.e. bluewards of 550 nm) would also be useful to definitely assess the presence of a scattering slope possibly related to hazes in WASP-103 b's transmission spectrum. At the high temperature (2000 K) of WASP-103 b, most of the usual condensate species are in gas phase (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Marley et al. 2013</ref>), with the exception of few such as Fe and Al 2 O 3 . Characterizing the presence of hazes in such atmospheres is important to be able to make robust determinations of chemical abundances from future spectroscopic data using HST and JWST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work, we presented a total of nineteen new eclipse light curves for the ultra-short-period hot Jupiter WASP-103 b. Sixteen of these light curves were obtained during occultations and three during transits. We also obtained five new RV measurements. We combined these new observations with previously published data and performed a global MCMC analysis of the resulting extensive dataset (41 eclipse light curves and 23 RVs), taking into account the contamination from a faint nearby star.</p><p>Using the approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lendl et al. (2013)</ref>, that involves combining a large number (here fifteen) of occultation light curves obtained with ∼1m-class telescopes to mitigate the effects of correlated noise and progressively extract the occultation signal from the noise, we detected the dayside emission of the planet in the z -band at better than 6-σ (699±110 ppm). From a single occultation light curve acquired with the CFHT/WIRCam facility, we also detected the planet's dayside emission in the K S -band at better than 10-σ, the measured occultation depth being 3567 +400</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>−350</head><p>ppm. We compared these two measurements, along with recently published HST/WFC3 spectrophotometric data, to model emission spectra of WASP-103 b with different temperature profiles and chemical compositions. On one hand, we found that the z -band and WFC3 data are best fit by an isothermal atmosphere at a temperature of ∼2900 K, or an atmosphere with a low metallicity or a high C/O ratio. On the other hand, we found an unexpectedly high flux in the K Sband when compared to these atmospheric models, which requires confirmation with additional observations before any interpretation can be given.</p><p>From our global data analysis, we also derived a broadband optical transmission spectrum that shows a minimum around 700 nm and increasing values towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This is in agreement with the results of the study by S16, which was based on a large fraction of the archival transit light curves included in our analysis. The unusual profile of this transmission spectrum is poorly matched by theoretical spectra and is not confirmed by more recent observations at higher spectral resolution reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lendl et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Future observations with existing (HST, Spitzer ) or planned (JWST) facilities, both in emission and transmission, should be able to provide better constraints on the P − T profile and chemical composition of WASP-103 b's atmosphere. In particular, we encourage further observations in the K S -band to confirm our high emission measurement in that band. Improving our understanding of this planetary system also requires a more precise characterization of the faint nearby star, by obtaining additional adaptive-optics observations with a large-aperture telescope. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure A1</ref>.
