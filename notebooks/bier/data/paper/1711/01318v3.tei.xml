				<p>The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for detecting exoplanets. It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced by the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star. As astronomical instrumentation has improved , radial velocity surveys have become sensitive to low-mass planets that cause their host star to move with radial velocities of 1 m/s or less. While analysis of a time series of stellar spectra can in theory reveal such small radial velocities, in practice intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots, convective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial velocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably detect low mass planets and planets orbiting magnetically active stars. A principled approach to recovering planet radial velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et al. (2015) and involves the use of a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture time series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar activity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension reduction techniques to construct more informative stellar activity indicators that make use of a larger portion of the stellar spectrum; (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger class of models and use a model comparison procedure to select the best model *</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Stellar activity modeling framework.</head><p>4.1. General class of stellar activity models. The R15 Gaussian process based model in (2.1)-(2.4) is designed for the specific stellar activity indicators log R HK (or normalized flux) and BIS. We now extend their model to a class of models that can capture a greater variety of behaviors of stellar activity indicators. We begin with a brief review of Gaussian processes.</p><p>A real-valued continuous time stochastic process {X(t)} is a Gaussian process (GP) if for every finite set of times t 1 , . . . , t n the vector (X(t 1 ), . . . , X(t n )) has a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Spatial processes and other kinds of processes can also be Gaussian processes, but here all Gaussian processes that we refer to will be temporal. A Gaussian process is specified via a mean function and a covariance function which determine what the mean vector and covariance matrix should be for the vector (X(t 1 ), . . . , X(t n )) given any set of times t 1 , . . . , t n . Here we make the usual assumptions that for any t the mean of X(t) is zero and the process is stationary in time so that the covariance between two observations of the process X(t) and X(t ) only depends on the value of |t − t |. Specifically, we adopt the quasi-periodic covariance function</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K(t, t ) = exp − sin 2 (π(t − t )/τ s ) 2λ 2 p − (t − t ) 2 2λ 2 e , (4.1)</formula><p>where τ s is the stellar period and λ p and λ e are parameters governing the relative importance of periodic and local correlations and the time-scale of local correlations, respectively. The fact that this covariance function leads to a positive definite covariance matrix follows from the fact that the product of two valid covariance functions yields a valid covariance function, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rasmussen and Williams (2006)</ref> page 95. In the current case the two underlying covariance functions are the standard periodic and squared exponential covariance functions, which correspond to the first and second terms of the exponent in (4.1), respectively. The covariance function (4.1) was also adopted by R15. A quasi-periodic covariance function makes sense in the current context because for a fixed spot the stellar activity signal should be similar for each rotation of the star but will change over longer intervals due to evolution of the spot or other phenomena not explicitly modeled. We denote the parameters of the covariance function by φ = (τ s , λ p , λ e ).</p><p>The R15 model given by (2.1)-(2.4) also makes use of the derivative of X(t). The derivative of a Gaussian process with covariance function K(t, t ) (if it exists as is the case for (4.1)) is also a Gaussian process and has covariance function</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂ 2 ∂t∂t K(t, t ).</formula><p>Furthermore, ∂K(t, t )/∂t gives the covariance between X(t) and ˙ X(t ). The covariance function for higher order derivatives of X(t) can be obtained in an analogous way. These results follow from Theorem 2.2.2 in Adler (2010).</p><p>R15 mention in their discussion section that the second derivative of X(t) could be useful for modeling the BIS time series, and also that it could be helpful to include an independent "GP component to model correlated instrumental noise." The purpose behind the latter ingredient is to capture deviations from the model in (2.1)-(2.4) which makes the strong assumption that only a single function X(t) and its derivative are needed to model both stellar activity and instrumental effects on all three time series. We investigated fitting a number of stellar activity indicators (constructed as described in Section 5) and concluded that the above two extensions offer substantially improved flexibility regarding the indicators that can be modeled. The scientific motivation that R15 give for including GP derivatives to capture the relationships between the apparent RV, log R HK , and BIS does not necessarily directly carry over to other stellar activity indicators. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that indicators capturing similar information to log R HK and BIS would have qualitatively similar relationships to each other and the apparent RV, and we have found this to be the case in practice.</p><p>Other model improvement ideas such as changing the covariance function for X(t) are likely to be important for fine tuning to specific indicators but were found to be less essential for expanding the range of indicators that can be modeled adequately.</p><p>We propose the following general class of models for jointly capturing the apparent RV signal due to stellar activity and l stellar activity indicators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u(t) = m 0 + a 01 X(t) + a 02 ˙ X(t) + a 03¨X03¨ 03¨X(t) + a 04 Z 0 (t) + 0i (4.2) q 1 (t) = m 1 + a 11 X(t) + a 12 ˙ X(t) + a 13¨X13¨ 13¨X(t) + a 14 Z 1 (t) + 1i (4.3)</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q l (t) = m l + a l1 X(t) + a l2 ˙ X(t) + a l3¨Xl3¨ l3¨X(t) + a l4 Z 3 (t) + li , (4.4)</formula><p>for i = 1, . . . , n, where the ji are independent with</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ji ∼ N (0, σ ji ). (4.5)</formula><p>Here the σ ji 's are known measurement uncertainties, q 1 . . . , q l are arbitrary stellar activity indicators, and Z 0 , . . . , Z l are independent zero mean GPs with the covariance function (4.1). The parameters for the covariance functions of Z 0 , . . . , Z l are assumed to be the same and are denoted φ Z (they are allowed to be different to φ, the covariance parameters for X). It is standard practice in astronomy to provide observation uncertainties, i.e., in practice, the σ ji 's would be derived from the spectra based on measurement uncertainties for each pixel as provided by a standard astronomical image reduction pipeline. We denote by Σ the (l + 1)n × (l + 1)n covariance matrix implied by the model (4.2)-(4.5), and specify its form in Appendix B.</p><p>The inclusion of the second derivative of X(t) in our class of models explicitly permits a third signal shape that is not just a linear combination of X(t) and ˙ X(t). The independent GP components Z 0 , . . . , Z l permit deviations from the signals allowed by the model assuming each output is a linear combination of X(t), ˙ X(t), and¨Xand¨ and¨X(t). In any specific case, not all the coefficients a jk , for j = 0, . . . , l, and k = 1, . . . , 4, in (4.4) will be non-zero. Indeed, such a model would likely be too flexible and absorb any RV signal from a planet that is mixed in with u. The goal of the model selection procedure introduced in Section 4.2 is to decide which coefficients should be non-zero.</p><p>For conciseness we write the observation times as t = (t 1 , . . . , t n ) T and the time series data as s = (u, q 1 , . . . , q l ), where u = (u(t 1 ), . . . , u(t n )) T and q j = (q j (t 1 ), . . . , q j (t n )) T , for j = 1, . . . , l. Denoting the parameters for the model (4.2)-(4.4) by θ act = (m 0 , . . . , m l , a 01 , . . . , a 04 , . . . , a l1 , . . . , a l4 , φ, φ Z ), the log-likelihood is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">l act (θ act |t, s) = − (l + 1)n 2 log(2π) − 1 2 |Σ| − 1 2 (s − m) T Σ −1 (s − m), (4.6)</formula><p>where m = (m 0 1 T n , m 1 1 T n , . . . , m l 1 T n ) and 1 n denotes a column vector of n ones.</p><p>Our model capturing both a planet and stellar activity is simply (4.2)-(4.4) except that u(t) in (4.2) is replaced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">u p (t) = u(t) + v(t) − γ, (4.7)</formula><p>where v(t) is given by the planet RV signal model in (3.1) and the offset γ is subtracted out because m 0 (in (4.2)) already provides an offset. We refer to this model incorporating a planet as the full model and denote the corresponding log-likelihood by l full . We write the parameters of the full model as θ full = (θ act , α), where α = (K, M 0 , τ p , ω, e) are the parameters describing the planet and its orbit.</p><p>The model (4.2)-(4.5) and the R15 model (2.1)-(2.4) are adaptations of the linear model of co-regionalization (LMC), see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Journel and Huijbregts (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Osborne et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alvarez and Lawrence (2011)</ref>. The LMC approach captures dependence between multiple outputs by modeling each output as a linear combination of independent GPs with at least some of the GPs appearing in more than one of the linear combinations. Our model and that of R15 allow more structured dependences between outputs than LMC by the inclusion of GP derivatives. Our approach also differs from both that of LMC and R15 in that our model selection procedure (see Section 4.2 below) allows us to learn the relationships between the outputs instead of fixing them by fitting a pre-specified model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.</head><p>Two stage model selection procedure. Model selection criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are often used to choose between models. In the current context these criteria can be applied to identify models in the class (4.2)-(4.5) that capture the RV corruption and stellar activity indicators at hand. However, there is a trade-off between selecting a model that captures the stellar activity well and making sure that the chosen model is not so flexible that it absorbs true planetary signals. Therefore the best model for exoplanet detection purposes cannot be determined from AIC, BIC, and similar criteria alone (even if we ignore the usual limitations of these criteria). Instead we now propose a two stage model selection procedure that focuses on our ultimate goal of planet detection.</p><p>Given a stellar activity model, we would like to quantify the evidence for a planet by computing the Bayes factor for the model with only stellar activity relative to the full model with both stellar activity and a planet (or multiple planets). In practice, computing the marginalized likelihood is computationally expensive. For the purposes of this paper, we will instead test for a planet by performing a likelihood ratio test (LRT) where the null model is the stellar activity model and the alternative model is the corresponding full model. Thus, for our purposes, the best stellar activity model in the class (4.2)-(4.5) is that which yields the highest power for detecting planets under the LRT. Since there are many possible models in the class (4.2)-(4.5), and many choices for the planet parameter vector α, it is not possible to determine the detection power for all possibilities through simulation. Furthermore, the typical number of spectral observations available for each star (on the order of dozens to a few hundred) is insufficient to apply asymptotic arguments to determine detection power. Instead, we propose a two stage model selection procedure where the first stage eliminates many of the models in the class (4.2)-(4.5) through an assessment of their adequacy for capturing the stellar activity indicators at hand, and the second stage chooses between the remaining models using a simulation study that evaluates the planet detection power they offer. The planet configurations we use in the stage two simulation study correspond to typical realistic systems that yield RV signals close to or below the current detection threshold of ∼ 1 m/s. If no activity model dominates the others in terms of detection power for the simulated planet configurations, we will choose the model that produces the highest detection power for the planets of most interest or the planets that are deemed most probable to accompany the star in question based on additional scientific considerations.</p><p>The performance of a two stage procedure of the form above can in general be improved by lowering the threshold for allowing a model to pass the first stage and expanding the range of simulations used to assess power in the second stage. However, these improvements will come at a computational cost which must be taken into consideration. We postpone theoretical investigations along these lines to future work and here focus on illustrating the method in the exoplanet detection context.</p><p>In principle our procedure can be applied with any number of activity indicators, but for concreteness we fix l = 2. We can immediately exclude models in which a j1 = a j2 = a j3 = a j4 = 0 for any j ∈ {0, 1, 2} because a non-trivial model is required for each time series. We also decide to fix a 04 = 0 because including an independent GP for modeling the apparent RV signal will intuitively lead to a stellar activity model that can also capture RV signals from planets. Such a model would have low power because the benefit of using the full model in the presence of a planet would be small. This leaves (2 3 −1)(2 4 −1) 2 = 1575 possible models which we choose between in stage one of our procedure using AIC, BIC, and cross validation (CV). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stone (1977)</ref> showed that AIC is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out CV, but here it is helpful to use both AIC and CV because asymptotic arguments do not apply, and because we found that it is better to leave out multiple observations for CV. The specifics of our CV procedure are given in Appendix C. For the sake of illustration we specify that the best five models under each criterion will be evaluated at stage two of our procedure.</p><p>Given the models selected in stage one of our procedure, we move to stage two where the planet detection power of the models is evaluated. The test statistic ∆ for our LRT is simply the difference in maximized log likelihood for the current stellar activity model and the corresponding full model, which includes the planet model (3.1). That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆ = l act ( ˆ θ act ) − l full ( ˆ θ full ) (4.8) wherê</formula><p>θ act andˆθandˆ andˆθ full are maximum likelihood estimates for θ act and θ full , respectively. Optimization details are given in Appendix D. To construct the null distribution of ∆ we use SOAP 2.0 to simulate 1000 datasets of the form {u(t i ), q 1 (t i ), q 2 (t i )} i=1,...,n and compute ∆ for each dataset.</p><p>Next, we simulate datasets with injected planet signals. In practice, the specific simulations that should be performed will depend on the instrument in question, our understanding of what signals can realistically be detected, and the type of planets we are hunting. Often it will be of particular interest to determine the minimum amplitude of a planet RV signal needed to reach a detection power of 0.5, which we call the detection threshold. In this paper, we will choose between the candidate stellar activity at stage two of our model selection procedure by computing the detection threshold for planets with an orbital period of 7 days. This period is favorable in the sense that it does not coincide with the stellar rotational period in our SOAP 2.0 simulations (10 days) or its harmonics. To generate datasets with planets, we first generate (new) datasets of the form {u(t i ), q 1 (t i ), q 2 (t i )} i=1,...,n and then add the planet signal v(t i ; α) (given by (3.1)) to u(t i ), for i = 1, . . . , n. The parameter vectors of the injected signals are given by α = (K, M 0 = 1.5, τ p = 7, ω = 1, e = 0.2, γ = 0) for amplitudes K = 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, . . . , 1.45, 1.5, 2 m/s, and 50 simulations are generated under each setting. In practice, the parameters M 0 , ω, e, and γ have less impact on the planet signal than K and τ p and the fixed values used here are reasonably typical. (Note that all the planet parameters are fitted in our procedure.) Finally, for each dataset, we compute ∆ for the current stellar activity model being considered and reject the null of no planet if ∆ is greater than the 0.99 quantile of the relevant null distribution, i.e., that constructed using the current stellar activity model. The number of rejections across the 50 simulations at a given value of K provides an estimate of the detection power at that planet signal amplitude. The approximate detection threshold is then determined by finding the K value for which the detection power is approximately 0.5. The final model we select is the one with the smallest detection threshold.</p><p>5. Constructing new stellar activity indicators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Motivation for Doppler-constrained dimension reduction approaches.</head><p>Traditional activity indicators such as log R HK and BIS are unlikely to be the most suitable stellar activity indicators for predicting the RV perturbation induced by stellar activity. It is desirable to have a data-driven method for identifying stellar activity indicators that are informative for our goals of detecting and characterizing exoplanets. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Davis et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a principled way of constructing stellar activity indicators and determining the proportion of the available information captured. They use principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose stellar spectra into orthogonal vectors along which variation in the spectra is observed across time. In particular, their principal component (PC) vectors are the eigenvectors of the matrix Y T Y , where Y is the same as the n × p SOAP 2.0 data matrix introduced in Section 3.2, except that they use n = 25. (They also use a slightly different process for reducing the SOAP 2.0 high resolution spectra to a realistic resolution.) For SOAP 2.0 data simulated with a single spot and no planet, one to four principal components are typically sufficient to explain nearly all of the spectral variation observed across different stellar rotation phases, even at spectral resolution and SNR significantly greater than current and next-generation spectrographs. For current planet surveys, only one or two principal component scores can be measured with significant SNR. PCA has also been used for tackling related challenges in astronomy, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">González et al. (2008)</ref> use PCA to denoise spectra.</p><p>It is not immediately apparent how the PCA based stellar activity indicators proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Davis et al. (2017)</ref> can be used in practice because each PC score may be composed of components from both stellar activity and the true Doppler shift. Ideally, some PC scores would be affected only by stellar activity, allowing them to be used to infer the impact of the activity on the apparent RV. Similarly, we do not know how much a true Doppler shift would project onto each of the PC vectors developed to reconstruct spectra of a star with spots. Indeed, with traditional PCA we may need more than one principal component, or even all the principal components, in order to capture an RV signal. To address this difficulty we now propose an adaptation of PCA in order to represent the apparent RV signal due to stellar activity as a single component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.</head><p>Doppler-constrained PCA method. The idea is to specify a p × 1 component w that corresponds to the apparent RV, then to compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Y = Y − Y ww T i |w i | 2 ,<label>(5.1)</label></formula><p>and finally to apply PCA to Y . To proceed with this approach we first identify w. Let the star light intensity at wavelength λ be denoted by f (λ), so that the function f (·) gives the stellar spectrum (at some fixed time t). For a source moving with a radial velocity of v = cz the Doppler shift is z, where c is the speed of light, i.e., the observed intensity at wavelength λ is given by f ((1+z)λ). Thus, a Taylor expansion tells us that the new spectrum at wavelength λ will approximately be given by f (λ) + zf (λ), where f = df /d log λ. Since the relevant Doppler shifts are typically very small (z ≈ 10 −8 ) this approximation is very accurate and we can therefore represent Doppler shifts as scalar multiples of the vector w = (f (λ 1 ), . . . , f (λ p )) T , where λ i , for i = 1, . . . , p, are the recorded wavelengths. In the case, of actual astronomical observations (as opposed to SOAP 2.0 simulations), it is necessary to make various corrections to the Doppler shift before using the Taylor expansion, see Appendix E.</p><p>Another complication is that the stellar spectrum changes due to the presence and location of stellar activity. Therefore, the function f (·) varies with stellar rotation phase. Fortunately, these differences can be regarded as second-order, so it is reasonable to treat w as fixed across time. Here, we compute the mean spectrum across the different phases observed, denoted ¯ f (·), and use ¯ f (·) in place of f (·) for all phases. Once w is computed, the vector of apparent radial velocity observations (u(t 1 ), . . . , u(t n )) is obtained by cY w/ i |w i | 2 , where the scaling c is the speed of light in m/s. Then we apply PCA tõ Y and use q PCj (t i ), for j = 1, 2, . . . , min{n, p} − 1, to denote the values of our resultng stellar activity indicators at time t i , for i = 1, . . . , n.</p><p>The main benefit of our approach is that the apparent Doppler component w and the stellar activity indicators are orthogonal. Thus, any planet RV signal will only appear in the w component scores, and we can use the orthogonal indicators to attempt to recover and remove any apparent RV signal due to the spot. In particular, we can use the class of models introduced in Section 4.1. Intuitively, we expect our indicators to be highly informative because PCA guarantees that the proportion of the variance explained by PC1 is maximized (after the removal of the w component from the data, see 5.1), then of the remaining variance the proportion explained by PC2 is maximized, and so on. Of course, high variance explained does not neces- The apparent RV and stellar activity indicators time series derived from the SOAP 2.0 data at two stages of our simulation process.

(2017)</ref>. Furthermore, higher order PCs may be important for distinguishing different types of stellar activity. In practice, for the case of a spot, we find that the RV corruption is related to at least the first three PC score time series for spectra with sufficiently high resolution and high SNR. However, since the PC1 scores are least sensitive to noise they are usually the most informative for recovering the RV corruption.</p><p>5.3. Generating realistic Doppler-constrained PCA activity indicator observations using SOAP 2.0. We now describe the final stellar activity simulations to be used in our model selection procedure of Section 4.2. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure</ref> 3 summarizes our simulation of realistic activity signals of the form {u(t i ), q PC1 (t i ), q PC2 (t i )} i=1,...,n from the SOAP 2.0 output Y , for the case of a star with a single spot. First, we apply our Doppler-constrained PCA approach to the noiseless spectra contained in Y to obtain ideal basis vectors. The top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the corresponding PC scores (blue dots) for 100 randomly selected phases, i.e., the ideal u, q PC1 , and q PC2 signals with a few phase gaps. Since we want our final simulations to include noise we also plot two standard deviation error bars. These are computed pointwise by applying our Doppler-constrained PCA approach to 200 noisy realizations of the spectra (at the 100 selected phases). The noise was generated for each wavelength using a Poisson distribution, which realistically reproduces random variations in the number of photons detected. Note, that although these latter spectra are noisy, the scores are still computed by projecting onto the previously obtained ideal basis vectors. SOAP 2.0 is based on real observations of the Sun so the use of the ideal basis vectors makes sense for Sun-like stars, but an alternative approach will likely be needed for stars that differ significantly from the Sun. We address this issue further in Section 7.</p><p>The bottom row of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows an example final dataset used in our analyses of Section 6. We have injected noise based on the two standard deviation error bars. The phases of the observations are the same as in the top row, but we have now randomly selected a rotation of the star from 1 to 50 for each observation to be recorded. Since the rotation period of the star is 10 days, the total observation time is 500 days, which is representative of an intensive observing program spanning two calender years.</p><p>6. Application of model selection procedure.</p><p>6.1. Preliminary model. The R15 model (2.1)-(2.4) was not designed to capture our PCA based stellar activity indicators both because our indicators differ to log R HK and BIS and because the SOAP 2.0 settings R15 used were different. However, the plot of {u(t i ), log R HK (t i ), BIS(t i )} i=1,...,m in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> of R15 qualitatively resembles the first three panels of <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref> here which show {u(t i ), q PC1 (t i ), q PC2 (t i )} i=1,...,n . We therefore plot the maximum likelihood fit of the R15 model (very slightly modified) to the data {u(t i ), q PC1 (t i ), q PC2 (t i )} i=1,...,n in the left half of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The only difference with the model given by (2.1)-(2.4) and that fitted is that the standard deviations σ 2 j are replaced by the known observation specific standard deviations σ 2 ji , for j = 0, 1, 2, and i = 1, . . . , n. We will refer to this model as the preliminary model since it is our best initial guess of a suitable model for our indicators based on the existing literature.</p><p>The red lines in the top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> show inferred values of the functions h 1 (t) = m 0 +a 01 X(t)+a 02 ˙ X(t), h 2 (t) = m 1 +a 11 X(t), and h 3 (t) = m 2 + a 21 X(t) + a 22 ˙ X(t), i.e., ˆ Preliminary model fit to {u(t i ), q PC1 (t i ), q PC2 (t i )} i=1,...,n (top row) and AIC-1 model fit (middle row).

A bright green region representing a 95% confidence interval for the functions h j (t), for j = 0, 1, 2, is plotted but is mostly covered by the red line due to very small uncertainties. The reason for the small uncertainties is that X(t) (and hence ˙ X(t)) can be precisely inferred by combining information across the three time series.</p><p>Despite the high precision, the preliminary model fit is unsatisfactory because in the case of q PC2 the inferred function h 1 shows systematic deviations from the observations. This can be seen from the bottom row of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, which shows the residuals for the preliminary model fit. In particular, the middle panel of the bottom row gives the q PC2 residuals and we can see that for phases near 0 and 1 the residuals tend to be positive, and for phases near 0.3 and 0.7 they tend to be negative. Finally the fit overshoots the signal peak and so again many of the residuals are positive near phase 0.5. In further investigations we found that introducing large gaps between the observations produced implausible predictions for the intervening times due to the highly constrained negative correlations imposed by the use of both X(t) and its derivative. R15 identified similar difficulties and attempted to alleviate them by imposing upper bounds on their noise parameters (the σ k 's in (2.4)) and thereby weighting the influence of the RV time series more heavily when optimizing the GP parameters. Their logic was that only the RV time series ultimately needs to be captured. However, the success of this approach in the absence of a planet only suggests that by fitting the stellar activity induced RV corruption with a GP and its derivative, some stellar activity indicators are also approximately recovered. In practice, we are of course interested in the reverse problem: by fitting a model to stellar activity indicators, we want to recover the RV corruption. In the case of a star with a planet, by inflating the influence of the RV time series in fitting the stellar activity model, one risks absorbing some of the planet signal that could have been extracted by more careful modeling of the stellar activity indicators and their relationship to RV corruption. Therefore, we do not alter the σ k 's to affect the balance of residuals among the RV and stellar activity indicator time series.</p><p>6.2. Initial stellar activity model selection. To improve upon the preliminary model we apply the two stage model selection procedure introduced in Section 4.2 to identify the best model among the class (4.2)-(4.5). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref> gives a partial summary of the results of stage one of our selection procedure, which identifies the top models for capturing stellar activity based on AIC, BIC, and CV. The second and third columns list the number of parameters in the model and the deviance, and columns four through six list the ranking of the models by the three criteria. Columns seven through nine give the relative criteria values for each model, e.g., ∆AIC is the AIC value for the model in question after the minimum AIC value found across all the models has been subtracted. Smaller values are preferable for all quantities listed in the table. The top five ranked models are the same under the AIC and BIC criteria so we have only listed them once as AIC models.</p><p>The top five ranked models under AIC (and BIC) are also found to be good models under the CV criterion, with the exception of AIC-1. Similarly the top five CV models have good AIC and BIC ranks, though the performance of CV-4 and CV-5 is somewhat worse than the performance of the top three CV models in terms of ∆AIC and ∆BIC. The preliminary model performs poorly under all three of the criteria in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, as might  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Maximum likelihood estimates of the AIC-1 stellar activity model coefficients.

For comparison, the fit of the AIC-1 model to the same data is shown in the middle row of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Close inspection reveals that the AIC-1 fit for q PC1 does not have the systematic deviations from the data that we observed for the preliminary model fit. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> gives the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the model coefficients for AIC-1. The MLEs of the kernel parameters are logˆτlogˆ logˆτ s = 2.30, logˆλlogˆ logˆλ p = −0.92, and logˆλlogˆ logˆλ e = 9.98. The interpretation of these values is that the stellar period τ s is approximately 10 days and that given the relatively small value of λ p and large value of λ e , periodic correlations are strong and local correlations are weak. Thus, the kernel parameter values are indeed consistent with a star with a single spot producing stellar activity signals that are periodic over a 10 day period (the star rotation period). The AIC-1 model turns out to be contained in all nine of the models listed below it in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, i.e., the coefficients a 01 , a 02 , a 11 , a 13 , and a 22 , are again non-zero in these nine models. This can be seen from the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, which shows the relative frequencies of the model coefficients across the five AIC and five CV models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Further checks revealed that in fact the top 49 AIC ranked models and the top 44 CV ranked models contain the AIC-1 model.</p><p>Given the above discussion, it might be surprising that the AIC-1 model has a poor CV score. The reason for the poor score is that the model only has 11 parameters and is too restrictive in the sense that it tends to underrepresent prediction uncertainty, particularly for q PC1 . Since our CV score is the conditional log-likelihood of the test data, the AIC-1 model is strongly penalized for this unreliable prediction uncertainty quantification. Nonetheless, in Section 6.3 we find that the strong constraints imposed by the AIC-1 model are helpful (or at least not harmful) for the purpose of planet detection because in most cases the model cannot mistakenly fit a planet signal. For more complex forms of stellar activity that behave less periodically such a constrained model may be less useful for planet detection.</p><p>The models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> do not make use of the independent GP components Z 1 and Z 2 , with the exception of CV-4 and CV-5 which are found to perform relatively poorly in Section 6.3 below. However, in Section 6.4 (below), we find that the flexibility offered by Z 1 and Z 2 does help to improve planet detection power in the case of modeling the stellar activity indicators used by R15. This is because the R15 indicators do not closely follow the structure imposed by using linear combinations of X(t) and its derivatives. In our ongoing investigations we have also found the extra GP components useful in the case where we use diffusion maps instead of PCA to construct Dopplerconstrained activity indicators. Further discussion of diffusion map based indicators can be found in Section 7.</p><p>6.3. Optimal models for planet detection. Next, we proceed to stage two of our model selection procedure, as described in Section 4.2. In order to choose between the stellar activity models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we assesses the planet detection power under the different candidate models. As explained in Section 4.2, the detection powers are computed for a planet with an orbital period of τ p = 7 days, which avoids aliasing with the stellar rotation period of 10 days. That is, τ p is distinct from the stellar rotation period and its harmonics and we therefore do not need to deal with the problem of separating two periodic signals that could be realistically modeled by one periodic signal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the power for detecting planets under each model at a range of planet signal amplitudes and τ p = 7 days. In the plot, we see that the top five AIC models (circles of different shades of blue) have a detection threshold of approximately 0.2 m/s (i.e., this is the amplitude at which 0.5 detection power is achieved), and have detection power close to 1 for planet signal amplitudes equal to or greater than 0.4 m/s. Turning to the top five CV models (triangles of different shades of red), the performance of CV-1 </p></div>

The problem with the CV-3, CV-4, and CV-5 stellar activity models is that they are too flexible and therefore sometimes absorb part of the planet signal making it harder to detect. In the case of CV-4 and CV-5 the source of the extra flexibility is mainly due to the inclusion of the independent GP Z 1 , and in the case of CV-3 it is due to the coefficients a 12 and a 21 being non-zero (the latter is also non-zero in the preliminary model).</p><p>The preliminary model (dark green diamonds) is seen to have substantially worse performance than all ten of the AIC and CV models presented. Indeed, the detection threshold for the preliminary model is about 0.55 m/s. This demonstrates the advantage of selecting a model appropriate for the stellar activity indicators at hand, and that it is possible to do this selection automatically even in the case of indicators such as ours which have no immediate physical interpretation. The white noise model (grey squares) considers only the RV signal and treats any RV corruption from stellar activity as independent Gaussian realizations with a fixed standard deviation (plus measurement error). This approach can be valuable for analyzing legacy RV datasets that typically have sparsely spaced observations and no stellar activity information (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ford, 2006</ref>). However, each of the models that makes use of stellar activity indicators is significantly more powerful for detecting low-mass planets, including the preliminary model.</p><p>The relatively poor performance of CV-3, CV-4, and CV-5 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig- ure 5</ref> demonstrates the importance of including the second stage of our model selection procedure. Indeed, these models are ranked among the best for capturing the stellar activity signals according to CV, and also have reasonably good AIC and BIC ranks (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). It is only stage two of our model selection procedure that allows us to identify the top five AIC models, CV-1, and CV-2 as better models for planet detection (at least under the scenario captured by our simulations). The fact that AIC-1, BIC-1, and CV-1 are all good models for planet detection is something of a coincidence, and in general we do not recommend relying on the AIC, BIC, and CV selection criteria alone; we only suggest using them to short-list candidate models.</p><p>In addition to detecting planets it is of interest to infer their properties, and in Appendix F we summarize our orbital period (τ p ) and signal amplitude (K) estimation results for the AIC-1 model. Another important consideration is how planet detection power varies as a function of period, and we discuss this in Appendix G, again for the AIC-1 model. Our main finding is that detection power is lower for planets with orbital periods that coincide with the stellar rotation period or its harmonics. <ref type="bibr">Rajpaul et al. (2015a)</ref>. The poor performance of the preliminary model seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> is not particularly surprising because the model was originally designed by R15 to capture the evolution of the apparent RV, normalized flux (or log R HK ), and BIS, rather than the evolution of our stellar activity indicators. Therefore, we repeat our detection power analysis for the R15 model, but using the R15 activity indicators in order to compare their utility for planet detection to that of our PCA based activity indicators. Both normalized flux and BIS are provided in SOAP 2.0 output. To mimic exoplanet RV observations, we must add noise at scales representative of RV data. For normalized flux, we compute the noise levels directly using the Poisson uncertainties for the wavelength level flux measurements. For BIS, we assume a constant standard deviation of 0.038 m/s, where the specific value is motivated by scaling actual BIS error measurements in <ref type="bibr">Du- musque et al. (2012)</ref> to account for the increased spectral resolution and SNR of our input data.</p></div>

We note that again there is a slight difference between the original R15 model and the model we fit because we have used the observation specific standard deviations, rather than estimating a single standard deviation for each times series (under an informative prior), see equation (2.4). For comparison, the detection power under the AIC-1  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> are plotted again: the detection power using our PCA based indicators under the AIC-1 model (blue circles) and preliminary (or R15) model (dark green diamonds).

The indicators are standardized (centered and normalized) for the purpose of the comparison.</p><p>(blue circles) and preliminary (dark green diamonds) models applied with our PCA based indicators are also shown (these lines are the same as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). The R15 model has a detection threshold of about 0.45 m/s and therefore performs better than the preliminary model, but still substantially worse than the AIC-1 model. It is not clear if the superiority of the AIC-1 model results are due to the use of our PCA based indicators or our model selection procedure or both. To investigate this we also applied our model selection procedure in the case of the normalized flux and BIS indicators. We again found the five best AIC, BIC, and CV ranked models, though we only plot a selection in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. We write, for example, "R-AIC-3" to mean the model ranked third by AIC in the case of the normalized flux and BIS indicators used by R15. The R-CV-3 model (dark red "x" symbols) is the top performing model, though several other models have very similar performance. The model performs substantially better than the R15 model and indeed comparably to the AIC-1 model for our stellar activity indicators (blue circles). The R-CV-3 model and the maximum likelihood estimates of its coefficients are given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Interestingly, the model uses the extra GP components Z 1 and Z 2 . <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> Maximum likelihood estimates of the R-CV-3 stellar activity model coefficients. Blank entries mean the coefficients are set to zero. All the outputs were normalized, but for interpretability the u(t) coefficient estimates in m/s are given in parentheses. Investigation showed that Z 1 and Z 2 are needed in order to capture the R15 indicators, which do not have the same level of symmetry as our PCA based indicators (in particular, the BIS minima are not as low as the maxima are high, see the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). The left of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> also shows the detection power for the R-AIC-3 model (pink "+" symbols), which is the best performing R-AIC model identified. This model performs poorly compared with the R-CV-3 model, but still considerably better than the R15 model. The R-AIC-3 model again makes use of the extra GP component Z 2 . The models that only use X(t) and its first two derivatives fit poorly to stellar activity data, including the R15 model (see their <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Our conclusion is that for this simple case of a single constant spot it is our model selection procedure rather than our PCA based stellar activity indicators that offers improved detection power. Therefore, for the time being, astronomers may prefer to keep using normalized flux (or log R HK ) and BIS as stellar activity indicators, but the model should be updated to the R-CV-3 model or a similar model. In particular, although the R15 model has the appealing feature of being physically motivated, it seems that planet detection power can be improved by using a more flexible model that can better capture the stellar activity time series jointly, at least in case of a constant spot. For cases where the stellar spectra are available to the investigators, it may be preferable to use our PCA based indicators for computational and robustness reasons, because the AIC-1 model (for our indicators) requires six fewer parameters than the R-CV-3 model (for the R15 indicators). Alternatively, investigators may wish to transform the BIS indicator so that the blueshifts (troughs) and redshifts (peaks) are more symmetric because this will likely make it possible to use a simpler GP model. For example, such a transformation could be based on transforming the BIS indicator to look more like our q PC2 indicator. The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> compares −q PC2 and BIS for noiseless SOAP 2.0 data (for a star with a single constant spot), and suggests that scaling blueshifts and redshifts differently (after centering) could be a good choice of transformation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">X coeff (aj1) ˙ X coeff (aj2) ¨ X coeff (aj3) Zj coeff (aj4) u(t) (m/s) 0</formula><p>With a longer term perspective, we emphasize that our indicators were constructed automatically without the need for physical derivations. This is important because it means that our approach can likely be easily generalized to more complex stellar activity phenomena, such as evolving spots, where different or additional indicators may be needed. The PCA approach ensures that when additional indicators are used they contain different information to those already included, whereas there is no such guarantee for expert-identified indicators chosen for their individual interpretations. Similarly, our indicator construction method could also allow custom indicators to be used for each star or type of star.</p><p>7. Discussion. We have considered the problem of using high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy to detect low-mass planets with RV amplitudes significantly less than the apparent RV induced by intrinsic stellar variability. We propose a constrained dimension reduction procedure to construct highinformation stellar activity indicators. We then model the temporal evolution of the RV and stellar activity indicators with a multivariate GP model. Specifically, we consider a family of GP models and use a model selection procedure to identify a model that can jointly capture the activity indicators and RV corruption due to a stellar spot. By incorporating planet detection power into our model selection procedure, we ensure that the models selected are effective for detecting low-mass planets. We have demonstrated that our model selection procedure leads to a substantial improvement in planet detection power compared to that obtained using the state-of-theart approach of R15. Furthermore, we have found that our automatically derived stellar activity indicators are at least comparable to the physically motivated indicators used by R15, and suspect they may offer detection power improvements for more complex stellar activity.</p><p>Our general procedures can be applied more broadly than to the specific stellar activity indicators used in this initial study. Firstly, our approach for constructing Doppler-constrained stellar activity indicators can make use of any dimension reduction technique. Our Doppler-constrained PCA method is simply one example. We are currently exploring the use of diffusion maps as an alternative to PCA because diffusion maps do not have the constraint of projecting onto a linear subspace as does PCA. Thus, diffusion maps might capture non-linear information that PCA cannot preserve. This non-linear information could particularly be helpful for complex situations such as when the stellar spot evolves over time. Our initial investigations also suggest that capturing non-linear structure helps to improve planet detection power when there is aliasing between the stellar rotation period and the planet orbital period, see the discussion of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> in Appendix G.</p><p>Secondly, by using a model selection procedure we avoid having to rely on a single model and therefore can model a variety of stellar variability indicators. Since our procedure assesses the planet detection power this can be used to compare the relative performance of various stellar variability indicators, as well as different models. Lastly, although we have assumed a single spot of constant size, our investigations suggest that our class of models is able to capture evolving spots. More generally, the extent to which it is reasonable to use the specific class of models (4.2)-(4.5) for modeling complex stellar activity is a topic of our ongoing work. If a more general class of models is ultimately found to be needed in the case of multiple evolving stellar variability phenomena, one option is to use the Gaussian process regression networks framework introduced by Wilson, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ghahramani and Knowles (2012)</ref>. In our context this would involve using GPs to model temporal changes in the coefficients of our model (4.2)-(4.5), which would permit the relationships between outputs to evolve over time.</p><p>Despite the promise of our approach, there are a number of limitations in the astrophysical scope of our work that we intend to address in future research. Firstly, the SOAP 2.0 spectra that we use to construct our PCA basis vectors do not include noise, whereas real spectra do. We have incorporated noise for each individual simulated dataset, but the basis vectors that we project onto remain the same across datasets. This makes sense for stars like the Sun because the SOAP 2.0 output used to create the basis vectors is based on real observations of the Sun, and these are of far higher precision than we could hope for in the case of any other star. However, for stars unlike the Sun, the basis vectors will instead need to be inferred from the data at hand rather than using SOAP 2.0. Consequently, there will be additional noise in the time series observations which might reduce the usefulness of higher order PCs and ultimately our ability to detect planets. Preliminary investigation suggests that this will not be a fundamental limitation.</p><p>A second area for expanding the scope of our work is to generalize our two stage model selection procedure to stars that differ significantly from the Sun. Our power calculations rely on simulated datasets from a star with the same spot configuration as the observed dataset, but in practice the precise properties of the star and spot are unknown. In future work we hope to address both of the above issues by marginalizing over a wide range of astrophysically plausible spot geometries. By incorporating our existing model into a hierarchical Bayesian model, one could jointly model stellar activity from multiple stars with similar spectroscopic properties. This would allow us to infer a population level stellar activity model that can be used for constructing basis vectors and generating replicate datasets.</p><p>Acknowledgements.

As mentioned in Section 4.2, we found that the models favored by leave-one-out cross validation tend to be overly complex and have low power for planet detection. This is unsurprising because leave-one-out prediction is substantially easier than identifying the component of a corrupted RV signal that is due to stellar activity. Indeed, the latter case is more similar to predicting all the apparent RV observations. Therefore, to somewhat better approximate the problem at hand, we instead leave out blocks of observations.</p><p>In a single repetition of our CV procedure we randomly select a test block of b = 5 consecutive observation times to hold back. Then we find the maximum likelihood parameter estimatesˆθestimatesˆ estimatesˆθ T based on the observations at the remaining n − b times, which we refer to as the training data.

It makes sense to use the log conditional likelihood rather that the log likelihood because our Gaussian process model is non-parametric, which means the unconditional likelihood of the test block observations is not very informative about the predictive power of the model. We repeat the above cross validation procedure r = 10 times for each model. The final cross validation score for a given model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">CV = 1 r r k=1 CV k (C.2)</formula><p>where CV k denotes the value of (C.1) for the kth repetition of the procedure, for k = 1, . . . , r. To ensure a fairer comparison of the models, we re-use the same 10 test blocks for all models.</p><p>D. Details of optimization procedure. Optimization of the parameters of the models in the class (4.2)-(4.4) and additional planet signal parameters was mostly straightforward, but there were three aspects of our approach that were specific to the context, and we detail them here. Firstly, the parameters were divided into four blocks: (i) the model coefficients a jk , for j = 0, 1, 2, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, (ii) the covariance function parameters φ for X, (iii) the covariance function parameters φ Z for Z j , for j = 0, 1, 2, and (iv) the mean function parameters including m j , for j = 0, 1, 2 and, in the case of the full model, the planet parameter vector α. Block (i) was optimized, followed by block (ii), and so on. We iterated through the blocks until we had completed at least 10 cycles and the log-likelihood (4.6) converged.</p><p>Secondly, rather than directly optimizing the full log-likelihood, we first optimized the log-likelihood for stellar indicator q 1 (again using parameter blocks as described above), and then the log-likelihood for q 1 and q 2 , and finally the full log-likelihood. At each stage the optimized parameters were input into the next stage as initial values. This approach proved more successful than direct optimization of the full log-likelihood because the stellar activity indicators are unaffected by potential planet signals making it easier to find the global mode of their log-likelihood, and because in our case the indicators have a natural information ordering (for parameter estimation) in that the measurement errors of the q PC1 observations are smaller than those of q PC2 . We repeated the above procedure for 10 initializations of the parameters and chose the run that resulted in the highest log-likelihood.</p><p>Thirdly, although most of the optimization was done using standard functions in the R software package, period and angle parameters required more care. The period parameter τ s in the covariance function (4.1) was optimized using a fine grid search. To optimize the planet parameters we first performed a fine 2D grid search on τ p and M 0 , where for each candidate pair (τ p , M 0 ) we used regression to quickly optimize the other planet parameters. In particular, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Loredo et al. (2012)</ref>, we re-wrote (3.1) as v(t) = β 0 + β 1 (e + cos(φ(t))) + β 2 sin(φ(t)), where β 0 = γ = m 0 , β 1 = K cos(ω), and β 2 = −K sin(ω). The linear parameters β 0 , β 1 , and β 3 were then inferred by regressing the residuals for the radial velocity observations under the current stellar activity model fit against e + cos(φ(t)) and sin(φ(t)). For this step e was fixed at a typical value (in practice there is little information to infer e). After the initial grid search, the parameters values found were used to initialize a joint gradient ascent optimization of the planet parameters.</p><p>E. Doppler shift corrections for actual astronomical observations. While the Doppler shift due to a planet orbiting other stars is small, the Doppler shift due to the motion of the observing instrument is much larger. That is we must consider the Earth's motion around Sun, and the Earth's rotation, which combined give a Doppler shift of around 30 km/s (or z ≈ 10 −4 ). Therefore, when analyzing actual astronomical observations, one must first compute the Doppler shift due to the motion of the observatory relative to the Solar System barycenter and transform the wavelength scale so that each spectrum is observed in the Solar System barycenter frame. This is now a standard astronomical procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wright and Eastman, 2014)</ref>. Only then could one use the linear Taylor expansion discussion in Section 5.2 to approximate any remaining Doppler shifts (which will be very small). However, in our study we use SOAP 2.0 simulated observations which are already in a stable reference frame, so no adjustments are necessary and we directly make use of the Taylor expansion.</p><p>F. Estimation of Keplerian planet model parameters. In addition to detecting planets it is of interest to infer their properties. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> summarizes the performance of the MLEs of the velocity amplitude K and orbital period τ p under the AIC-1 stellar activity model for the simulations used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> (note, no simulations were performed for K = 0.15 m/s). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> each boxplot shows the relative errors in estimating K (left plot) or the estimates of τ p = 7 (right plot) for a given simulation value of K. For values of K greater than about 0.4 m/s, we can see that both K and τ p are reliably well inferred. Since the detection threshold for the AIC-1 is about 0.2 m/s, this means that the model can detect some planets even before it is able to reliably infer properties accurately. This is to be expected because planet detection requires less information than inferring planet properties. The relative errors in estimating K seem to indicate a small negative bias. This is due to the stellar activity model attempting to fit parts of the planet q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q signal. For large planet signals, stellar activity is not a concern and the Keplerian model in Section 3.1 can be fit under the white noise stellar activity model, thus avoiding any continuing bias potentially introduced by the GP model.</p><p>G. Detection power as a function of orbital period. In practice, we would like to be able to detect planets with a wide range of orbital properties. Based on experience analyzing RV observations, the detection sensitivity is most sensitive to RV amplitude and orbital period. Therefore, we proceed to investigate detection power under the AIC-1 model as a function of orbital period. The planet signals injected were given by α = (K, M 0 = 1.5, τ p , ω = 1, e = 0.2, γ = 0) for a two-way grid of the amplitude K and the period τ p , where the values used were K = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 m/s and τ p = 5, 6, . . . , 10 days. The other simulation and LRT details are the same as in Section 6.3. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the detection power found under each setting. The numbers in parentheses in the left column give the amplitude of the planet signal as a percentage of the amplitude of the apparent RV caused by the spot K spot , which is about 7.5 m/s for our SOAP 2.0 settings. Consistent with the findings in Section 6.3, the detection threshold seems to be between 0.1 m/s and 0.25 m/s, except for orbital periods of 5 and 10 days. For orbital periods of 5 and 10 days, the detection power is lower because these orbital <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> Detection power for a range of orbital periods (τp) and planet signal amplitudes <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> under the AIC-1 stellar activity model. τp = 5 τp = 6 τp = 7 τp = 8 τp = 9 τp = 10 K=0.1m/s ( periods are difficult to separate from the 10 day stellar rotation period (and its harmonics) that appears in the stellar activity signal. This is known as the aliasing problem in astronomy. Our ongoing investigations suggest that detection power for aliased planets can be increased above the values in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> by modifying the activity indicator construction method of Section 5.2 to use dimension reduction techniques that, unlike PCA, are able to find non-linear structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig 1: Example stellar spectrum (left) and an illustration of the scientific model for a radial velocity signal due to a planet (right).
