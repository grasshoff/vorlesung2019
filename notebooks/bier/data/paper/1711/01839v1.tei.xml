<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Several methods are used for the derivation of stellar spectroscopic parameters. These can be divided into two main groups. One based on spectral synthesis for which synthetic spectra are created and compared with the observed spectrum to find the best fit. The second group adopts a line by line analysis strategy, measuring the strength of observed spectral lines and then estimating abundances and applying Physics criteria such as the ionization and excitation balance to find the best spectroscopic stellar parameters for the observations. The description of the physics behind these methods can be found in many books <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>A brief work-flow for an EW method can be described as follows: For a high quality observed stellar spectrum, starting by measuring the strength of several spectral lines (e.g. EWs with ARES). These measurements are then converted into individual line abundances which are computed (e.g. with MOOG) using stellar atmospheric models, normally assuming Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (LTE) S.

Andreasen</head><p>Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Universidade do Porto, CAUP, Rua das Estrelas, 4150-762 Porto, Portugal, e-mail: sergio.sousa@astro.up.pt approximation. The model parameters are then adjusted until the individual line abundances show evidence of the excitation and ionization balance. This step can be automatized if a proper minimization method is adopted.</p><p>The rest of the document will focus on the technical aspects of the codes provided for this tutorial and how a student can use them to actually derive spectroscopic stellar parameters. A more specific description of the ARES+MOOG method can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The next sections will be based on the codes and test data available online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Requirements</head><p>This tutorial was implemented to be executed on a Linux machine. Note that even without an access to a Linux machine, today it is very easy to emulate one by using virtual machines (e.g. VirtualBox). All the instructions provided both in this document and in the repository are compatible for Debian/Ubuntu systems, but can be easily adapted for other Linux flavors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Main codes for the tutorial</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARES</head><p>ARES is a C code that allows a fast and automatic measurement of EWs of spectral absorption lines. The ARES code is a submodule in the school codes repository and therefore easily updated with the root ARES repository 2 which contains more information. For a more detailed description of the code please see the ARES papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Note that the latest version of ARES is already able to deal with in-situ radial velocity correction and automatic parameterization for the continuum level which makes the spectral analysis easier and consistent. In order to compile ARES it is required some external libraries (e.g. CFITSIO, GSL, etc.) which can be easily installed in Linux machines. The compilation of the code is then handled by the Makefile provided in the repository.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOOG</head><p>MOOG is a code that performs a variety of LTE spectral analysis. The original code can also be found in its homepage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . The code available in the school codes repository is an adapted version of MOOG2014 modified to neglect its (non-free) plot library dependency. In this tutorial it is only used the silent version of the code to make abundance computations for our EW method. The compilation of the code is also handled by the Makefile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Spectral test data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observed Spectrum</head><p>The spectra for the analysis should be of good quality, in terms of resolution (R &gt; 30000) and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N &gt; 100). Three HARPS spectra are provided for the tutorial. These spectra have R ∼ 110000, and S/N &gt; 300. These spectra is provided in the folder spectra of the repository. These are standard FITS 1D spectra. In order to be compatible with ARES they need to have the standard keywords CDELTA1 and CRVAL1 and the units of the wavelengths should be Angstrom. Alternatively ARES can also read ASCII spectra where the format must be two columns, the first with the wavelengths and the second with the flux. In this tutorial only the standard 1D fits files are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linelist</head><p>The strength of specific absorption spectral lines should be measured in this analysis. As in most EW methods, iron lines are mostly used because they strongly populate the solar-type spectrum and because iron can be used as a proxy for the stellar metallicity. The linelist provided online (iron lines parameters.dat) compiles 263 Fe I and 36 Fe II lines. These lines were carefully selected <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and its atomic data were revised using a solar spectrum as a reference making it possible to use of a differential analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This linelist is used both for ARES and MOOG. For ARES the important information is only the wavelength of the lines. The format in this case is to keep the first column as wavelength in Angstrom. For the individual abundance computation MOOG needs the atomic data, the Excitation Potential (E.P.), and oscillator strengths (log gf), the 2nd and 3rd columns respectively. The format of this file should be kept fixed so the scripts work without a problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Script Codes</head><p>Input linelist for MOOG</p><p>The EW measurements and the atomic data for the linelist require a special format to be used by MOOG. To facilitate this task it is provided a python script (make moog lines.py) that reads the atomic data from the linelist and the output file from ARES to compile the required formated input file for MOOG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creating a stellar atmospheric model</head><p>For the computation of the individual line abundance it is required the use an atmospheric stellar model. MARCS models 4 are used in this tutorial. For this task it is provided a script that interpolates a grid of MARCS models for specific stellar parameters. The folder interpol models marcs in the repository includes a script for this task. In order to make it work, it is first required to follow the instructions to download and extract the grid of MARCS models. The use of the script to get a specific atmospheric stellar model is straightforward and it will be described later in this document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excitation and Ionization Correlation</head><p>To understand how the individual line abundances depend on the stellar atmospheric parameters and how to find the best stellar parameters, it is provided a plotting script that allows the visualization of the correlations/indicators needed to constrain the parameters. These include the abundance vs. E.P., abundance vs. Reduced EW., the information on | &lt; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Step by Step Tutorial</head><p>The criteria to derive good spectroscopic parameters with this method rely on the model that enforces the excitation and ionization balance for the line abundances. Therefore the final step of this iterative method is when it is found the same abundance for all the lines which will translate in zero slopes for abundance vs. E.P., abundance vs. Reduced EW. and &lt; FeI &gt;=&lt; FeII &gt;. How to reach this? The steps to derive stellar parameters, where the spectrum TestA.fits is used for this example, are described as follow:</p><p>1. Location: To start the process lets first define a reference folder. Let the folder running dir be our reference in order to run the codes and scripts in this tutorial. To confirm this, when displaying the spectra available in the repository the result should be:  6. Control check: This is the crucial step where it is validated the stellar parameters for the model. Again, good parameters are found when the same abundance is derived for all the lines. The slopes should therefore be negligible (all indicators having values &lt; 0.005 is a good criteria). If significant correlations are found in these indicators, these can be used to adjust the parameters back in step 4. To check the status of these indicators the plotting python script can be used:</p><p>running_dir$ python read_moog_plot.py output.moog Model Parameters: Teff logg vtur [M/H] 5500 4.4 1.00 0.00  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> The result of the first iteration of the TestA.fits spectrum. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the plots that appear in the last step. The indicators values for this first iteration are far from zero. Therefore it is require to go back to step 4 and try different parameters. The strategy to minimize this problem and change the parameters in the correct direction is discussed in the next section.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">----------------------------- |</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The strategy to find the best parameters</head><p>In this section it is briefly described the technical strategy to find the best model. A complete description of this strategy is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. From figure 1 the four indicators values provide the necessary hints to reach a better model for the next iteration.</p><p>• Slope E.P.: This indicator is the one that strongly depends on the temperature of the model. Negative values of this slope means that the correct temperature should be lower. To fix positive values the temperature should increase in the next iteration. This indicator controls the excitation balance. Given the very high number of iron lines, the temperature is one of the best constrained parameters with this method.</p><p>• Slope R.W.: This indicator is connected with the microturbulance parameter which basically controls the abundance determination for the stronger lines where saturation becomes specially significant in the wings of the absorption lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For negative slopes the microturbulance should be reduced, while positive values it means the microturbulance is overestimated.  • &lt; &lt; &lt; F F Fe e eI I I &gt; &gt; &gt; − − − &lt; &lt; &lt; F F Fe e eI I II I I &gt; &gt; &gt;: Since FeII lines are more sensitive to surface gravity than FeI lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, this indicator can be used to control the log g of the model. For negative values then log g should decrease for the next iteration, while for positive values log g should be higher.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• [ [ [F F FE E E/ / /H H H] ] ] − − − [ [ [M M M/ / /H H H] ] ]:</formula><p>More than an indicator, this is actually a logical physical constraint for the model. Meaning that the input metallicity should output a compatible global iron abundance. Here it is assumed that the iron abundance is a proxy for the stellar metallicity. Therefore if the iron abundance is larger than the model metallicity (positive indicator) then it should be increased for the next iteration. If the indicator is negative this means that the metallicity of the model is overestimated.</p><p>These indicators can be used to find a better model for the spectrum TestA.fits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows one good result for a model with Teff: 5838 K, logg: 4.34 dex, [M/H] = 0.25, v tur = 1.08 km/s. With this model all the indicators are close to zero (all &lt; 0.005). These results can still improve, given the clear presence of outliers in the figure. In this case most of these outliers are overestimating the iron abundance (compared with the average). The cause for this may be related with less reliable, and overestimated, EW measurements for those specific spectral lines and therefore removing these outliers will improve the result.</p><p>For this tutorial, it is provided in table 4 the identification of the stars for each test spectrum provided. The table also summarizes the stellar parameters which were derived by using the same method with remotion of outliers. For the spectrum TestA.fits, which correspond to HD128620 (also known as α Cen A) the results are quite close to the ones presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. Note that temperature is within 10 K, and the metallicity should be slightly lower (by only 0.02 dex) as expected given that the outliers overestimate the iron abundance. Although here it is not discussed any error analysis for this method, it is clear from the results that the precision of the method is quite high, just by considering the very low spread of the parameters derived without the lines with problematic EW measurements. </p></div>
