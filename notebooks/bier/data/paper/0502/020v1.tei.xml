			<abstract>
				<p>The possibility of measuring the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction to the or-bital period of a test particle freely orbiting a spherically symmetric mass in the Solar System is analyzed. It should be possible, in principle, to detect it for Mercury at a precision level of 10 −4. This level is mainly set by the unavoidable systematic errors due to the mismodelling in the Keplerian period which could not be reduced by accumulating a large number of orbital revolutions. Future missions like Messenger and BepiColombo should allow to improve it by increasing our knowledge of the Mer-cury&apos;s orbital parameters. The observational accuracy is estimated to be 10 −4 from the knowledge of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) axes. It could be improved by observing as many planetary transits as possible. It is not possible to measure such an effect in the gravitational field of the Earth by analyzing the motion of artificial satellites or the Moon because of the unavoidable systematic errors related to the uncertainties in the Keplerian periods. In the case of some recently discovered exoplanets the problems come from the observational errors which are larger than the relativistic effect.</p>

In the framework of the Einstein's General Theory of Relativity the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric acceleration of order O(c −2 ) experienced by the test particle is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Joos &amp; Grafarend 1991)</ref> a (GE) = GM c 2 r 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">4 GM r − (v · v) r + 4(r · v)v ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, r and v are the position and velocity vectors, respectively, of the test particle, r is the standard isotropic radial coordinate 1 , not to be confused with the Schwarzschild radial coordinate r ′ = r[1 + GM/(2c 2 r)] 2 .</p><p>⋆ E-mail: lorenzo.iorio@libero.it (AVR) 1 It is the coordinate used in the force models of the postNewtonian equations of motions (Estabrook 1971) adopted for the computations of the planetary ephemerides by, e.g., the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</p><p>The gravitoelectric acceleration of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is the same which is responsible for the Einstein secular advance of the perihelia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Einstein 1915</ref>) of the Solar System planets which are known at a 10 −4 level of accuracy (Pitjeva 2001a,b). We are interested in the consequences of eq.(1) on the orbital period of the test particle in order to see if they can be detected in suitably designed experiments in the Solar System arena. Let us first consider circular orbits for which r · v = 0 and r = a, where a is the semimajor axis of the orbit; indeed, the orbits of the planets and of many of the best tracked Earth artificial satellites have rather small eccentricities e. Subsequent sensitivity analyses will show the extent to which this approximation can be considered adequate. In this case the acceleration given by eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is directed radially and the radial equation of motion reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v 2 a = GM a 2 − GM c 2 a 3 4 GM a − v 2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>With v = adφ/dt, the time required for the azimuthal angle φ to pass from 0 to 2π becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P ≡ P (0) + P (GE) = 2π a 3 GM + 3π c 2 √ GM a,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where P (0) is the unperturbed Keplerian period Note that eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> is consistent with the result of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mashhoon et al. 2001</ref>). Contrary to the gravitomagnetic correction to the Keplerian orbital period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mashhoon et al. 2001</ref>), which is generated by the proper angular momentum J of the central mass, P (GE) is insensitive to the direction of motion of the test particle around its orbit and to its inclination with respect to the equatorial plane of the central body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A TENTATIVE ERROR BUDGET</head><p>Is it possible to measure P (GE) by analyzing the motion of the planets around the Sun? Although their eccentricities are rather small being of the order of 10 −2 − 10 −3 , apart from Mercury for which e = 0.2056, it turns out that, as we will show below, the available observational accuracy does not allow to neglect the impact of the non-circularity of their orbits. For e = 0 the exact expression of the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction is ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mashhoon et al. 2001</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (GE) = 3π c 2 √ GM a 3 − 2 √ 1 − e 2 (1 + e cos f0) 2 (4)</formula><p>where f0 is the true anomaly at the initial epoch of the planet. The factor</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">3 − 2 √ 1 − e 2 (1 + e cos f0) 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>runs from 1.65 for f0 = 0 • to -0.10 for f0 = 180 • ; in the case of Venus, which has e = 0.00677, it changes from 1.02 to 0.97. In the following, in order to sketch a sensitivity analysis, we will work with the initial epoch for which the factor of eq.(5) is equal to 1, i.e. we will assume eq.(3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The observational sensitivity</head><p>The azimuthal angle φ is the usual right ascension α of a spherical coordinate system in an astronomical reference frame.</p><p>We will refer to the International Celestial Reference Frame 2 (ICRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(McCarthy &amp; Petit 2004</ref>). Moreover, the right ascension is one of the direct observables in planetary motions. Since we are interested in the times when the right ascension of a planet crosses the {x, z} plane of ICRF, i.e. when it is zero, it is of the utmost importance to see if the present uncertainty in the stability of the ICRF's axes would allow for a detection of the gravitoelectric correction or if it is too large and would mask it. We can reasonably assume that the right ascension of a planet advances under the effect of the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric force over an angular interval of α = 2π, by a quantity δα defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">δα α ∼ P (GE) P (0) = 3GM⊙ 2c 2 a ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where a is the semimajor axis. From eq.(6) it is apparent that the inner planets have to be considered in order to maximize the effect. For Mercury, whose semimajor axis amounts to a = 0.38709893 A.U., P (GE) = 0.29 s (if the numerical factor of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> is assumed equal to 1) and P (0) = 7.60055184 × 10 6 s; eq.(6) yields δα/α = 3.8 × 10 −8 . Then, δα = 50 milliarcseconds (mas in the following). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(McCarthy &amp; Petit 2004</ref>), the uncertainty in the ICRF axes amounts to σα = 0.02 mas. This yields an accuracy of 4 × 10 −4 . Then it appears clear that with such an accuracy 3 the circular case approximation cannot be considered adequate. Such evaluations hold for a single orbital revolution only; a measurement like that proposed here must be performed over a large number of planetary transits. This would greatly increase the observational accuracy.</p><p>Our knowledge of the orbital motion of Mercury will improve thanks to the future missions Messenger <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , which has been launched in the summer 2004 and whose encounter with Mercury is scheduled for 2011, and, especially 5 , BepiColombo 6 , which is scheduled to fly in 2010-2012. A complete error analysis for the range and range-rate measurements to BepiColombo can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Iess &amp; Boscagli 2001)</ref>. According to them, a two orders of magnitude improvement in the Earth-Mercury range, which is accurate to hundreds of meters now, should be possible. According to a more conservative evaluation by E.M Standish (JPL) <ref type="bibr">(Standish, private communication 2004</ref>), improvements in the Mercury's orbital parameters might amount to one order of magnitude. In regard to the proposed test, the Mercury transits which could benefit from Messenger and BepiColombo will be of the order of 4, since both the spacecraft should nominally orbit Mercury for 1 year and the orbital period of Mercury around the Sun is almost equal to 88 days.</p></div>

Then, let us see if the systematic errors in the Keplerian period are smaller than the postNewtonian gravitoelectric correction which we are interested in. This is a very important point because, opposite to the 3 It maybe interesting also to note that such an accuracy would not allow for a detection of the gravitomagnetic correction to the Keplerian period 2πJ ⊙ /c 2 M which, in the case of the Sun, amounts to 4×10 −6 s by assuming (Pijpers 2003) J ⊙ = 1.9×10 41 kg m 2 s −1 . <ref type="bibr">4</ref> See on the WEB http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/ and http://discovery.nasa.gov/messenger.html 5 While the spacecraft trajectory will be determined from the range-rate data, the planet's orbit will be retrieved from the range data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Milani et al. 2002)</ref>. In particular, the determination of the planetary centre of mass is important to this goal which can be better reached by a not too elliptical spacecraft's orbit.

Note this error should be reduced to ∼ 10 −5 s if J2⊙ will be measured with an accuracy of the order of 10 −9 by BepiColombo. These sources of constant bias, which are at the same level of the one-revolution observational error previously outlined, set the limit of the obtainable accuracy over a record spanning over many planetary revolutions.</p></div>

From an observational point of view, by repeating the reasonings of Section 2.1 with eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref> and by considering that the accuracy in the orientation of the axes of the International Terrestrial Reference System 9 (ITRS) is of the order 10 of 3 mas, it would be possible to measure P (GE) over a sufficiently high number of orbital revolutions. Indeed, for a typical satellite orbit with a = 7×10 6 m the post-Newtonian shift over 2π would amount to 1 mas.</p><p>However, by assuming, e.g., a = 1.2270 × 10 7 m, as for LAGEOS whose rms post-fit residuals amount to σa ∼ 10 −2 m or better, the systematic error on the Keplerian period P (0) amounts to 1×10 −5 s, while P (GE) is of the order of 7 × 10 −6 s only. It is important to note that this uncertainty, opposite to the observational one, could not be reduced by observing a large number of transits: indeed, the 1-cm level of accuracy in estimating the semimajor axis comes just from a data reduction over a time span of many orbits.</p><p>Let us, now, consider the possibility of using the very accurate present and future data from the Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) technique for the Moon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Williams et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Recalling that a Moon = 3.84400 × 10 8 m and e Moon = 0.0554 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Standish 2001)</ref>, the approximation of circular orbit would be adequate and P (GE) = 4 × 10 −5 s almost independently of f0; the gravitoelectric advance over 2π amounts to 7.5 mas. By assuming the present day centimeter accuracy in knowing the lunar orbit, the systematic error related to the Keplerian period, which cannot be reduced by accumulating a large number of revolutions, would amount to 1×10 −4 s. If the millimeter accuracy level will be reached ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Williams et al. 2004</ref>), the systematic error will be reduced down to 1 × 10 −5 s, i.e. 25% of the gravitoelectric correction.</p><p>The major limiting factor both for the Moon and the artificial satellites is the impact of the uncertainty in the Earth's GM which amounts to σGM ⊕ = 8 × 10 5 m 3 s −2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(McCarthy &amp; Petit 2004</ref>).

Indeed, they are giant planets following circular trajectories with orbital periods of the order of 1 day, i.e. very close to their star. On the other hand, the accuracy of the measurement of their periods with photometric techniques is continuously increasing. Let us look at the very recently analyzed OGLE-TR-132b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bouchy et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Moutou et al. 2004</ref>). The relevant orbital parameters are M/M⊙ = 1.35 ± 0.06 (adopted for the star), a/A.U. = 0.0306 ± 0.0008, m (c) /m (Jup) = 1.19 ± 0.13 and P (obs) = 1.46003645 × 10 5 s ± 0.518 s (measured for the planet over many orbital revolutions). Unfortunately,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P (GE) = 0.095 s only.</formula><p>The situation is even worse in the case of the pulsars' planetary systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we have conducted a preliminary sensitivity analysis about the possibility of measuring the postNewtonian gravitoelectric correction to the orbital period of a test body in a Solar System scenario. The conclusions are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The post-Newtonian shift of Mercury's right ascension would amount to 50 mas over one orbital revolution. Its orbit has been assumed circular just in order to perform a preliminary sensitivity analysis. In fact, the obtainable observational accuracy does not allow to neglect the impact of the factor of eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> which depends on the eccentricity and the true anomaly at the initial epoch.</p><p>Such an effect should be measurable, in principle, for Mercury with a 10 −4 accuracy. This level is mainly set by the systematic errors induced by the mismodelling in the Keplerian period which should be subtracted. Instead, the precision with which the axes of the International Celestial Reference Frame are known (0.02 mas) can be assumed as representative of the observational accuracy. It yields a 10 −4 accuracy over one orbital revolution only. Of course, it could be increased by observing as many transits as possible. Future improvements in astrometry and in the knowledge of Mercury's orbital parameters from the Messenger and BepiColombo mission should allow to further increase the precision of this test by reducing the systematic errors. BepiColombo is also expected to measure the Solar quadrupole mass moment J2 with an accuracy of few parts in 10 −9 .</p><p>The present-day level of accuracy in knowing the orbits of the best accurately tracked Earth artificial satellites rules out the possibility of measuring such post-Newtonian effect in the terrestrial gravitational field. For the Moon, a millimeter accuracy in knowing its orbit, a goal which could be reached in the next future, would yield a 25% systematic <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Observational and systematic errors affecting the measurement of the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction P (GE) to the orbital period of Mercury, the Moon, the Earth artificial satellite LAGEOS, an exoplanet of the system OGLE-TR-132b and a planet of the PSR 1217+12 pulsar. All figures are in s. The circular orbit approximation has been adopted. The observational accuracy is to be intended over one orbital revolution. It is retrieved from the ratio of the accuracy, in mas, with which the axes of the ICRF and ITRS are known to the gravitoelectric shift over one orbital revolution. Contrary to the systematic errors, the observational errors can be reduced by observing a sufficiently large number of orbital revolutions. Note that the observational uncertainty for the exoplanet refers to many orbital revolutions. The systematic errors are due to the Keplerian period P (0) , the indirect effect ∆P (0) on it due to the perturbations in the semimajor axis, the perturbation induced by the quadrupolar mass moment of the central source P <ref type="bibr">(J 2 )</ref> , the direct perturbation induced by the secular N-body interaction P (planets) . In regard to the indirect effects on the Keplerian period, σ ∆P (0) | GE and σ ∆P (0) | planets are induced by the short-period post-Newtonian and Newtonian effects on the semimajor axis.</p></div>
