Observations were acquired with 0.5-1.2-m telescopes between 2007 and 2013. Our homogeneous analysis, which also includes the literature data, results in determining precise system parameters. New values are in agreement with those reported in previous studies. Transit times follow a linear ephemeris with no sign of any transit time variations. This finding is in line with the paradigm that Jupiter-like planets on tight orbits are devoid of close planetary companions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Observations of transiting exoplanets offer a wealth of knowledge about extrasolar planetary systems. Photometric and spectroscopic datasets, when combined Vol. 0 1 together, allow the planetary radius and exact planetary mass to be determined. These quantities give the mean planetary density, which is a clue to the internal structure of a planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nettelmann et al. 2010</ref>). Observations of occultations of transiting planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Snellen et al. 2009</ref>) constrain an orbital eccentricity, which is usually poorly determined from radial velocity (RV) measurements alone. These observations also allow one to determine chemical properties of the planetary atmosphere with the spectrophotometry technique (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>). Observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect provide the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Queloz et al. 2000)</ref>. This information gives important insight into theories of planet formation and dynamical evolution.</p><p>The architecture of planetary systems with a transiting planet may be studied with the RV and transit timing methods to search for additional planets. The former technique has already brought discoveries of companions on wide orbits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakos et al. 2009</ref>). The latter method, based on the detection of transit time variations <ref type="bibr">(TTVs, e.g., Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>, is sensitive to terrestrial-mass planetary companions close to low-order mean-motion resonances <ref type="bibr">(MMRs, Steffen et al. 2007</ref>). In such configurations, the mutual gravitational interaction of planets may generate deviations from strictly periodic transit times. The terrestrial-mass planets are usually below the current RV sensitivity limit which makes the TTV method, in addition to gravitational microlensing, the unique discovery tool. So far, the TTV technique has been successfully applied to data from the space-based Kepler transit survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Borucki et al. 2010</ref>). In transiting multi-planetary systems, analyses of TTVs have allowed one to confirm or validate the planetary nature of many candidates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Holman et al. 2010</ref>). In single transiting planet systems, dynamical analyses of observed transit times have led to discoveries of unseen planetary companions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballard et al. 2011</ref>), some of them confirmed independently by RV measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barros et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Statistical studies of hot-Jupiter candidates (planets with masses of the order of 1 Jupiter mass, M Jup , and orbital periods shorter than 5 days) in the Kepler sample show that these planets accompanied by nearby low-mass planets are rare <ref type="bibr">(Stef- fen et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Steffen &amp; Farr 2013</ref>. In contrast, planets on slightly wider orbits, so called warm Jupiters, Neptunes, or super Earths, are observed to form multiplanetary systems with planetary pairs close to MMRs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ming et al. 2013</ref>). The relative isolation of hot Jupiters could be the result of the initial formation conditions and dynamical evolution of their planetary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kley &amp; Nelson 2012)</ref>. Theoretical studies show that the system architecture may depend on many factors, including the mass ratio of planets relative to the central star, the mass of the protoplanetary disk, and the mechanism of the planetary migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Goldreich &amp; Schlichting 2013</ref>). Thus, the detection or a lack of companion planets close to hot Jupiters may put forward observational constraints on the theory of planet formation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ogihara et al. 2013</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Steffen et al. 2012</ref> for a detailed discussion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>It has been shown that a terrestrial-mass planet perturbing a hot-Jupiter gas giant in an orbital resonance can produce a TTV signal of an amplitude of a few minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Steffen et al. 2007)</ref>. Such a signal can be detected using timing observations acquired with 0.5-1.0-m telescopes. Being encouraged by this finding, we have organized observing campaigns for selected transiting planets to search for their possible <ref type="bibr">TTVs (Maciejewski et al. 2011a</ref>). So far, we have put constraints on the upper mass of additional planets in WASP-3 and TrES-3 systems ( <ref type="bibr">Maciejew- ski et al. 2013b</ref><ref type="bibr">, Vaňko et al. 2013</ref>), refined transit ephemerides for some transiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Maciejewski et al. 2011c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, 2013c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Raetz et al. 2014</ref>), studied physical properties of the WASP-10 b planet and the activity of its host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Maciejewski et al. 2011b)</ref>, and finally found a hint of orbital perturbations for the WASP-12 b planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Maciejewski et al. 2013a)</ref>. In this paper, we study the transiting exoplanet WASP-1 b . Our observing campaign, spanning six years, resulted in refining system parameters and putting upper-mass constraints on the second planet in the system.</p><p>The WASP-1 star (GSC 02265-00107, V = 11.31 mag) with its transiting planet belongs to the first planetary systems discovered by the SuperWASP survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Pollacco et al. 2006</ref>). The planetary nature of its companion was confirmed with RV measurements acquired with the SOPHIE spectrograph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bouchy et al. 2006</ref>). The planet was found to be bloated with a sub-Jovian mass and the radius 1.4 times greater than that of Jupiter. It orbits a dwarf star of the F7 spectral type on a 2.5-d orbit with the semi-major axis of 0.038 AU. The system parameters were refined by follow-up observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charbonneau et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Shporer et al. (2008)</ref> and a re-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Southworth (2008;</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Szabó et al. (2010)</ref> refined the transit ephemeris with new transit observations acquired with a small telescope.</p><p>The host star was the subject of a detailed spectroscopic study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Stempels et al. (2007)</ref>. Precise RV measurements, obtained throughout a transit by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Simpson et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albrecht et al. (2011)</ref>, show that WASP-1 b belongs to the group of misaligned planetary systems with the almost polar orbit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wheatley et al. (2010)</ref> observed an occultation of WASP-1 b with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Their results show that there is a strong temperature inversion in the planet's atmosphere. Furthermore, the phase of mid-occultation was found to be consistent with a value of 0.5. This finding suggests that the planetary orbit is circularised.</p><p>There is a number of mechanisms proposed to explain anomalous sizes of inflated exoplanets (see e.g., Martin et al. 2011 for references). Early studies suggested that a small but non-zero value of the orbital eccentricity of WASP-1 b, excited by an undetected planetary companion, could bloat the planet through tidal heating <ref type="bibr">(Mardling 2007)</ref>. This finding motivated us to study the WASP-1 system through the transit timing of WASP-1 b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations and data reduction</head><p>New transit light curves were acquired using six instruments with diameters of the main mirror between 0.5 and 1.2 m, located in Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia, and Namibia (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for details). All instruments were equipped with charge coupled devices (CCDs), thus standard data reduction procedure, including debiasing, dark correction, and flat-fielding using sky flats, was applied. Differential aperture photometry was performed with respect to the comparison stars available in a field of view. The size of aperture was optimized to achieve the smallest scatter in the out-of-transit light curves. To account for photometric trends, mainly caused by differential atmospheric extinction and different spectral types of the target and comparison stars, the light curves were de-trended by fitting a second-order polynomial function of time along with a trial transit model. In the first iteration, complete light curves were de-trended using the trial transit model, the initial parameters of which were taken from the literature. A preliminary transit model, based on complete light curves, was obtained following a procedure described in Section 3.1. In the second iteration, partial transit light curves were de-trended employing a second-order polynomial function and the preliminary transit model. The de-trending procedure was performed with the JKTEBOP code <ref type="bibr">(Southworth et al. 2004a,b)</ref>, which allows photometric trends to be modeled as polynomials up to 5th order. The best-fitting trend was subtracted from each light curve.</p><p>Magnitudes were transformed into fluxes and normalised to have a mean of unity outside of the transit. The timestamps in geocentric Julian dates in coordinated universal time (UTC) were converted to barycentric Julian dates in barycentric dynamical time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Eastman et al. 2010</ref>). To ensure a reliable time survey and exclude systematic errors in the recorded times, local computer clocks were synchronized with the network time protocol software, usually accurate to better than 0.1 s. To quantify the quality of each light curve, we used the photometric noise rate <ref type="bibr">( pnr , Fulton et al. 2011</ref>) defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">pnr = rms √ Γ (1)</formula><p>where the root mean square of the residuals, rms, is calculated from the light curve and a fitted model, and Γ is the median number of exposures per minute. We acquired 13 new transit light curves 2 for WASP-1 b between 2007 September and 2013 November, summarised in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Some light curves are incomplete because they were affected by adverse weather conditions or limited visibility of the target above the horizon. The observations were mostly collected in R and V filters. Some data were acquired without any filter (in so called "clear" filter or white light) with a spectral band determined by instrumental response, stellar spectral energy distribution, and the wavelength-depended sky transmission. This method is</p></div>

One must note, however, that a poorly determined efficient band, which in addition may vary due to variable atmospheric conditions, introduces uncertainties to the coefficients of the limb darkening (LD) law. In consequence, white-light data should be treated with caution while determining system parameters. In this study, we used those data for transit timing only.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Transit model</head><p>Transit light curves were modeled with the Transit Analysis Package 3 (TAP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gazak et al. 2012</ref>). The best-fitting parameters of a transit, which is based on the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Poddaný et al. 2010</ref>), and 13 new light curves presented in this paper, were modeled simultaneously to improve the determination of system parameters. The orbital inclination i b , the semimajor-axis scaled by stellar radius a b /R * , and the planetary to stellar radii ratio R b /R * were linked together for all light curves in Sloan-z, V , R, and I filters. For light curves acquired in "clear" filter, their morphology may be affected by systematics caused by not precisely known LD coefficients, so their parameters were allowed to vary independently. The only restriction was put on i b , which was allowed to vary around the best fitting value under Gaussian penalty with the 1-σ uncertainty of the parameter. The orbital period was fixed to a value obtained in Sect. 3.2. Mid-transit times of individual light curves were free parameters to account for possible timing variations. Two transits were observed simultaneously with two different telescopes. In those cases, the mid-transit times were linked together to obtain a single determination for a given epoch. It is worth noticing that individual mid-transits times for both epochs were found to be consistent well within 1σ when they were allowed to be determined independently in a test run. This observation allowed us to exclude any systematic errors in the time survey for both epochs.</p><p>To parametrise the flux distribution across the stellar disk, TAP employs a quadratic LD law in a form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I θ /I 0 = 1 − u 1 (1 − cos θ) − u 2 (1 − cos θ) 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where I θ is the intensity at angle θ which is the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight, I 0 is the intensity at the centre of the stellar disk, and u 1 and u 2 are linear and quadratic LD coefficients, respectively. For individual filters, the values of u 1 and u 2 coefficients were linearly interpolated from tables of <ref type="bibr">Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011)</ref> with an on-line tool 4 of the EXOFAST applet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Eastman et al. 2013</ref>). The efficient maximum of energy distribution in the "clear" filter was found to be between V and R bands. Thus, the LD coefficients for white-light data were calculated as average values of those in V and R bands. We notice that this approach results in values close to bolometric LD coefficients. The parameters of the host star (effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) were taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Torres et al. (2012)</ref>. The photometric dataset was found to be not precise enough to allow LD coefficients to be free parameters of the model. To take uncertainties of the theoretical LD law into account, LD coefficients were allowed to vary under the Gaussian penalty of σ = 0.05. A circular orbit of WASP-1 b was assumed as discussed in Sect. 3.3. The fitting procedure was also allowed to account for possible linear trends in individual light curves and to include their uncertainties in a total error budget of the fit.</p><p>In the final iteration, ten MCMC chains, each containing 10 6 steps, were computed. The first 10% of the results were discarded from each chain to minimise the influence of the initial values of the parameters. The best-fitting parameters, determined as the median values of marginalised posteriori probability distributions, are given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Their upper and lower 1 σ errors are determined by 15.9 and 84.1 percentile values of the distributions. The transit parameter b b , defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">b b = a b R * cos i b ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and the mean stellar density ρ * , which can be directly calculated from other parameters with a formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ρ * = 2π P b 2 a b R * 3 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>are also given. For comparison, we also include determinations from previous studies. The individual light curves with models and residuals are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>An analysis of relations between fitted parameters <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>) reveals a statistically significant correlation between i b and a b /R * . This is a typical behaviour when there are no other constraints on one of these parameters (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hoyer et al. 2012</ref>). However, we notice that keeping a b /R * fixed on the value based on spectroscopic determinations results in noticeable underestimated uncertainties of i b , compared to our final solution. Our final approach is more conservative and provides an independent determination of a b /R * . Remaining parameters, especially mid-transit times of individual light curves, reveal no dependence between each other.

We employed PARSEC isochrones in version 1. <ref type="bibr">1 (Bressan et al. 2012</ref>) that were bilinearly interpolated to estimate the parameters and their errors. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the location of WASP-1 in a modified Hertzsprung-Russell diagram together with the best-fitting isochrone.</p><p>The refined value of the stellar mass allowed us to reanalyse RVs from Collier <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Simpson et al.

The RV measurements come from the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.9-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (France) and the FIES spectrograph mounted on the 2.6-m Nordic Optical Telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on La Palma (Spain). The data points that were obtained during transits (±120 min from the expected mid-transit time, based on the transit ephemeris refined in Sect. 3.2) were removed from the sample to exclude deviations caused by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We used the Systemic Console software <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Meschiari et al. 2009</ref>) to redetermine the RV semi-amplitude k b , the minimal planetary mass M b sin i b , and the semi-major axis, a b . The mid-transit times from <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> were included in the RV model to tighter constrain the orbital mean anomaly at the initial epoch. The orbital period was a free parameter to verify the value obtained from transit timing alone, and to take into account its uncertainty when computing the uncertainties in other parameters. To account for differences in the calibration of system velocities, the RV offsets were allowed to vary for both data sets. In the final iteration, a perfectly circular orbit was assumed. In test runs, when the orbital eccentricity was a free parameter, it quickly converged to zero, leaving no statistically significant hint of an eccentric orbit solution. The Nelder-Mead minimization procedure was used to find the best-fitting Keplerian orbit. The MCMC algorithm was used to determine the parameter uncertainties. The MCMC chain was 10 6 steps long, and the first 10% configurations were discarded. The scale parameters were set empirically in a series of attempts to get the acceptance rate of the MCMC procedure close to the optimal value of 0.25. For each parameter, the standard deviation was taken as the final uncertainty estimate. The scatter of the RVs, characterised by rms rv , was found to be equal to 16.7 m s −1 .</p><p>The determined quantities were combined to calculate the physical parameters of the planet and host star, such as the planetary mass M b , the radius R b , the mean density ρ b , the surface gravitational acceleration g b , the stellar radius R * , and the surface gravity log g * .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Constraints on the mass of an additional planet</head><p>Transit timing and RV observations allow us to place constraints on the properties of any hypothetical additional planet in the system. We used the MERCURY 6 package (Chambers 1999) with the Bulirsch-Stoer integrator to generate a set of synthetic O-C diagrams for WASP-1 b in the presence of a fictitious perturbing planet. The mass of this body was set at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 M Earth (Earth masses), and the initial semi-major axis varied between 0.0083 and 0.115 AU with a step of 10 −6 AU. The initial orbital longitude of WASP-1 b was set at a value calculated for cycle zero, and the initial longitude of the fictitious planet was shifted by 180 • . The system was assumed to be coplanar, with both orbits initially circular. The integration time covered 2700 days, i.e., the time span of the transit observations. The value of rms of the residuals from a linear ephemeris was calculated for each set of simulated observations. Then, for each orbital distance, we determined the range of planet masses in which the calculated rms ttv of 0.0012 d fell. An upper mass of the fictitious planet at the detection limit was found by linear interpolation for masses below 500 M Earth . If rms ttv was found to be generated by a more massive body, the limiting mass was extrapolated using a linear trend as fitted to 100 and 500 M Earth . In addition, the value of rms rv was used to calculate the RV mass limit as a function of the semi-major axis of the fictitious planet. Finally, both criteria were combined together. The results are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Fig. 6. Upper mass limit for a fictitious additional planet in the WASP-1 system, based on timing and RV data sets, as a function of the orbital period of that planet, P p . The greyed space of parameters area show configurations that are below our detection threshold. Planetary systems between the inner 2:3 and outer 3:2 orbital period commensurabilities (marked with vertical dashed lines) were found to be highly unstable in most cases.</p><p>Most of orbits located between the inner 2:3 and outer 3:2 orbital period commensurabilities, were found to be highly unstable and planetary close encounters or planet ejections occurred during the relatively short time of integration. This space of instability was omitted in further analysis. The RV dataset puts tighter constraints in most orbital configurations and allows us to exclude a fictitious planet down to ∼30 M Earth on ∼12-hour orbits. The timing technique allows us to probe the Earth-mass regime close to MMRs. We can exclude an additional planet of the mass of 4.4, 0.4, and 1.1 M Earth in inner 1:3, 1:2, and 3:5 MMRs, respectively. We also find no sign of a perturber of the mass greater than 1.4 and 0.5 M Earth in outer 5:3 and 2:1 MMRs, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Our simultaneous observations of transits with two telescopes at different locations reduced mid-transit time uncertainties by 7-20%, depending on the quality of individual datasets. Our pilot observations without any filter, i.e., in white light, if performed in photometric conditions, result in higher data quality, and hence bring more precise mid-transit times.</p><p>The simultaneous analysis of our 13 new transit light curves and additional 6 from the literature results in redetermining system parameters which in most cases agree with the literature ones within 1σ. Despite the conservative approach, we derived more precise values than those ones published before.</p><p>The homogeneous analysis of transit light curves shows that transit times of the WASP-1 b planet follow the linear ephemeris, leaving no space for any sign of timing variation. Thus, we can only put observational constraints for a fictitious second planet in the system. The transiting planet has no detectable close planetary companion and this finding agrees with the analysis of a sample of hot Jupiter candidates observed with the Kepler space telescope.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
