			<abstract>
				<p>We present a large, uniform analysis of young (≈10-150 Myr) ultracool dwarfs, based on new high-precision infrared (IR) parallaxes for 68 objects. We find that low-gravity (vl-g) late-M and L dwarfs form a continuous sequence in IR color-magnitude diagrams , separate from the field population and from current theoretical models. These vl-g objects also appear distinct from young substellar (brown dwarf and exoplanet) companions, suggesting the two populations may have a different range of physical properties. In contrast, at the L/T transition, young, old, and spectrally peculiar objects all span a relatively narrow range in near-IR absolute magnitudes. At a given spectral type, the IR absolute magnitudes of young objects can be offset from ordinary field dwarfs, with the largest offsets occurring in the Y and J bands for late-M dwarfs (brighter than the field) and mid/late-L dwarfs (fainter than the field). Overall, low-gravity (vl-g) objects have the most uniform photometric behavior while intermediate-gravity (int-g) objects are more diverse, suggesting a third governing parameter beyond spectral type 1 This work is largely based on observations obtained with WIRCam, a joint project of CFHT,-2-and gravity class. We examine the moving group membership for all young ultracool dwarfs with parallaxes, changing the status of 23 objects (including 8 previously identified planetary-mass candidates) and fortifying the status of another 28 objects. We use our resulting age-calibrated sample to establish empirical young isochrones and show a declining frequency of vl-g objects relative to int-g objects with increasing age. Notable individual objects in our sample include high-velocity (100 km s −1) int-g objects; very red late-L dwarfs with high surface gravities; candidate disk-bearing members of the MBM20 cloud and β Pic moving group; and very young distant interlopers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive summary of the absolute magnitudes and spectral classifications of young ultracool dwarfs, using a combined sample of 102 objects found in the field and as substellar companions to young stars. Subject headings: brown dwarfs-proper motions-parallaxes-solar neighborhood 2. 1. Sample Our ongoing CFHT program is monitoring candidate young field objects with spectral types of M6 and later that have been identified from a variety of sources. This paper presents results for a sample of 67 such objects (and 1 object with a spectral type of M4.5), chosen for publication solely based on a sufficient number of observing epochs and time baseline to determine a robust parallax and proper motion. These objects fall into four subsets (Table 1): • Low-gravity objects (44 objects): We selected targets noted as having lower surface gravity than typical field objects based on their optical and/or near-IR spectra. Most of these objects were originally identified by 2MASS-based searches for ultracool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (e.g., Cruz et al. 2003, 2007; Reid et al. 2008; Kirkpatrick et al. 2008), with low-gravity signatures identified in their discovery spectra or followup studies (e.g. Cruz et al. 2009; Allers &amp; Liu 2013a). We included the young L dwarf binary SDSS J2249+0044AB, which has signs of low gravity in the near-IR spectrum presented by Nakajima et al. (2004) and has been resolved into a tight binary by Allers et al. (2010). We also included the extremely red young L dwarf PSO J318.5−22 discovered from our ultracool dwarf search using Pan-STARRS; this parallax has already been published in Liu et al. (2013b), and a slightly revised parallax and proper motion based on a larger dataset are presented here. Also, we added two L dwarf companions to young stars, G 196-3B (Rebolo et al. 1998) and LP 261-75B (Reid &amp; Walkowicz 2006). The former was included for its known low-gravity spectrum (e.g. Rebolo et al. 1998; McGovern et al. 2004). The latter was included as its primary star (LP 261-75A, NLTT 22741) is young (≈100-200 Myr [Reid &amp; Walkowicz 2006], ≈40-300 Myr [Shkolnik et al. 2009]), though in the end we classified the near-IR spectrum of LP 261-7B as field gravity (see Appendix). In fact, the M4.5 primary LP 261-75A was the target of our CFHT observations, so we used a narrow-band filter to observe this system. The same data also yielded a parallax for LP 261-75B, albeit with 2× larger uncertainties than for the primary. In total, our 44 young field objects in 42 systems represent a 4× larger sample than targeted by previous parallax studies of such objects (Faherty et al. 2012; Zapatero Osorio et al. 2014). • Candidate stellar association members (12 objects): We targeted a smaller sample of ultracool dwarfs proposed as members of open clusters and moving groups, for the purpose of assessing their membership and/or establishing them as age-calibrated benchmark objects. These candidates have been identified based on their common kinematics with the stellar members of these groups. As these were drawn from different sources, the candidacy criteria differs in construction and stringency. The two sources from the TW Hya Association (TWA; ≈10 Myr [e.g., Weinberger et al. 2013; Ducourant et al. 2014]) had already been strongly confirmed as members based on their kinematics (Mamajek 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008) and corroborated to be young based Recently, Filippazzo et al. (2015) reported a similar trend in the J-band magnitudes of young late-M to late-L dwarfs as seen in our CFHT sample. (Note that a significant fraction of their sample relied on kinematic distances, rather than parallaxes.) They found that their young sequence and field sequence cross at a spectral type of L0, whereas our vl-g and field sequences cross at a spectral 9 Note that the summary plots in Wahhaj et al. and Faherty et al. both show the young L0 companion AB Pic b (Chauvin et al. 2005b) as being significantly fainter in J band than the field sequence. However, improved photometry by Biller et al. (2013) produces a brighter flux for AB Pic b, leading to a less anomalous appearance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Observational studies of brown dwarfs have been inspired by two complementary perspectives. One has been the desire to expand the parameter space of classical stellar astrophysics. Brown dwarfs are the lowest mass products of the star formation process and thus represent the terminus of the mass function that has been well-mapped for hydrogen-burning stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Chabrier 2005</ref>). Similarly, the ultracool temperatures of field brown dwarfs extend spectral classification from the late-M dwarfs into the new regimes of the L, T, and Y dwarfs (T eff ≈ 2500 to 300 K; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Kirkpatrick 2005</ref>). There has been sustained progress over the last ≈15 years in exploring ever lower masses and temperatures, in large part thanks to wide-area digital sky surveys sensitive to such cool objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Delfosse et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Kirkpatrick et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Chiu et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Burningham et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Reylé et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Best et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The second perspective has been the connection between brown dwarfs and gas-giant planets, both planets in our own solar system and around other stars. This has been an equally powerful inspiration -indeed, the interpretation of the first unambiguous brown dwarf Gl 229B ( <ref type="bibr">Nakajima et al. 1995</ref>) was guided by its spectral similarity to the planet Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr">Oppenheimer et al. 1995</ref>). However, in contrast to the numerous connections with stellar astronomy, observations in common between the brown dwarf and exoplanet populations have been far more limited. The underlying cause is that magnitudes, colors, and spectra are the most accessible measurements for brown dwarfs but the least accessible ones for exoplanets. In addition, for the case of planets in our own solar system, the gap between them and brown dwarfs is substantial. Jupiter (124 K; <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Hanel et al. 1981</ref>) is much cooler than the coldest known brown dwarf WISE J085510.83−071442.5 (≈250 K; Luhman 2014), which is itself much cooler than the next coolest known brown dwarfs at ≈350-400 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Luhman et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Dupuy &amp; Kraus 2013)</ref>. This range of effective temperature corresponds to a factor of ∼100 in luminosity.</p><p>Direct detection of young gas-giant exoplanets is now strengthening the link between the exoplanet and brown dwarf populations, enriching our understanding of both classes of objects. Young (100 Myr) planetary-mass (13 M Jup ) companions have been discovered over a wide range of separations, luminosities, and mass ratios with respect to the host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Chauvin et al. 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Luhman et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Lafrenì ere et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Lagrange et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Ireland et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Janson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Carson et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Kuzuhara et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Rameau et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bailey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Macintosh et al. 2015</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Gauza et al. 2015</ref>), possibly suggesting a range of origins for these systems. The inferred temperatures for these objects amply overlap the known brown dwarf census, but the young ages mean these companions have significantly lower surface gravities. The HR 8799 system has been particularly illuminating as it is the only directly imaged multi-planet system <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Marois et al. 2010)</ref>, and the planets possess extreme photospheric properties compared to previously known substellar objects. Their absolute magnitudes and inferred effective temperatures (T eff ≈ 1000 K) overlap field T dwarfs, which are cloud-poor and methane-rich. But the planets' infrared photometry and spectra indicate the presence of very cloudy photospheres and weak methane, stemming from the lower surface gravity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Marois et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Hinz et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bowler et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Currie et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Barman et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Skemer et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Skemer et al. , 2014</ref>). Theoretical work (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Barman et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Marley et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Lee et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zahnle &amp; Marley 2014</ref>) has helped provide physical context for direct imaging observations. But we are still faced with the conundrum of how to integrate young gas-giant planets and field brown dwarfs into a common understanding of substellar evolution.</p><p>A promising approach to understanding such low-gravity ultracool atmospheres is to identify the analogs of young exoplanets among the field brown dwarf census. The initial mass functions in the young star-forming clusters appear to go down to a few Jupiter masses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Lodieu et al. 2008)</ref>, and thus such low-mass objects should be found in the field after departing their birth sites. For objects of spectral type L (T eff ≈ 1300 − 2300 K; <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Golimowski et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stephens et al. 2009</ref>), a field object of typical age (≈1-5 Gyr) has a mass of ≈40-80 M Jup according to evolutionary models <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Chabrier et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley 2008)</ref>. But for the same temperature, an age of 10-100 Myr corresponds to an object of 6-40 M Jup , encompassing the planetary-mass regime (13 M Jup ). Such young field objects will have larger radii and, combined with their lower masses, this means a reduction in surface gravity by a factor of ∼10 compared to older field objects. Evolutionary models predict that brown dwarf radii become nearly constant at ages of 300 Myr, which sets an approximate upper age limit for field objects displaying signatures of low gravity.</p><p>Young objects are expected to be a small minority population in the field and can be identified primarily in three ways. (1) The first young field L dwarf, G196-3B, was found in seeing-limited imaging as a wide companion to a star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rebolo et al. 1998</ref>). Such imaging surveys have now uncovered ≈20 brown dwarfs as bound companions to young (≈10-300 Myr) field stars in seeing-limited data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Kirkpatrick et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Reid &amp; Walkowicz 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Goldman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Huélamo et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naud et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Gauza et al. 2015</ref>), space-based imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Lowrance et al. 1999</ref>), and ground-based adaptive optics imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">(Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2005b,a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Biller et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Delorme et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bowler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Carson et al. 2013;</ref>). (2) Young objects can be distinguished from older objects as their lower surface gravities are manifested as differences in their optical and near-infrared (IR) spectra compared to field objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Martín et al. 1999b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Lucas et al. 2001</ref>). Among the spectroscopic studies of hundreds of ultracool dwarfs from wide-field surveys, a small fraction of young late-M and L dwarfs have been identified in this fashion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Reid et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cruz et al. 2009</ref>; Allers &amp; Liu 2013a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Liu et al. 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Best et al. 2015</ref>), with implied masses down to ≈7 M Jup . (3) Finally, there have been significant recent efforts to find young ultracool dwarfs in the nearest young moving groups through kinematic and stellar-activity criteria (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Shkolnik et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Shkolnik et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Rodriguez et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Schlieder et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Malo et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Kraus et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Gagné et al. 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aller et al. 2016</ref>). For such objects, their ages can be assigned using the ages of the higher mass stellar members derived from theoretical isochrones and/or lithium depletion boundaries.</p><p>Parallactic distances for young brown dwarfs are critical for directly establishing basic properties like absolute magnitudes and bolometric magnitudes. Given their younger ages, it may not be appropriate to derive photometric distances using relations between absolute magnitude and spectral type established for field objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Vrba et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In addition, high-quality parallaxes and proper motions allow for more stringent assessments of membership in young moving groups than possible with spectrophotometric distances alone. Previous work has produced parallaxes for relatively small samples of low-gravity ultracool dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. 2012</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Liu et al. 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zapatero Osorio et al. 2014</ref>). This work has resulted in discordant conclusions regarding spectrophotometric trends, such as whether young L dwarfs are brighter, fainter, or similar to field objects at JHK bands. To date, with the exception of late-M dwarfs in the TW Hydrae Association (TWA), only a handful of free-floating ultracool dwarfs have membership in a young moving group validated by a measured parallax and radial velocity <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. 2013a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Gizis et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Gagné et al. 2015</ref>). Furthermore, the codification of near-IR spectral types and gravity indicators for M and L dwarfs by Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) enables a rigorous investigation of the spectrophotometric properties of low-gravity ultracool dwarfs using a uniform classification system.</p><p>We present here a large sample of high-precision parallaxes for young ultracool field dwarfs, based on our ongoing astrometric monitoring program at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The immediate aims of this effort are to provide distances for these objects and to compare their spectrophotometric properties to the field population. Preliminary results from this work for a smaller set of objects were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Liu et al. (2013a)</ref>, where we showed for the first time that young field objects form a separate sequence on the near-IR color-magnitude diagram, residing redder and/or brighter than the field population. We revisit this work with a much larger sample of parallaxes, supplemented with a uniform analysis of near-IR spectral type and gravity classifications using the methods of . We also perform a uniform assessment of membership in canonical young moving groups for the entire known sample of young ultracool dwarfs with parallaxes. The broader goal of our work is to critically examine this intriguing class of brown dwarfs as empirical analogs for directly imaged exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>Since 2007, we have been carrying out a high-precision parallax program at the 3.6-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) using the facility wide-field IR camera WIRCam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Puget et al. 2004</ref>). CFHT offers an excellent platform for parallax work, given its combination of large aperture, excellent seeing, and queue scheduling, though to our knowledge it had not been used to measure IR parallaxes prior to our program. Our initial motivation was to determine accurate distances to ultracool binaries, which can be used to directly measure dynamical masses when parallaxes are combined with visual orbit determinations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Liu et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Dupuy et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Dupuy et al. 2015</ref>). This goal compelled us to establish observing protocols and data reduction methods to achieve the best possible accuracy, since the total dynamical mass scales with the cube of the binary distance via Kepler's Third Law.</p><p>After a few seasons of observations, it became apparent that the CFHT/WIRCam was incredibly effective for IR parallaxes. Thus, we expanded the scope of our program to other interesting classes of ultracool dwarfs. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>, our measurements are as good as have ever been achieved in the near-IR, producing parallaxes with typical uncertainties of 1.3 mas and as good as 0.7 mas, but for objects ≈2-3 mags fainter than have been measured by previous parallax programs. This combination of faint limiting magnitudes and high precision naturally lends itself to two broad classes of targets: (1) extremely low-luminosity late-type brown dwarfs, as illustrated by our IR parallax to the J = 19.7 mag T9 binary CFBDS J1458+1013AB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Liu et al. 2011a</ref> and updated in Dupuy &amp; Liu 2012), and (2) more distant objects, where the same small uncertainties needed for nearby binaries can benefit science cases that need only moderate S/N distances. The latter is relevant for studying young field brown dwarfs. Since such objects are a small minority population (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. 2008</ref> find that 8% ± 2% of field L dwarf are younger than ≈100 Myr), their typical distances will be larger than those of older field objects. Furthermore, the known stellar members of even the youngest and nearest moving groups can extended to distances of ≈60 pc (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. 2008)</ref>. This is quite distant compared to previous brown dwarf parallax programs -in comparison, among ≥L4 dwarfs, no objects had high precision (≤ 3%) parallaxes beyond 13 pc prior to our CFHT effort. on their low-gravity spectra. We included one T dwarf candidate in the Hyades cluster (≈600-800 Myr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Perryman et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Brandt &amp; Huang 2015)</ref> identified in a proper motion search by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bouvier et al. (2008)</ref>.</p><p>Our remaining objects were flagged by <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Seifahrt et al. (2010)</ref> as candidates of the nearby moving groups studied by <ref type="bibr">Montes et al. (2001)</ref>: the Pleiades (1 object; 130±20 Myr [Barrado y <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Navascués et al. 2004]</ref>), Ursa Majoris (2 objects; ≈400-500 Myr <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[King et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Jones et al. 2015]</ref>), and Hyades (4 objects; ≈600-800 Myr) moving groups. Note that these are not the open clusters themselves, but rather more dispersed stars claimed to be coeval with the clusters.</p><p>This sample contains 12 objects in 10 systems, with DENIS J1441−0945AB and DENIS J2200−3038AB being binaries. For the latter, we were able to measure parallaxes to each individual component (see Appendix).</p><p>• Extremely red ultracool dwarfs (8 objects): A small number of field objects have extremely red near-IR colors and peculiar near-IR spectra. The original archetype for this genre is 2MASS J2244+2043, which has an ordinary L6.5-type optical spectrum but a very unusual near-IR spectrum, distinguished by its much redder color, stronger CO, and more peaked H-band continuum shape compared to other field objects <ref type="bibr">McLean et al. 2003</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> and  have concluded this is in fact a young field object, as opposed to being a ordinary (high gravity) object with extreme cloud properties. However, since its discovery, about a dozen similarly red objects have been identified that do not appear to be low gravity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. 2008b</ref> [though see Appendix for discussion of 2MASS J2148+4003]; <ref type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Mace et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Marocco et al. 2014</ref>). Instead their extreme colors are thought to be due to high gravity (i.e., old age) and/or metallicity. Parallaxes for eight of these objects are presented here, as these objects are valuable laboratories for understanding the extrema of ultracool atmospheres.</p><p>• Strong Hα emitters (3+1 objects): Strong line emission from L dwarfs is uncommon. Unlike for earlier M-type objects, Hα emission is not necessarily a diagnostic of youth (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Schmidt et al. 2015</ref>). Nevertheless we included three objects with strong Hα emission in our program to help better diagnose these objects, including one object with a close T7.5 companion (2MASS J1315−2649AB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Burgasser et al. 2011</ref>). Note that a fourth object known to have strong and variable Hα emission, 2MASS J1022+5825 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Schmidt et al. 2007)</ref>, was already included in our low-gravity sample (β in the optical but fld-g in the near-IR). <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 1</ref> details the full sample of 67 ultracool objects in 63 systems, including youth properties. All but one of our targets have near-IR spectra, mostly from published work and a few obtained by us (Section 2.3). (The exception is the young M4.5 primary LP 261-75A, whose early spectral type removes it from our subsequent analysis.) This complete spectroscopic dataset allows the entire sample analyzed in this paper, both objects with parallaxes from our CFHT program and those from the literature (Section 2.5), to be spectrally classified in a homogeneous fashion using the Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) system (Section 2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">CFHT Parallaxes</head><p>Our analysis methods for obtaining high-precision astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam images are described in detail in Section 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>. Briefly, we obtain many dithered images (average of 21) at each observing epoch, thereby achieving a median standard error per epoch of 3.6 mas for targets presented here. Targets are observed on each WIRCam run if they fulfill strict airmass constraints, needed to reduce differential chromatic refraction to a level below the astrometric noise. We began observing the majority of the sample presented here in mid-2009, except for SDSS J2249+0044AB which was started in mid-2008 and several objects that we added to our program during <ref type="bibr">2010-2013.</ref> Images were obtained in J band for most of our targets, while brighter targets at risk of saturating in the WIRCam minimum integration time (5 s) were observed in a narrow K-band filter (K H2 ) centered at 2.122 µm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 1</ref> summarizes our target list and the details of our observations for each target such as the seeing (median of 0.63 ′′ , full range of 0.50-0.85 ′′ ), number of epochs, time baseline, number of reference stars (S/N&gt; 10), and the mean parallax for the reference stars determined from the Besançon model of the Galaxy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Robin et al. 2003</ref>) as described in Section 2.4.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>. In addition, we now derive proper motion corrections also from the Besançon model of the Galaxy in a similar manner as the parallax correction, using the median proper motion of modeled stars as the correction and computing the uncertainty in this correction through a Monte Carlo simulation of sampling variance given our finite number of reference stars. These proper motion corrections are small, with a median amplitude of 2.5 mas yr −1 , but necessary for accurately computing space motions.</p><p>We derived astrometric parameters and their uncertainties from our data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_56">Figure 1</ref> plots the results, and the parallax and proper motion values are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>, along with the χ 2 of the best-fit solutions. In all cases χ 2 is commensurate with the degrees of freedom and thus validates the accuracy of the astrometric errors used in our analysis, which are simply the standard error of the position measured across multiple dithers at a given epoch. We report parallaxes and proper motions both as relative values (i.e., the direct output of our MCMC analysis) and absolute values (i.e., corrected for the parallax and proper motion of our reference grid). The median absolute parallax uncertainty for the sample presented here is 1.4 mas (5.0% uncertainty in distance), with a best precision of 0.8 mas (1.0%) and 90% have errors of 1.0-2.1 mas. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2</ref> summarizes all parallaxes measured to date for ultracool dwarfs by us and other programs, illustrating CFHT's excellent combination of small parallax errors and faint limiting magnitudes.</p><p>Our astrometry pipeline automatically detects any object in the field with a significant parallax by comparing the χ 2 of astrometric solutions where the parallax was fixed to zero or freely fitted. Normally this simply allows for easy identification of our targets, but occasionally we find other objects in the field with significant parallaxes. We found two such objects in the sample presented here, LP 415-22 2 (π abs = 13.0 ± 1.6 mas, M K = 6.49 ± 0.26 mag) and 2MASS J07521548+1614237 (π abs = 13.2 ± 1.4 mas, M K = 8.76 ± 0.23 mag), and their astrometric solutions are included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>. Based on the photometric relationship with spectral type from <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref>, we estimate spectral types of M3 for LP 415-22 and M6 for 2MASS J07521548+1614237.</p></div>

We used the facility spectrograph SpeX ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Rayner et al. 2003</ref>) in prism mode with the 0.5 ′′ slit, which provided an average spectral resolution (R ≡ ∆λ/λ) of ≈150. We dithered in an ABBA pattern on the science target to enable sky subtraction during the reduction process. We obtained calibration frames (arcs and flats) and observed an A0 V star contemporaneously for telluric calibration of each object.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Spectral Typing and Gravity Classification</head><p>For consistency, we classify the near-IR spectra of all M5-L7 dwarfs in our sample using the system developed by <ref type="bibr">Allers &amp; Liu (2013a, hereinafter AL13</ref>). The AL13 classification system includes a gravity-independent determination of spectral type, followed by a classification of the surface gravity of the object. First, a combination of visual comparison to field standards as well as spectral indices is used to determine the near-IR spectral type. These generally agree with optical spectral types to better than 1 subtype. Then given an object's near-IR spectral type, indices and equivalent widths for gravity-sensitive features (VO, FeH, K I, Na I, and the H-band continuum shape) are used to classify the gravity of the object as vl-g (very low), int-g (intermediate), or fld-g (field). As noted in AL13, the gravity classifications of vl-g, int-g, and fld-g roughly correspond to ages of <ref type="bibr">30 Myr, ∼30-200 Myr, and 200</ref> Myr, respectively. The near-IR gravity classifications of vl-g, int-g, and fld-g are designed to agree with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cruz et al. (2009)</ref> optical classifications of γ, β, and α, respectively. The majority of our sample have classifications already published in the AL13 system. For the remaining objects, we determine the spectral type and gravity <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">(Table 4)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 1</ref> gives the near-IR spectral types and gravity classifications on the AL13 system for our entire sample of M5-L7 objects. Unless stated otherwise, these types and classifications are used throughout the paper.</p><p>The AL13 method of spectral typing is only valid for objects with spectral types of L7 and earlier. To determine near-IR spectral types for the three late-L and early-T dwarfs in our sample (WISE J0206+2640, CFHT-Hy-20 and WISE J0754+7909), we compute the set of flux indices defined by  and assign spectral types to each resulting index based on the Burgasser (2007) polynomial fits ( <ref type="table">Table 5)</ref>. Each object has four of the indices with values suitable for this purpose. We average the spectral types from the four usable indices and compute an overall index-based type, with the RMS of the spectral types quoted as the uncertainty. We also visually compared these objects to spectral standards from . (For the T3 subclass, the original standard 2MASS J1209−10 has since been found to be a binary with estimated component types of T2+T7.5, so we also compared with the T3 dwarf SDSS J1206+28 [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Liu et al. 2010]</ref>.) There is no established system for identifying low-gravity features for late-L and early-T dwarfs, 3 so this information is not available for such objects in our sample. The Appendix discusses the typing results for each of these three objects.</p></div>

In brief, we measure binary parameters using a three-component Gaussian representation of the point-spread function and use the RMS of the dithered images to determine our measurement uncertainties. We measured flux ratios of ∆Y NIRC2 = 0.32 ± 0.06 mag, ∆J MKO = 0.250 ± 0.016 mag, ∆H MKO = 0.232 ± 0.014 mag, and ∆K MKO = 0.200 ± 0.010 mag. Given the nearly equal magnitudes and colors of the components, we assume that within the measurement errors here ∆Y NIRC2 = ∆Y MKO , ∆J MKO = ∆J 2MASS , ∆H MKO = ∆H 2MASS , and ∆K MKO = ∆K S,2MASS .

Also, young companion objects included in our study have largely been identified with AO imaging. For the objects lacking high angular resolution imaging, the low intrinsic binary frequency among field ultracool dwarfs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Duchêne &amp; Kraus 2013)</ref> suggests few undetected binaries, especially when accounting for the decline in binary frequency with stellar mass. (The young ages of our targets mean they are lower mass than old field objects of similar spectral type.) Overall, unresolved binarity is unlikely to be an important factor in our analysis.</p></div>

Only LP 261-75B is not resolved from its primary in the WISE data. In order to create a homogeneous collection of near-infrared photometry, we have supplemented these published results with synthesized photometry. All of our targets have spectra published either here or elsewhere, and we use these to compute 2MASS-MKO photometric conversions for each object as well as synthetic Y − J colors. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>, we assume the synthesized colors within a given bandpass (e.g., J 2MASS − J MKO ) are errorless and assume an error of 0.05 mag for the synthesized Y − J colors. The young binary SDSS J2249+0044AB has published K-band flux ratios in both 2MASS and MKO systems but J-and H-band flux ratios reported only in the MKO system (∆J MKO = 1.024 ± 0.016 mag and ∆H MKO = 0.953 ± 0.009 mag; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Allers et al. 2010</ref>).

We supplemented the published photometry for this extended sample in the same way as our main sample, using published spectra to compute synthesized photometry when available. For objects without published spectra, we estimated 2MASS-MKO photometric conversions from other objects with similar spectral types or absolute magnitudes. We expect these estimates to be reasonably accurate as, e.g., over our entire sample the differences in these corrections vary by ±0.06 mag or less in any one band.

As can be seen from the histograms of parallaxes differences in σ in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Figure 4</ref>, all of the most extreme outliers are from the programs of <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> and Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>. We now consider all of the &gt;2σ outliers individually, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and in the end we decide to use our parallaxes for all these cases (except for 2MASS J1139−3159).</p><p>2MASSW J0033239−152131. Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 24.8 ± 2.5 mas, and we find a value 5.8σ different, 42.8 ± 1.8 mas. The total proper motion of this object is 300.6 ± 2.3 mas yr −1 , and our RA and Dec proper motions both agree to better than 4 mas yr −1 with those reported by Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>. In this case, our parallax seems to resolve an anomaly that Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> found when placing 2MASSW J0033−1521 on their H-R diagram that used a spectral type-based T eff and parallax-based luminosity. They found that this object appeared to have an age of &lt;10 Myr and thereby a mass well below the lithium fusion limit, but it has a clear non-detection of lithium absorption (&lt;1Å&lt;1Å; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cruz et al. 2009</ref>). It also does not display evidence of very low surface gravity (i.e., γ, δ, or vl-g) as might be expected for such a young object, rather it is classified as <ref type="bibr">L4β (Cruz et al. 2009</ref>) in the optical and L1 fld-g (Allers &amp; Liu 2013a) in the near-infrared (see Appendix). Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> note that their parallax could be the cause of the problem, as a closer distance would reconcile the H-R diagram position and lack of lithium, and our parallax does indicate a much closer distance. We thereore use our parallax for this object. 2MASSW J0045214+163445. Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 57.3 ± 2.0 mas, and we find a value 3.6σ different, 65.9 ± 1.3 mas. Our proper motions agree reasonably well within their quoted errors (≈16 mas yr −1 or 1.5σ). Our correction from relative to absolute parallax is only 1.56 ± 0.20 mas and thus not sufficient to explain why our parallax is 8.6 mas larger. We share all 10 objects from Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> in common with our program, and as noted above there is at least one other case (2MASS J0033−1521) where the Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> parallax is likely to be in error. In contrast, the 15 parallax measurements we have in common with programs other than <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> and Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> have no &gt;2σ outliers. We therefore use our own parallax for 2MASSW J0045+1634.</p><p>GJ 3276 (a.k.a. 2MASS J04221413+1530525). <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 24.8 ± 3.1 mas and a relative proper motion of (−17.2 ± 2.7, 7.4 ± 2.6) mas yr −1 . However, we find only a marginally significant relative parallax detection of 2.6±1.0 mas, from which we compute an absolute parallax of 3.9 ± 1.0 mas. We also do not detect a significant relative proper motion, finding (1.4 ± 1.5, 1.8 ± 1.4) mas yr −1 . Thus our parallax is 6.4σ discrepant from <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref>, and the total proper motion is different by 16 mas yr −1 . We believe this is unlikely to be a case of mistaken identity, as we observe no other stars near GJ 3276 in our CFHT imaging with ≈0. ′′ 5 seeing, and there are no other objects in the field with a similar parallax or proper motion. We automatically detect any sources with significant parallaxes in each field, and this field did have one such detection (LP 415-22, 4. ′ 1 away from GJ 3276), but its parallax (13.2 ± 1.5 mas) and total proper motion (112.5 ± 1.7 mas yr −1 ) are also inconsistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref>.  note that this the spectrum of GJ 3276 is particularly red for its spectral type and report a reddening of A V = 4.6 mag. They also note that it is only ∼10 • from the Taurus star-forming region on the sky and thus may be behind or embedded in interstellar material. Either of these scenarios is consistent with our parallax, which places it at or behind the distance of Taurus within 2σ. Such reddening would be more challenging to explain using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> parallactic distance of ≈40 pc. Thus, we favor our parallax for this object, but given its low S/N we do not end up including it in the analysis that follows.</p><p>2MASS J05012406−0010452. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 76.4 ± 4.8 mas, and we find a value 5.6σ different, 48.4 ± 1.4 mas. Like GJ 3276 above, our value is ≈20 mas smaller than the <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> value. Our two proper motions agree reasonably well (&lt;10 mas yr −1 ) for this object that has a total motion of 236 mas yr −1 . Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> also report a parallax for this object, 51.0 ± 3.7 mas, which agrees with ours at 0.7σ, and proper motions that also agree well (1 mas yr −1 ). Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> note this parallax discrepancy and show that 2MASS J0501−0010 would be unique among objects of its spectral type, i.e., much fainter than the field sequence or other low-gravity objects, if the <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> parallax is used. Therefore, we use our parallax, consistent with but more precise than that of Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>LP261-75B (2MASS J09510549+3558021). <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Vrba et al. (2004)</ref> reported a preliminary absolute parallax of 16.1 ± 7.4 mas, and we find a value 2.1σ different, 31.6 ± 1.3 mas. Our proper motions agree well (3-6 mas yr −1 ) for this object with a total motion of 189 mas yr −1 . An updated parallax distance of 33.0 +2.8 −2.4 pc from Vrba et al. is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bowler et al. (2013)</ref>, which is in excellent agreement with our parallax distance. Therefore, we do not consider this object a &gt;2σ outlier in the end, and we use our parallax in the following analysis.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 35.1 ± 4.3 mas, and we find a value 2.5σ different, 23.7 ± 1.6 mas. Our proper motions are also somewhat discrepant at 10-20 mas yr −1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Weinberger et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Ducourant et al. (2014)</ref> also report parallaxes for this object of 23.8 ± 2.6 mas and 26.2 ± 1.1 mas, respectively, which agree with ours at 0.1σ and 1.3σ (as does the Mamajek 2005 kinematic parallax of 25.0 ± 2.5 mas). Their proper motions also agree with ours at 6 mas yr −1 . We use the Ducourant et al. result, given its somewhat higher precision than our CFHT result and the fact that this group has measured parallaxes for several other TWA members using the same methods. 2MASSW J2208136+292121. Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> report an absolute parallax of 21.2 ± 0.7 mas, and we find a value 2.2σ different, 25.1 ± 1.6 mas. This marginal discrepancy is largely driven by the very small quoted parallax error of Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>. Our proper motions agree reasonably well (&lt;10 mas yr −1 ) for this object with a total motion of 96 mas yr −1 . Our correction from relative to absolute parallax is 0.85 ± 0.04 mas, which is slightly larger than the quoted parallax error from Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> and slightly smaller than their adopted correction of 1.0 mas. Given that 2 of 10 objects from Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> are ≈4-6σ (≈10-20 mas) outliers, we are reluctant to take their very small quoted parallax uncertainty of 0.7 mas for 2MASS J2208+2921 at face value. Therefore, we use our own parallax value in the following analysis.</p><p>To summarize, our parallax sample overlaps with 10 out of 15 young objects from <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Faherty et al. ( , 2013</ref>, 7 the entire sample of 10 objects from Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>, and 15 measurements from various other programs <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table 8</ref>). The only &gt;2σ outliers in this sample come from <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> and Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>, and for the three largest discrepancies (&gt;5σ) our new parallaxes seem to resolve standing problems with the interpretation of those objects. One of the other &gt;2σ discrepant objects, 2MASS J1139−3159, has two independent parallaxes in the literature that agree with ours. For all of these overlapping cases except 2MASS J1139−3159, in the end we choose to use our CFHT parallaxes, which has the added benefit of internal consistency for the handling of systematic effects such as the correction from relative to absolute parallax and proper motion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Kinematic Distances</head><p>Given prior knowledge of the expected space motions of stars, such as membership in co-moving associations, distance estimates are possible for objects that have some kinematic information (proper motion and/or radial velocity). Such kinematic distance estimates exist in the literature for a number of our targets, either because they have been proposed as members of young moving <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Of the 5 non-overlapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al.

The remaining 3 parallaxes appear to be problematic (Section 2.5.3) and thus are excluded from our analysis.</p><p>groups or through a kinematic model of the solar neighborhood. The most homogeneous and complete collection of such kinematic distances for our ultracool dwarf sample comes from the BANYAN II analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Malo et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. 2014b</ref>). (Note that subsequent BANYAN II analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. 2015a</ref> does not publish independent kinematic distances.) We now compare our trigonometric parallax distances to these kinematic distance estimates. We also compare our TWA parallaxes to the kinematic distances from <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Mamajek (2005)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> presents the complete list of overlapping objects.</p><p>Overall, the kinematic distances are reasonably consistent with parallax distances within the quoted uncertainties, with 50% of BANYAN II distances agreeing within 1.2σ and 90% agreeing within 2.3σ. In terms of absolute fractional difference, 50% of BANYAN II kinematic distances are within 20% of the parallax distance, with the other half being more discrepant. (Note that the typical parallax error is much smaller than this: the median fractional error for the CFHT sample is 6%.) In fact, for the best studied groups (TWA, β Pic, AB Dor, Tuc-Hor), there are no &gt;2σ outliers out of a sample of 11 objects. However, outliers are present in the larger sample, and we find that SIMP J2154−1055 is significantly more distant (2.9σ, 28%) than predicted from its kinematic distance based on Argus membership ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Gagné et al. 2014a</ref>). Other candidate group members with &gt;2σ or &gt;50% discrepancies are 2MASS J0045+1634 (Argus) and 2MASS J0619−2903 (Columba). All four TWA and Tuc-Hor proposed members that have CFHT parallaxes are consistent at &lt;1σ and 5%-10% with kinematic distances from <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Mamajek (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>.</p><p>For objects identified to belong to the "young field" population by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>, there is a significant preference for kinematic distances to be larger than parallax distances ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">Figure 5</ref>). The median offset is +11% with a dispersion of ±37%. In terms of the absolute value of the fractional difference, the median offset for the young field sample is 25%. The rate of highly discrepant BANYAN II kinematic distances (&gt;2.5σ, &gt;60% fractional offset) is 10% for the whole sample. The largest of these discrepancies seem to only occur for the young field population. For example, we find that 2MASS J0435−1414 is at 88 +9 −12 pc while Gagné et al. (2014b) report 10.5 ± 1.6 pc. Another large difference in the opposite direction is for 2MASS J1711+2326 that we place at 32.7 +1.7 −1.9 pc but for which <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> estimate to be at 53 +7 −6 pc. In summary, we find that BANYAN II kinematic distances are generally not as accurate as their quoted precision of 8% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. 2014b</ref>), with 50% of kinematic distances being ≥20% different from parallactic distances. Kinematic distances for young field objects seem to be systematically overestimated by 11%, with an RMS dispersion of 37% with respect to the parallactic distances, and have a failure rate (i.e., values that are &gt;2.5σ, &gt;60% discrepant) of ≈10%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Absolute Magnitudes</head><p>Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the absolute magnitudes of our sample in the standard 2MASS, MKO, and WISE infrared bandpasses as a function of Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) near-IR spectral type and gravity classifications, applicable for objects down to L7. (Later-type objects are discussion in Section 4.7.) While there are many possible criteria for partitioning our sample, near-IR spectral type and gravity classification are the only spectroscopic properties available for all our CFHT targets. Also, surface gravity is the key defining characteristic of this young sample, so it is natural to examine how reduced gravity impacts the photometry of ultracool dwarfs.</p><p>The figures also show the loci of field ultracool dwarfs for comparison. Because our sample is predominantly composed of late-M and L dwarfs, which change monotonically in absolute magnitude with spectral type, we derive new linear relations to represent the M6-L8 field population, instead of using the higher-order polynomials from Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012) which were derived for a much larger range in spectral type. (In particular, the near-IR magnitudes become non-monotonic in the L/T transition. This leads to curvature in the polynomial fits, and thus the higher-order fits do not track the behavior of the earlier L dwarfs as well as linear fits.) Also, our complete young sample has near-IR spectral types, and thus we would like to compare with a field relation based solely on near-IR types (unlike the relations of Dupuy &amp; Liu 2012, which used optical types for M and L dwarfs when available, though the effect of their inclusion is small). For our field data, we used the IDL structure posted at the Database of Ultracool Parallaxes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">8</ref> which includes the comprehensive summary of <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref> along with more recent published parallaxes and photometry for ultracool dwarfs (M6 and later). In order to use only normal field objects with high-quality absolute magnitudes, we excluded anything without null in the IDL structure's flag tag (which excludes, e.g., subdwarfs and young objects), with a peculiar optical or infrared spectral type noted in the osptstr or isptstr tags, or with a S/N &lt; 10 parallax. We then used the least absolute deviation method (LADFIT in IDL) to compute robust linear fits of absolute magnitude as a function of infrared spectral type for objects having spectral types of M6 to L8. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref> reports the coefficients of these fits along with the RMS about the fit. Note that the RMS does vary with spectral type range so a single number is not fully representative (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 27</ref> of Dupuy &amp; Liu 2012 and discussion below.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">General Trends in Absolute Magnitudes with Spectral Type and Gravity</head><p>Our data reveal three main trends in the behavior of the near-IR (Y JHK) absolute magnitudes.</p><p>1. In a given bandpass, the loci of young objects relative to the field follows a consistent pattern, with young late-M dwarfs being brighter than the field, young early-L (≈L0-L2) dwarfs being comparable, and young mid/late-L (L3) dwarfs being fainter than the field sequence. This is in accord with the preliminary J-band results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Liu et al. (2013a)</ref>.</p><p>2. The offset of the young objects relative to the field sequence (brighter at earlier types, fainter at later types) is more dramatic at bluer wavelengths. At Y and J bands, the young late-M's and late-L's can be ≈2 magnitudes offset from the field sequence, whereas at K band most L dwarfs are comparable to the field.</p><p>3. The low-gravity (vl-g) population is more distinct from the field objects than the intermediategravity (int-g) population, especially for the late-L dwarfs, though individual young objects of both gravity classifications do overlap. To highlight the differences between each other and the field, Figures 6, 7, and 8 include robust linear fits to the vl-g and int-g samples, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref> gives the fitted coefficients.</p><p>The first two trends have been noted in earlier studies of young ultracool dwarfs using smaller samples and more heterogenous spectra classifications, though not as conclusively. (1) Based on the companions to young (≈10-500 Myr) stars known at the time,  showed that young late-L dwarfs were always fainter than the field sequence, but that young early/mid-L dwarfs could be brighter or fainter, broadly consistent with our results presented here. The spectral types available for their companion sample was of variable quality, perhaps enhancing the scatter in the absolute-magnitude relations. (2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Faherty et al. (2013)</ref> found that most young L dwarfs are fainter than the field sequence in J band, by up to 1 mag, based on their own IR parallaxes for a comparable sample of young field objects. This result is not confirmed with our CFHT sample: while some of the young L dwarfs show such a large offset, many are comparable to the field sequence. 9 (3) Finally, Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref> found most of the young early/mid L dwarfs in their IR parallax sample are comparable or brighter than the field sequence (i.e., the opposite of Faherty et al.), whereas our CFHT results do not find brighter objects except among the earliest L dwarfs. To summarize, while young late-L dwarfs have long been recognized as being fainter at J band than the field, previous studies of young early/mid-L dwarfs have been inconsistent. The large sample and high precision of our CFHT sample now affords a clear view of the spectrophotometric trends. type of L2. This small discrepancy may be due to our separate analysis of vl-g and int-g samples whereas Filippazzo et al. consider all young objects as a single sample, or due to slightly different definitions of the field sequence (see below). In addition, Filippazzo et al. find young objects have brighter W 2 magnitudes than the field sequence at all spectral types, in accord with our results.</p><p>In the WISE mid-IR bandpasses, the young targets appear generally to be brighter than the field sequence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">Figure 8</ref>, especially among the young early/mid-L dwarfs. There may be a more clear distinction between the loci of int-g and vl-g L dwarfs than seen at shorter wavelengths, with the vl-g objects being systematically brighter in the mid-IR than int-g, and similarly between int-g and fld-g.</p><p>Many of our objects have optical spectra, so <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">Figure 9</ref> shows the absolute-magnitude trends using optical spectral types from the literature. Many of the objects also have optical gravity classifications, or at least reported signatures of youth in the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Reid et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cruz et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Shkolnik et al. 2009;</ref>). The overall behavior of the young objects relative to the field sequence is the same for optical and near-IR spectral types. (Note that optical types for L dwarfs only go down to L8, while near-IR types include L9.) The scatter in the young L dwarf sequence is smaller for optical types, likely reflecting the greater spectral heterogeneity of L dwarfs in the near-IR (e.g., see discussion in Kirkpatrick 2005 and Allers &amp; Liu 2013a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Dispersion in Absolute Magnitudes</head><p>In conjunction with the aforementioned general trends, there is significant scatter in the absolute magnitudes of young objects. This phenomenon is real and not simply due to parallax uncertainties. Among the late-M dwarfs, the vl-g objects show relatively uniform magnitudes, perhaps in part because 5 out of 7 of them are TWA members, and thus have common ages. (The six TWA objects in our sample are all the brightest vl-g objects in J-band for their spectral type, ranging from M6 [TWA 8B] to L0 [2MASS J1245−4429 a.k.a. <ref type="bibr">TWA 29]</ref>.) The scatter is far more notable for the int-g late-M dwarfs, where objects can be comparable to the field locus or up to ≈2 magnitudes brighter at Y JHK.</p><p>In fact, while the sample is small, the int-g late-M's seem to bifurcate in the magnitude-vsspectral type plots and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams (Section 4.2), into a pair of M8's brighter than field objects (2MASS J1411−2119 and 2MASSI J0019+4614) and a fainter pair of M7.5's comparable to field objects (SO J0253+1652 [a.k.a. Teegarden's Star] and 2MASS J0714+3702). Furthermore, this bifurcation is also reflected in the lithium abundances, with the two brighter objects having lithium absorption in their optical spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">(Reiners &amp; Basri 2009</ref>) while the one fainter object with an optical spectrum does not show lithium (SO J0253+1652; <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Henry et al. 2004</ref>). And thus the bifurcation of our int-g late-M sample may reflect the conflation of a younger population (e.g., 2MASSI J0019+4614 is a member of the ≈125 Myr AB Dor group) and an older one. An additional consideration is that the M7-M8 range is where <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Dobbie et al. (2002)</ref> have suggested the mass-luminosity relation changes due to the onset of dust formation, as inferred from the luminosity function of young clusters (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Pinfield et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Chappelle et al. 2005</ref>). So the int-g bifurcation may also reflect dust opacity variations. (Intriguingly, the vl-g objects seem to show the largest dispersion right at the M/L transition.) Altogether, more int-g late-M objects with parallaxes are needed to refine our view of this sub-population.</p><p>For young L dwarfs, the scatter relative to the field population is less than for the late-M's, though young L's can still be brighter or fainter than the field. The notable outlier is the companion 2MASS J1207−3932b (L3 vl-g), which may reflect the difficulties of assigning a single number, namely spectral type, to this spectrally extreme object (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Liu et al. 2013b</ref>). In this vein, it is worth remembering that differences between the young and old populations also reflect the challenges of near-IR spectral typing for dusty ultracool dwarfs (e.g., see Section 4.1 of Allers &amp; Liu 2013a). Some of the scatter may be due to spectral type uncertainties, rather than the intrinsic dispersion of absolute magnitudes in objects of the same spectral type.</p><p>While the vl-g and int-g populations show clear trends, perhaps a comparably interesting result is how the near-IR absolute magnitudes are only partly influenced by surface gravity. A sizeable number of young objects do not have significantly different absolute magnitudes than the field sample. Similarly, for objects of comparable near-IR spectral type, the offsets from the field sequence only partly correlate with gravity classification. Some int-g objects can be just as faint or bright relative to the field as vl-g objects, except for the late-L dwarfs, where the vl-g objects can achieve fainter magnitudes. Spectral type (a proxy for temperature) and gravity (a proxy for age) do not seem to be the only factors driving the absolute magnitudes, at least given our current ability to assign types and gravities. (Note this is not the case for the color-magnitude diagram, where vl-g objects show a clearly defined sequence, as discussed in Section 4.2.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">Absolute Magnitudes of Unusually Red Field-Gravity Objects</head><p>Figures 6, 7, and 8 also show the behavior of field objects with unusually red colors but fld-g gravities, such as 2MASS J1821+1414 and 2MASS J2148+4003. Interestingly, such objects mostly fall within the absolute magnitude range seen in field objects. Thus while these objects have absolute magnitudes and colors that overlap low-gravity objects (see also Section 4.2), they are not unusually bright (for the case of the late-M dwarfs) or faint (for the case of the mid/late-L dwarfs) compared to objects of similar spectral type, unlike the low-gravity objects. In this respect, absolute magnitudes for late-M and late-L dwarfs may help to distinguish dusty objects from low-gravity ones, in cases where the spectra are insufficient or unavailable to assess surface gravity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 10</ref> shows the fld-g objects and objects having strong Hα emission from our CFHT sample. For the most part, the fld-g objects appear similar to the field locus, including the young companion LP 261-75B and peculiar object SDSS J1025+3212. The most discrepant fld-g object compared to the field locus is 2MASSW J0033−1521, which is L4β in optical but L1 fld-g in NIR. This is 0.8 mag fainter at J-band than the field locus, making it notably fainter than even the low-gravity L1 dwarfs, though its absolute magnitudes would be field-like if it were classified as L4. Among the Hα emitters, the two objects brighter than the field locus both have low-gravity signatures: 2MASS J0335+2342 is a vl-g object, and LP 423-31 is classified as fld-g in the near-IR but has signs of low gravity in its optical spectrum ). The two Hα emitters without any low-gravity signatures (2MASS J0407+15464 and 2MASS J1707+4301) have comparable magnitudes to the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Polynomial Relations</head><p>A common use of absolute magnitude-spectral type relations is to estimate photometric distances. As seen in our plots, the field and young sequences differ depending on bandpass, spectral type, and gravity, but there are some regimes where they overlap. For instance, the H-band absolute magnitudes of early-L dwarfs (≈L0-L2) are comparable for field and young objects, likewise for K band with mid-L dwarfs (≈L3-L6), and for W 1 band with late-L dwarfs (≈L5-L8), though there still exist young outliers. Such trends may be useful for estimating distances for ultracool dwarfs where spectral types are available but gravity information is not, e.g., typing from modest S/N spectra or purely photometric estimates. Unfortunately, for the late-M dwarfs, the young and field sequences are distinct so they are not amenable to this approach. Similarly, if gravity information is known, then specific choices of bandpasses for certain spectral types may be quite useful for photometric distance estimates, e.g., the low-gravity L dwarfs show remarkably small scatter in their W 1-band magnitudes, more so than it would appear from simply quoting the RMS about the robust linear fit in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">Figure 11</ref> compares polynomial fits for absolute magnitude versus near-IR spectral type for the field sequence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>; for field late-M and L dwarfs from this paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al.

(2015)</ref>; for the int-g and vl-g samples from this paper; and for the young field sample from <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref>. We caution that the Gagne et al. relations are derived from a sample that has some objects with parallactic distances but most with kinematic distances derived from their Bayesian classification method (described here in Section 4.4). Overall, the differences between the polynomial relations can be very significant between our low-gravity relations and those of Gagne et al., depending on the spectral types and filters of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Color-Magnitude Diagrams</head><p>As another comparison of our sample to the field population, we examine several infrared colormagnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on near-IR (Y JHK) and mid-IR (W 1 and W 2) data with objects distinguished by their gravity classifications <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figures 12 and 13)</ref>. For the field population, we use the same data described in the previous section. Note that our CMDs contain more objects than the plots of absolute magnitude versus spectral type in the previous section, since some objects have measured photometry but have not been classified spectroscopically. For brevity, we plot near-IR photometry on the MKO system only, though our compilation is complete for both 2MASS and MKO systems. All CMD plots span 9.5 mag in absolute magnitude for ready comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">General CMD Trends with Gravity</head><p>The most obvious feature of all the CMDs is that vl-g objects are displaced from the field sequence, being brighter and/or redder than field objects. In fact, the distinction between the respective vl-g and field sequences is remarkable, with only a very small fraction of interlopers. The Appendix discusses the individual interlopers in detail. In short, four of them (2MASS J0407+1546, LP 423-31, 2MASS J0835−0819, and 2MASS J2208+2921) appear to have CMD positions that are discrepant with their gravity classifications, though three of these have hints of low-gravity spectral signatures (all except 2MASS J2208+2921). One interloper (2MASS J1935−2846) appears to have a mid-IR excess.</p><p>In contrast, objects classified as int-g share CMD positions with both the field and vl-g objects. There seems to be a slight preference for the early-type int-g objects, brighter than M J,MKO ∼ 12 mag, to sit on the field sequence (in accord with Saumon &amp; Marley 2008 models which show surface gravity has a minimal influence on the CMD positions of the hottest ultracool dwarfs), while fainter int-g objects are redder and intermediate between the field and vl-g sequences. However, there are also counterexamples of this trend, with a few bright int-g objects being closer to the vl-g sequence or faint int-g objects being consistent with the field population. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Figure 14</ref> provides a master summary of our low-gravity sequences, the field population, the unusually red field objects, and the locus of young ultracool companions of stars, with many individual objects labeled. We plot J-band absolute magnitude versus J − K color because we have nearly complete data in these bands, and this captures more dynamic range in the observed properties than other CMDs. We have also plotted linear fits to the three sequences shown here (vl-g, int-g, and the field). We used the same least absolute deviation method (LADFIT in IDL) as in Section 4.1 to fit (J − K) MKO color as a function of absolute magnitude, since absolute magnitude is the more precisely measured quantity and has the larger dynamic range. We exclude 2MASS J1207−3932 from the fits given its extreme position. These linear fits quantify the behavior discussed above for the three sequences, and the coefficients and RMS about the fits are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">Figure 15</ref> examines how the CMD behavior described above relates to spectral type, plotting our vl-g sample and the field population, as well as the linear fits between color and absolute magnitude. We also show the mean absolute magnitude at each spectral type from M7 to L7 using the linear relations derived in Section 4.1 for both the vl-g and field samples, thereby indicating the direction in which objects of the same spectral type but different gravity classifications move on the CMD. Late-M dwarfs are much brighter at nearly the same color at lower gravity. This behavior gradually changes from late-M to early-L such that low gravity objects of the same spectral become more similar in absolute magnitude but increasingly redder in J − K. At spectral type L3 and beyond, low-gravity counterparts are on average fainter in J band and even redder in J − K. At the latest L types, low gravity objects are fainter in both J band (by ∼1.6 mag) and K band (by ∼0.8 mag) and correspondingly ∼0.8 mag redder in J − K. Thus, the overall effect of decreasing surface gravity on the CMD positions of ultracool dwarfs follows a complex pattern, with the changes in the absolute magnitudes and colors depending on the spectral type</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Young Companions versus Young Field Objects</head><p>One of the prime motivations for studying young ultracool dwarfs is to use these objects as analogs for young gas-giant exoplanets. The overlapping temperatures, ages, and masses of young ultracool dwarfs and young imaged companions make this analogy appealing. At the same time, we expect that field objects and companions typically form via different mechanisms, e.g., gravitational collapse of a gas cloud as compared to formation within a circumstellar disk., respectively, which could result in different thermal evolution, metallicities, elemental mixtures, etc. High-quality data enables an empirically driven comparison of free-floating objects with substellar companions. In this aspect, our CMD plots reveal the following:</p><p>1. At the bright end, the young companion and young field samples overlap on the CMD. The brightest companions (HR 7329B, PZ Tel B, and TWA 5B) are consistent with the vl-g sequence, mainly because they are brighter than anything of similar spectral type and/or color.</p><p>2. Most of the fainter young companions are more consistent with the old field sequence than the vl-g sequence. There are exceptions among the early/mid-L companions, as CD-35 2722B (int-g), AB Pic b (vl-g), and G 196-3B (vl-g) all concide with the vl-g sequence, and 2MASS J0103−5515 b might as well given its (larger) photometric uncertainties. In addition, as is well known, the extreme companions HR 8799b and 2MASS J1207−3932 fall off the field sequence.</p><p>Overall, the late-M to late-L companions appear to be bluer and/or fainter than the young field sample, which suggests that the companions and the field objects span a different range in physical properties. These two samples cover similar age ranges and spectral types, including objects in the same moving groups (Section 4.4), and thus should have similar masses and temperatures given their similar absolute magnitudes. Thus, difference in other physical properties, e.g., formation history or composition, may be relevant here. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_38">Figure 17</ref> highlights the difference between the vl-g sequence and the young companions, using a robust linear fit as in our other CMD plots. The construction of the two samples are heterogenous, which deters a more rigorous comparison between the two. But the overall pattern is intriguing -the vl-g sequence is notably offset from the young companion sequence. Note that most of the free-floating objects were identified as low-gravity in optical spectra (Section 2.1), and thus their redder colors are not due to a selection effect. Given the large number of young field objects with parallaxes, the next significant step in such a comparison will likely rely on more discoveries to grow the companion sample. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> 3. Companions in the L/T transition are beyond the spectral type and color range where we have defined our linear fits, but the companions broadly appear to be consistent with the field population on the CMD. Finally, the late-T companions Ross 458C and Gl 504b are notably redder than the field T dwarf CMD sequence, likely due to the gravity dependence of collisionally induced H 2 absorption (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Burningham et al. 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Unusually Red Field-Gravity Objects</head><p>The eight fld-g objects identified as unusually red behave in a way distinct from either of the field or low-gravity samples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 16</ref>). The four earlier-type red objects (M9-L5) are indistinguishable from the field sequence on all our CMDs. 2MASS J2224−0158 (L3 fld-g) is the reddest of these, but it is only marginally inconsistent with the field sequence within its color errors. In contrast, the late-type red objects 2MASS J2148+4003 (L6 fld-g) and WISE J2335+4511 (L7p fld-g) intermingle with the bottom of our vl-g sequence on CMDs where the color includes K band, having colors and magnitudes similar to such objects as 2MASS J0355+1133 (L3 vlg), 2MASS J2244+2043 (L6 vl-g), and WISE J0047+6803 (L7 int-g). This intermingling is suprising, given that work to date on late-L dwarfs has focused on low-gravity being the prime mover to generate extremely red colors and faint magnitudes (see Section 4.7). Perhaps these two red fld-g late-L dwarfs have enhanced metallicity compared to most objects in the field, a possibility that could be examined in the future with higher-resolution spectra.</p><p>In the mid-infrared W 1 − W 2 versus M W 2 plot, the red fld-g objects both appear to be intermediate between the field and vl-g sequence. Only in Y −J or Y −H CMDs do they distinguish themselves, with 2MASS J2148+4003 sitting with the vl-g sequence and WISE J2335+4511 being consistent with the field. Finally, the latest-type unusually red objects WISE J0206+2640 (L8 (red)) and WISE J0754+7909 (T2p (red)) appear in locations on all CMDs that seem to be consistent with the field sequence, which we discuss further in Section 4.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Tangential Velocities</head><p>Given our measured parallaxes and proper motions, we can readily compute the projected tangential velocities (V tan ) for all of our targets. Objects that have not acquired significant velocities relative to their natal material should have small tangential velocities with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) and overall a small velocity dispersion as a sample. This allows for an interesting probe of our low-gravity sample, since we do not expect our objects to be old enough to have acquired large space motions. While tangential velocities cannot be used to rule out large space motions, if an object does have a large space motion we might detect it through V tan .</p><p>While it is common practice to quote directly observed tangential velocities (V tan ≡ µ/π), we also compute here tangential velocities corrected for the Sun's space motion with respect to the LSR, adopting the recent determination of (U, V, W ) ⊙ = (−11.10, 12.24, 7.25) km s −1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Schönrich et al. (2010)</ref>. For a given position on the sky it is straightforward to convert (U, V, W ) ⊙ into projected component velocities in RA and Dec, and with a parallactic distance these can be converted into proper motion in angular units. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 11</ref> reports our uncorrected tangential velocities, our derived corrections to proper motion in RA and Dec, and the final tangential velocities of our objects in the LSR frame (V ′ tan ). We compute all of these quantities in a Monte Carlo fashion, accounting for the uncertainties in parallax and proper motion.</p><p>Two objects with signatures of low gravity display raw (i.e., not LSR corrected) tangential velocities of 90 km s −1 . 2MASS J1022+5825 (L1β/L1 fld-g) is an object from our parallax program for which we measure µ abs = 1. ′′ 0775 ± 0. ′′ 0031 yr −1 and π abs = 0. ′′ 0526 ± 0. ′′ 0031, resulting in V tan = 97 ± 6 km s −1 (V ′ tan = 82 ± 6 km s −1 ). SO J0253+1652 (M7.5 int-g; a.k.a., Teegarden's Star) has a parallax of π abs = 0. ′′ 2593 ± 0. ′′ 0009 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Gatewood &amp; Coban (2009)</ref> and proper motion of µ abs = 5. ′′ 129 ± 0. ′′ 029 yr −1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Roeser et al. (2010)</ref>, resulting in V tan = 93.8 ± 0.6 km s −1 (V ′ tan = 79.2 ± 0.6 km s −1 ). In fact, both of these objects have radial velocities <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 12)</ref> showing that 2MASS J1022+5825 and SO J0253+1652 have total space motions of 99 ± 4 km s −1 and 116.0 ± 0.5 km s −1 , respectively (not LSR corrected). Such velocities are inconsistent with young stars, e.g., the high probability (&gt;75%) moving group members from <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. (2008)</ref> have a median of 24 km s −1 and a 95% confidence limit of 18-34 km s −1 . The existence of these two objects demonstrates that one of two possibilities must be true: (1) objects with low gravity spectral signatures are indeed young but are sometimes born with, or quickly acquire, large space motions; or (2) the optical/near-IR spectral signatures being used to identify low-gravity objects are sometimes manifested by much older objects. If the former is true, then high velocity cannot be used to distinguish between objects that are red because they are dusty and those that are red because they are low gravity, as has been suggested previously (e.g., see discussion of 2MASS J2148+4003 in the Appendix). We note that these kinematic outliers only occur among objects with intermediate gravities, not the vl-g objects, which thus might prefer the latter possibility, namely that other effects besides lower gravity can lead to an int-g spectrum. However, visual inspection of the near-IR SpeX prism spectra for our two high-velocity objects ) do not reveal any obvious discrepancies compared to other int-g objects of similar spectral type but lower tangential velocity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">Figure 18</ref> shows all of the tangential velocity measurements for objects with signatures of low gravity as noted in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, including those without formal gravity classifications, along with the unusually red fld-g objects. With the exception of the two highest velocity objects discussed above, the low-gravity objects have a median V ′ tan of 10 km s −1 and standard deviation of 8 km s −1 . This distribution is a somewhat tighter than has been noted previously in the literature for low-gravity objects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2013</ref>). It is also tighter than standard deviations typically quoted for normal field dwarfs of similar spectral type (≈20 km s −1 ; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Schmidt et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Schmidt et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Faherty et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. 2012</ref>). These results are consistent with the notion that low-gravity objects have younger ages. 11</p><p>Unusually red fld-g objects tend to have higher tangential velocities, with a median V ′ tan of 29 km s −1 and a standard deviation of 15 km s −1 . We caution however that these objects have sometimes been discovered in proper motion searches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. 2008b;</ref>) and thus could harbor a selection bias toward higher velocities. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The unusually red objects with the highest velocities are the two earliest-type ones (2MASS J2224−0158 [L4.5/L3 fld-g] and 2MASS J1331+3407 [L0/L0 fld-g] with V ′ tan = 41.4 ± 0.7 km s −1 and 40.1 ± 2.4 km s −1 , respectively) and the latest-type one (WISE J0754+7909 [T2p (red)] with 56.0 ± 1.0 km s −1 ). As noted in Section 4.2, all three of these red objects are consistent with the field sequence on CMDs. In contrast, the two unusually red objects that seem to follow the vl-g sequence on CMDs have velocities marginally consistent with the low-gravity sample (V ′ tan = 25.1±0.5 km s −1 for 2MASS J2148+4003 and V ′ tan = 24.8 ± 0.4 km s −1 for WISE J2335+4511).</p></div>

Note that the BANYAN model only contains groups within 100 pc and the field population only extends to 200 pc, so the model is not appropriate for analysis of our most distant objects (GJ 3276, 2MASS J0557−1359, and 2MASS J0619−2903).</p><p>For objects with clear spectroscopic signatures of youth, we use the online tool's "Young Field" option, which removes the old field component from consideration, leaving just the young field population to represent field objects &lt;1 Gyr old. Note that for objects with discrepant information between their optical and near-IR gravity classifications, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> we run the tool both with the Young Field option and without. The resulting probabilities for field membership are unchanged, though the objects are assigned to young field or old field depending on the age assumed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 13</ref> shows the resulting Bayesian probabilities for all the field objects, computed using the astrometry compiled in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, and supplemented with radial velocities from the literature given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 12</ref>. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>, bona fide YMG members within 1σ of their group's six-dimensional U V W XY Z location have membership probabilities of 95%, and more peripherial members (≈1.0-2.5σ) have probabilities of ≈10-95%, based on a full Bayesian analysis using kinematic and photometric information (described below). Using this as a benchmark, we report all membership outcomes with a probability &gt;10% from our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis. Most objects are uniquely matched to a single YMG or the field population.</p><p>2. Kinematic+SED BANYAN II analysis: For most of our objects, membership results are avail-able from the full BANYAN II modeling by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref>. While the BANYAN II online tool uses only kinematics, the full BANYAN II model evaluates YMG membership for ultracool dwarfs using both kinematic and spectrophotometric information, the latter based on the 2MASS and WISE colors and absolute magnitudes of old and young ultracool dwarfs. For this reason, the probabilities that compute from the BANYAN II online tool cannot be directly compared to those from the full BANYAN II analysis of Gagne et al.. The full BANYAN II model evaluates 4 kinematic criteria and 2 photometric ones, and thus kinematics still plays a large role in the membership calculation but not an exclusive one.</p><p>While BANYAN II can efficiently identify low-gravity ultracool dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. 2015a</ref>), there are known deficiencies that deter us from relying solely on its results. The first is its kinematic model of the solar neighborhood may not be complete as there may be (1) stellar YMG members that are currently unidentified, which would alter the triaxial gaussians used by BANYAN II, (2) uncertainties in the reality of all seven adopted YMGs, e.g., the exact nature of Argus is disputed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. 2015</ref>), and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> new YMGs in the solar neighborhood that remain to be discovered. The second important deficiency is the photometric aspect of BANYAN II, which relies on the census of young ultracool dwarfs known at the time of its construction. Our CFHT work has expanded this census by a factor of 4, most notably growing the L dwarf sample, and has significantly revised parallaxes for some objects used by BANYAN II. Thus, the definition of the sequence used by the full BANYAN II analysis may need to be updated. Finally, Gagne et al. require objects to show low-gravity features to be considered YMG members. However, we consider this to be too strict, given the diversity of gravity classifications seen in YMG brown dwarfs and the lack of firm constraints on the upper age at which gravity signatures persist (Allers &amp; Liu 2013a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aller et al. 2016</ref>) -this is especially relevant for 2MASS J2351+3010 discussed below.</p><p>In short, while the full BANYAN II analysis provides a powerful tool for assessing membership, we do not consider it to be a complete representation of the nearby young ultracool population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comparison to known stellar members:</head><p>As a simple check, we compare our objects' U V W XY Z position with the nearby young groups, using reduced chi-squared ( ˜ χ 2 ) as a metric, namely in velocity position:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">˜ χ 2 U V W = 1 3 (U obj − U ymg ) 2 σ 2 U + (V obj − V ymg ) 2 σ 2 V + (W obj − W ymg ) 2 σ 2 W (1)</formula><p>where σ is the quadrature sum of the measurement uncertainty for an individual object and uncertainties in the group kinematics (both centroid uncertainty and group dispersion). ˜ χ 2</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thus, ˜</head><p>χ 2 values provides a simple assessment of whether an object's membership proposed by BANYAN II is plausible. Obviously, this is an incomplete view since it does not consider false positives, namely that an object from the young field population happens to have a very similar U V W and/or XY Z with the YMGs being considered (and likewise for intermixing of members from different YMGs). For this reason, we chiefly use˜χuse˜ use˜χ 2 to rule out cases of marginal membership.</p><p>We calculate the U V W velocities for our sample in a right-handed coordinate system.

Note that BANYAN II uses rotated ellipses to define the galactic position and velocity of each group, thus we cannot directly compare their group definitions to ours. As a check, we computed the mean and standard deviation of U V W XY Z for group members from the BANYAN II lists ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. 2014b</ref>). With the exception of the Argus group, we find that our adopted group U V W XY Z agree with those determined from BANYAN II members to within the uncertainties. For Argus, our adopted Y for the group (−115.1 ± 35.5 pc) does not agree with the mean Y value for objects in the BANYAN II Argus membership list (−21.7 ± 26.7 pc). This discrepancy could be due to contamination of the membership lists for Argus, as recently noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al.

At one extreme, for objects with complete spatial-kinematic data (both parallaxes and radial velocities) as well as full agreement among our three membership methods (kinematics-only BANYAN II, full kinematics+SED BANYAN II, and˜χand˜ and˜χ 2 confirmation), there is no ambiguity in the result. Similarly, objects with parallaxes only, without RVs, but with agreement between BANYAN II analyses are also considered highly probable members, especially if the minimum RV distance between the object and the known members is plausible (equivalently, the minimum possible˜χpossible˜ possible˜χ 2 U V W value is less than our nominal cutoff of 4). And likewise, some objects flagged by Gagne et al. as strong members from their full BANYAN II analysis but that lacked parallactic distances now have measured parallaxes from our work, thereby strengthening the case for membership.</p><p>Where the three membership methods disagree, we scrutinize the differing results along with the available data to make an assessment. For instance, when our kinematic BANYAN II analysis has a different outcome than the Gagne et al. full BANYAN II analysis, we examine the observations and the Bayesian calculations. Our new parallaxes often help to resolve the disagreement. The full (kinematic+SED) BANYAN II analyses for many objects were done without parallaxes, producing membership assignments along with statistical estimates of the distances. These statistical distances, and thus the associated membership claims, can be evaluated in light of our CFHT parallactic distances. (Likewise, some objects' parallaxes have changed significantly from published work to our CFHT measurements; see Section 3.1.) Similarly, new CFHT distances for objects can establish their U V W XY Z positions as being highly discrepant with known stellar members based oñ χ 2 , even if the BANYAN II analyses (either our kinematics-only one or the published kinematics+SED one) points to membership. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 13</ref> provides our membership results. Young companions are not included here, as their membership is assessed in their discovery papers. Individual objects that warrant discussion are given in the Appendix, primarily those where the different membership methods give discrepant results or where our CFHT parallaxes lead to a revision in the membership assigned by previous work. A few particularly notable findings are:</p><p>• Argus fld-g members: we identify two possible Argus members with fld-g near-IR gravities (2MASS J0030−1450 and 2MASS J2351+3010), suggesting an older age than previously claimed (≈40 Myr; <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. 2008</ref>), if the group actually a physical one (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. 2015</ref>). Another Argus candidate found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Gagné et al. (2014a)</ref>, SIMP J2154−1055, is refuted as a member based on our new parallax.</p><p>• Disk-bearing brown dwarfs in the β Pic moving group: we support the membership of the accreting object 2MASS J0335+2342 proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Shkolnik et al. (2012)</ref>, and we identify 2MASS J1935−2846 as a potential member with a mid-IR excess indicative of a disk. These are the two longest-lived <ref type="bibr">(24 Myr;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. 2015</ref>) brown dwarf disks known to date.</p><p>• Distant young ultracool dwarfs with disks: Four M5-M7 dwarfs originally thought to be nearby young objects turn out to be very young (∼Myr) objects at distances of ≈100-300 pc: GJ 3276 (a.k.a. 2MASS J0422+1530), 2MASS J0435−1414, 2MASS J0557−1359, and 2MASS J0619−2903. All of them have signatures of having circumstellar disks, most notably 2MASS J0435−1414 which is detected at far-IR, sub-millimeter, and millimeter wavelengths. Based on their spectral types, they straddle the stellar/substellar mass boundary.</p><p>• • −0.3 M Jup ) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Gagné et al. (2014a)</ref>. In all these cases, we weaken or eliminate the case for planetary-mass status, either by assigning field membership or finding the near-IR spectra are not low-gravity. Our analysis does preserve one young planetary-mass candidate from <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>, the β Pic candidate 2MASS J2208+2921 (12.9 +0.3 −0.1 M Jup ). These are all discussed individually in the Appendix. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 15</ref> provides a concise summary of our membership results relative to the published BANYAN II analyses. We adopt two simple categories: (1) 23 objects for which our results have changed the membership assignments, and (2) 28 objects for which our results have improved/fortified the existing assignments. For the former, we include all objects identified as YMG member candidates which end up with changed memberships. This count includes objects previously identified as only marginal candidates based on their low BANYAN II membership probabilities and/or high contamination rates, under the rationale that such candidates would still warrant followup observations whereas we conclude they are unlikely to be worth pursuing. For the latter, most are objects with BANYAN II membership determinations done without parallaxes where our CFHT results reinforce the BANYAN II assignments. There is inevitable ambiguity for a handful of objects when using this simple 2-bin categorization, so those interested in the details of specific objects should consult the Appendix and <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 13</ref>.</p><p>Broadly speaking, objects with 80% BANYAN II probabilities to reside in a YMG are confirmed by our work, except for the Argus (1 object) and Columba (1 object) candidates, which we refute and assign to the field. Objects with 60% probabilities are usually refuted as members and assigned to the field. These numbers are a very rough summary -the reasons for the membership changes depend on the individual objects and their specific datasets.</p><p>For several objects, our parallaxes improve/fortify the previous YMG membership claims based on BANYAN II analyses without parallaxes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Gagné et al. 2015b</ref>). These are 2MASS J0019+4614 (ABDMG), 2MASS J0045+1634 (ARG), WISE J0047+6803 (ABDMG; see also <ref type="bibr">Gizis</ref>  Similarly, our parallaxes have added three objects for which YMG memberships are now secured based on both parallax and RV data: 2MASSI J0019+4614 (ABDMG), 2MASS J0045+1634 (ARG), and SDSS 0443+0002 (BPMG). (These had previously been noted as members based on BANYAN II statistical distances and RVs, and hence are also listed in the previous paragraph.) We have also tentatively added a fourth YMG member with both parallax and RV data, 2MASS J0608−2753 (COL). This object was previously considered a marginal candidate by BANYAN II, and our improvement in the parallax has strengthened the case (see Appendix).</p><p>Finally, Figures 19 and 20 present the color-magnitude diagrams again, this time with the YMG memberships indicated. These results provide empirical isochrones for substellar evolution as a function of age and spectral type. We use these in Section 4.6 to test current theoretical isochrones.</p></div>

(2010)</ref> were included in our sample, as they were reported to be candidate members of older (100 Myr) moving groups, namely the Hyades, Pleaides, Ursa Major streams (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Montes et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zuckerman &amp; Song 2004</ref>). These are more kinematically distributed then the aforementioned young moving groups and lack a definite spatial concentration. Accordingly Seifahrt et al. (2010) adopted a rather large velocity dispersion (7-10 km s −1 ) combined with photometric distances (and an unrealistically small uncertainty of 1 pc) to select candidates.</p><p>With our CFHT parallaxes, the U V W values of these candidates is consistent with group membership, as judged by˜χby˜ by˜χ 2 U V W and using the updated group definitions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Klutsch et al. (2014)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 14)</ref>. However, the large velocity extent of these older groups means that a given object can overlap more than one group. Moreover, the reality of these groups and the purity of their membership lists are still being debated (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bovy &amp; Hogg 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tabernero et al. 2012</ref>). In the absence of a quantitative method to assign membership and the lack of any matches to younger groups, we simply assign these objects to the general field population and propagate their original assignments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Seifahrt et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Age Calibration of the Ultracool Gravity Sequence</head><p>Low-gravity spectral signatures in optical and near-IR spectra of ultracool dwarfs have been valuable for distilling the rare subset of young field brown dwarfs from the general field population. Theory predicts that the radii of substellar objects cease contracting by ∼300 Myr (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Burrows et al. 2001</ref>), but accurate predictions about the time-evolution of gravity-sensitive features leading up to this cessation are beyond current models. Thus, empirical calibration of the spectral evolution is needed, based on ultracool dwarfs in stellar associations/groups and as companions to stars. Such a calibration would also be prized for diagnosing ages of field ultracool objects unaffiliated with any stellar group as well as ultracool companions around host star with uncertain ages.</p><p>For late-M and L dwarfs, evidence to date supports the expected ∼300 Myr timescale disappearance of low-gravity features (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smith et al. 2015)</ref>, with ample evidence that objects at ∼100 Myr still have distinct gravity signatures (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Martín et al. 1999b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">McGovern et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aller et al. 2016</ref>). At optical wavelengths, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> also showed that low-gravity signatures for late-M dwarfs are distinct between ∼10 Myr and ∼100 Myr objects, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cruz et al. (2009)</ref> speculated that a similar distinction for young L dwarfs was possible for their β/γ gravity classifications. At near-IR wavelengths, Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) used a sparse sample of YMG members and candidates to estimate vl-g and int-g classifications occur for ∼10-30 Myr and ∼50-200 Myr, respectively. At the youngest ages (≈10 Myr), they found vl-g gravity classifications are ubiquitous, but intermediate ages could display objects with both vl-g and int-g classifications (see also Allers &amp; Liu 2013b), in accord with evolutionary models (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Figures 4 and 5 of Saumon &amp; Marley 2008)</ref>. Surprisingly, they also found that brown dwarfs of the same age and spectral type could have differing gravity classifications, as demonstrated by the AB Dor members CD-35 2722B (L3 int-g) and 2MASS J0355+1133 (L3 vl-g). Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> found that the strength of gravity-sensitive near-IR spectral features do generally correlate with age, but with too much scatter to diagnose individual objects.</p><p>Our membership assignments and uniform near-IR gravity classifications afford an opportunity to revisit this issue. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 21</ref> shows the distribution of vl-g and int-g objects in different young moving groups, as a function of group age. While the number of objects and age sampling is still rather sparse, the data do indicate a decline in vl-g objects with age, with int-g objects becoming prevalent by ≈150 Myr. However, the transition from low to high gravity (i.e., vl-g to int-g to fld-g) does not purely depend on age, nor simply depend on spectral type, as might be expected. This is highlighted in the AB Dor group, where L dwarfs are are both vl-g (2MASS J0355+1133</p><p>[L3] and 2MASS J2244+2043 <ref type="bibr">[L6]</ref>) and int-g (CD-35 2722B <ref type="bibr">[L3]</ref> and DENISJ1425−3650 <ref type="bibr">[L4]</ref>). The one AB Dor late-M dwarf has int-g, but one cannot reach conclusions based on one object. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aller et al. 2016</ref>.) Finally, the Argus group may be the best illustration of the diverse spectral behavior, where the one secure group member is vl-g (2MASS J0045+1634 <ref type="bibr">[L2]</ref>) while the two other possible members are fld-g (2MASS J0030−1450 <ref type="bibr">[L6]</ref> and 2MASS J2351+3010 <ref type="bibr">[L5]</ref>). <ref type="bibr">14</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Comparison to Theoretical Models</head><p>We now examine whether current model atmospheres can reproduce the locus of low-gravity ultracool dwarfs on the CMD. This has previously been addressed primarily for planetary-mass companions like HR 8799b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Barman et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Marley et al. 2012</ref>) and 2MASS J1207−3932b (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Barman et al. 2011b</ref>), and our new large sample of low-gravity objects spans a much wider range in mass and temperature. Here we consider two sets of models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref> provide a model atmosphere grid over a wide range of T eff , log(g), and cloud properties based on the cloud treatment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref>, which is parameterized by the sedimentation efficiency f sed . (Larger values of f sed mean more efficient sedimentation, leading to faster particle growth, larger particle sizes, and thinner clouds.) This grid predicts the range of colors and magnitudes that objects would have, regardless of the particular prescription for cloud evolution as objects cool. We also examine BT-Settl evolutionary model isochrones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baraffe et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Allard et al. 2015</ref>, in preparation) that adopt a particular prescription for the formation and sedimentation of clouds as objects age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allard et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 22</ref> shows our vl-g CMD sequence, along with the field population and HR 8799bcd. (HR 8799e is lacking J-band photometry.) We have overplotted <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref> model atmospheres of different gravities and cloud thicknesses, from very thick (f sed = 1) and red in J −K to thin (f sed = 3) and bluer. We plot models for T eff = 1100-2400 K at log(g) = 4.5 dex and 5.5 dex, while for the lowest gravity log(g) = 4.0 dex models are only complete over T eff = 1100-1500 K. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> We find that the vast majority of our vl-g objects do not overlap with the <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref> model atmosphere locus. This is because the models do not reach sufficiently red colors at a given absolute magnitude (or equivalently are too faint at a given color). The discrepancy is especially severe for the earlier type objects, the late-M and early-L dwarfs. and also occurs when using K-band absolute magnitude for the CMD. While the Saumon &amp; Marley models are similarly too blue (and/or faint) compared to the field population given the expected field gravities of log(g) ≈ 5 (e.g., also see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 10</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley 2008)</ref>, the discrepancy is more severe for the vl-g sample. Finally, a similar discrepancy with the data is seen when considering the <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Marley et al. (2012)</ref> evolutionary models, which adopt a gravity dependence to the L/T transition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 23</ref>).</p><p>The cloud treatment is perhaps the most ready explanation for the discrepancy on the CMD between the vl-g sequence and the models. Since <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 22</ref> shows that reducing f sed at fixed temperature and gravity moves the models redder, one natural explanation is that more extreme f sed values are needed for young objects than currently modeled, namely even smaller f sed and thus smaller particles and thicker clouds. Another alternative is unphysically large radii (i.e., lower gravities) to boost the absolute magnitudes at a given temperature.</p><p>A more speculative idea is that the cloud particle size distribution differs in low-gravity objects compared to higher-gravity field objects, the latter of which have served as the notional references for model developments. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref> assume the size distribution is always log-normal, as detailed computations over the range of parameter space are prohibitive. In addition, brown dwarf radii decrease by a factor of ≈2-3 from 10-100 Myr (e.g. Burrows et al. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Previous comparison of these models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> for a sample of four low-gravity L dwarfs seemed to show (1) the model locus overlapping with the data, and (2) the low-gravity models being too red relative to to their data (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 12</ref> 2001), so perhaps the correspondingly longer rotation periods of young brown dwarfs change the dynamics of condensate formation and sedimentation. Note that there is a large spread in natal brown dwarf rotation rates (e.g., factor of ≈10; <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Scholz et al. 2015</ref>), which might lead to differences in the cloud properties. These could manifest as differences in colors, magnitudes, and spectra for objects of similar mass, age, and metallicity (e.g., Sections 4.1 and 4.5). However, the fact that the vl-g sequence is rather tight and distinct from the field sequence on the CMD hints that evolutionary changes play a larger role than initial conditions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 24</ref> shows our vl-g CMD sequence alongside BT-Settl isochrones ranging from 1 Myr to 10 Gyr. We also show the confirmed and probable members of young moving groups compared to isochrones encompassing the age ranges for these groups from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. (2015)</ref>. Overall, isochrones tend to have bluer colors (or equivalently fainter J-band absolute magnitudes) than the empirical sequences, and faint red L dwarfs are not reproduced at all as the models begin to turn to the blue due to cloud clearing at relatively bright magnitudes. Notable exceptions to these trends are β Pic b (L1), which is bluer than the 20-30 Myr isochrones (albeit with a large J − K uncertainty), and the AB Dor member DENIS J1425−3650 (L4 int-g), which aligns well with the 120-200 Myr isochrone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">The L/T Transition at Low Gravity</head><p>Our sample contains mostly M6-L7 dwarfs and thus well covers the earlier spectral types of the L/T transition (which we loosely consider as spectral types L6-T5 here). In this arena, the mid/late-L dwarfs have been the focus on much attention, in light of the relevance to young directly imaged planets such as 2MASS J1207−3932b and HR 8799bcde, which have redder and fainter IR fluxes than field objects. Similarly, studies of benchmark brown dwarfs (those with known masses and/or ages) show the L/T transition occurs at lower effective temperatures for younger objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bowler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Liu et al. 2013b)</ref>. Initial attempts to model the full evolution of the transition from <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref> indicated that the absolute magnitudes of the transition (where the near-IR CMD locus crosses from red L dwarfs to blue T dwarfs) should be brigher for young ages. However, with the addition of a gravity-dependent recipe for the transition, chosen to match the HR 8799 planets, more recent evolutionary models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Marley et al. (2012)</ref> point to fainter absolute magnitudes for the transition at young ages.</p><p>Our combined sample also contains a handful of young objects at later types and thus begins to probe the impact of reduced surface gravity across the entire L/T transition. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 25</ref> again shows behavior of the absolute magnitude versus spectral type, but with a larger range in spectral types than previous plots to highlight the L/T objects. The most straightforward result comes from the T2.5 Hyades member CFHT-Hy-20, which at all IR bandpasses is consistent with field objects. This is not surprising since evolutionary models indicate that brown dwarf contraction has largely completed by the ≈600-800 Myr age of the Hyades. Similarly, the young (≈100-500 Myr) wide L/T companions known to date -HD 203030B (L7.5; <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2006</ref>), HN Peg B (T2.5; , and GU Psc b (T3.5, which only has a BANYAN statistical distance; <ref type="bibr">Naud et al. 2014</ref>) -have positions on the IR color-magnitude diagrams consistent with the field locus (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Figure 14)</ref>. Finally, the AB Dor member SDSS J1110+0116 (T5.5; <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Gagné et al. 2015</ref>) also coincides with the field locus. Thus, for L/T objects as young as ≈100 Myr, while the temperatures for a given spectral type may be age-dependent, the IR absolute magnitudes across the L/T transition do not seem to strongly depend on age.</p><p>The two latest-type red objects in our sample, WISE J0206+2640 (L9 (red)) and WISE J0754+7909 (T2p (red)), may be illuminating landmarks for the transition. Their spectra are unusual compared to most field objects of similar type, especially WISE J0754+7909 (see details in Appendix). And yet their absolute magnitudes are largely consistent with field objects, with the largest discrepancy being WISE J0206+2640 having ≈0.5 mag fainter magnitudes at Y and J bands compared to the field. Even given its very peculiar spectrum, WISE J0754+7909 has absolute magnitudes and color-magnitude positions in accord with the field. Thus, while the spectral peculiarities of these two objects may not be due to low gravity (indeed both have old field kinematics; <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 15</ref>), their consistency with field objects may be circumstantial evidence that the IR magnitudes of the L/T transition are robust over a range of physical properties.</p><p>One interesting question that we can address is whether the J-band flux reversal that is a hallmark of L/T transition binaries in the field population (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Liu et al. 2006</ref>) would appear different at lower gravities. The most extreme such flux reversal binaries known are 2MASS J1404−3159AB (∆J = −0.54 ± 0.08 mag, ∆K = 1.33 ± 0.05 mag; <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Looper et al. 2008a</ref>) and SDSS J1052+4422AB (∆J = −0.45 ± 0.09 mag, ∆K = 0.52 ± 0.05 mag; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Dupuy et al. 2015</ref>). SDSS J1052+4422AB has a very precise evolutionary model-based age derived from its dynamical masses and luminosities, clearly demonstrating that it is field age and gravity (1.11 +0.17 −0.20 Gyr and log(g) = 5.0-5.2 dex; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Dupuy et al. 2015</ref>). Now that we have parallaxes for members of young moving groups that span the L/T transition, we can imagine hypothetical L/T transition binaries composed of these coeval objects. For example, if the AB Dor members WISEP J0047+6803 (L7 int-g) and SDSS J1110+0116 (T5.5) were paired together in a binary, they would have ∆J = −0.37±0.11 mag, ∆K = 2.04 ± 0.09 mag. If the primary were instead 2MASS J2244+2043 (L6 vl-g), the flux ratios would be ∆J = −0.47 ± 0.09 mag, ∆K = 1.89 ± 0.09 mag.</p><p>Thus, it seems plausible that young J-band flux-reversal binaries have comparable J-band flux ratios as field systems, with the caveat that the current sample of young objects for such hypothetical pairings is very small. However, the "bump" relative to K band in these binaries would be somewhat larger, i.e., their K-band ratios may be larger, as low gravity late-L dwarfs are both fainter at K and redder in J − K than field objects of comparable spectral type, while the young mid-T dwarf SDSS J111010.01+011613 seems to lie close to or perhaps only slightly below the field CMD sequence. Although little work has been done on field J-band flux-reversal binaries at bandpasses bluer than J, we note that the Y -band bump of a hypothetical AB Dor L/T transition binary composed of 2MASS J2244+2043 and SDSS J1110+0116 would be even larger than at J-band (∆Y = −0.71±0.09 mag), while SDSS z-band photometry of these sources indicates no significant z-band bump (∆z = 0.18 ± 0.14 mag).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have completed a large, uniform analysis of the spectrophotometric properties of young ultracool dwarfs in the field, based on a populous new sample of high precision distances from the Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program combined with a uniform analysis of near-IR spectral types and gravity classifications. Our parallax sample is a factor of 4× larger than previous studies of young field objects and with significantly higher parallax precision. Objects with already published parallaxes from other groups mostly agree with our (typically higher precision) CFHT results, though we note that at least 6 out of the 15 parallaxes for young objects measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref> appear to be problematic. A few young objects previously thought to have odd/extraordinary properties in fact are unremarkable when considering our new distances.</p><p>Combined with previously published measurements (mostly substellar companions to young stars), we have assembled a sample of 102 ultracool objects with parallaxes that allows us to clearly delineate the spectrophotometric behavior of young ultracool dwarfs as a function of spectral type, gravity, and age. The absolute magnitudes of young field objects as a function of near-IR spectral type differ from those of old field objects, with young late-M objects being brighter and mid/late-L dwarfs being fainter in the near-IR (Y JHK) bandpasses. The brightness differences relative to the field are more dramatic for bluer bandpasses. In contrast, in the WISE mid-IR bandpasses, young targets generally appear brighter than the field sequence.</p><p>As delineated by the Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) gravity classifications, the vl-g and int-g populations have differing spectrophotometric behavior. The vl-g population forms a well-defined sequence, both in its absolute magnitudes as a function of spectral type and in near-IR colormagnitude diagrams. For the latter, the vl-g sequences now extended smoothly from late-M to the late-L spectral types, offset from the field sequence to both redder colors and brighter absolute magnitudes. Our work reveals that the effect of decreasing surface gravity from field to vl-g follows an evolving pattern with spectral type, making the IR absolute magnitudes of late-M and early-L dwarfs brighter, then making the colors of mid-L dwarfs redder while not affecting their IR absolute magnitudes, and then making the late-L dwarfs both redder and fainter.</p><p>In contrast, the int-g population is more heterogeneous. Its absolute magnitudes as a function of spectral type have more scatter, especially among the late-M dwarfs. Limited data, based on the presence of lithium, suggests this scatter may be age-related. The int-g sample is also notable for having two kinematic outliers, with tangential velocities of &gt;99 km s −1 , far exceeding known young stars. Two natural explanations are that some young objects experience early dynamical interactions that lead to significant acceleration (e.g., ejection from their birth clouds; <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Reipurth &amp; Clarke 2001)</ref> or old (high-gravity) objects can display spectra that mimic low gravity. We note that the absence of any high-velocity vl-g objects disfavors the former possibility. Though the current sample sizes and selection effects limit firm conclusions, we notionally propose that older high-gravity objects can show near-IR spectra that appear to be intermediate in gravity (int-g) between typical young and old field objects.</p><p>Along with these trends, there is notable dispersion among the population as a whole that is not well-correlated with spectral type or gravity classification, at least given current ability to diagnose these two properties. There appears to be (at least) a third physical parameter that governs the spectral energy distributions of young ultracool dwarfs. Metallicity is unlikely to be such a parameter, given the metallicity of local high-mass stars <ref type="bibr">(Nieva &amp; Przybilla 2012</ref>) and YMG stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Biazzo et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barenfeld et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">McCarthy &amp; Wilhelm 2014</ref>) appear to be basically solar (σ 0.1 dex in metallicity). Other possibilities might be early formation history, rotation, or inclination.</p><p>We included some objects in our study with unusual properties possibly connected to youthfulness. Very red objects with field gravities turn out to have IR absolute magnitudes similar to ordinary field objects, as do ultracool field dwarfs with strong Hα emission. The latest-type red fld-g objects do overlap the color-magnitude positions of the young late-L dwarfs, meaning they might provide an interesting case study for extreme cloud formation. The extreme redness of young field L dwarfs is believed to be due to extreme clouds, which in turn are believed to be the consequence of reduced surface gravity. But we find two field-gravity objects (2MASS J2148+4003 and WISE J2335+4511) also demonstrate such extreme near-IR properties. Thus, the current theoretical framework for the extreme red and faint magnitudes of late-L dwarfs is incomplete.</p><p>Young field brown dwarfs are appealing in large part given their potential utility as analogs for brown dwarf and planetary companions around stars, given the observational difficulties of studying the latter. We find the photometric properties of the free-floating and companion populations are quite similar. However, the young field population may inhabit more extreme parameter space, as seen by the brighter and/or redder locations of the young late-M and L dwarfs in the near-IR color magnitude diagrams relative to known young companions. With the young field population now well-mapped, progress on this issue will rely on discovery of more substellar companions to determine whether the two populations do in fact differ in their physical range, which might reflect differences in formation history, photospheric processes, and/or composition. In a similar vein, theoretical models for ultracool objects roughly coincide with the data, but the observational properties are more extreme than the models, with the young objects being redder and/or brighter than the models especially among the young late-M and early-L dwarfs (contrary to the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>We have conducted a comprehensive membership analysis of all young field objects with parallaxes. We establish several new members of young moving groups, as well as strengthen, revise, or refute previously published memberships of many others. Altogether, memberships assigned by BANYAN II for young field objects appear to be reliable when group membership probabilities are 80% (except for the less-certain Columba and Argus groups), whereas objects with lower group membership probabilities appear in fact to be field objects. Similarly, objects with high membership probabilities in well-established groups have BANYAN II kinematic distances that are comparable to actual parallactic distances ( 10% errors). For the remaining objects, either with lower membership probabilities or assignments to the field population, the BANYAN II statistical distances have significantly larger errors than reported. (We caution that our comparison with BANYAN II is based on our specific sample of objects, which does not uniformly sample the full range of spectral types, photometric properties, and moving groups.) Out of the nine planetarymass (13 M Jup ) objects from the BANYAN II searches (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. 2015a</ref>) that coincide with our sample, we weaken or eliminate the case for planetary-mass status for eight of them.</p><p>With a robust sample of objects in young moving groups, our work provides age-calibrated benchmarks for ultracool dwarfs. We find clear evolution in the mix of IR gravity classifications, with 20 Myr objects being entirely composed of vl-g objects and by ∼100 Myr most objects being int-g. At the older ages, we note that objects of the same spectral type can have different gravity classifications even within the same moving group, as first suggested by <ref type="bibr">Allers &amp; Liu (2013)</ref>. Our benchmark sample defines empirical color-magnitude isochrones for substellar evolution from 10-150 Myr, and shows that current BT-Settl evolutionary models are not a good match to the data. The few young age-benchmarks in the L/T transition regime (late-L to mid-T) suggest that the J-band brightening may be slightly enhanced for young objects compared to the field. But the evolutionary locus in the near-IR CMD does not appear to be significantly different, namely young early/mid-T dwarfs, appear to have similar IR absolute magnitudes as the field sequence and even spectrally peculiar objects. Overall, the L/T transition on the CMD is relatively narrow in near-IR absolute magnitudes (1 mag).</p><p>As a by-product of such a large parallax sample, we have identified a number of individual objects that warrant specialized followup. Four objects appear to be very young (Myr), distant (200 pc) brown dwarfs (GJ 3276, 2MASS J0435−1414, 2MASS J0557−1359, and 2MASS J0619−2903), at least one of which has a well-detected circumstellar disk. Another candidate disk-bearing object might be a member of the β Pic moving group (2MASS J1935−2846), which would make it the oldest disk found to date around a brown dwarf. The two aforementioned high-velocity int-g objects would benefit from high resolution spectroscopy to assess their gravity and abundances.</p><p>Our work enables several future lines of inquiry. A larger sample of parallaxes at later types than covered by our sample would help delineate the L/T transition at low gravities. A larger sample of directly imaged substellar companions would help to clarify if the companion population and young field populations have different photometric properties, perhaps reflecting different origins. Memberships for strong YMG candidates with parallaxes should be further secured by measuring radial velocities. Expanding the stellar census in these groups will be an important complementary effort, energized by the upcoming high-precision astrometric catalogs from Gaia. The culmination of such work will establish the full membership census from the highest mass stars to the planetary-mass regime, creating a rich empirical grid of stellar and substellar evolution to test our understanding of how low-mass self-gravitating objects form and evolve.</p><p>We greatly appreciate the CFHT staff for their constant observing support and dedication to delivering the highest-quality data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Notes on Individual Objects</head><p>For each object, the optical and near-IR spectral types are listed in parentheses, along with gravity classifications when available. Objects noted in the literature as having low gravity but without a formal gravity classification are indicated by "low-g" (also see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 1</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Using the same spectrum, we assign a spectral type of L6 in the AL13 system to 2MASS J0030−1450 <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">(Table 4)</ref>. We note that our spectral type is close to the optical L7 spectral type of this object (Kirkpatrick et al. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The spectral classification system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> uses visual comparison to spectral templates to assign near-IR spectral types and gravities, whereas the AL13 system uses a combination of visual comparison and spectral indices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> use gravity designations of β/γ/δ for near-IR spectra (the same notation as the Cruz et al. 2009 optical gravity classification), which are similar to (but not the same as) the near-IR int-g and vl-g gravity classifications of the AL13 system. 2000). At low spectral resolution, the AL13 system can not classify the gravities of objects with spectral types later than L5. We can visually compare the spectrum of 2MASS J0030−1450 to vl-g and int-g L6 objects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 26</ref>). 2MASS J0030−1450 has has deeper FeH and alkali features relative to the L6 int-g standard, indicating that it likely has higher gravity. Overall, the features of 2MASS J0030−1450 better match the field dwarf standard, so we adopt a spectral type of L6 fld-g. Oddly, our calculated indices agree with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref>, but the overall classification does not. We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> use their own (template-based) spectral type when determining the AL13 gravity classification of 2MASS J0030−1450, but the AL13 gravity classification is designed to incorporate AL13 spectral type classifications which are derived from both index-based and visual typing (as described in Section 2.3.2). This likely explains the discrepant gravity classifications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> find that 2MASS J0030−1450 is a possible ARG member, with 26% probability and 3% contamination, based on a parallactic distance of 27 ± 3 pc from <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Vrba et al. (2004)</ref>. Their resulting mass estimate is 10.8 +0.4 −0.6 M Jup , based on an age of 30-50 Myr. While we do not provide a new parallax for this object, our reclassification of the spectrum as field gravity would have led Gagné et al. to remove this object from YMG consideration. However, we retain it given (1) the uncertain diversity of gravity classifications within young groups (Section 4.5) and (2) the ambiguous age/nature of the Argus moving group ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. 2015</ref>). Both of these aspects suggest a substantially higher mass for this object. place the object at its minimum velocity distance from the Argus group (based on Torres et al.) of 4.9 km s −1 . We consider this a possible Argus member for now, but a radial velocity for this object and a renewed evalution of the Argus group are needed to clarify the situation. 2MASSW J0033239−152131 (L4β/L1 fld-g): <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> characterized this as low gravity based on relatively weak K I, CaH, and FeH in its optical spectrum compared to field objects. However, they caution that its atypically weak VO compared to other young L dwarfs (which show enhanced VO absorption) may indicate that its age is near the ∼100 Myr limit where low-gravity indications are present.  find that this object has near-IR FeH, VO, K I and H-band continuum features consistent with field dwarfs and classify 2MASS J0033−1521 as L1 fld-g. Our parallax shows that the JHK absolute magnitudes of this object are comparable to other field objects.</p><p>Based on a parallax-free analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> found this is a modest probability ARG member, with 32% probability, 22% contamination, and a statistical distance of 17.3 +1.  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The spectrum is slightly redder than a normal L8, so we assign a spectral type of L8 (red). U V W =2.6. Thus, BPMG membership seems marginal at best given the velocity distance.</p><p>2MASSI J0253597+320637 (M7 low-g/M6 fld-g): Based on a parallax-free analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>    <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref>, BANYAN II analysis indicates that ARG membership may be an option for this object, which is also found from our kinematics-only analysis, but this object most likely belongs to the Castor moving group, which is not included in the standard BANYAN II model. We find that this object is faint for its spectral type at J band, but its H and K-band absolute magnitudes are comparable to the field population.</p><p>At a distance of only 9.10 ± 0.10 pc, this object is the nearest known young brown dwarf. In addition, it is one of the very closest known young moving group members, with only the M2 dwarf BD+01 2447 (7.07±0.02 pc; van Leeuwen 2007) in the AB Dor moving group being closer ( <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. 2008</ref>) and the young M dwarfs AT Mic (10.7±0.4 pc) and AU Mic (9.91 ± 0.10 pc) in the β Pic moving group ( <ref type="bibr">Zuckerman et al. 2001</ref>) being comparable. 2MASS J04070752+1546457 (L3.5/L3 fld-g): This is a strong (EW ∼ 60Å60Å) Hα emitting L3.5 dwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Reid et al. 2008</ref>), classified as fld-g by . It has normal J-band absolute magnitudes for its near-IR spectral type but slightly brighter in K and W 2 than the field sequence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 10</ref>), On both near-and mid-IR CMDs, this is makes it a clear fld-g interloper in the vl-g sequence, being unusually red in J − K, H − W1, and W1 − W2 given its absolute magnitude.</p><p>Gagné et al. (2015a) note some marginal visual signs of low gravity but do not associate it with any YMG. Our kinematics-only BANYAN analysis finds 49% Y.FLD and 40% O.FLD, perhaps in accord with possible mild youth seen in the near-IR spectrum. For these spectral subclasses, the IR absolute magnitudes of the young and field populations are very similar, so they provide no age discrimination. We assign a generic "field" membership to this object, as we cannot distinguish between the young and old possibilities.</p><p>GJ 3276, a.k.a. 2MASS J04221413+1530525 (M6γ/M6 vl-g): Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) note that its near-IR spectrum appears reddened and that it has a mid-IR excess indicative of a circumstellar disk, which combined with its sky position points to possible membership with the Taurus star formation region ∼10 • away. Our CFHT parallax puts this at a distance (240 +70 −40 pc) that is marginally consistent with the young stars in Taurus (130-160 pc; <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Torres et al. 2009</ref>). (See Section 3 for a discussion of the highly discrepant parallax from <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. 2012</ref>.) The absolute magnitudes of this object derived from our CFHT parallax are ≈5 mag brighter than the field dwarf sequence and comparable to very young (3 Myr old) mid-M dwarfs in the Taurus star-forming region (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Luhman et al. 2003</ref>).</p><p>CFHT-Hy-20 (-/T2.5): The depth of this object's JH and HK water absorption bands are well-matched to the T2 standard SDSSp J1254−0122, though its H-band and K-band methane absorption and Y J water absorption are slightly deeper and would suggest a type of T2.5 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Fig- ure 27)</ref>. Our visual and index-based types are in good agreement, and we assign a final near-IR spectral type of T2.5. This agrees well with the T2 assigned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bouvier et al. (2008)</ref>, based on their very low resolution (R = 50) near-IR spectrum of CFHT-Hy-20 compared to field T dwarfs observed with their same instrument.</p><p>CFHT-Hy-20 lies 3 • from the center of the Hyades (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_56">Figure 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bouvier et al. 2008)</ref>. No radial velocity is available, but it has a minimum U V W distance of 2.5 km s −1 from the Hyades. We measure a parallactic distance of 32.5 +1.5 −1.7 pc, which agrees well with the Hipparcos distance of 46.34 ± 0.27 pc given the cluster tidal radius of 10 pc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Perryman et al. 1998</ref>). We therefore confirm this object as a Hyades member.</p><p>2MASSI J0435145−141446 (M6δ/M7 vl-g): A parallax-free analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> indicates this is a young field object (&gt;99.9% probability) with a statistical distance of 10.5±1.6 pc. We measure a parallactic distance of 87.7 +9.4</p><p>−11.8 pc, with a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis still indicating &gt;99.9% Y.FLD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Cruz et al. (2003)</ref> noted that the object lies in the direction of the high-galactic latitude MBM20 (LDN 1642) cloud, which has an estimated distance of 124 ± 19 pc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Schlafly et al. 2014</ref>). Our parallax is 1.7σ different than the cloud, placing the object in front of or plausibly within the cloud. The radial velocity for the object (E. Shkolnik, priv. comm.) is notably different than the cloud's CO emission at ≈0-1 km s −1 (Liljestrom 1991; <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Russeil et al. 2003)</ref>, perhaps due to spectroscopic binarity or unusual kinematics. Our proper motion measurement of (µ α , µ δ ) = (−0.6 ± 1.9, +9.3 ± 2.0) mas/yr is consistent with that of the IRASexcess star EW Eri associated with the cloud ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">Sandell et al. 1987)</ref>, which has a proper motion of (−5.3 ± 5.6, +7.1 ± 5.5 mas/yr) from UCAC4 ( <ref type="bibr">Zacharias et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) noted that this object's WISE photometry (3.6-22 µm) shows no sign of a disk, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Malinen et al. (2014)</ref> associate this object with a source detected in far-IR, submillimeter, and millimeter data (100-1100 µm). The overall (1.2-1100 µm) spectral energy distribution points to a Class III source, namely one without a substantial circumstellar disk but still possessing residual material at large separations. A modified blackbody fit finds a dust color temperature of only ≈15 K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Malinen et al. (2014)</ref> remark that the object is clearly extended at 160 µm and overall conclude 2MASS J0435−14 is an embedded young object, consistent with the very bright absolute magnitudes derived from our parallax.</p><p>Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) also noted that the spectrum of this M7 vl-g dwarf appears to be highly reddened, with a rough estimate of A V ∼ 7.4 based on its observed J − K color (1.93 ± 0.04 mag in 2MASS) compared other young objects of similar spectral type. Similarly, we also found that young late-M dwarfs in Taurus from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Allers et al. (2009)</ref> are a reasonable match to the near-IR spectrum assuming a modest reddening (A V ∼ 4.5). However, we note that the <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Cruz et al. (2003)</ref> optical spectrum shows a normal continuum shape, which is inconsistent with reddening as is the overall Class III SED. Instead, we suggest that the unusual near-IR spectrum and very red J − K color may be manifestations of very low surface gravity, more extreme than young field objects ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 28</ref>). Low surface gravity is also consistent with the very bright absolute magnitudes and its optical gravity classication of δ, the only such object in our entire sample. Given the low effective temperature, relatively large bolometric luminosity (≈0.05 L ⊙ , from scaling the Malinen et al. results to our parallax), and very low surface gravity, this object appears to be a very young (1 Myr) brown dwarf with a residual circumstellar disk. Our work now provides a parallax distance of 21.1 +0.4 −0.5 pc and a refined proper motion of (+53.6 ± 1.3, −104.6 ± 1.5) mas yr −1 . With this new information we confirm SDSS J0443+0002 as a member of β Pic (99.8% probability from our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis).</p><p>2MASS J05012406−0010452 (L4γ/L3 vl-g): <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> identify this as a possible COL (49%) or CAR (17%) member, based on a parallactic distance of 13.1 ± 0.8 pc from <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faherty et al. (2012)</ref>, with an associated mass estimate of 10.2 +0.8 −1.0 M Jup . As discussed in Section 3.1 and shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Figure 4</ref>, their parallax is the among the most discrepant of all the results with our CFHT measurements (20.7±0.6 pc) and also disagrees with Zapatero <ref type="bibr">Osorio et al. (2014)</ref>. Our CFHT distance leads to brighter absolute magnitudes, and our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis gives &gt;99.9% probability of young field membership. So our new parallax weakens the case for 2MASS J0501−0010 being a planetary-mass object.</p><p>We note that the membership lists of Columba and Carina differ substantially between BANYAN II and <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. (2008)</ref>, with the BANYAN II lists having larger U V W XY Z extents. Using our CFHT parallax and the BANYAN II membership lists, radial velocities of 19.2 and 18.4 km s −1 would would place the object at minimum velocity distances of 8.5 and 8.2 km s −1 from the Columba and Carina group cores, respectively, which is rather far given the dispersions of the known members. We conclude that 2MASS J0501−0010 is a young field object. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Cruz et al. (2007)</ref> originally identified this as a giant during a search for nearby ultracool dwarfs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Shkolnik et al. (2009)</ref> found this object is actually a M7.0 dwarf and estimated a photometric distance of 60 pc assuming an age of 10 Myr based on its strong lithium absorption, low-gravity features in the optical, and possible Hα accretion. The Allers &amp; Liu (2013) near-IR classification of vl-g is in accord with this young age. Its 2MASS JHK colors are consistent with late-type dwarfs, rather than giants.</p><p>Our parallax measurement is very marginal (S/N = 2.8) and places the object at ≈300 pc. Our result agrees with a similarly poor parallactic distance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Shkolnik et al. (2012)</ref> of 526±277 pc. Based on the evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Chabrier et al. (2000)</ref>, such a high luminosity implies that this is a very young (∼1 Myr old) brown dwarf. Similarly, its K-band absolute magnitude of 4.4±0.8 mag is ≈1.5 mag brighter than the individual components of the very young (∼1 Myr) M6.5 eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184−0546085 in Orion ( <ref type="bibr">Stassun et al. 2006</ref>). A comparison of the near-IR spectrum of 2MASS J0557−1359 with the aforementioned 2MASS J0435−1414 shows the two have a comparable surface gravities, both more extreme than young field objects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Fig- ure 28)</ref>.</p><p>A parallax-free analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> indicated that 2MASS J0557−1359 is a young field member (99.7%) with a statistical distance of 45 +12 −8 pc. Our parallactic distance of 290 +80 −110 pc suggests that 2MASS J0557−1359 is beyond the 200-pc spatial extent of the BANYAN II field model.  and therefore outside the spectral type range of their gravity classification scheme. They deredden the spectrum (A V = 6.5) and note that it appears low in gravity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 29)</ref>, and that its mid-IR photometry suggests a circumstellar disk. A parallax-free analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> indicate this object is a modest probability COL member, with a 81% membership, 22% contamination, a statistical distance of 55.8 +5.6 −6 pc, and a mass of 15-23 M Jup based on an age of 20-40 Myr. We measure a parallactic distance of 270 +270 −100 pc making 2MASS J0619−2903 likely beyond the 200-pc extent of the BANYAN II field model. The very bright absolute magnitudes derived from our CFHT parallax support the notion that this is a very young low-mass star.</p><p>Comparing our new 2015 spectrum with the 2008 one from Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) shows that the object appears to be spectrally variable ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 30)</ref>. We classify the new spectrum as M6 vl-g, slightly later than the published M5 type. (The published classification did not include a gravity class, since the object was too early-type, but the first-epoch spectrum was visually identified as low gravity.) The individual H 2 O spectral indices suggest a slightly later type in the second-epoch spectrum <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">(Table 4)</ref>.   <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> discovered and classified this object as "extremely red," noting that its extremely unusual near-IR spectrum made classification very difficult with available methods. We visually compared this object to spectral standards, finding a spectral type of T2 in the J-band and T1.5 in the K-band. The H-band spectrum, however, is very unusual, with the central continuum plateau resembling an L8-L9 spectrum but the surrounding water absorption bands being closer to T2. The spectral indices in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> indicate a spectral type of T1.7 ± 1.5, while WISE J0754+7909 is much redder than a typical T2. Thus, we assign a spectral type of T2p (red) to WISE J0754+7909, with the caveat that it warrants more detailed examination.</p><p>2MASS J08354256−0819237 (L5/-): This object is not in our CFHT sample, but it is in the sample of parallaxes that we plot for the field population (Sections 4.1 and 4.2). It has a parallax from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andrei et al. (2011)</ref> and is one of the nearest objects of its spectral type (8.5 +0.9 −0.7 pc). It is also one of the reddest with (J − K) MKO = 1.97 ± 0.03 mag (and M (J) = 13.42 ± 21). Thus, in our Y JHK CMDs it appears as a possible vl-g sequence interloper. To our knowledge, this object has no properties associated with low gravity or youth. Examination by us of its near-IR SpeX prism spectrum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Burgasser et al. 2010</ref>) suggests the object's gravity is on the borderline between fld-g and int-g. G 196-3B, a.k.a. 2MASS J10042066+5022596 (L3β/L3 vl-g): As a well studied companion to a young M3 star that lacks a parallax measurement, the age of G 196-3B has been estimated to be anywhere from 20-300 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rebolo et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Kirkpatrick et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Shkolnik et al. 2009</ref>).

Our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis favors young field, which we adopt as the outcome. that SDSS J1025+3212 has an unusual L7.5 spectrum, with scattered spectral indices indicating a spectral type of L4.5-T2 and hints of variability based on two epochs of spectra. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> listed SDSS J1025+3212 as a potential young object on the basis of weak K I and H 2 O features. AL13 determined a spectral type of L7 for this object, but could not reliably determine its gravity, as the AL13 system only provides gravity classification for low-resolution spectra with spectral types earlier than L6. Recently, two bona-fide young L7 objects have been discovered, PSO J318.5−22 (L7 vl-g; <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Liu et al. 2013b</ref>) and WISE J0047+6803 (L7 int-g; <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Gizis et al. 2015</ref>), which allows for a visual assessment of the gravity of SDSS J1025+3212 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">(Figure 31</ref>). We do not find evidence of low gravity, as the FeH absorption bands, alkali lines, and H-band continuum shape are all consistent with fld-g. The H-cont index from AL13 also yields a score of "0", which corresponds to fld-g. We assign a spectral type of L7 fld-g.</p><p>Based on a parallax-free analysis and adopting the <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al.

Using our fld-g gravity classification and CFHT parallax (26.8 +0.9 −0.8 pc), a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis finds a probability of 99.8% of belonging to the old field population. (If youth is assumed based on the optical spectrum, then the result is &gt;99.9% membership for young field.) Its U V W position is far from any known young group. We also note that our parallax gives absolute magnitudes for SDSS J1025+3212 (e.g., M J = 14.75 ± 0.09 mag) that are more consistent with field objects of the same spectral type (M J = 14.7 mag; Dupuy &amp; Liu 2012) than with the low-gravity L7 dwarfs PSO J318.5−22 (M J = 15.42 ± 0.09 mag) and WISE J0047+6803 (M J = 15.07 ± 0.08 mag) Thus, this appears to be an old field object. 2MASSW J1139511−315921, a.k.a. TWA 26 (M9 low-g/M9 vl-g): Gizis (2002) identified this young brown dwarf as a candidate TWA member based on its proximity to previously known members and its low-gravity optical spectral features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Mohanty et al. (2003)</ref> found a radial velocity consistent with the other TWA members, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Reid (2003)</ref> suggested that this object is not a TWA member based on the (low-quality) proper motion available at the time.

Using the near-IR spectrum of , we classify 2MASS J1331+3407 as L0 fld-g. The (J−K S ) 2MASS color of 2MASS J1331+3407 (1.448±0.035 mag) is slightly redder than the J−K S color of L0 field dwarfs (median color = 1.24 mag, RMS = 0.18 mag; <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Schmidt et al. 2010</ref>). Likewise, the near-IR spectrum of 2MASS J1331+3407 is slightly redder than a field L0 standard (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 10</ref> of Allers &amp; Liu), but otherwise shows no spectral peculiarities.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al.

The absolute magnitudes of DENIS J1705−0516 are also consistent with field objects, so its spectrophotometry and kinematics are in accord.</p><p>Reid • 4 at the NICMOS epoch. (Note that our quoted errors do not account for the uncertainty in the proper motion of the faint source.) We therefore conclude that this possible companion is a background object, which is seemingly at odds with a recent note by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Dieterich et al. (2014)</ref> that they observe orbital motion in their astrometry of DENIS J1705−0516.</p><p>2MASS J18212815+1414010 (L4.5/L5p fld-g): <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. (2008b)</ref> flag this as a potential young object, based on its slightly red color (2MASS J − K S = 1.78 ± 0.05 mag), peculiar near-IR spectrum (including somewhat triangular H-band peak and strong CO), and low tangential velocity of 10 km s −1 (based on a photometric distance of 9.8 ± 1.3 pc). Using the low resolution near-IR spectrum of <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. (2008b)</ref>, we determine a near-IR spectral type of L5 fld-g and similarly assign a peculiar designation to denote its red color and triangular H-band continuum shape.</p><p>Our astrometry gives a tangential velocity of 15.20 ± 0.17 km s −1 and a parallactic distance of 9.56 ± 0.09 pc. The photometric and parallactic distances agree well because 2MASS J1821+1414 has normal absolute magnitudes compared to the field sequence. Also its position in the near-IR CMDs resides among the field L dwarfs. Similar to 2MASS J0314+1603 and DENIS J1705−0516, this object has kinematics consistent with the Ursa Major moving group but resides far from the core members on the sky. The ≈400-500 Myr age of the group would be consistent with the near-IR gravity classification. Thus, we conclude that 2MASS J1821+1414 is likely to be an older dusty object, as opposed to a young one as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. (2008b)</ref>. This is consistent with the notion that objects with triangular H-band spectra are not necessarily young, as found by .</p><p>Based on a parallax-free analysis using an radial velocity of 9.8 ± 0.8 km s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Blake et al. 2010;</ref>) and an assumption of low gravity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> assign this young field membership (&gt;99.9%) with a statistical distance of 13.3 ± 2.8 pc. With our new CFHT parallax and no assumption of youth, a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis reports 82% old field population and 18% young field population. Its U V W places it far from any known young group. Altogether we assign it to the old field population.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> found a slim possibility for BPMG membership (9%), with a statistical distance of 57±5 pc and favoring the hypothesis that the system is a binary. (Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging by us finds the source to be single at 0.07 ′′ resolution at K band.) For young field membership, they derive a statistical distance of 62 +12 −10 pc. Our new CFHT parallax (70.4 +6.5 −5.5 pc) yields a smaller BPMG possibility (1.1%) from the kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis, but shows that the XY Z position of this object is quite compatible with known BPMG members ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 2.0). This BPMG probability increases modestly if the radial velocity for the system (E. <ref type="bibr">Shkolnik 2015, priv. comm.</ref>) is included in the analysis but is still small. We note that this object lies beyond the ≈50-pc limiting distance of the original <ref type="bibr">Zuckerman et al. (2001)</ref> search that identified the β Pic moving group, and it is also farther than 42 out of the 48 members identified by <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. (2008)</ref>. Thus the relatively low BPMG probability assigned by the BANYAN II model may simply reflect the incomplete membership census for more distant stars. A radial velocity of −9.3 km s −1 would bring the object to 3.2 km s −1 from the group core. Altogether, we consider BPMG membership to be unlikely but still viable -further investigation is warranted. More precise U V W XY Z data for this object as well as a more expansive census of the β Pic stellar members would help refine the membership. <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Martín et al.

Both of these are noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Riaz &amp; Gizis (2008)</ref> to have excess thermal emission as short as 5 µm due to circumstellar disks that likely explains their red colors on this plot. The similar mid-infrared photometry of 2MASS J1935−2846 suggests that it too possesses circumstellar material. We note that the mid-IR excess of 2MASS J1935−2846 lends circumstantial support to the possibility of β Pic membership, since an older age would make a circumstellar disk more implausible. If confirmed, this would join the β Pic member 2MASS J0335+2342 as the oldest disks found to date around brown dwarfs.</p><p>2MASS J20135152−2806020 (M9 low-g/L0 vl-g): <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Reid et al. (2008)</ref> classify this object as a low-gravity M9 dwarf, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> indicate an optical spectral type of M8-M9 III. Our parallax detection and the resulting absolute magnitudes show that it is a dwarf. Near-IR spectra of the object from Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) also show that it is a low-gravity dwarf and not a giant.</p><p>A parallax-free BANYAN II analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> identified this as a low probability BPMG member, with a 43% probability, a 71% contamination rate, and a statistical distance of 44 +5 −4 pc, as well as an estimated mass of 15.7 +1.5 −0.6 M Jup from <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref>. Our new CFHT parallax (48 ± 3 pc) also suggests BPMG membership (70% probability) and places the object comfortably among the known members ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 1.0). The velocity offset between 2MASS J2013−2806 and the group would be only 2.2 km s −1 for a radial velocity of −8.1 km s −1 . Like 2MASS J1935−2806, we thus consider this a promising β Pic member, with radial velocity followup and a more complete group census needed. 2MASS J21403907+3655563 (-/M8p fld-g):  originally typed the near-IR spectrum of 2MASS J2140+3655 as "M8 pec" and noted that it appears to be redder than vB 10, the dwarf field M8 standard. We obtained a higher S/N spectrum of 2MASS J2140+3655 suitable for gravity classification on 2015 July 23 UT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 32)</ref>. The H-cont index of <ref type="bibr">Allers &amp; Liu (2013)</ref> indicates intermediate gravity, but the FeH z and K I indices are consistent with fld-g. We type 2MASS J2140+3655 as M8 fld-g but also assign a "p" designation to its spectral classification, to denote the peculiarity of having a triangular H-band continuum shape while lacking any other low-gravity indications. Its IR absolute magnitudes are consistent with field objects.</p><p>In contrast to Kirkpatrick et al., our new spectrum does not appear redder than vB 10 but instead is slightly bluer. To check for possible spectral variability, we obtained an additional spectrum of 2MASS J2140+3655 on 2015 September 25 UT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">(Figure 33</ref>). Our two spectra from 2015 are consistent with each other, making the  spectrum the discrepant one. In addition, the 2MASS J − K S color of this object (0.94 ± 0.13 mag) agrees with the synthetic 2MASS J −K S colors from our spectra (1.01 mag and 0.93 mag for our July and September spectra, respectively) and is bluer than vB 10 (1.14± 0.03 mag). Thus, 2MASS J2140+3655 does not appear to be systematically red for its spectral type. Assessing its potential variability would benefit from more observations. 2MASS J21481633+4003594 (L6/L6 fld-g): <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Looper et al. (2008b)</ref> discovered this object, noting that its red color, peculiar near-IR spectrum, and field-gravity optical spectrum indicate an unusually dusty photosphere. From their measured proper motion (1. ′′ 33 ± 0. ′′ 24, 75. • 6 ± 0. • 3), and estimated distance of 9.9 ± 1.3 pc, they estimated V tan = 62 km s −1 and suggested that such a value implied this object is not young but rather possibily high metallicity. Our proper motion of (0. ′′ 9041 ± 0. ′′ 0018, 59. • 63 ± 0. • 13) is 50% (1.8σ) smaller than theirs, and our parallax distance of 8.03 +0.11 −0.12 pc is 10% (0.6σ) smaller.  photometric distance turns out to be an overestimate, because this object is faint at J band compared to field objects.) Thus, we find a significantly smaller V tan = 34.4 ± 0.5 km s −1 , which is in fact consistent with the high end of tangential velocities for our low-gravity sample (Section 4.3).</p><p>A parallax-free BANYAN II analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> identified this as a modest ARG candidate, with a probability of 48%, a contamination rate of 37%, a statistical distance of 4.9 +0.4 −0.4 pc, and an estimated mass of 6-7 M Jup based on an age of 30-50 Myr. They also derived a statistical distance of 8.1 +0.8 −1.2 pc, under the assumption that the object is young. However, Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) classify the gravity as fld-g. Our new CFHT parallactic distance (8.03 +0.11 −0.08 pc) greatly favors field membership, 67% young field and 33% old field based on no prior assumption about the object's youth. The U V W are incompatible with any known young group. Thus, 2MASS J2148+4003 might have an intermediate age, old enough that spectroscopic signatures of gravity have receded but whose kinematics are still indicative of youth. Its mass is more uncertain and likely higher than estimated by Gagné et al. SIMP J215434.5−105530.8 (-/L4 int-g): Based on a parallax-free analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Gagné et al. (2014a)</ref> identify this as a ARG candidate, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Gagné et al. (2015b)</ref> reporting a revised 59% membership probability, 34% contamination rate, a statistical distance of 22.5 ± 2.4 pc, and an estimated mass of 10.3 +0.7 −0.3 M Jup based on an age of 30-50 Myr. We had independently identified this object as a low-gravity L dwarf during a search for nearby ultracool dwarfs using Pan-STARRS1 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Liu et al. 2013b</ref>) and had begun parallax observations prior to its published discovery. Using our resulting CFHT parallax (30.7 +1.0 −0.9 pc), a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis leads to ARG membership probability of 23% and a spatial position that is just beyond the known members ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 4.6). Its smallest velocity offset from ARG would be 6.0 km s −1 for a radial velocity of −14.5 km s −1 , using the <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. (2008)</ref> group properties. Radial velocity is needed for better assessment, but given the available data we favor young field membership and thus likely a higher mass than originally estimated. In our CFHT images we typically cleanly resolve this 1. ′′ 09 binary. Any images in which two sources were not detected by SExtractor were not used in our astrometric analysis. We report the individual solutions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>. The individual parallaxes are 41 ± 4 mas and 35 ± 4 mas, among the worst precision of our sample due to the difficulty in obtaining centroids for such a close pair. We adopt a common parallax of 38 ± 4 mas for the system. This object is the only case where something classified as vl-g lies closer to the field CMD sequence than the vl-g CMD sequence, although given the photometric and parallax uncertainties this is only a marginally significant discrepancy (≈2σ). Given a sample of 28 vl-g objects on our CMD plots, such a ≈2σ outlier is not unexpected. In fact, if we use the spectrum of this object to synthesize its (J − K S ) 2MASS color, we get a value 0.12 mag redder than the catalog value of 1.65 ± 0.11 mag, which would reduce the discrepancy to an ≈1σ. Therefore, we determine that this object is not unusual for its gravity classification.</p><p>Based on a parallax-free analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Gagné et al.

Its smallest possible velocity offset from BPMG would be a relatively large value of 6.0 km s −1 , for a radial velocity of −3.1 km s −1 . Altogether, we favor young field membership and thus the mass is more uncertain and likely to be higher than reported by Gagné et al.  <ref type="formula">(2005)</ref> first noted that 2MASS J2224−0158 has abnormally red colors for its spectral type ((J − K S ) 2MASS = 2.03 ± 0.04 mag), thus we assign a "p" designation to denote this spectral peculiarity.</p><p>2MASSW J2244316+204343 (L6.5/L6 vl-g): This object serves as the archetype for extremely red L dwarfs, with an ordinary optical spectrum but a very peculiar near-IR one <ref type="bibr">McLean et al. 2003</ref>). The very red near-IR colors, weak FeH and alkali features in the J-band, and triangular H-band spectra indicate this a low-gravity object (Allers &amp; Liu 2013a) as opposed to an ordinary (high-gravity) object with extreme cloud properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)</ref> suggest that the bland optical spectrum arises from a fortuitous degeneracy of photospheric chemistry, whereby the weakened alkali lines and stronger oxides due to reduced surface gravity act to mimic an earlier type L dwarf of higher gravity. As noted in Section 4.2, its near-IR absolute magnitudes are among the faintest in our sample (exceeded only by SDSS J2249+0044B), and on the CMD it appears to be an extension of the L dwarf sequence towards the very red planetary-mass objects 2MASS J1207−3932b and HR 8799b. SDSS J224953.46+004404.6AB (-/L3 int-g and -/L5 int-g): Allers et al. (2010) identified this as possible young object by examining the near-IR spectrum from <ref type="bibr">Nakajima et al. (2004)</ref> as well as their own low-resolution spectrum. They then resolved this object into a 0.32 ′′ binary with component spectral types of L3 and L5.

(2002)</ref>.</p><p>The secondary component of the binary has the faintest near-IR absolute magnitudes of our entire sample. Allers et al. estimated a photometric distance of 54 ± 16 pc by comparing to other young objects with distances, which was also consistent with the photometric distance to a wideseparation early-M dwarf comoving with the binary. We find that the object is closer, with a parallactic distance of 39.2 +2.3 −2.1 pc. The closer parallax distance also means that SDSS J2249+0044A and B are less luminous than assumed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Allers et al. (2010)</ref>. As a result, the estimated masses of the components are also smaller. For possible ages of 20-300 Myr, we estimate masses of 0.007-0.027 M ⊙ and 0.005-0.019 M ⊙ for the A and B components, respectively, based on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Saumon &amp; Marley (2008)</ref> f sed = 2 models.

Using our higher S/N spectrum <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">(Figure 31)</ref>, we determine a spectral type of L7 for WISE J2335+4511, based on visual classification (L9±2 in the J-band and L7±1 in the K-band) and the H 2 OD index (L6.9±0.9). The only index in the Allers &amp; Liu (2013) system applicable to low-resolution L7 spectra is the H-cont index. The H-cont index value for WISE J2335+4511 yields a gravity score of "0", indicating fld-g. The gravity of this object can be assessed by visual comparison to L7 vl-g and int-g spectra <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">(Figure 31)</ref>. Overall, the spectrum of WISE J2335+4511 appears intermediate between that of WISE J0047+6803 (L7 int-g) and the L7 field standard, showing subtle hints of low gravity in its FeH and alkali features but not distinct enough from the field standard to warrant an int-g classification. Thus, we assign a final spectral type of L7p fld-g to WISE J2335+4511, where the "p" derives from its red color and subtle spectral peculiarities.</p><p>As discussed in Section 4.2, WISE J2335+4511 also displays the unusual behavior of appearing with the vl-g sequence on CMDs where the color involves K-band but appearing with the field sequence on Y − J and Y − H CMDs.

Our new CFHT parallax (22.7 +0.7 −0.7 pc) yields old field membership at 73% with a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis, and young field at 27%. Thus we assign this to the general field population. 2MASS J23512200+3010540 (L5.5/L5 fld-g):  assign a near-IR type of L5 pec (red), while we assign a type of L5 fld-g to their spectrum without a peculiar flag. Using a parallax-free analysis and no assumption of youth, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Gagné et al. (2014b)</ref> identify this as a modest ARG candidate, with 47% membership probability, a 63% contamination rate, a statistical distance of 20.9 +2.0 −2.4 pc, and a mass of 9-11 M Jup based on an age of 30-50 Myr. The corresponding statistical distances for young and old field are 32.5 ± 6 pc and 47.8 +8.8 −9.2 pc, respectively. Based on its near-IR spectrum having only weak evidence for low gravity (consistent with our classification as fld-g), <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Gagné et al. (2015a)</ref> place this in the field population, with 93% probability and a 6% contamination rate. Using our new CFHT parallax (24.3 +0.8 −0.9 pc), its spatial position is at the outskirts of the known members ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 5.0), and a kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis gives 89% probability for ARG membership. Its smallest velocity offset from the group would be 3.2 km s −1 for a radial velocity of −3.4 km s −1 . Given the uncertain state of this group's membership and thus its age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bell et al. 2015</ref>), the presence of low-gravity spectral features seems to be an inappropriate selection criterion at this point. Thus we consider Argus membership to be viable despite the absence of low-gravity spectra, with more data needed both for this object and the group as whole.</p><p>McLean, I. S., McGovern, M.

Most objects have distances that agree to within 20%, which is dominated by the uncertainty in the kinematic distances since the parallax errors are typically &lt;6%. Although the most visible outliers are those with CFHT parallaxes placing them at much larger distances, overall the kinematic distances for the "young field" population show a slight preference for being systematically 11% larger than our parallax distances. Data points without obvious error bars have uncertainties smaller than the plotting symbol. The histograms in the righthand panels show percentages computed as .-2MASS JHK S absolute magnitudes for all known field late-M and L dwarfs with parallaxes, near-IR spectral types, and spectroscopic evidence of youth. (About 80% of the objects are from this paper's CFHT parallaxes.) Spectral types and gravity classifications are mostly based on the Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) system (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 1</ref>). Objects labeled as "low g" (HR 6037 Ba and Bb [both M9] and β Pic b <ref type="bibr">[L1]</ref>) appear young spectroscopically, but their spectra have insufficient wavelength coverage for a formal gravity classification. Objects labeled as "fld-g red" have field gravities but unusually red colors highlighted in the literature. The errors on the absolute magnitudes are typically smaller than the plotting symbol. The thick black line shows our fit for field (old) ultracool dwarfs, and the grey swath shows the 1σ scatter about that fit.

Mean colors and magnitudes for low-gravity objects are marked by large, labeled open squares with orange lines connecting them to the mean field population location of the same spectral type. On average, the low-gravity sequence is brighter in both J and K at roughly the same J − K color as the field for early spectral types. Then, going to later spectral types, the low-gravity sequence gradually becomes redder in J − K as it becomes much fainter in J and somewhat fainter in K.

This suggests either truly young objects acquire large space motions soon after birth or cases of old objects that somehow display spectral signatures of youth. The red fld-g objects with V tan &gt; 35 km s −1 are either at the earliest spectral types (2MASS J1331+3407) or latest (WISE J0206+2640, WISE J0754+7909).    <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> alongside our low-gravity parallax sample (vl-g) and the field population.

We plot the highest gravity models (log(g) = 5.5 dex in green) for comparison to lower gravities (log(g) = 4.0, 4.5 dex in blue), where the lowest gravities are only complete for T eff = 1100-1500 K.

Based on a parallactic distance of 31.3 ± 3.5 pc and proper mo- tion of (+8.9 ± 3.5, +10.7 ± 3.5) mas yr −1 from Faherty et al. (2012), Malo et al.

(2014b), 2MASS J0608−2753 was excluded from the list of bona fide members based on their proper motion significance criterion (S/N &gt; 5σ). Gagné et al. (2014b) then indicated 2MASS J0608−2753 as a peripheral COL candidate, with 4% probability and 2% contamination, finding that BPMG mem- bership is not viable in their model due to the RV measurement.

(2015a) classify this as M7.5β and assign this to ARG with 88.9% probability and 0.6% contamination rate, based on a parallax from Dittmann et al. (2014) and no radial velocity information. Gagné et al. (2015b) estimate a mass of 20.6 +2.5 −1.7 M Jup based on an age of 30-50 Myr. Using the published parallax and an RV from Deshpande et al. (2013), our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis robustly places the object in the young field population (&gt;99.9%). In U V W XY Z, this object barely overlaps the spatial positions of the most distant members of Argus ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 4.8) and is 120 pc from the group core. Also its U V W position is 22.2 ± 0.4 km s −1 from the mean group velocity, placing it far beyond the ≈1 km s −1 dispersion of the known members ( ˜ χ 2 U V W = 299). Thus we categorize this as a young field object and hence expect a more uncertain (and likely higher) mass than originally reported.</figDesc></figure>

(2013) classified the low resolution infrared spectrum of LP 261-75B as L4.5 fld-g. Using the same spec- trum, we determine a later spectral type of L6 in AL13 system, in agreement with its optical spectral type of L6 (Kirkpatrick et al. 2000). At low spectral resolution, the AL13 system can not classify the gravity of an L6 object, so we use visual comparison. Figure 26 compares the spectrum of LP 261- 75B to vl-g, int-g, and fld-g L6 standards as well as the aforementioned 2MASS J0030−1450. Overall, the spectrum of LP 261-75B is very similar to that of 2MASS J0030−1450 but has deeper FeH and alkali features indicating likely higher gravity. The spectral features of LP 261-75B are better matched to the fld-g template than the int-g template, and thus we classify LP 261-75B as L6 fld-g. Based on a parallax-free analysis and no assumption of youth, Gagné et al. (2015a) indicated this as a possible ABDMG member, with 19% probability, 31% contamination, and a statisti- cal distance of 32.5 +1.6 −2.0 pc. While our new parallactic distance for LP 261-75A (31.6 +1.2 −1.4 pc) agrees well, our kinematics-only BANYAN II analysis reports &gt;99.9% Y.FLD membership. The XY Z is broadly consistent with known AB Dor members ( ˜ χ 2 XY Z = 1.9), but the U V W is off by 15.2 ± 1.1 km s −1 , much larger than the group dispersion ( ˜ χ 2 U V W = 64). Thus we categorize this as a young field object.</figDesc></figure>

Based on a high-quality composite optical spectrum, Kirkpatrick et al. (2008) assigned a spectral type of L5.5. Burgasser et al. (2011) resolved 2MASS J1315−2649 into binary and determined component spectral types of L3.5±2.5 and T7±0.6 from H-band spectra. Using the composite near-IR spectrum of Burgasser et al. (2011), we classify 2MASS J1315−2649AB as L6 fld-g on the Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) system. The composite near-IR spectrum shows subtle peculiarities, but these do not appear low-gravity in nature, and the H-cont index is consistent with field gravity. As discussed by Burgasser et al., the peculiar spectrum is well-explained by unresolved L+T binarity.</figDesc></figure>

However, the known members of TWA have a filamentary XY Z distribution (e.g. Weinberger et al. 2013), and 2MASS J1411−2119 is not well aligned with this.

(About 80% of the objects are from this paper's CFHT parallaxes.) Spectral types and gravity classifications are mostly based on the Allers &amp; Liu (2013a) system (see Table 1). Objects labeled as "low g" (HR 6037 Ba and Bb [both M9] and β Pic b [L1]) appear young spectroscopically, but their spectra have insufficient wavelength coverage for a formal gravity classification. Objects labeled as "fld-g red" have field gravities but unusually red colors highlighted in the literature. The errors on the absolute magnitudes are typically smaller than the plotting symbol. The thick black line shows our fit for field (old) ultracool dwarfs, and the grey swath shows the 1σ scatter about that fit. The colored lines show the linear fits for the vl-g and int-g samples (Table 10); the anomalously faint L3 object 2MASS J1207−3932b has been excluded from the line fits.

Even these models intended for comparison to young planetary-mass objects such as HR 8799b do not accurately follow the low-gravity (vl-g) sequence defined by our sample. (Note that our vl-g sample is expected to include objects above 20 M Jup . Plotting of these iso-mass model tracks is meant to illustrate the current theoretical locus relative to the data, not to assign actual masses to the vl-g sample using the models.)</figDesc></figure>

Top left: Our empirical vl-g sequence, the field sequence from Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012), and BT-Settl isochrones ranging from 1 Myr to 10 Gyr. Although older isochrones provide a reasonable match to the field sequence, our vl-g sequence tends to be redder than the models. No model isochrones match the faint (M J 14 mag), red portion of the sequence. Top middle to bottom right: Subsets of our sample that belong to young moving groups (10-200 Myr) shown alongside isochrones encompassing each group's age (Bell et al. 2015). Overall, model isochrones do not tend to match the locus of the observations at any age.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> In principle, spectroscopic distance estimates can be computed from fitting model atmospheres to the observed spectra and assuming a radius (Bowler et al. 2009), though current models have not yet been validated for this purpose, even for old (high-gravity) field objects (Liu et al. 2011a; Cushing et al. 2011).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> LP 415-22 is listed in SIMBAD as a Hyades member, but our proper motion and parallax rule out this association for any assumed radial velocity, in agreement with previous work using only the proper motion (van Altena 1969).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> For mid/late-T dwarfs, the ratios of the near-IR continuum flux peaks are known to be sensitive to metallicity and gravity (e.g. Liu et al. 2007; Burningham et al. 2009), and Naud et al. (2014) suggest a similar effect for the young T3.5 companion GU Psc b.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> NIRC2 wide camera distortion solution computed by H. Fu: http://herschel.uci.edu/fu/idl/nirc2wide/.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> Note that we consider proper motion discrepancies in units of mas yr −1 rather than σ since most authors do not report absolute proper motions, and even absolute proper motions may contain systematic errors associated with imperfect knowledge of the reference frame.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> http://www.as.utexas.edu/ ~ tdupuy/plx, maintained by T. Dupuy and last updated 2013 September 9.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> The paucity of young companions with M (J) ≈ 13 − 15 mag on the CMDs is interesting, though we note that the young mid-L dwarf companion 2MASS J0122−2439 B (Bowler et al. 2013) has M (JMKO) = 14.0 ± 0.3 mag based on a photometric distance. Its (J − K)MKO color is 2.28 ± 0.15 mag, placing it in the vl-g sequence.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="12"> We note that one red object, 2MASS J21481633+4003594 (L6/L6 fld-g), was previously thought to have a relatively high tangential velocity (Vtan= 62 km s −1 ; Looper et al. 2008b), but our parallax and proper motion give a lower velocity (34.4 ± 0.5 km s −1 ; see Appendix), consistent with the bulk of the low-gravity objects.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="13"> For all objects with discrepant optical and near-IR gravity classifications (2MASS J0033−1521 [L4β/L1 fld-g], 2MASS J0253+3206 [M7 low-g/M6 fld-g], LP 423-31 [M7 low-g/M6 fld-g], 2MASS J1022+0200 [M9β/M9 fld-g], and 2MASS J1022+5825 [L1β/L1 fld-g], the optical spectrum is low gravity while the IR spectrum is classified as fld-g. This suggests that optical spectra are somewhat more discriminating for gravity.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="14"> Dupuy et al. (2016a) have recently determined the individual component dynamical masses for the ultracool binary LSPM J1314+1320AB, which has an integrated-light spectrum on the borderline of fld-g and int-g. The measured masses and luminosities combined with evolutionary models yield an age estimate of 81±3 Myr, rather young compared to its spectroscopic gravity.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="17"> Their text and tables report both a 7% and 10% probability. We take the larger value as it is the one reported alongside the contamination rate.</note>
