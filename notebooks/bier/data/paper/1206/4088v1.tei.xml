				<p>Phase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) coronagraphs are a promising technology for imaging exoplanets, with the potential to detect Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. A PIAA system nominally consists of a pair of mirrors which reshape incident light without attenuation, coupled with one or more apodizers to mitigate diffraction effects or provide additional beam-shaping to produce a desired output profile. We present a set of equations that allow apodizers to be chosen for any given pair of mirrors, or conversely mirror shapes chosen for given apodizers, to produce an arbitrary amplitude profile at the output of the system. We show how classical PIAA systems may be designed by this method, and present the design of a novel 4-mirror system with higher throughput than a standard 2-mirror system. We also discuss the limitations due to diffraction and the design steps that may be taken to mitigate them.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The challenge of imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star has two primary components: contrast and angular resolution. An Earth twin orbiting a sun twin at 1 AU at a distance of 10 parsecs will be 10 10 times fainter than its host star, while being separated by only 100 milliarcseconds. For a 2m telescope with a circular aperture operating at 500nm-a reasonable expectation for a visible-band space telescope-this places the planet at 1.95λ/D in the image plane. Here, the intensity in the point spread function (PSF) from the host star will be ∼ 6 × 10 −3 lower than the peak of the diffraction pattern and over six orders of magnitude higher than the planet, making detection of the planet virtually impossible. To overcome this, a number of optical systemsincluding coronagraphs, occulters, and interferometers-have been proposed to reduce the residual stellar light in the regions of the image plane where we wish to look for planets.</p><p>One of the most promising coronagraphs for space applications is the phase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) coronagraph <ref type="bibr">(Guyon 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Traub &amp; Vanderbei 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guyon et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Vanderbei &amp; Traub 2005)</ref>, which uses a pair of mirrors to losslessly remap incident light to apodize the beam while retaining high throughput. In addition, incident wavefronts with an angle to the optical axis of the system are displaced disproportionately from the optical axis, providing an effective magnification of the inner working angle.</p><p>A number of these systems have been designed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pluzhnik et al. 2006</ref>) and tested ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Belikov et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kern et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guyon et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balasubramanian et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pueyo et al. 2011a</ref>), in conjunction with apodizing elements to reduce manufacturing requirements on mirrors or mitigate diffraction from mirror edges. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vanderbei (2006)</ref>, without at minimum an apodizer before the mirrors (a pre-apodizer ), the effects of diffraction from the edges of the mirrors limit the achievable contrast severely, to 10 −5 . Apodizers after the mirrors (a post-apodizer ) have also proved useful for performing a portion of the beam-shaping, at the expense of some throughput; using a post-apodizer can reduce the manufacturing requirements on the mirrors, particularly the curvatures required on the edges of some designs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pluzhnik et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>While the tools for accurately modeling propagation through PIAA systems have become fairly sophisticated and robust ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belikov et al. 2006b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pueyo et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krist et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pueyo et al. 2011b</ref>), the tools for finding new apodizations and mirror shapes are not as developed; in particular, the interaction between multiple remapping and apodizing components in the design has not been fully explored. In this paper, we discuss the propagation of radially-symmetric amplitude functions through PIAA systems, in particular setting down a series of equations in Sec. 2 which allow for the arbitrary specification of amplitude profiles throughout the system. This permits mirrors and apodizers to be designed explicitly to work jointly as a system; examples of this are shown in Sec. 3. Applications to design and modeling of four-mirror systems are discussed in Sec. 4, including their interactions with apodizers in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Design of amplitude profiles</head><p>A key problem in designing a PIAA system is determining what shapes the mirrors must take on to correctly redistribute the light. Early PIAA work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Traub &amp; Vanderbei 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guyon 2003)</ref> approached this from the perspective of ray optics, shaping the mirrors to redirect incoming rays into a desired amplitude distribution while maintaining constant pathlength for each ray. However, in 2006, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vanderbei (2006)</ref> showed that this approach was insufficient; mapping of rays was insufficient to capture all of the physics seen in the full diffraction integral. Rays do allow for a straightforward visual interpretation of the remapping induced by PIAA, and the workings of a PIAA system using rays are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. (We note that, as an approximation, design is done in an on-axis configuration, despite the fact that the system geometry requires that mirrors must eventually be placed off-axis; the system layout is generally chosen to minimize the off-axis angle.)</p><p>In the following, we investigate an alternative approach to creating PIAA systems with preand post-apodizers. Rather than ray optics, we start with the Huygens diffraction integral as set out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vanderbei (2006)</ref>, with a uniform amplitude distribution. We then consider the first term of an asymptotic expansion of the full Huygens diffraction integral-that is, apply the stationary phase approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Born &amp; Wolf 1999</ref>)-and show that the resulting approximation directly relates the output amplitude distribution and the mirror shapes, and additionally recovers the geometric optics ray-remapping relationship from the full diffraction integral for a uniform input amplitude. In Sec. 2.2, we then use the stationary phase approximation to show how to remap non-uniform but radially-symmetric input amplitude distributions.</p><p>Our purpose in doing this is threefold: first, to show that a relation between input and output amplitude profiles and the mirror heights can be derived from the diffraction integral in a manner consistent with, but without recourse to, ray optics, and to be able to make the same sorts of statements about the amplitude distributions in a diffractive PIAA system that can be done with ray optics. We would note that the purpose here is not to explicitly rederive the ray-optics mapping, though the equivalence does introduce a certain amount of convenience.</p><p>Second, the stationary-phase approximation gives a straightforward derivation for the relationships between the amplitude profiles at different planes that to our knowledge has not been shown in a ray-optics context for PIAA previously.</p><p>Third and finally, we wish to lay the groundwork for designs which explicitly minimize diffractive effects by appropriate choices of apodizers and mirror shapes. The differences between the stationary phase approximation and the full diffraction integral can be expressed explicitly as higher-order terms in the same asymptotic expansion; the derivation of these terms falls beyond the scope of this current work, but their characteristics and general dependence on system parameters are known and discussed later in Sec. 2.5, along with strategies for mitigating them.</p><p>Sec. 2.3 and 2.4 show how the equations of Sec. 2.2 may be inverted to allow the PIAA mirror shapes to be derived directly from specified input and output profiles, as well as how exactly the required profile on the input beam is set by the mirror shapes and the output profile. In particular, the results of these sections allow one to choose apodizers and a desired output amplitude profile-based on whatever criteria which will optimize performance for the specific applicationand determine exactly what shapes the mirrors must be to make this happen, a novel result for radially-symmetric PIAA systems. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-The basic PIAA system, illustrated with rays: light entering the system is redirected by the first mirror to concentrate or spread out the light, and the second mirror corrects the path length so the wavefront has a uniform phase at the output as well as the input. The mirror depths have been increased by a factor of 5 for clarity. Coordinates related to arrangement of these mirrors are shown to the right. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-A diagram showing the three amplitude profiles associated with a PIAA system. A m (r) is the output amplitude profile when the input amplitude profile to a set of mirrors is uniform, while for an arbitrary input profile A i (r) and the same set of mirrors, the output profile is A f (r). As shown later, knowledge of any two of these profiles allows the third to be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The stationary phase approximation applied the diffraction integral</head><p>For a radially-symmetric PIAA system, there are three different amplitude profiles to consider when propagating an on-axis wavefront:</p><p>• The amplitude profile of the wavefront incident on the first mirror, which we denote A i (r).</p><p>• The amplitude profile directly following the second mirror, which we denote A f (r).</p><p>• The 'intrinsic' profile of the mirror pair; this profile would be produced by an incident plane wave when considering the remapping as ray-optics, without diffraction. We denote this A m (r).</p><p>The amplitude profiles A i (r), A f (r), and A m (r) are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. These three profiles are not independent, but rather selecting any two determines the third; in the following we will show this and further show how to determine the third given the other two. (A fourth profile from a post-apodizer, A p (r), may be included to reshape the amplitude profile further; this factor is solely multiplicative and does not factor into the remapping equations that follow. See Sec. 3.1.)</p><p>Assume we have a PIAA system with intrinsic profile A m (r), assumed real and positive. Consider initially the output from a wavefront E 0 (x, y) incident on a PIAA system with no pre-apodizer; following the Huygens-Fresnel principle, the electric field at any point in the output plane can be considered to be a superposition of spherical waves from all points across the open aperture, which in Cartesian coordinates takes the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vanderbei 2006</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(x, y) = E 0 (x, y) iλQ(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) e i 2π λ Q(x 0 ,y 0 ,x,y) dx 0 dy 0 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, x 0 and y 0 are coordinates in the plane of the input aperture, while x and y are coordinates in a plane just following the second mirror. In the case of an on-axis plane wave, E 0 (x, y) = 1. The optical path length Q is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) = (x 0 − x) 2 + (y 0 − y) 2 + (z + h(r) − h 0 (r 0 )) 2 + (h(r) − h 0 (r 0 ))<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">= r 2 0 + r 2 − 2r 0 r cos (θ − θ 0 ) + (z + h(r) − h 0 (r 0 )) 2 + (h(r) − h 0 (r 0 )), (3)</formula><p>where (r 0 , θ 0 ) and (r, θ) are polar coordinates equivalent to (x 0 , y 0 ), and (x, y), respectively. The shapes of the first and second mirror are given by h 0 (r 0 ) and h(r), respectively, and defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∂h 0 (r 0 ) ∂r 0 = ∂h(r) ∂r = r 0 (r) − r 2z ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h 0 (0) = h(0) = 0.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We note that this notation has been adjusted slightly from the definitions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vanderbei (2006)</ref>, so that both h 0 and h are between 0 and the maximum height of the mirror. Here, unlike in Eq. 3, r 0 in Eq. 4 is not an independent variable from r; rather, we recall the equations for a single pair of radially-symmetric PIAA mirrors, which relate the coordinates r 0 on the first mirror to r on the second (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Vanderbei &amp; Traub (2005)</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∂r 0 ∂r = r r 0 A m (r) 2 (6) ⇒ r 0 (r) = c 2 r 0 sA m (s) 2 ds,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where c is a normalization constant chosen so r 0 (R) = R-that is, both mirrors have the same radii.</p><p>We also define the square root portion of Q as S(x 0 , y 0 , x, y), such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) = (x 0 − x) 2 + (y 0 − y) 2 + (z + h(r) − h 0 (r 0 )) 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) = S(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) + (h(r) − h 0 (r 0 )).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>(S will appear later in this derivation, and is an important factor in the S-Huygens approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vanderbei 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belikov et al. 2006a</ref>) which is used for diffraction calculations.) The derivatives of Q are equal to zero when Q, the path length, is a constant Q 0 , which occurs (as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Vanderbei &amp; Traub (2005)</ref>) when r 0 = r 0 (r), as defined by Eq. 7, and θ 0 = θ.</p><p>We approach the evaluation of Eq. 1 by using the stationary phase approximation (see appendix III of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Born &amp; Wolf (1999)</ref>), which allows integrals of a certain form to be approximated for large values of the parameter k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g(x 0 , y 0 )e ikf (x 0 ,y 0 ) dx 0 dy 0 ≈ 1 k 2πiσ |αβ − γ 2 | g(x c , y c )e ikf (xc,yc) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where (x c , y c ) are critical points where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∂f ∂x 0 = 0, ∂f ∂y 0 = 0,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α = ∂ 2 f ∂x 2 0 xc,yc ,<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">β = ∂ 2 f ∂y 2 0 xc,yc ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">γ = ∂ 2 f ∂x 0 ∂y 0 xc,yc ,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">σ =      1 αβ &gt; γ 2 , α &gt; 0, −1 αβ &gt; γ 2 , α &lt; 0, i αβ &lt; γ 2 .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>We define k "large" more explicitly as being such that kf (x 0 , y 0 ) ≫ 2π, with the assumption that g(x 0 , y 0 ) is slowly varying and f (x 0 , y 0 ) is not constant over the region of integration. Informally, the exponent must oscillate sufficiently quickly-and the amplitude g(x 0 , y 0 ) sufficiently slowlythat the contributions of neighboring regions tend to cancel each other out, except in the vicinity of certain critical points.</p><p>By applying Eq. 10 to the equations governing the propagation through the PIAA system, we can determine the effect of incident wavefront profiles. (This is, of course, an approximation; the stationary phase approximation is the first term in an asymptotic expansion of the integral in Eq.</p><p>1. The effects of higher-order terms in this expansion are discussed in Sec. 2.5.)</p><p>We consider first the case of an on-axis plane-wave. We can return to Eq. 10 and rewrite its components as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">k = 2π λ ,<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">g(x 0 , y 0 ) = E 0 (x, y) iλQ(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) = 1 iλQ(x 0 , y 0 , x, y)</formula><p>for on−axis plane wave,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">f (x 0 , y 0 ) = Q(x 0 , y 0 , x, y),<label>(17)</label></formula><p>to make the left side identical to Eq. 1; it remains only to evaluate the second derivatives of Q to determine Eq. 12 and complete the approximation. The algebra involved is extensive and is derived in full in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pueyo (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pueyo et al. (2011a)</ref>, and we merely report the results: for Q, S, h 0 , and h as defined above,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">σ |αβ − γ 2 | = 1 | 1 S(x 0 (xc),y 0 (yc),xc,yc) 2 Am(r) 2 | (19) = A m (r)S(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ),<label>(20)</label></formula><p>as both and S and A m (r) are real and positive.</p><p>The right side of Eq. 10 thus becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">1 k 2πiσ |αβ − γ 2 | g(x c , y c )e ikf (xc,yc) = λ 2π 2πiA m (r) S(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ) iλQ(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ) e 2πiQ(x 0 (xc),y 0 (yc),xc,yc)/λ .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>If we use the fact that Q(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ) = Q 0 , we reduce this to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">1 k 2πiσ |αβ − γ 2 | g(x c , y c )e ikf (xc,yc) = A m (r)e 2πiQ 0 /λ S(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ) Q 0 .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>In general h(r) − h 0 (r 0 ) ≪ S, and so:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">S(x 0 (x c ), y 0 (y c ), x c , y c ) Q 0 ≈ 1, (23) 1 iλQ(x 0 , y 0 , x, y) e i 2π λ Q(x 0 ,y 0 ,x,y) dx 0 dy 0 ≈ A m (r)e 2πiQ 0 /λ .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>and so the output wavefront for a plane wave is the desired intrinsic remapping A m (r) multiplied by a constant phase. As described above, A m (r) is the output amplitude distribution for rayoptics propagation through a PIAA system, and so, for the case of a uniform input amplitude, this reproduces the results of geometric optics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Vanderbei &amp; Traub 2005</ref>).</p><p>The substitution for E 0 (x, y) in Eq. 17 remains the only deviation from generality in the description of the input amplitude profile. We will capitalize on this to relate the amplitude profiles at different planes without requiring any recourse to ray optics; this is the major strength of the stationary phase approximation in this application.</p></div>

This system used both pre-and post-apodizers, which were held constant as z was changed, along with pair of mirrors which correspond to the same A m (r) for all values of z, and these can be seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. (This means the mirrors will always have the same shape, but scaled up and down to take the maximum height of the mirror from a low of 21µm at z = 1.6m to a high of 350µm at z = 0.1m.) The mirror profiles were determined with Eq. 36 and Eq. 37, using the polynomial pre-apodizer outlined later in Sec. 3.3, and both a Gaussian A f (r) and post-apodizer A p (r).</p><p>It is well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vanderbei 2006</ref>) that the contrast from a pair of mirrors alone will be overwhelmed by diffraction from the first PIAA mirror. The inclusion of a pre-apodizer and post-apodizer to a mirror pair is necessary but still not sufficient to produce a system with good performance; diffraction modeling must be run on the actual system configuration to verify the system performs adequately.</p><p>The explanation for why the system can perform so differently is that there always remain additional wavelength-and separation-dependent diffraction effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vanderbei 2006</ref>) which have not been accounted for in the design process. These residual diffraction effects correspond to higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion (of which the stationary phase approximation is the leading order) and must be accounted for-and compensated with apodizers and system properties-to properly determine the expected performance of a PIAA system. A full discussion of these terms and their effect on PIAA systems is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can draw on related analysis from the laser beam shaping community to present a few salient considerations.</p><p>The key parameter for quality of a beam-shaping optical system is β <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dickey &amp; Holswade 2000)</ref>, which in PIAA terms can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">β = 2πR 2 λz .<label>(49)</label></formula><p>The larger this parameter becomes, the closer a beam-shaping system (or a PIAA system) comes to the first term in the stationary phase approximation. For small β performance will be hindered; for sufficiently small β, it becomes mathematically impossible to get a beam shaping system that works even approximately, as this would violate the uncertainty principle for Fourier transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Romero &amp; Dickey 1996)</ref>, although this will generally not be an issue for most PIAA systems. In practice, this means that building larger mirrors or lenses and placing them closer together will reduce diffraction effects; it also suggests that if β is sufficiently large at the longest wavelength of operation, the PIAA system performance will be wavelength-independent. (At the level of design, at least; a real system will inevitably have wavelength-dependent performance due to aberrations in the optics, but it should not be limited by diffraction.)</p><p>The falloff of higher-order terms depends on the continuity class of Q(x 0 , y 0 , x, y). For an  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.-The effect of varying mirror distance on the image plane performance of a PIAA system with pre-and post-apodizers.

All mirror designs use an identical A m (r) and mirror radius, which gives identical mirror shapes scaled to greater or lesser sag following Eq. 4 and Eq. 5. infinitely differentiable Q, the higher order terms will fall off as 1/β 2 ; however, if Q has a discontinuity in its third derivative, or A i (r) has a discontinuity in its first derivative, then the rate of convergence will drop to 1/ √ β <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dickey &amp; Holswade 2000)</ref>. Discontinuities in lower-order derivatives will reduce the convergence further. The input field is a plane wave with a discontinuity at the edge of the aperture, which immediately suggests that inserting an apodizer (see Sec. 3.2) to produce a continuous A i (r) will improve convergence. (This also suggests that the choice of A m (r) may affect convergence properties and thus exacerbate residual diffraction-something to keep in mind for design.)</p><p>Compensating for these diffraction effects a priori is nontrivial, though a hope for future analysis is that the dependence of those terms on A i (r) and A m (r) and their derivatives can be characterized and used to set conditions on these functions which can minimize or null the largest terms in the asymptotic expansion. (Ideally, this would allow PIAA systems to be designed which naturally minimize diffractive effects.) One fairly simple solution to mitigate some of these effects is to note that while the first mirror's main purpose is to redirect the light, the purpose of the second is to correct the phase of the wavefront so that the output has a uniform phase. The diffraction effects above will introduce phase errors which reduce the contrast in the final image plane; to compensate, we can model the residual phase at a wavelength near the center of our band of operation and add half this value to the surface of the second mirror. Some smoothing may be applied if desired, as the residual phase may have high-frequency components. This approach is also taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guyon et al. (2010)</ref>, to correct similar phase effects. This simple correction can reduce the residual light near the inner working angle by two or more orders of magnitude; the examples in the next section use this as a final adjustment where noted.</p></div>

(2006)</ref> to press beyond this limit was the use of apodizers preceding (a pre-apodizer ) and following (a post-apodizer ) the mirrors. The post-apodizer would do some of the beam shaping, but at the expense of throughput. (Pre-apodizers will be discussed in the next section.)</p><p>The choice of the post-apodizer is a free variable; switching out post-apodizers is equivalent to changing the final profile of the system. The profile is selected to produce sufficient contrast at the image plane in conjunction with the PIAA mirrors.

In general, it is better to design the pre-apodization in advance, since diffraction mitigation introduces an additional constraint on A i (r) not found in A m (r) or A f (r); nonetheless, for completeness, we provide an example of how to retrofit a pair of mirrors with a pre-apodizer.</p><p>Suppose we wish to make a PIAA system which is designed to produce, as an output, a Gaussian apodization.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Mirror design</head><p>One difficulty with pre-apodizer design is that a pre-apodizer has to meet an additional requirement that is not necessarily imposed on the other system optics: it needs to be entirely open across the majority of its aperture to keep throughput high, and yet has to approach zero transmission near the edge to prevent ringing from the discontinuity in field imposed by the mirror edge. The pre-apodizer profile should not go all the way to zero, though, as this drives A m (r) to infinity in Eq. 37; in addition, making the profile too close to 0 or 1 at any point creates difficulties in manufacturing the apodizer. (If the profile is intended to be truncated at some point, it is better to include this truncation in the profile A i (r) directly so that its effects can be compensated for.) For these reason, it can be more advantageous to choose a desired output profile and a preapodizer which meets these requirements and design a mirror which connects the two. Consider, for example, a simple pre-apodizer with an open center and a polynomial falloff near the edge:</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">A i (r) =        1, r ≤ R p a + 3(b − a) r−Rp R−Rp 2 + 2(a − b) r−Rp R−Rp 3 , R p ≤ r ≤ R 0, r ≥ R. (64)</formula><p>The polynomial in the region R p ≤ r ≤ R is chosen so that A i (R p ) = a, A i (R) = b, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">∂A i (r) ∂r | r=R + p = ∂A i (r)</formula><p>∂r | r=R − = 0. Generally, we would prefer a to be as close to 1 and b as close to 0 as manufacturing permit. This is not to imply that this is necessarily the best choice of preapodizer, but it has one significant computational advantage for design: the integral in Eq. 36 can be done analytically, which allows the right side of Eq. 36 to be implemented directly as a function instead of repeatedly determined by numerical integration. (The solution, which is a large and not particularly instructive 8th-order polynomial, is not shown here.)</p><p>If we then select a final profile and a post-apodizer, Eq. 37 gives our mirror pair immediately. An example of this is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, using a Gaussian final profile and post-apodizer; this system would achieve 10 −10 contrast at 2λ/D on sky. The red curve is the idealized output expected from geometric optics, while the blue curve includes the effects of diffraction. The parameters in this example are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>; the post-apodizer was proportional to e −2(r/R) 2 , and the final profile was proportional to e −10(r/R) 2 . Propagation through the system is performed using the S-Huygens approximation to the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integrals following the prescription in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belikov et al. (2006a)</ref>. As discussed in Sec. 2.5, the shape of the second mirror is adjusted to compensate for phase errors introduced by the higher-order terms neglected in taking the stationary-phase approximation.  Fig. 5.-A comparison between the PSFs from a set of amplitude profiles derived from the equations in Section 2 ("Perfect") and from the full diffractive treatment on the corresponding mirrors. The two-mirror system has a preselected pre-and post-apodizer, and the mirrors designed with Eq. 37. The second mirror is adjusted to compensate for phase errors, following § 2.5.</p></div>

We solve Eq. 40 to produce A i,2 (r) for the second set, and as the field out of the first pair of mirrors must match the field into the second, we have the matching condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">A i,2 (r) = A f,1 (r).<label>(68)</label></formula><p>We choose a preapodizer A i,1 (r) to minimize ringing in the system from the edges of the input aperture, and finally use Eq. 37 to find A m,1 (r). The second mirror in the first set (and possibly the second set, as well) may be adjusted for phase errors. As these equations are derived from the leading term of the expansion of the full diffraction integral, and the appropriate choice of pre-apodizer and mirror size/spacing will minimize effects of higher-order terms, we can chain four mirrors together in a way that can provide adequate contrast even with all diffraction effects included.</p><p>As an example, we can recreate the system given in 3.3 using four mirrors instead of using a two mirrors and a post-apodizer. The parameters chosen are identical to the ones in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and the second mirror has A m,2 ∝ e −2(r/R) 2 ) to match the post-apodizer. The final system profile is still proportional to e −10(r/R) 2 . The resulting intensities are shown at top in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>; as with <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, the red curve is from geometric optics, while the blue curve includes diffraction using S-Huygens. Broadband performance is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> at bottom.</p><p>As expected, the system gains in inner working angle, to around 1.75λ/D, but its contrast is reduced by the additional diffraction in the system from two additional mirrors. Both this plot and <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> are normalized to unity at the PSF peak; the throughput of the two-mirror system is 50.9% on-axis, while the throughput of the four-mirror system is 87.9%. In both cases, the first mirror pair has sag of 87.6µm on each mirror; the second mirror pair has 86.9µm of sag. Both are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.  8</ref> (For reference, both of these designs are on flat mirrors sized in accordance with the low-cost/lowsag design principles outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balasubramanian et al.
