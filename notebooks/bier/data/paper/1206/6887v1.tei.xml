			<abstract>
				<p>We present new, full-orbit observations of the infrared phase variations of the canonical hot Jupiter HD 189733b obtained in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands using the Spitzer Space Telescope. When combined with previous phase curve observations at 8.0 and 24 µm, these data allow us to characterize the exoplanet&apos;s emission spectrum as a function of planetary longitude and to search for local variations in its vertical thermal profile and atmospheric composition. We utilize an improved method for removing the effects of intrapixel sensitivity variations and robustly extracting phase curve signals from these data, and we calculate our best-fit parameters and uncertainties using a wavelet-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis that accounts for the presence of time-correlated noise in our data. We measure a phase curve amplitude of 0.1242% ± 0.0061% in the 3.6 µm band and 0.0982% ± 0.0089% in the 4.5 µm band, corresponding to brightness temperature contrasts of 503 ± 21 K and 264 ± 24 K, respectively. We find that the times of minimum and maximum flux occur several hours earlier than predicted for an atmosphere in radiative equilibrium, consistent with the eastward advection of gas by an equatorial super-rotating jet. The locations of the flux minima in our new data differ from our previous observations at 8 µm, and we present new evidence indicating that the flux minimum observed in the 8 µm is likely caused by an overshooting effect in the 8 µm array. We obtain improved estimates for HD 189733b&apos;s dayside planet-star flux ratio of 0.1466% ± 0.0040% in the 3.6 µm band and 0.1787% ± 0.0038% in the 4.5 µm band, corresponding to brightness temperatures of 1328 ± 11 K and 1192 ± 9 K, respectively; these are the most accurate secondary eclipse depths obtained to date for an extrasolar planet. We compare our new dayside and nightside spectra for HD 189733b to the predictions of 1D radiative transfer models from Burrows et al. (2008), and conclude that fits to this planet&apos;s dayside spectrum provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of energy transported to the night side. Our 3.6 and 4.5 µm phase curves are generally in good agreement with the predictions of general circulation models for this planet from Showman et al. (2009), although we require either excess drag or slower rotation rates in order to match the locations of the measured maxima and minima in the 4.5, 8.0, and 24 µm bands. We find that HD 189733b&apos;s 4.5 µm nightside flux is 3.3σ smaller than predicted by these models, which assume that the chemistry is in local thermal equilibrium. We conclude that this discrepancy is best-explained by vertical mixing, which should lead to an excess of CO and correspondingly enhanced 4.5 µm absorption in this region. This result is consistent with our constraints on the planet&apos;s transmission spectrum, which also suggest excess absorption in the 4.5 µm band at the day-night terminator.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Observations of eclipsing extrasolar planetary systems, in which the planet periodically passes in front of and then behind its host star, have proven to be a powerful diagnostic tool for studies of exoplanetary atmospheres. Because the probability of a transiting geometry scales as R ⋆ /a where R ⋆ is the radius of the host star and a is the planet's semi-major axis, the majority of currently known transiting planet systems have orbital periods of just a few days. At these distances, the time scale for the planet to achieve synchronous rotation is short compared to the typical ages of the systems, leading to the prediction that a majority of these transiting planets should be tidally locked <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bodenheimer et al. 2001)</ref>. In this paper we focus on the class of gas giant planets known as "hot Jupiters", which typically have orbital periods on the order of 1 − 3 days and atmospheric temperatures ranging between 1000 − 3000 K.</p><p>One fundamental question for these planets is what fraction of the incident flux absorbed on the planet's day side is subsequently transported around to the night side. Atmospheric circulation models predict that these planets should develop a broad superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet that circulates energy between the day and night sides (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Showman &amp; Guillot 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Showman &amp; Polvani 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Langton &amp; Laughlin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dobbs-Dixon et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012b)</ref>. Depending on the relative strengths of these winds, these planets could exhibit large gradients in both temperature and composition between the two hemispheres. We can constrain the efficiency of the day-night circulation by measuring changes in the infrared brightness of the planet as a function of orbital phase; the day-night brightness contrast can then be translated into a day-night temperature contrast. There are currently well-characterized phase curves published for seven planets, including υ And b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Harrington et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Crossfield et al. 2010</ref>), HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knutson et al. , 2009a</ref>), HD 149026b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knutson et al. 2009c</ref>), HD 80606b <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref>, HAT-P-7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Borucki et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Welsh et al. 2010</ref>), CoRoT-1b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Snellen et al. 2009)</ref>, and WASP-12b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cowan et al. 2012</ref>), with more sparsely sampled phase curves for three additional planets (51 Peg b, HD 209458b, and HD 179949b) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cowan et al. (2007)</ref>. These data indicate that hot Jupiters display a diversity of circulation patterns, ranging from relatively small day-night temperature gradients (e.g., HD 189733b) to large temperature gradients (e.g., WASP-12b).</p><p>Of these four systems, HD 189733b stands out both as having the best-characterized phase variation, and also as the only system with phase curve observations at more than one wavelength. We know more about this planet's atmosphere than that of any other extrasolar planet; key results include the detection of a highaltitude haze ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sing et al. 2011</ref>) and sodium absorption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Redfield et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Huitson et al. 2012</ref>) in its visible-light transmission spectrum, as well as more controversial detections of methane, carbon monoxide, and water absorption in its infrared transmission spectrum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Swain et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sing et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Désert et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gibson et al. 2011a</ref>,b) and carbon dioxide absorption in its dayside emission spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Swain et al. 2009</ref>). Several recent ground-based studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Swain et al. 2010</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Waldmann et al. 2012</ref>) have also reported detections of methane emission from the planet's day side, although these results have been the subject of some debate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mandell et al. 2011</ref>). HD 189733b's dayside emission spectrum has also been characterized in the near-and mid-infrared using both Spitzer IRAC photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>) and IRS spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Grillmair et al. 2008)</ref>, with additional constraints on its variability in the 8 µm IRAC band from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the extent of the data available for this planet, there are still a number of open questions regarding the properties of its atmosphere. The single largest outstanding question centers on the issue of whether or not the chemistry is in equilibrium (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Visscher &amp; Moses 2011)</ref>; it is likely that the atmospheric circulation plays an important role in shaping this chemistry (e.g., ). Although we have observational constraints on relative abundances for the planet's day side and the day-night terminator, we know very little about the properties of HD 189733b's night side. In this paper we present new full-orbit phase curve observations for HD 189733b in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope during its extended warm mission. We combine these data with previous observations at 8.0 and 24 µm to provide the first detailed characterization of its emission spectrum as a function of orbital phase. Our data include two secondary eclipses and one transit in each band, which we use to derive improved estimates for the planet's orbital ephemeris and dayside emission spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>We analyze two full-orbit phase curves for HD 189733b, obtained in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands using the IRAC instrument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fazio et al. 2004</ref>) on the Spitzer Space Telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Werner et al. 2004</ref>). The 3.6 µm observation was obtained on UT 2010 Dec 27 − 29 and has a total duration of 68.5 hours, corresponding to 1,722,624 images. The 4.5 µm observation was obtained on UT 2009 Dec 22 − 24 and has a total duration of 66.7 hours, corresponding to 1,711,872 images. Data in both bandpasses were obtained in subarray mode with 0.1 s exposures in order to avoid saturation and to minimize the total data volume. As a result of the limited on-board memory, both observations required three breaks for downlinks with a duration of 1 − 2 hours per downlink. In order to downlink data the spacecraft must point towards the earth and then reacquire the target, which produced offsets of up to half a pixel in the star's position after each downlink ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 and 2)</ref>.</p><p>We calculate the BJD UTC values at mid-exposure for each image using the MBJD OBS keyword in the image headers. Each set of 64 images obtained in subarray mode comes as a single FITS file with a time stamp corresponding to the start of the first image; we calculate the time stamps for individual images assuming uniform spacing and using the difference between the AINTBEG and ATIMEEND headers, which record the start and end of the 64-image series. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Eastman et al. (2010)</ref> further advocate a conversion from UTC to TT timing standards, which includes a more consistent treatment of leap seconds. We note that for the dates spanned by these obser- Data has been binned into two minute intervals. The raw photometry is shown in the bottom panel. Gaps in data are due to spacecraft downlinks, and the offset in positions between downlinks is a result of the need to re-acquire the star after each downlink.</p><p>vations the conversion from BJD UTC to BJD TT simply requires the addition of 66.184 s, and we proceed using BJD UTC in order to ensure consistency with other studies of this planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Photometry</head><p>Subarray images have dimensions of 32 × 32 pixels, making it challenging to estimate the sky background independent of contamination from the wings of the star's point spread function. We choose to exclude pixels within a radius of 12 pixels of the star's position, as well as the 13th-16th rows and the 14th-15th columns, where the stellar point spread function extends close to the edge of the array. We also exclude the top (32nd) row of pixels, which have values that are consistently lower than those for the rest of the array. Lastly, we mask out a 4 × 3 pixel box centered on the position of HD 189733b's M star companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2006a</ref>). We then iteratively trim 3σ outliers from the remaining subset of pixels, create a histogram of the remaining values, and fit a Gaussian to this histogram to determine the sky background for each image. We find that the background contributes 0.2% of the total flux at 3.6 µm and 0.1% of the total flux at 4.5 µm.</p><p>We determine the position of the star on the array in each image using flux-weighted centroiding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>). We also tried fits using Gaussian position estimates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Stevenson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2010</ref>), but found that this method results in an inferior correction for the intrapixel sensitivity variations in our data. Before estimating the position of the star on the array we first correct for transient hot pixels in each set of 64 images by The raw photometry is shown in the bottom panel; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for a complete description.</p><p>replacing outliers more than 3σ away from the median flux at a given pixel position with this median value. We then subtract the best-fit background flux from each image and iteratively calculate the flux-weighted centroid for a circular region with a radius of either 4.0 (3.6 µm) or 3.5 (4.5 µm) pixels centered on the estimated position of the star. Increasing or decreasing the size of this region does not significantly alter the time series but does result in a slightly higher scatter in the normalized light curve. We also estimate the width of the stellar point spread function in each image by calculating a quantity known as the noise pixel parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mighell 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lewis et al. 2012)</ref>, which is defined in Section 2.2.2 ("IRAC Image Quality") of the IRAC instrument handbook as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">˜ β = ( i I i ) 2 i I 2 i (1)</formula><p>where I i is the measured intensity in the i th pixel. This noise pixel parameter is equal to one over the sharpness parameter S 1 , first introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Muller &amp; Buffington (1974)</ref>, and proportional to the FWHM of the stellar point spread function squared <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mighell 2005</ref>). We find that we obtain the best results in both bands when we calculate˜βcalculate˜ calculate˜β using a circular aperture with a radius of 4.0 pixels. We calculate the flux in each image using aperture photometry with either a fixed radius ranging between 2.0-5.0 pixels in 0.1 pixel steps or a time-varying radius equal to the square root of the noise pixel parameter˜β parameter˜ parameter˜β with either a constant scaling factor ranging between 0.8 − 1.2 or a constant offset between −0.4 and +0.4 pixels. We optimize our choice of aperture individually for each of the four data segments defined by the downlink breaks, as the star falls on a different region of the pixel in each section. We find that for the 3.6 µm array we obtain the best results for apertures with radii equal to ( ˜ β)+[0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] pixels respectively in our four segments; this corresponds to a range of 2.3 − 2.6 pixels with a median value of 2.5 pixels. In the 4.5 µm band we prefer a fixed aperture with a radius of 2.3 pixels in all segments. We obtain consistent results for the best-fit phase curve and eclipse parameters in both bands over a range of either fixed (4.5 µm) or time-varying (3.6 µm) aperture sizes, albeit with a larger standard deviation and correspondingly higher uncertainties for the less optimal apertures. We remove outliers from our final light curves using a moving median filter in flux with a width of 50 points, where we discard points that lie more than 5σ away from the median flux values. This corresponds to 0.008% of our data at 3.6 µm and 0.025% at 4.5 micron.</p><p>In addition to the intrapixel sensitivity variations described in §2.2, our data also exhibit a short duration, ramp-like behavior similar to that observed in the IRAC 8.0 µm array (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knutson et al. , 2009c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2010</ref>) at the start of each phase curve observation and again after each downlink break. We find that the amplitude of this ramp decreases in each successive segment, with the largest ramp at the start of the first segment. This effect may be due to charge-trapping in the array, as has been suggested for longer wavelengths (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>), or it may be related to a settling of the telescope at a new pointing. This effect has an asymptotic shape and generally converges to a constant value on time scales of an hour or less; we elect to trim the first 60 minutes of data at the start of the 3.6 µm phase curve observation and the first 30 minutes of data at the start of the 4.5 µm phase curve observation, repeating this trim after each downlink break. As before, we select our trim intervals in order to minimize the standard deviation of the residuals from the best-fit solution. Such trimming is standard practice for Spitzer secondary eclipse observations in these bands, which typically have a duration of less than eight hours (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Knutson et al. 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Todorov et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fressin et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Donovan et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Deming et al. 2011</ref>). We also tried including exponential functions at the start of each data segment in our fits to the 3.6 µm phase curve, which displayed a stronger ramp than our 4.5 µm data, but we found that these functions did not significantly improve the quality of the fits, nor did they change the best-fit phase curve amplitude and the times of minimum and maximum flux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Correction for Intrapixel Sensitivity Variations</head><p>Fluxes measured at these two wavelengths show a strong correlation with the changing position of the star on the array. This effect is due to a well-documented intra-pixel sensitivity variation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Reach et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morales-Calderon et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Knutson et al. 2008)</ref>, in which the sensitivity of an individual pixel varies between the center and the edge. We find that quadratic functions of x and y position, which are commonly used to correct shorter (&lt; 10 hour) transit and secondary eclipse observations, are inadequate to describe the pixel response over the range of positions spanned by our phase curve observations. We instead correct for these sensitivity variations by approximating the star as a point source on the array and using the measured fluxes as a function of x and y position to create a map of the pixel response. Our approach is based on the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ballard et al. (2010)</ref>, but includes a number of changes that improve the performance and reduce computational overheads for our long light curves (75 hours, vs. approximately 20 hours in <ref type="bibr">Ballard et al.)</ref>. We calculate the effective pixel sensitivity at a given position as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F meas,j = F 0,j n i=0 e −(xi−xj) 2 /2σ 2 x,j ×e −(yi−yj) 2 /2σ 2 y,j × e − √ ˜ βi− √ ˜ βj 2 /2σ 2 √ ˜ β,j<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where F meas,j is the measured flux in the jth image, F 0,j is the intrinsic flux, x j , y j , and˜βand˜ and˜β j are the measured x position, y position, and noise pixel values, and σ x,j , σ y,j , and √ σ ˜ β,j are the the standard deviations of the x, y, and˜β and˜ and˜β vectors over the full range in i. In this case the standard deviation does not represent the uncertainty on the measured positions but instead reflects the relative range in position spanned by the points in our vector. By using this parameter to determine our smoothing width, we effectively implement an adaptive smoothing scheme with a smaller spatial resolution in regions with dense sampling and a larger resolution in regions where the pixel is more sparsely sampled. The i index sums over the nearest 50 neighbors with distance d i,j defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d i,j = (x i − x j ) 2 + y i − y j b 2 + ˜ β i − ˜ β j 2 (3)</formula><p>where b is an empirically determined scaling constant that allows more weight to be placed on either the x or y separation. Both b and the total number of points n used in Eq. 2 are fixed at the values that produce the lowest standard deviation in the residuals from the bestfit solution. In this case we obtain the best results when b = 0.8 in the 3.6 µm band, while we prefer b = 1.0 in the 4.5 µm band. We find that increasing the number of nearest neighbors used in the weighted average from 50 to 400 reduces the relative scatter in the final unbinned residuals by less than 1% and increases the computation time by a factor of six, making our Markov chain fits computationally intractable. We calculate the intrapixel sensitivity correction using the residuals after the best fit functions for the phase curve ( §2.4), transit and secondary eclipses ( §2.3), and stellar activity ( §2.5) have been removed in order to ensure that we do not inadvertently remove part of these astrophysical signals. We re-calculate this correction at each step in our fits, allowing the pixel map to trade off against changes in our nominal astrophysical functions. We find that this iterative approach results in a unique best-fit solution despite the large amplitudes of the intrapixel sensitivity variations, as improved estimates for the astrophysical parameters result in a more accurate pixel map, which in turn results in a lower scatter in the residuals after both the astrophysical signals and the intrapixel sensitivity variations have been removed. It is worth noting, however, that the success of this approach depends on our ability to generate accurate models for the astrophysical signals in our data.</p></div>

Our transit light curve has four free parameters, including the planet-star radius ratio R p /R ⋆ , the orbital inclination i, the ratio of the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar radius a/R ⋆ , and the transit time. For the secondary eclipse we approximate the planet as a uniform disk (for more on this see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2010</ref>) where the depth is measured relative to the average of the phase curve function over the duration of the eclipse. We account for the change in the planet's brightness during the secondary eclipse by rescaling the amplitudes of ingress and egress to match the values of the phase curve at the start and end of the eclipse, respectively. Our secondary eclipse light curves use the same values of R p /R ⋆ , i, and a/R ⋆ as the transit, and we allow the depths and times of each secondary eclipse to vary individually. This gives us a total of eight free parameters in our fits to describe the transit and two secondary eclipses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Phase Curve Functions</head><p>We calculate our phase curve functions as the sum of a series of sine and cosine terms with periods equal to the planet's orbital period and its even harmonics as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cowan &amp; Agol (2008)</ref>.

We fit the data shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> and 4 with a spot model for the star following the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aigrain et al. (2011)</ref>, with uncertainties calculated using a Gaussian processes method described in <ref type="bibr">Gibson et al. (2011b)</ref>. Based on these models, we find that the star varied in brightness by approximately 0.4%−1.8% (3.6 µm) and 0.3%−1.4% (4.5 µm) in the averaged Strömgren b and y filters during our phase curve observations, with a local minimum in the 3.6 µm data and a linearly decreasing flux in the 4.5 µm data. If we rescale these variations to the wavelengths of our Spitzer observations assuming a spot temperature of 4250 K (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pont et al. 2008</ref>), we find corresponding amplitudes of 0.1% − 0.4% at 3.6 µm and 0.1% − 0.5% at 4.5 µm.</p><p>We account for the effects of the spots in our data by including a quadratic function of time in our 3.6 µm fit and a linear function of time in our 4.5 µm fit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F (t) = d 1 t + d 2 t 2 (5)</formula><p>where t is defined as the time from the predicted center of transit, d 1 and d 2 are free parameters in the 3.6 µm fit, and we set d 2 equal to zero in the 4.5 µm fit. As a test of our ability to distinguish between spot variability and the planet's phase curve in these bands, we inserted linear functions of time with slopes ranging between ±0.5% in both data sets. We find that we are able to retrieve the correct slope for our inserted trend in all cases, although our nominal phase curve solutions displayed some degeneracies with these trends for amplitudes larger than 0.3%.</p><p>Including a quadratic function of time in our fits to the the 4.5 µm data produces a negligible improvement in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; 1,651,608 for the linear fit vs. 1,651,584 for the quadratic fit) <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . As an additional test, we generated 100 random samples from the Gaussian process model trained on the visible-light photometry. We then fit the predicted stellar trend from each sample during the epoch of our 4.5 µm phase curve observation with both a linear and a quadratic function of time. We find that the addition of a quadratic term produces a significant (∆BIC &gt; 5) improvement less than 30% of the time, in good agreement with our previous test. We therefore limit our 4.5 µm fits to a linear function of time in the analysis described below and find that the star decreased in brightness by 0.180% ± 0.022% over the course of our observations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), in good agreement with our prediction of 0.1% − 0.5% from the visible-light photometry. In contrast to this result, we find that at 3.6 µm the addition of a quadratic term to our stellar spot function results in a significantly improved BIC (1,604,852 for the linear fit vs. 1,604,538 for the quadratic fit). This is consistent with the results from our sampling of the Gaussian process model, which indicate that the quadratic term provides a better description for the predicted trend during our 3.6 µm phase curve observations in more than 70% of cases. However, we find that the best-fit quadratic solutions from our fits to the visiblelight and 3.6 µm photometry are mutually inconsistent; we strongly prefer a negative quadratic term and a local flux maximum in our 3.6 µm fits, whereas the visible-light photometry indicates a positive quadratic term and a local flux minimum in 83% of our solutions. Upon closer examination we noticed that our best-fit quadratic function of time from the 3.6 µm photometry produced a local maximum just before the secondary eclipse, around the same time where we would expect to see a maximum in our best-fit phase curve. We therefore conclude that the quadratic fit is degenerate with our phase curve function in this bandpass and opt to limit the quadratic coefficient in our subsequent fits to positive values (i.e., a linear function or a local flux minimum) in order to avoid this degeneracy and ensure good agreement with our visible-light spot models. Our best-fit solution in this band is very close to linear and indicates that the star increased in brightness by 0.262% ± 0.016% during our observations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, in good agreement with our prediction of 0.1% − 0.4% from the visible-light photometry.</p></div>

In our wavelet MCMC we maximize the likelihood function instead of minimizing χ 2 , which allows us to fit for the white (σ w ) and red (σ r ) noise contributions to the per-point uncertainties. The wavelet transform routine requires our data to have a length equal to a power of two, which we achieve by subdividing each phase curve into thirteen segments of equal length and zero-padding by either 6% (3.6 µm) or 3% (4.5 µm). We prefer zero-padding over trimming as it allows us to include all available data in our fits, and we find that this approach has a negligible effect on our best-fit noise parameters.</p><p>We initialize each chain at a position determined by randomly perturbing the best-fit parameters from a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization. After running the chain, we search for the point where the χ 2 value first falls below the median of all the χ 2 values in the chain (i.e. where the code had first found the optimal fit), and discard all steps up to that point. For the wavelet MCMC we perform a similar trim where the likelihood first rises above the median value. We set our best-fit parameters equal to the median of each distribution and calculate the corresponding uncertainties as the symmetric range about the median containing 68% of the points in the distribution. The distribution of values was very close to symmetric for all parameters, and there did not appear to be any detectible correlations between variables aside from i and a/R ⋆ . Our wavelet analysis produces modestly higher uncertainties for most parameters, with the greatest increases in the planet-star radius ratio and secondary eclipse depth errors, which were a factor of two larger than in the standard Gaussian χ 2 fits.

(2011a)</ref> find that their 4.5 µm radius ratio is 0.0012 ± 0.0004 smaller than at 3.6 µm and suggest that this may be consistent with absorption from carbon monoxide, although they do not correct explicitly for changes in the stellar flux over the approximately one year interval between their two measurements.</p><p>We account for the effect of varying stellar flux in our data using the ground-based monitoring data described in §2.5. We find that the star is 0.9%±0.6% fainter in the Strömgren (b + y)/2 band during our 3.6 µm transit as compared to our 4.5 µm transit. If we assume a spot temperature of 4250 K as estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pont et al. (2008)</ref>, we find that the corresponding flux change in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands should be approximately 28% of the variation in the Strömgren (b + y)/2 band, or 0.3%±0.2%. Correcting the 3.6 µm transit depth to the equivalent stellar flux at the time of the 4.5 µm transit observation yields a planet-star radius ratio of 0.15465±0.00037, 0.00115±0.00042 (2.7σ) smaller than in the 4.5 µm band. This result is consistent with the planet-star radius ratio difference of 0.0012 ± 0.0004 reported by <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref>, who also find a deeper transit at 4.5 µm as compared to 3.6 µm. We note that although our measurements of the planet-star radius ratios are more precise than those reported in this paper, we are ultimately limited by the uncertainties in our estimates of the stellar flux and its corresponding effect on the measured transit depths at the epochs of our two measurements.</p><p>We also present new estimates of the secondary eclipse depth in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands. We see no convincing evidence for variability in the planet's flux over the planet's orbit; our two 3.6 µm depths differ by 0.8σ, and our 4.5 µm depths differ by 2.5σ. We estimate an average secondary eclipse depth of 0.1466% ± 0.0040% at 3.6 µm and 0.1787% ± 0.0038% at 4.5 µm. We utilize a PHOENIX stellar atmosphere model for the star and calculate corresponding brightness temperatures of 1328 ± 11 K and 1192 ± 9 K, respectively. These values are shallower than our previous estimates of 0.256 ± 0.014% at 3.6 µm and 0.214 ± 0.020% at 4.5 µm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. (2008)</ref>, although the 4.5 µm depths are consistent at the 1.7σ level. We note that the error estimates for our new secondary eclipse depths are a factor of 4 − 5 smaller than these previous values; this is mainly due to the fact that the older observations cycled between all four Spitzer IRAC bands in order to obtain multi-wavelength coverage during a single secondary eclipse event, leading to an effective cadence one-fifth that of our new staring-mode observations. Although our new 3.6 µm secondary eclipse depth differs from our older estimate by 7.5σ, the older observation had much larger intrapixel sensitivity variations that were partially degenerate with the secondary eclipse depth in this band. Because our error estimates in the 2008 paper were based on conventional MCMC methods, which assume that the noise is Gaussian, it is likely that the uncertainties on the older eclipse depth were significantly underestimated. Although we considered re-analyzing these older data with our new methods, we concluded that the lower cadence and larger pointing jitter in these observations meant that we were unlikely to get useful constraints on the secondary eclipse depth as compared to our new observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Comparison to 1D Atmosphere Models</head><p>We compare our new secondary eclipse depths to the predictions of one-dimensional radiative transfer models for HD 189733b's dayside emission as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. (2008)</ref>. These models assume a solar metallicity atmosphere with the chemistry in local ther-mal equilibrium <ref type="bibr">(LTE)</ref>, an interpolated ATLAS model for the stellar spectrum, and allow for the parameterized redistribution of heat from the dayside to the night side using a heat sink between 0.01 − 0.1 bars. They also include an additional grey absorber at low pressures, which is required to reproduce the high-altitude temperature inversions observed in the atmospheres of a subset of hot Jupiters such as HD 209458b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Swain et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>. Both the fractional amount of the incident flux P n redistributed to the night side and the opacity of the high-altitude absorber κ e in cm −1 g are left as free parameters and optimized to provide the best match to the updated secondary eclipse depths at 3.6 and 4.5 µm, together with previously published 5.8, 8.0, 16, and 24 µm eclipse depths from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref> and the 5 − 12 µm IRS spectrum from <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Grillmair et al. (2008)</ref>. We obtain a reasonably good match to all measurements except the 3.6 µm dayside using a model with P n = 0.15 (i.e., 15% redistribution, where 50% redistribution corresponds to a perfectly well-mixed atmosphere) and κ e = 0.035 cm −1 g, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. These values are identical to those of the nominal model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Grillmair et al. (2008)</ref>. Given that our models include an estimate of the relative day-night recirculation efficiency, it is worth considering whether or not a nightside model with the same assumptions as our day side model can accurately reproduce the measured night side fluxes at 3.6, 4.5, 8.0, and 24 µm. We take the longer-wavelength flux estimates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knutson et al. (2009a)</ref> and estimate the 3.6 and 4.5 µm night side fluxes as the measured secondary eclipse depths minus the phase curve amplitude in each band; this gives planet-star flux ratios of 0.0224% ± 0.0073% and 0.0805% ± 0.0097% at 3.6 and 4.5 µm, respectively. If we use a PHOENIX stellar atmosphere model for the star, these fluxes correspond to brightness temperatures of 825 ± 54 K and 928 ± 33 K, respectively. We compare these fluxes to the predictions of a solar metallicity LTE model with P n = 0.15; the model does not include any additional high-altitude absorber, but this is irrelevant for the night side as there is no incident flux at the top of the atmosphere. We find that this default night side model provides a good match for the measured 3.6 and 4.5 µm nightside fluxes (−1.9σ and +2.3σ difference, respectively), although it underestimates the 24 µm flux by 7.1σ. We conclude that statistical surveys seeking to estimate the relative amount of day-night circulation based on fits to the dayside emission alone, such as those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref>, should obtain reasonable estimates for this quantity despite the limited data available and the relative simplicity of the models used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">A Note on Stellar Atmosphere Models</head><p>There are several potential sources of stellar atmosphere models for HD 189733 in the literature, including both interpolated and star-specific ATLAS models  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2008)</ref> with parameterized recirculation Pn = 0.15 at depth and a high-altitude absorber with an opacity equal to κe = 0.035 cm −1 . Black filled squares show the predicted planet-star flux ratios in the same bands as the Spitzer observations. The lower panel shows the measured minimum fluxes for HD 189733 (filled dark blue circles) compared to the same 1D atmosphere model for the planet's night side; the temperature in this region is set by the amount of energy transported from the day side.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kurucz 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kurucz , 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kurucz , 2005</ref>  <ref type="bibr">15</ref> and interpolated PHOENIX models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hauschildt et al. 1999</ref>). We compare the stellar spectra obtained from these three sources, and find that the star-specific ATLAS model over-predicts the strength of the CO absorption feature between 4 − 5 µm as compared to our interpolated ATLAS and PHOENIX spectra. If HD 189733's spectrum is best-described by this starspecific model it would shift the predicted planet-star flux ratio in the 4.5 µm Spitzer band to larger values, at a level comparable to or larger than our uncertainties for this measurement. For now we proceed using the interpolated grid models, which we find give consistent predictions regardless of which grid they are taken from.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Phase Curve Fits</head><p>There are three basic quantities which we obtain from our phase curve observations: the amplitude of the observed variation, the location of the flux maximum, and the location of the flux minimum. Taken together, these quantities can be used to estimate the day-night brightness contrast as well as the positions of hot and cold regions in the atmosphere. Because the opacities (and hence the pressure from which most of the detected flux is emitted) may vary from one band to the next, we do not necessarily expect to see the same features in all bandpasses. This picture is further complicated by the fact that the wavelength-dependent opacity of the planet's atmosphere may vary as a function of longitude. Our first task, therefore, is to consider whether or not our ensemble of phase curves all display the same qualitative features.</p><p>Focusing on the most basic feature first, we compare the amplitude of the phase variation in our four bands. We find that the planet's minimum flux is 15%±5% of the maximum flux at 3.6 µm, and 45% ± 5% at 4.5 µm. We can then convert this flux contrast to a brightness temperature contrast of 503 ± 21 K at 3.6 µm and 264 ± 24 K at 4.5 µm. The contrast in the 3.6 µm band is 6 − 7σ larger than in the 4.5 µm band or the corresponding value of 188±48 K at 24 µm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knutson et al. (2009a)</ref>. If we assume that the composition of the planet's atmosphere is uniform (e.g., the opacity is constant), this would suggest that at longer wavelengths we are seeing deeper into the planet's atmosphere, where temperatures are expected to be more homogenous (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 2010</ref>). This differs from the predictions of 1D solar metallicity atmosphere models assuming equilibrium chemistry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knutson et al. 2009a</ref>), which find that HD 189733b's 3.6 µm band should have the lowest average opacity and, therefore, probe deepest in the planet's atmosphere.</p><p>We next compare the locations of the flux maxima in each band. If the planet's atmosphere is in strict radiative equilibrium (i.e., no recirculation) we would expect the phase curve to reach its maximum at the center of the secondary eclipse, when we are viewing the substellar point face-on. If, on the other hand, the atmospheric circulation is dominated by a strong west-to-east (i.e., superrotating) equatorial band of wind, we would expect to see the phase curve reach a maximum prior to the secondary eclipse. We find that the maximum flux occurs 5.29 ± 0.59 hours before the center of the secondary eclipse at 3.6 µm and 2.98 ± 0.82 hours before the eclipse center at 4.5 µm. These two offsets differ from zero by 9.0 and 3.6σ, respectively, and from each other by 2.3σ.</p><p>We next compare the locations of the minima in both light curves, which should be offset in the same direction as the maxima in the limit of a single equatorial band of wind. We find that the minimum flux occurs 6.43 ± 0.82 hours before the transit center at 3.6 µm and 1.37 ± 1.00 hours before the transit center at 4.5 µm. These two measurements differ from zero by 7.8 and 1.4σ respectively and are consistent with the presence of an eastward jet on the night side. If this same eastward offset was present in our 8.0 and 24 µm phase curves it would have gone undetected, as our observations began shortly before the transit and spanned just half an orbit in both cases. General circulation models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Heng et al. 2011</ref>) predict that in cases where a super-rotating eastward jet dominates heat transport the cold region on the planet's night side should display a larger shift than the hot region on the dayside; this results in maximum and minimum fluxes in the integrated light curves that are separated by slightly less than 180 • . We find that our data are consistent with a 180 • separation in both bands, but this is not surprising as our constraints are weak compared to the size of the predicted deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">The Location of the 8 µm Phase Curve Minimum</head><p>Spitzer data taken in the 8 µm band display a ramplike behavior where higher-illumination pixels converge to a constant value within the first hour of observations while lower-illumination pixels show a continually increasing linear trend on the time scales of interest here. This effect is generally attributed to charge-trapping in the array and is discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knutson et al. ( , 2009c</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref>, among others. We must correct for this effect in order to retrieve the phase curve presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref>, which displays a flux minimum several hours after the transit (i.e., shifted in the opposite direction of the minima in our new 3.6 and 4.5 µm phase curves). Although we initially considered this minimum to be reliably detected despite the uncertainties in our ramp correction, an independent analysis presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref> used a different method to correct the ramp and found much larger uncertainties at early times.</p><p>In this section we investigate the nature of the detector ramp in more detail, focusing on the question of whether or not the flux minimum in the 8 µm data might be either a direct result of the ramp or an artifact created by our ramp correction. We utilize 8 µm preflash data obtained on UT 2009 Apr 23 as part of a program to observe CoRoT-7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fressin et al. 2012</ref>), which targeted a region in the Orion Nebular Cloud with bright, diffuse emission located at J2000 05:35:16 -05:23:24. The purpose of these observations was to mitigate the ramp effect by filling the charge traps throughout the array immediately before slewing to the science target (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seager &amp; Deming 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knutson et al. 2009c</ref>). These data are particularly useful for characterizing the ramp effect because they allow us to bin pixels according to their median illumination level without worrying about added variability introduced by shifts in the telescope pointing. For a bright, compact source such as a star, it is almost impossible to disentangle these two effects at the pixel level.</p><p>We divide the data from the preflash images into twelve bins, with illumination levels ranging from 1000 − 4500 MJy Sr −1 . Although these illumination levels are generally higher than the peak flux of approximately 1700 MJy Sr −1 reached in the central pixel of our 8 µm HD 189733b observations, we expect that lower illumination pixels will display qualitatively similar behaviors on longer time scales. We plot the resulting light curves for each bin in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. Although the majority of pixels exhibit the typical asymptote associated with this effect, we note that the highest illumination pixels display an additional behavior which we term "overshooting", in which the flux increases past its equilibrium value and then gradually decreases until it reaches its nominal steady state. It is possible that this effect is present in the lower-illumination light curves as well, but is hidden by the larger size of the initial ramp. There is some evidence for this theory, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> report an effect resembling overshooting in their 8 µm observations of the stellar binary component in the HD 80606 system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Crossfield et al. (2012)</ref>, we also find evidence for a similar effect in the 24 µm MIPS array.</p><p>We note that exponential fits to the 8 µm ramp, such as those used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref>, do not take this effect into account. Although we used a more general , with best-fit fourth-order polynomial functions of time (red lines) overplotted for comparison. Although the detector ramp typically resembles an asymptote that converges on time scales related to the median illumination level, the most highly illuminated pixels exhibit an additional over-shooting effect that could lead to residuals in the corrected light curves if not taken into account in our choice of functional form to describe the ramp.</p><p>seventh-order polynomial function of time to describe the ramp in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref>, we only corrected a subset of the lower-illumination pixels inside our photometric aperture. If the uncorrected higher-illumination pixels in our aperture displayed this behavior, or if it was inadequately described by our polynomial fits to the lower-illumination pixels, then we would expect to see a local minimum near the start of our observations. Based on these data, we conclude that the flux minimum observed in our corrected data could reasonably be attributed to this overshooting effect, rather than the planet's phase curve. For the purposes of comparing our 8 µm phase curve to other wavelengths, we adopt the convention of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref> and trim the first part of the light curve where the ramp correction is largest and our conclusions correspondingly uncertain. This trimming does not affect our estimate of the location of the flux maximum, but it does prevent us from determining the location of the flux minimum in these data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparison to General Circulation Models</head><p>In this section we combine our new 3.6 and 4.5 µm phase curves with our previous observations at 8.0 and 24 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knutson et al. 2009a</ref>) and compare these results to the predictions of 3D general circulation models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Showman et al. (2009)</ref>. These models use the MITgcm to solve the primitive equations in three dimensions, and are coupled to a non-grey radiative transfer scheme. Showman et al. considered four complementary cases for the planet, corresponding to: 1) a solar metallicity atmosphere and a 1:1 ratio for the planet's rotation and orbital periods, 2) a 5× solar metallicity atmosphere and 1:1 rotation, 3) a solar metallicity atmosphere and a 1:2 ro- tation period (i.e., more slowly rotating than the tidally locked case), and 4) a solar metallicity atmosphere and a 2:1 rotation period (i.e., the rapid rotation case). We calculate phase curves in the 3.6, 4.5, 8.0, and 24 µm Spitzer bands for each model following the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fortney et al. (2006)</ref>. We use an interpolated PHOENIX model to calculate planet-star flux ratios and confirm that this model gives predictions consistent with those of the ATLAS model used with the 1D models in §4.2.1. We compare the resulting predictions to our measured phase curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12 and 13</ref>; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> for a more quantitative comparison.</p><p>In examining the locations of the local maxima and minima, we find that the slow rotator model is the only one that provides an acceptable fit (&lt; 3σ disagreement) to the measured offsets in the 4.5, 8.0, and 24 µm bands.  The 3.6 µm band displays a larger offset that is inconsistent with this model at the 5σ level, and is instead best-matched by the offset in the 5× solar model. We note that there are a number of model parameters in addition to rotation rate that could reduce the offsets of the maxima and minima given the complex interplay of radiative, chemical, and advective timescales. For example, increasing atmospheric drag in the region near the photosphere would decrease the wind speeds and reduce the corresponding offsets (e.g., Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012a). By controlling the opacities and therefore the photosphere pressures that contribute flux in a given bandpass, atmospheric chemistry also plays a large role in determining the offsets of the observed maxima and minima.

We find that the our measured maximum fluxes differ by [+11%, -7%, +5%, +8%] from their predicted values in the <ref type="bibr">[3.6, 4.5, 8.0, 24]</ref> µm bands, with a significance of [3.5σ, −3.3σ, 4.5σ, 1.2σ], respectively.

The 2σ upper limit on the 8 µm minimum is consistent with all models. We show the predicted spectra at times of minimum and maximum flux in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>, and list the corresponding planet-star flux ratios in the Spitzer bands in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>We next consider whether or not non-equilibrium chemistry might be able to explain the disagreement between the measured and predicted planet-star flux ratios. The planet's 3.6 and 4.5 µm nightside fluxes display the single largest discrepancies, with valuees approximately one third to one half those predicted by our preferred model. As discussed in , the time scale for converting between CO and methane is long relative to the vertical mixing time scales in these atmospheres, and as a result the relative abundances of these two molecules should reflect their values in the planet's deeper atmosphere (∼ 1 − 10 bars) where chemical quenching can occur. For planets in the temperature regime of HD 189733b, Cooper &amp; Showman's models suggest that approximately 20% of the total carbon should exist in the form of methane on both the day and night sides, with the remainder residing primarily in CO. If we compare this to chemical equilibrium predictions for HD 189733b's night side, we find that this leads to an excess of CO and a deficit of CH 4 at the pressures probed by our observations. Increasing the amount of CO in our nightside model would suppress the 4.5 µm flux, bringing it into good agreement with our measured value in this band. This result is also consistent with our constraints on the planet's transmission spectrum (see §4.2), which suggest the presence of additional CO absorption at the day-night terminator. Although the 3.6 µm nightside flux is also lower than predicted, we note that the slow rotator model provides a poor match to the measured locations of the flux maximum and minimum in this band, and it is therefore not surprising that it would also fail to match the measured flux on the planet's night side.</p><p>Although non-equilibrium chemistry offers a possible solution for HD 189733b's night side, the picture on the day side is more mixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Moses et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Visscher &amp; Moses (2011)</ref> find that their non-equilibrium models for this planet's day side have more methane and less CO than the equilibrium predictions, as expected in the limit of strong vertical mixing (K zz = 10 11 ). However, the net effect of this non-equilibrium chemistry in their models was to decrease the dayside fluxes in the 3.6, 8.0, and 24 µm bands, while preserving a nearly identical flux in the 4.5 µm band; unfortunately this is the opposite of the change needed in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we present new full-orbit and nearcontinuous phase curve observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm Spitzer bands, which allow us to characterize the atmospheric circulation patterns and corresponding chemistry of HD 189733b's atmosphere. These data include one transit and two secondary eclipses in each bandpass, which we use to derive an improved estimate for the planet's orbital ephemeris and wavelength-dependent transmission and emission spectrum in these bands. We confirm that the planet's 4.5 µm transit depth is 3σ smaller than at 3.6 µm, consistent with the presence of excess CO at the daynight terminator, although our precision is comparable to that reported by <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref>. We obtain improved estimates for HD 189733b's dayside planet-star flux ratio of 0.1466% ± 0.0040% in the 3.6 µm band and 0.1787% ± 0.0038% in the 4.5 µm band, corresponding to brightness temperatures of 1328±11 K and 1192±9 K, respectively; these are the most accurate secondary eclipse depths obtained to date for an extrasolar planet. Our new 3.6 µm secondary eclipse depth is 7.5σ smaller than the value reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Charbonneau et al. (2008)</ref>, but we find that the uncertainties in this previous measurement, which assumed Gaussian noise, are likely underestimated. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence for time variability in the measured secondary eclipse depths or times, consistent with the upper limits derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2010)</ref> using a more extensive 8 µm data set.</p><p>We combine our new 3.6 and 4.5 µm phase curves with previously published observations at 8.0 and 24 µm in order to characterize the planet's emission spectrum as a function of orbital phase. We find that the times of minimum and maximum flux occur several hours earlier than predicted for an atmosphere in radiative equilibrium, consistent with the eastward advection of gas by an equatorial super-rotating jet. The locations of the flux minima in our new data differ from our previous observations at 8 µm, and we present new evidence indicating that the flux minimum observed in the 8 µm is likely caused by an over-shooting effect in the 8 µm array. We fit the planet's dayside spectrum with a 1D radiative transfer model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. (2008)</ref> where the amount of energy transported to the night side is left as a free parameter and find that the corresponding nightside spectrum is in good agreement with our measured values. This serves to validate studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cowan &amp; Agol 2011</ref>) that seek to constrain circulation patterns on hot Jupiters based on dayside spectra alone.</p><p>We then compare our phase curves to the predictions of 3D general circulation models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Showman et al. (2009)</ref> and find that we require models with either a slower-than-synchronous rotation rate or increased drag at the bottom of the atmosphere in order to match the small measured offsets in the locations of the phase curve maxima and minima at 4.5, 8.0, and 24 µm. We also find that HD 189733b's 4.5 µm nightside flux is 3.2σ smaller than predicted by these models, which assume that the chemistry is in local thermal equilibrium. We conclude that this discrepancy is best-explained by vertical mixing, which should lead to an excess of CO and correspondingly enhanced 4.5 µm absorption in this region. This result is consistent with our constraints on the planet's transmission spectrum, which also suggest excess absorption in the 4.5 µm band at the day-night terminator.</p><p>Looking ahead, it is clear that the questions regarding atmospheric chemistry and circulation patterns on tidally locked planets will continue to recur as the field shifts towards studies of smaller and more earth-like worlds. Current studies of the atmospheres of low-mass planets such as GJ 1214b <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bean et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bean et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berta et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Désert et al. 2011b</ref>) and GJ 436b (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Stevenson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beaulieu et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Knutson et al. 2011</ref>) focus almost exclusively on systems with M star primaries, as the lower stellar effective temperature and smaller stellar radius result in proportionally larger transit and secondary eclipse depths. For late M stars, the location of the habitable zone is within the region in which we would expect tidal locking to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kasting et al. 1993)</ref>; it is therefore likely that the first atmosphere studies of potentially habitable worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope will focus on these tidally locked systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

This result was recently confirmed by Majeau et al.
