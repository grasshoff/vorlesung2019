			<abstract>
				<p>Context. The research of extrasolar planets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of the radii of transiting planets, and the luminosity of planets observed by direct imaging. Meanwhile, the precision of radial velocity surveys allows to discover not only giant planets, but also very low-mass planets. Aims. Uniting all these different observational constraints into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important , but also difficult undertaking. One approach is to develop a theoretical model which can make testable predictions for all these observational techniques. Our goal is to have such a model, and to use it in population synthesis calculations. Methods. In a companion paper, we described how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. In this second paper, we first continue with the model description. We describe how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core of the planet, and include radiogenic heating. We also introduce an upgrade of the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we use the upgraded model in population synthesis calculations. Results. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H 2 /He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the mass-radius relationship can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to &quot;forbidden&quot; zones in the M − R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii, mainly due to different bulk compositions, reflecting different formation histories. We compare the synthetic M − R plane with the observed one, finding good agreement for a &gt; 0.1 AU. The synthetic planetary radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local maximum at about 1R. The increase towards small radii comes from the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows good agreement for R 2R ⊕ , but divergence for smaller radii. This indicates that for R 2R ⊕ , the radius distribution can be described with planets with primordial H 2 /He atmospheres, while at smaller radii, planets of a different nature dominate. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at about 1 R. Conclusions. With the updated model, we can compute the most important quantities like mass, semimajor axis, radius and luminos-ity characterizing an extrasolar planet self-consistently from its formation. The comparison of the radii of the synthetic planets with observations allows to better constrain this formation process, and to distinguish between fundamental types of planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the first part of this paper we continue to present the improvement of our formation model in order to extend it into a combined planet formation and evolution model. With these extensions, and those introduced and in the companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Mordasini et al. 2012b</ref>, hereafter Paper I), we are able to synthesize planetary populations for which we can calculate in a self-consistent way not only the mass and semimajor axis as in previous works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Alibert et al. 2011</ref>) but also the radius and luminosity. This is possible during the entire formation and evolution, starting at a tiny sub-Earth mass seed embryo and ending at a Gigayear old planet. In the second part of the paper, we use population synthesis calculations to study different aspects of the planetary mass-radius relationship and the distribution of the radii of the planets.</p><p>Send offprint requests to: Christoph MORDASINI, e-mail: mordasini@mpia. <ref type="bibr">de</ref> The background to motivate this work is that the number of known transiting extrasolar planets has increased very rapidly in the past few years. Recently, the space missions CoRoT and Kepler have yielded very precise measurements of the radius of a very large number of planet candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Léger et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Borucki et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Batalha et al. 2012</ref>). The data from the Kepler satellite has stimulated a multitude of studies like for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Traub (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Demory &amp; Seager (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Youdin (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin (2012)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gaidos et al. (2012)</ref> to name just a few. The results of these studies will be used in this work to compare the radii of the actual and the synthetic population.</p><p>For a number of transiting planets, masses were measured using the radial velocity method (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. 2011</ref>), or by transit timing variations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Cochran et al. 2011</ref>). By the combination of the mass and the radius of the planet one gets the planetary mass-radius diagram, which is an observational result of similar importance as the planetary semimajor axis-mass diagram. The reason for this is that one can derive the mean den-sity of the planet, which constrains, at least to some extent, the internal structure which is crucial to understand the nature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Chabrier et al. 2011</ref>) and, as we shall see in this work, the formation of a planet. We thus make an important step towards a physical characterization of planets based on their formation history.</p><p>The radius adds a whole new class of observational constraints to which the output of the theoretical model in a population synthesis can be compared to. Important examples are the radius distribution, the mass-radius relationship, or the impact of semimajor axis, metallicity and stellar mass on the radii. Due to the complexity of planet formation and evolution with a multitude of interacting effects (often only understood in a rudimentary way), it is of highest importance to have as many observational constraints which can concurrently and self-consistently be used for comparison with the theoretical results. This is the central motivation for the work here and in the companion paper. The combination of results of different observational techniques allows to obtain insights which could not be obtained from the data of one technique alone (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gaidos et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The reason to improve the model of the protoplanetary disk is on one hand the observational progress that has been made in the last few years also in this field (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Andrews et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Andrews et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Fedele et al. 2010</ref>), but also the theoretical result that the disk structure is very important for the final properties of a synthetic planetary population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>) Planetary population synthesis has become possible thanks to the large number of extrasolar planets that have been detected in the last decade. Apart from our series of works, several other studies have been presented (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ida &amp; Lin 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">-2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Miguel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012)</ref>. These studies can roughly be divided into two classes, one emphasizing more the coupling of several processes (solid and gas accretion, migration, disk evolution), the other treating in details the N-body interaction. Here, we add the long-term evolution in order to allow a physical characterization as an additional aspect. A natural extension of this approach will be in future a better description of the atmospheric structure and the chemical compositions of the planets, as well as the inclusion of atmospheric evaporation and the formation of secondary atmospheres for low-mass planets. This will finally lead to the study of planetary habitability.</p><p>It is the goal of population synthesis to eventually calculate from first physical principles a synthetic population that is able to reproduce in a statistically significant way the observed properties of the actual population in terms of its major characteristics like mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, composition, radius and luminosity. The formation model used here for the syntheses combines several simple standard descriptions for important physical mechanism acting during planet formation (α-disk model, core accretion mechanism, tidal migration, 1D planetary structure equations). It is important to understand to what extent this much simplified approach is sufficient to reach the mentioned goal. Comparisons with as many observational results as possible should allow to identify which aspects of current planet formation and evolution theory need most improvements. We also want to understand if physical mechanisms which are currently not at all included in the model are necessary in order to explain the observed properties. Examples are -among may others -the interaction of planetary systems with third, external bodies causing Kozai migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref> or dynamical instabilities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Malmberg et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>In related papers we present how we have concurrently improved also other aspects of our original formation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Alibert, Mordasini &amp; Benz 2004</ref>). We worked on the inclusion of stellar irradiation for the temperature structure of the protoplanetary disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fouchet et al. 2012)</ref>, the description of disk migration taking into account non-isothermal type I migration ( <ref type="bibr">Dittkrist et al. in prep.)</ref>, the concurrent formation of many planets in one disk ( <ref type="bibr">Alibert et al. in prep.</ref>) and a more realistic planetesimal disk and solid accretion rate (Fortier et al. submitted).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Structure of the papers</head><p>In Paper I we have presented the improvements and extensions regarding the calculation of the gaseous envelope of a planet. We have introduced a new, simple and stable method to calculate planetary cooling tracks. We have also described the boundary conditions which are used to solve the structure equations.</p><p>In Paper I we have used the upgraded model to study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the radius of giant planets as function of their mass and age, the influence of the core mass on the radius of giant planets and the planetary luminosity both in the "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario. We put special emphasis on the comparison of our results with those of other models of planet formation and evolution like <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Lissauer et al. (2009)</ref>. We found that our results agree very well with those of the more complex models, despite a number of simplifications we make.</p><p>In this second paper, we introduce further improvements: In Section 2 we describe two upgrades of the computational module which describes the planetary interior structure. First, we now solve the internal structure equations of the solid core 1 which yields a variable, realistic core density as a function of core mass, core composition and external pressure by the surrounding envelope (Sect. 2.1). We assume that the planet is differentiated, consisting of iron, silicates, and, if it accreted outside the ice line, ices. The ice line corresponds to the orbital distance in the protoplanetary disk where the temperature drops below the level necessary for ices to condense, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Hayashi (1981)</ref>. Second, we include radiogenic heating due to the decay of longlived radionuclides in the mantle of the planet (Sect. 2.3). These extensions should in particular allow to calculate the evolution also of planets of a relatively low mass, provided that they have a primordial H 2 /He atmosphere. In Section 3 we show how we have improved the disk model by using more realistic initial and boundary conditions, and a detailed model for the photoevaporation of the disk.</p><p>In the following sections, we present our results. We first use the upgrades to study the effect of a variable core density on the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter (Sect. 5), and the formation and evolution of a close-in super-Earth 2 planet under the influence of radiogenic heating (Sect. 6). As in Paper I, we want to validate the model by comparison with previous studies. Our goal is also to understand how these mechanisms potentially influence population synthesis calculations. The degree of uncertainty which affects our radius calculation is estimated in Sect. 2.2. The most important result, which is the application of the updated model in population synthesis calculations to obtain the planetary mass-radius relationship is shown in Sect. 7. We study how the planetary mass-radius relationship forms and evolves <ref type="bibr">(Sect. 7.2)</ref>. We show the predicted planetary radius distribution and compare with the results of the Kepler satellite (Sect. 7.5).</p><p>We study the impact of the semimajor axis on the radius distribution and give, for comparison with observations, an analytical expression for the mean planetary radius as function of mass (Sect. 7.8). We quantify the spread in radii for a given mass interval in Sect. 7.7 and compare core and total radii in Sect. 7.10. In Section 8 we summarize our results and finally present the conclusions in Section 9.</p><p>In the appendix we show our results concerning the disk module which are mainly comparisons with previous works. The stability of α disks with the new initial profile against self-gravity is discussed in Appendix A, while the evolution of the disks with the new photoevaporation model is shown in Appendix B.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Variable core density</head><p>In previous versions of the formation model, we assumed as other formation models a constant core density of 3.2 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> independent of the size and composition of the core. In order to obtain realistic radii for the core we have replaced this assumption with an internal structure model. Our model is simpler than the one presented, e.g., by <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Valencia et al. (2006)</ref>, and includes for example no internal temperature profile, but, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>, nevertheless yields reasonably accurate results for the radius (see Sect. 2.2 for a discussion of the uncertainties).</p><p>For low-mass, core-dominated planets (or planets without a significant atmosphere) this means that we have realistic total radii which is important for the comparison with, e.g., Kepler results (Sect. 7.6).</p><p>The model calculating the core radii was originally developed for the study of GJ 436b in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Figueira et al. (2009)</ref> where the methods are described. Our approach is very similar to the one described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> for solid planets. We assume that the core is differentiated and consists of layers of iron/nickel, silicates, and, if the embryo accreted planetesimals beyond the iceline, (water) ice. The silicate-iron/nickel ratio is fixed to 2:1 in mass as found for the Earth (we shall call such a ratio "rocky"), and the ice fraction is given by the formation model as it is known whether the planet accretes in-or outside the iceline.</p><p>Ordinary chondrites have typical total iron weight fractions of roughly 20 to 30% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Kallemeyn et al. 1989)</ref>, and carbonaceous chondrites have Fe/Ni weight fractions around 25% <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Mason, 1963)</ref>. Therefore, assuming 33% as a typical (not strongly altered by giant impacts, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Marcus et al. 2009</ref>) iron fraction for rocky planets is probably not far from what is expected for the typical solar abundance mix, although at the upper end (cf. also <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Weidenschilling 1977)</ref>.</p><p>An important effect for the size of cores of giant planets is the external pressure exerted by the envelope. This leads to significant compression of the core for massive planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Baraffe, Chabrier, &amp; Barman 2008)</ref> where the core is buried below hundreds, or even thousands of Earth masses of gas, and subject to huge pressures of thousands of GPa. This effect is included in our calculations.</p><p>While we used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Figueira et al. (2009)</ref> the EOS for solid materials from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, which are more accurate, but applicable in a limited pressure domain only, we now use the slightly less accurate, but more widely applicable (also at very high pressures) modified polytropic EOS from <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> which has a form (ρ is the density, P the pressure) ρ(P) = ρ 0 + cP n</p><p>where the parameters ρ 0 , c and n are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>. For silicates, we use the parameters appropriate for MgSiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> (perovskite). At high pressures, such an EOS becomes equivalent to a completely degenerate, non-relativistic electron gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter 1969</ref>) which can be used to solve the Lane-Emden equation with an external pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Milne 1936)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the cores of giant planets, we assume for simplicity that they do not dissolve in the envelope even during the longterm evolution, though this seems possible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Guillot et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Wilson &amp; Militzer 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Core radius as a function of core mass</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, left panel we show the classical plot of (core) radius versus mass for various compositions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Stevenson 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>It shows first the increase of the radius with mass, until a maximum is reached and then a decrease as the electrons become increasingly degenerated, and the material more compressible. The right panel shows the corresponding mean densities. The red solid curve applies to planets with a purely "rocky" composition (2:1 silicate-to-iron ratio), close to the terrestrial composition. For M = 1M ⊕ , the models yields a radius of 0.96 R ⊕ . The green dotted curve is for 50% ice and 50% "rocky", while the dashed blue line is for a planet made purely of water ice, which is a composition that is however not expected to exist in nature. All three cases were calculated without applying an external pressure P ext , and thus correspond to terrestrial (or ice) planets without significant envelopes. In the left panel, we also show the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> for planets with a "rocky" and pure water composition calculated with a more accurate EOS. One sees that for masses less than ∼ 200M ⊕ and ∼ 60M ⊕ for "rocky" and pure ice planets, respectively, we find very similar radii and recover their results to typically within 1% to 2%. For a pure ice planet, at a mass of 100M ⊕ , we find a radius that is 3% smaller than obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>. At such a high mass, it is however expected that a non-negligible amount of gas is accreted during the presence of the protoplanetary disk, which has a much stronger effect on the (total) radius. It is indeed found in the synthesis that at a core mass of 100M ⊕ , even the planets which accreted the lowest amount of gas have a total radius that is 65% larger than the core radius (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 16</ref>).</p><p>The two black lines correspond to cores of giant planets. Both lines show the radius for objects consisting of 75% ice and 25% "rocky" material as expected for the composition of solids in the Solar System beyond the iceline (we shall call such a composition "icy"). This 3:1 ice-to-rock ratio comes from the classical minimum mass solar nebula model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Hayashi (1981)</ref>. More recent works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Lodders et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Min et al. 2011</ref>) indicate a ratio that is closer to unity for water ice. At sufficiently low temperatures, the ices of CH 4 and NH 3 , which are the most important ices after H 2 O ice, would approximately lead to a 2:1 ratio ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Min et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Without an external pressure, the radii (respectively density) of planets with such a composition would lie approximately in the middle between the green and the blue line. With the external pressure, the core gets compressed. The short-dashed-dotted line is for an external pressure P ext of 4000 GPa (4 × 10 13 dyn/cm 2 ), <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Total planetary or core radii and mean densities as a function of mass for different compositions. The red solid curve corresponds to a "rocky" planet with a 2:1 silicate-to-iron ratio, similar to Earth. The green dotted curve is for planets consisting of 50% ice, 33% silicates and 17% iron. The blue dashed line shows radii for planets consisting entirely of ice. These three models are calculated without an external pressure on the surface and, therefore, apply to low-mass planets without significant envelopes. The thin red and blue dotted lines show the result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> for comparison. The thin black lines correspond to cores of giant planets. The short-dashed-dotted line is for a 75% ice, 25% "rocky" core inside an old, Jovian mass planet (P ext = 4×10 13 dyn/cm 2 ). The long-dashed-dotted line is for a core of the same composition inside an old, 10 M Super-Jupiter planet (P ext = 6 × 10 15 dyn/cm 2 ). which is the estimated central pressure of a Jupiter today <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2009)</ref>. The long-dashed-dotted line shows the even more extreme conditions at the core-envelope boundary of an 5 Gyr old, 10 M planet. For this case we find (Paper I) an external pressure as high as ∼600 TPa (6 × 10 15 dynes/cm 2 ). Such a central pressure is roughly expected from the simple estimate based on hydrostatic equilibrium which scales as M 2 /R 4 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Kippenhahn &amp; Weigert 1990)</ref>, and the fact that the radius R only changes (decreases) weakly between 1 and 10 Jupiter masses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chabrier et al. 2009</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows that a typical giant planet core with a mass of 10 M ⊕ inside a Jupiter mass planet gets compressed to a radius of about 1.6 R ⊕ corresponding to a mean density of about 12 to 14 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . Inside the Super-Jupiter, the core gets squeezed to a radius of about 0.75 R ⊕ , corresponding to a very high mean density of about 130 g/cm 3 .</p></div>

Compared to the blue line (also 10 M ⊕ , but without external pressure), these lines lie at clearly smaller radii. One also notes that the composition becomes less important: For P ext = 0, R increases by a factor 1.44 when going from f ice = 0 to f ice = 1, which is in good agreement with the fitting formula from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> and just corresponds to the result expected when the mean density of "rocky" material is three times higher than ice. With the high external pressures, we find in contrast a radius increase by only a factor of about 1.19 and 1.15 for the Jovian and Super-Jupiter case, respectively. This is due to the fact that for the (completely) degenerate electron gas, the density for a given pressure depends on the material only via the mean molecular weight per free electron µ e <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Cox &amp; Giuli 1968)</ref>. The mean molecular weight per free electron (and thus the density in the limit of complete degeneracy) of "rocky" material is however only about 1.14 times higher than the µ e of pure water ice. This explains why at very high pressures, the dependence of the radius on the specific core material becomes weaker.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Uncertainties in the radius calculations</head><p>The different sources of uncertainty which affect theoretical models calculating planetary radii have been addressed in many works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Baraffe et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Grasset et al. 2009</ref>). We here discuss simplifications which are specific to our model. In view of the population synthesis calculations presented below where comparison are made with the observed radii, it is important to estimate the uncertainties which are introduced by these simplifications. For the solid core, we have neglected the internal temperature profile, used a simple modified polytropic equation of state (EOS) and a Si/Fe ratio fixed at the terrestrial value. For the gaseous envelope, we assume that all solid reside in the core (no heavy element mixing with the envelope), and use simple gray atmospheric boundary conditions (Paper I). We next discuss the possible impact of these simplifications.</p></div>

This agrees with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. (2007)</ref> Fixed silicate-iron ratio Grasset at al. (2009) studied in details the effects of different <ref type="bibr">[Mg/Si]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/Si]</ref> values. Using observed abundances of extrasolar host stars, and assuming that the planets have the same relative abundances in Fe, Mg, and Si as their hosts, they found that the radii of "rocky" planets only change by less than 1.5% when the composition varies over the observed domain. Larger differences in the radii however occur if one abandons the assumption of identical relative abundances in planets and the host star. Such a situation can result from collisional mantel stripping as might have occurred for Mercury (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Benz et al. 2007</ref>). For a 1 M ⊕ planet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Marcus et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Gaseous envelope</head><p>All solids in the core The consequences of how the heavy elements are distributed in a (giant) planet have been analyzed in details by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref>. The two limiting cases are either that all solids reside in the core, surrounded by a pure H 2 /He envelope (as in our model), or that there is no core, but that the solids are uniformly mixed with the gas. For a Neptunian planet, and a heavy element mass fraction Z = M Z /M of up to 20%, putting all solids in the core versus uniform mixing typically leads to a change of the radius by ∼ 10% during the long-term evolution. For a Jovian planet, with Z=20% or 50%, the variation in the radius is of order 4% and 12%, respectively. For both planet types, putting the solids in the core leads to larger radii.</p><p>Gray atmosphere model The Kepler satellite has recently detected large numbers of planets with radii between the radius of the Earth and the ice giants, allowing to study the composition of such objects (Sect. 7.6). Most of these transiting planets are inside ∼ 0.5 AU from their host star, therefore they are subjected to significant levels of irradiation. It is well known (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Guillot &amp; Showman 2002</ref>) that a strong irradiation can significantly affect the evolution of a planet, and lead to atmospheric structures more complex than the simple gray atmosphere we use (Paper I). In the current version of our model, we do not allow planets to migrate closer than 0.1 AU to the star, so that the cases undergoing the strongest effects are excluded by construction. But also at a distance of 0.1 AU, the irradiation already affects the radius of low-mass planets with H 2 /He atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>). In order to estimate the uncertainty introduced by using the simple gray atmosphere model, we compare in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> the radii of low-mass planets with H 2 /He atmospheres with those found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. These authors use a more realistic "two-stream" atmosphere (Guillot 2010). The radii shown in the figure were found not by combined formation and evolution calculations as in the rest of this study, but instead by specifying directly the composition of the planets, their semimajor axis and the intrinsic luminosity ("equilibrium model" in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>). Then, the same method as in the evolutionary calculations was used to obtain the radii. In all models, the intrinsic luminosity per mass is 10 −6.5 erg g −1 s −1 as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. The left panel shows the radii for planets with an equilibrium temperature of 500 K, which corresponds for zero albedo to an orbital distance of about 0.3 AU around a solar-like star. In this and the middle panel, a composition of the core with an ice mass fraction of 67% and 33% "rocky" material was assumed. This is similar, but not exactly identical as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, because of a somewhat different composition of the silicates. The resulting radius of the core is also shown in the <ref type="figure">figure.</ref> A comparison of the thick and thin lines show that both models lead to the same global pattern (as also found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Valencia et al. 2010)</ref>. At a total mass of the planet of 20M ⊕ , our model predicts total radii (i.e. τ = 2/3) which are 2% larger than those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, independent of the envelope mass fraction f = M XY /M = 1 − Z. This difference is partially due to an identical difference in the core radius. When moving to smaller planetary masses, the differences get larger, in particular for planets with a high envelope mass fraction. This is expected, as such low-mass, high f planets are particularly sensible to irradiation. At M = 4M ⊕ , for f =0.05, we find radii which are 7% larger, while for f = 0.5, the difference becomes significant with about 25%. In the combined formation-evolution calculation it is however found that the envelope mass fraction scales with the total mass of the planet (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>), so that low-mass planets with very massive envelopes cannot exist. This is a natural consequence of the long KH timescales of low-mass cores. At a total mass of 4M ⊕ for example, the mean f in the synthesis is approximately 0.05, and no planet has f &gt; 0.2, where the overestimation of the radius due to the simple gray atmosphere is about 10%. Preliminary calculations using also the "two-stream" approximation, lead to radii which are in excellent agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, showing that the gray atmosphere is indeed the reason for the differences. We can thus conclude that as long as a planet is not in the regime where R is clearly increasing with decreasing mass (hot, low M, high f planets), the errors introduced by the gray atmosphere are less than ∼15%. In this light, the radii in the middle and left panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> (equilibrium temperature of 250 K) to the right of the dotted line should not be too affected by the gray approximation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 10</ref> shows that indeed, only a tiny fraction of the synthetic planets falls in the regime where the gray atmosphere introduces large differences, thanks to the fact that we model planets with a ≥ 0.1 AU only. We must however keep in mind that we have compared here equilibrium models only, i.e. we have not studied how a different atmospheric boundary condition affects the entire temporal evolution. This will be addressed in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Summary</head><p>In summary we see that depending on the properties of a planet, the errors affecting the radius are of a different level. A clearly gas dominated, Jovian planet at large orbital distance is less affected than a low-mass planet with a 20% H 2 /He atmosphere at 0.1 AU, even if also for the giant planet, we cannot reach the level of refinement as in dedicated models for individual planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Fortney et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>When considering the uncertainties of the radii in a bigger context, one should keep in mind the following point: The evolution of planets is by itself a complex problem, which is studied in dedicated evolutionary models. In the combined formation and evolution model shown here, however, the evolutionary part serves first of all to establish a link between observable properties of planets at late times, and the formation model, where many mechanisms are poorly understood. When used in planetary population synthesis calculations, the model must thus be sufficiently accurate that possible observational findings like correlations between radius and planet mass, host star metallicity, semimajor axis, etc., are not lost as constraints for the formation model. This results in different requirements than when one is interested in determining as exactly as possible the composition of one specific planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Core luminosity due to radioactive decay</head><p>During the accretion of planetesimals, the luminosity of the core due to this process is approximatively given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L core,acc = GM Z R core ˙ M Z (2)</formula><p>where M Z is the mass of the core, R core its radius, ˙ M Z the accretion rate of planetesimals, and G the gravitational constant. This equation is applicable if the planetesimals or their debris sinks to the core (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Mordasini et al. 2005</ref>) and if their initial velocity is small compared to the escape velocity of the core. In our previous models, the accretion of planetesimals is the only source of luminosity of the core. This means that once the accretion of solids ceases, the core luminosity drops to zero. However, several processes can lead to a non-zero core luminosity during the evolution of the core at constant mass (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Baraffe et al. 2008)</ref>: the cooling of the core due to its internal energy content dU/dt, its contraction −PdV/dt, and finally the decay of radioactive elements contained in it. Within the upgraded model, we now take into account the last two points (see Paper I for the contraction). In this section we describe how we model the last mechanism.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Wasserburg et al. 1964</ref>), assuming a chondritic composition. We further assume that the radiogenic heat production rate in the interior, and the loss at the surface are in equilibrium, i.e. the luminosity at the surface is equal to the instantaneous radiogenic energy production rate inside the planet. We therefore neglect a possible delayed secular cooling, and also possible residual heat from the impacts during the formation of the planet. This is, at least for Earth today, a good approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Hofmeister &amp; Criss 2005)</ref>. As illustrated below, the radiogenic luminosity L radio obtained this way is small, but not negligible for the total luminosity of low-mass (super-Earth) planets' with a tenuous H 2 /He atmosphere, i.e. L radio provides a physically motivated minimum for the luminosity of the core, once the accretion of planetesimals has ceased. This can play a role for the evolution of the total radius, which is an observable quantity, as demonstrated in Section 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Valencia et al. (2010)</ref> simply use a total heat production rate of 2 × 10 20 erg s −1 M −1 ⊕ for the planet's mantel which is also assumed to have a chondritic composition. They assume that the rate is constant in time. We improve this by considering that over timescales of billions of years, the heat production by the longlived radionuclides will decrease according to the law of the exponential radioactive decay.</p><p>Denoting with Q(t) the energy release per second per gram of chondritic material, one can write (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Prialnik et al. 1987</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q(t) = Q 0 e −λt (3)</formula><p>where Q 0 is the heat production rate per gram of chondritic material at time t = 0, and λ = ln 2/t 1/2 is the decay constant for a radionuclide with a half-life t 1/2 . The values of Q 0 can be found by extrapolating back from currently measured values in meteorites <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">. In table 1</ref> we give the values of λ and Q 0 derived from the data given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Lowrie (2007)</ref> for the three nuclides we include. These values are compatible with the ones of <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Prialnik et al. (1987)</ref>.

The total radioactive luminosity of the core is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L radio (t) = Q tot (t) f mantle f rocky M Z (5)</formula><p>where M Z is the total core mass, f mantle the mantle fraction and f rocky = 1 − f ice the mass fraction of "rocky" material in the core. With this setting, one finds for an Earth like planet ( f mantle =2/3, f rocky =1, M Z =1 M ⊕ ) at t = 4.5 Gyrs a radioactive luminosity of L radio = 2.26 × 10 20 erg/s which is in good agreement with the value from <ref type="bibr">Valencia et al. (2009)</ref>. For t = 0, one finds L radio = 1.65 × 10 21 erg/s, or about a factor 7.3 higher than today. This is in good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Wasserburg et al. (1964)</ref> who estimate a ratio of 4.5 to 8.2 depending on the chemical composition of the Earth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Nettelmann et al. (2011)</ref> find in a similar approach as here a present time radiogenic heat production rate of 2.3 × 10 20 erg/s, and a value of 2.7 × 10 21 erg/s at t = 0. The latter value is higher than found here, probably because we have not included 235 U due to it's relatively short half-life of 0.47 Gyrs. The value of the radiogenic luminosity due to longlived nuclides at t = 0 (or up to small t ∼ 10 Myrs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Prialnik et al. 1987)</ref> has no practical meaning, as short-lived radionuclides, and heat produced by collisional growth would then dominate by many orders of magnitude. It gives however an impression by how much the heat flux due to long-lived radionuclides has varied over the lifetime of the Solar System.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Short-lived radionuclides</head><p>We have neglected the radiogenic heating due to short-lived radionuclides, in particular Aluminium 26.

This value is compatible with the one given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Prialnik et al. (1987)</ref>. This is many orders of magnitude more than for the long-lived nuclides. If we were to have a fully assembled rocky 1 M ⊕ planet at t = 0, then <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Al would lead to a luminosity of about 2.5 L , and a surface temperature of 414 K (neglecting melting and a delayed heat transport, which is clearly not realistic in this case).</p><p>It is difficult to derive a general model (i.e. also for other stars than the sun) including short-lived radionuclides for a number of reasons: First, it is unclear how universal the initial abundance of short-lived radionuclides is for different planetary systems. If non-local effects play an important role (like the proposed nearby supernova, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cameron &amp; Truran 1977)</ref>, then we probably must expect very different initial concentrations. Second, due to the short half-life of <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Al (about 0.72 Myrs), results regarding this nuclide are very sensitive to the exact time delay between CAI formation and inclusion into the planetesimals and protoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Prialnik et al. 1987</ref>). The time corresponding to t = 0 is not very well defined in our simulations. For example, the distribution of initial disk masses is based on observations of YSO in ρ Ophiuchi, which is about 1 Myr old ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Andrews et al. 2009</ref>). Third, the inclusion of short-lived nuclides would require a detailed thermic model of the core, allowing melting and heat transport. This is currently beyond the scope of the model. The same applies for the heating due to impacts.</p><p>In the result Section 6, we illustrate the effect of the radiogenic heat production on the luminosity of a low-mass planet with a tenuous primordial H 2 /He atmosphere.</p></div>

It should be noted that the primary role of photoevaporation in the framework of planet formation models like the one here is that it acts as a controlling mechanism for the disk lifetime, which is important for the final mass of giant planets. The finer description of the photoevaporation (in specific where how much gas is removed) is in contrast not very important, as the detailed description becomes important only when the typical disk surface density (or alternatively, the accretion rate onto the star) has become small. At such surface densities, the main gas driven mechanisms (gas accretion, tidal migration) have however already fallen to a low level.</p></div>

(2010</ref> and a variable one, using the model described above. The simulation with a variable core density is the nominal case discussed in Paper I, where all parameters used in the simulation can be found. Except for the density, all settings are identical in the two simulations.</p><p>The top left panel of the figure shows the core mass as a function of time during the formation phase. It immediately demonstrates that the formation is very similar in both cases, in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> who found only a weak dependence of the formation on the core density. The core grows in the simulation with the constant density during phase I initially slightly slower, as the actual mean density is then still smaller (about 2 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> ), as can be seen in the bottom left panel. This leads to a larger capture radius for planetesimals and thus to a faster growth. This is because in phase I, capture and core radius are initially identical (Paper I).</p><p>For the variable density, the growth of the core leads to an increase of the density due to the increasing pressure, therefore the two densities become equal roughly in the middle of phase I. From now on, the actual density is always larger than 3.2 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The further mass accretion in phase II is similar in both cases. This is due to the fact that the capture radius for planetesimals is now between 10 to 60 times larger than R core . The capture radius is similar in both cases, because the density structure in the envelope relevant for the capture is similar in both cases, since it is located quite far away from the core. The mean core density in phase II is of order 4 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , so quite close to the constant value. As the runaway gas accretion phase is approached, the density in the variable case increases, so that the evolution starts to diverge slightly, with the constant density case growing now faster. This leads to a difference in the formation timescale of somewhat less than 10 5 years, corresponding to about 10%.</p><p>The collapse of the planet and the rapid accretion of ∼ 300 Earth masses of gas lead to a rapid increase of the core density during the collapse/gas runaway accretion phase, due to the quickly growing external pressure exerted on the core. The density goes up quickly from about 5 to 10 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The core grows during the same time by another ∼ 17M ⊕ in mass. The increase of the density however over-compensates that, so that R core actually shrinks after having reached a local maximum, as visible in the top right panel. This is an interesting effect. We should however keep in mind that it is unclear whether the planetesimals still penetrate to the core in this phase (Paper I), therefore the moment of the maximum core radius might occur already at an earlier time than shown here where it coincides with the onset of gas runaway accretion.</p><p>During the long-term evolution, a core density of 3.2 g/cm 3 is clearly not realistic. The actual core densities range between 10 and 15 g/cm 3 (14.3 g/cm 3 at 4.6 Gyrs), leading at late times to a significant difference of R core of about 0.13R between the two cases.</p><p>It is interesting to investigate how this difference affects the observable total radius. This is shown in the bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 5</ref>. We find that the total radius is larger in the constant density case, too. The difference is as expected smaller than for the core radius, namely about 0.06 R at 4.6 Gyrs.

The red, solid line is the total intrinsic luminosity, while the blue dotted line is L radio . The left axis gives L in units of present day intrinsic Jovian luminosities. The right panel shows the total radius (red solid line) and the radius of the solid core (blue dotted line). The inset figure shows the total radius at late times. Note the delayed contraction between about 0.2 and 2 Gyrs due to radiogenic heating. Atmospheric mass loss, as well as outgassing are neglected so that one directly sees the effect of L radio . These simplifications could however also mean that the evolution is in reality more complex than shown here. a non-negligible difference, as it would otherwise correspond to a difference of the core mass of about 30M ⊕ (Paper I; ), which is a significant quantity. For accurate comparisons of our population synthesis calculations with transit observations we must therefore include a realistic core density model, as can implicitly be deduced already from the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Evolution of a super-Earth planet including radioactive luminosity</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> we illustrate the effect of L radio on the total luminosity of a low-mass, super-Earth planet (core mass M Z = 4.2M ⊕ ) which has, at the end of formation, a tenuous H 2 /He envelope with a mass of about M XY = 0.045M ⊕ , i.e. about 1%. For comparison, Venus has an atmosphere with a mass of approximately 8 × 10 −5 M ⊕ , which is a factor ≈ 560 less. On this scale, M XY = 0.045M ⊕ still corresponds to a relatively massive envelope.</p><p>The H 2 /He envelope mass of low-mass planets at the end of formation varies as it depends on a number of factors. Important quantities are the grain opacity in the envelope (see the dedicated work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Mordasini et al. 2012c</ref>), the luminosity of the core due to the accretion of planetesimals, but also, as tests have shown, the radiogenic luminosity of the core due to the decay of <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Al. Large radiogenic core luminosities during the nebular phase can lead to lower envelope masses because of a stronger pressure support in the gas at a higher temperature. By modifying the final envelope mass, short-lived radionuclides can thus have an impact on the long-term evolution of a planet in an indirect way. The planets which are most affected by this mechanism are lowmass, core-dominated "rocky" planets, which undergo towards the end of their formation a phase where the accretion rate of planetesimals is low. This can for example occur if a planet is caught in a type I convergence zone, and has emptied its feeding zone. If this happens early enough compared to the half-life of the radionuclides, the radiogenic heating will reduce the amount of gas that can be accreted.</p><p>In the light of the discoveries of the Kepler satellite of a number of low-mass, low-density planets (e.g. the Kepler-11 system, Lissauer et al. 2011a) the problem of possible primordial envelope masses in the transition regime between terrestrial and water planets on one hand (without primordial envelopes), and mini-Neptunes (with primordial envelopes) has become an important one. We show our results concerning this question in Sect. 7.6.</p><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref> shows the total intrinsic and the radiogenic luminosity (neglecting 26 Al) as a function of time. During the formation of the planet, the luminosity is high, mostly due to the accretion of solids. The specific shape of L in this phase with some wave-like patterns is a consequence of the complex migration behavior of this planet, giving origin to phases with high and low planetesimal accretion rates, and thus core luminosities. The planet eventually migrates to ∼ 0.1 AU. At about 4 Myrs, the accretion of solids (and of gas) ceases. The luminosity is now dominated by the contraction and cooling of the gaseous envelope. At about 400 Myrs however, L radio becomes the dominant source of luminosity for this planet, giving rise to a transient plateau phase of roughly constant L. Finally, beyond a few billion years, L starts to decrease again, following now the decrease of L radio according to the radioactive decay law. As found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Nettelmann et al. (2011)</ref>, we see that it is important to include radiogenic heating to accurately model the thermal evolution of core-dominated planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Radius evolution and comparison with Rogers et al. (2011)</head><p>Knowing the intrinsic luminosity (as well as the irradiation from the host star), we can calculate the radius of a (low-mass) planet as a function of time, and thus compare with results of transit observations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> shows the core and total radius as a function of time. During the attached phase, the planet has a large radius (Paper I), and then contracts rapidly after accretion has stopped (i.e. when the protoplanetary gas disk disappears) to a radius of initially about 3.5 R ⊕ . During the following evolution, it slowly contracts to a radius of about 2.2 R ⊕ at 4.6 Gyrs. The core radius is only 1.46 R ⊕ , so despite the fact that the envelope only contains about 1% of the total mass, it contributes significantly to the radius. This is a well know effect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Valencia et al. 2010</ref>; Sect. 2.2.2).</p><p>At an orbital distance of 0.1 AU from a solar-like star and the albedo we assume (Paper I) we get a surface temperature of the planet during the evolutionary phase of about 790 K. This temperature is virtually constant, as the contribution of the intrinsic luminosity compared to the contribution from stellar irradiation is negligible. The temporal variation of the stellar luminosity itself is currently not considered in the model. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> we show the temporal evolution of the pressure-temperature profile in the planetary envelope. The entire envelope is shown, so that the lower ends of the lines correspond to the temperature and pressure at the interface with the solid core. The first profile which corresponds to the rightmost line is shown at an age of the planet of 5 Myrs, which is about one million year after the end of the formation phase. At this early time, the temperature at the coreenvelope boundary is approximately 6700 K. The last profile which is the leftmost line shows the state at a hypothetical age of 16 Gyrs. The temperature at the core envelope-interface has then fallen to ∼ 1500 K. The intrinsic luminosity is decreasing with time, therefore the envelope becomes completely radiative at an age of about 7 Gyrs. At even later times, the envelope would become isothermal. Between an age of 5 Myrs and 16 Gyrs, additional p − T structures are shown at irregular time intervals of a few 10 4 yrs (at the beginning) to several 10 9 yrs towards the end, reflecting the increase of the numerical time step due to the increase of the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale of the planet.</p><p>We note that our treatment of the effect of stellar irradiation on the envelope structure is very basic at the moment (Paper I) and will be improved in future <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Guillot 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heng et al. 2011</ref>). It is therefore likely that the upper part of the atmosphere structure is clearly more complex than shown here.</p><p>It is interesting to compare our results with the ones of Rogers et al. (2011) who use a more realistic "two-stream" atmosphere (Guillot 2010). These authors find for a 4M ⊕ planet with a 1% envelope a radius of about 2.7 and 3.3 R ⊕ , at an equilibrium temperature of 500 and 1000 K, respectively, and an intrinsic luminosity to mass ratio of L/M = 10 −6.5 = 3.2 × 10 −7 erg/(g s).</p><p>These authors do not follow the temporal evolution of the internal luminosity and thus use the L/M ratio as an age proxy, as was also made to calculate <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>Our planet has L/M ratios of 6.6×10 −6 , 5.2×10 −7 , 1.7×10 −7 and 1.1 × 10 −8 erg/(g s) at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 Gyrs, respectively. The values at 1 and 10 Gyrs simply correspond to Eq. 5. One notes the effect of the plateau phase because of radiogenic heating between roughly 0.2 and 2 Gyrs. This is also directly visible in the evolution of the radius <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 6, right panel</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Evolutionary sequence of the p − T structure of the envelope. The first structure (rightmost line) is at 5 Myrs, the last structure (leftmost line) is at a hypothetical age of 16 Gyrs. The entire internal structure is shown, which means that the lower end of a line corresponds to the core-envelope interface, while the top end corresponds to the τ = 2/3 surface. Red indicates convective parts, black radiative layers. Note that the actual upper part of the envelope/atmosphere will be more complex than shown here, since we only use a simple grey atmosphere in the current model. as these authors assume an icy composition of the core resulting in a core radius of about 1.9 R ⊕ , while we use an Earth-like "rocky" composition as the planet has accreted only inside the ice line, leading to a R core = 1.46R ⊕ . Therefore, there is a difference of the core radii of about 0.45 R ⊕ . Taking this into account, we see that for the total radius, the models agree on a 0.2 R ⊕ or better level, corresponding to about ∼7%. The comparison here, and in Sect. 2.2.2, shows that the radii of low-mass super-Earth planets can be simulated for the population synthesis with relatively good accuracy.</p><p>As the evaporation of the primordial H 2 /He envelope, the thermal cooling of the core as well as the outgassing of a secondary atmosphere during the long-term evolution are not included, we must nevertheless keep in mind that the evolution of the planet on Gyrs could in reality be more complex than shown here. Here, our interest was to show the differential effect of L radio . To quantify the importance of subsequent H 2 outgassing, we can use the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. These authors find that a rocky planet with a composition as we assume (2:1 silicate-to-iron ratio) could outgas H 2 corresponding to about 0.2 wt% of its mass. This corresponds in the case here to 0.0084 M ⊕ . This is a factor ∼ 5 less than the mass of the primordial atmosphere, so that at least this effect should not completely change the evolution.</p></div>

The new description of photoevaporation of Sect. 3.4 is applied, and for the calculation of the vertical temperature structure of the disk we now include besides viscous heating also stellar irradiation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fouchet et al. 2012</ref>). As in earlier works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>), we fix the α viscosity parameter to 7 × 10 −3 .</p><p>Regarding the planetary seed, we start with an embryo of 0.6 M ⊕ . This setting, and the fact that we do not calculate any planetary growth once that the gaseous disk is gone means that our model lacks an essential phase (giant impacts) in the formation of low-mass (terrestrial) planets, so that results about low-mass planets (M 10M ⊕ ) must be regarded with caution (see extended discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>). For the internal structure of the core, we use the model presented in Sect. 2.1. Radiogenic heating is included as a source of core luminosity as described in Sect. 2.3. The fraction of ice in the core is known as we keep track of how much solids are accreted inside or outside of the iceline. The position of the iceline is given by the initial temperature structure of the nebula ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>).</p><p>Primordial H 2 /He envelopes only are considered in the model. For the treatment of the accretion shock occurring during gas runaway accretion, we assume that the shock radiates all liberated energy into outer space i.e. we assume a "cold start" scenario (Paper I). The gas accretion rate in the runaway phase is calculated as described in Paper I allowing for non-equilibrium fluxes in the disk. We use the simplification of a constant luminosity within the envelope, due to the reasons explained in Paper I. We assume that the grain opacity in the gaseous envelope is 0.003 times the value in the interstellar medium. This value has been determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref> by comparison with detailed grain evolution calculations in protoplanetary envelopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Movshovitz et al. 2010</ref>). For the opacity due to the grain-free gas, the tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Freedman et al. (2008)</ref> are used. Two effects related to the planetary envelope which can be relevant during the long-term evolution of the planet are currently not included. First, we do not include deuterium burning in the low number of planets that grow beyond the D-burning limit. This will affect the radius of objects more massive than ∼13M at early times (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Spiegel et al. 2011</ref>). Second, we do not take into account that planets close to the star can loose parts of their gaseous envelope due to evaporation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lammer et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>).    <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2010)</ref>, we now distinguish several sub-types of type I migration which lead to different migration directions and rates. We distinguish isothermal and adiabatic regimes as well as regimes where the corotation torque saturates. We also take into account the decrease of the surface density due to beginning gap formation. For the transition to type II migration, we now use the criterion derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Crida et al. (2006</ref>). An important effect of the non-isothermal type I migration is that it leads to the existence of convergence zones, i.e. to places in the disk towards which the planets migrate both from in-and outside ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Lyra et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Mordasini et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Kretke &amp; Lin 2012)</ref>. Once a low-mass planet has migrated into such a convergence zone, it follows the viscous evolution of the disk. This means that it migrates on a viscous timescale, which is typically much longer than the migration timescale in the isothermal type I approximation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Tanaka et al. 2002)</ref>. The rapid, and always inward migration in the isothermal approximation as assumed in our previous studies made arbitrary reduction factors necessary. In the new migration model, no efficient factors are used any more. A short overview of the migration model is presented in Mordasini et al. (2011a) while a detailed description will be given in <ref type="bibr">Dittkrist et al. (in prep.)</ref>. We fix the stellar mass to 1 M in all calculations and follow the evolution of the planets up to an age of 10 Gyrs. The calculations presented here are made in the one-embryo-per-disk approximation. The effects induced by the concurrent formation of many protoplanets (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Hellary &amp; Nelson 2012</ref>) like for example capture into meanmotion resonances, competition for gas and solids, or effects of the eccentricity onto the migration, cannot be described in the current model. The results from HARPS indicate that lowmass planets are usually found in multiple systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). This simplification is therefore an important limitation which should be kept in mind when comparing the model out-comes for low-mass planets with observations. The model will reach its full predictive power only when the improvements presented here will be combined with the calculation of the concurrent formation of many embryos per disk <ref type="bibr">(Carron et al. in prep.)</ref>. Giant planets on the other hand are more frequently found as single planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Latham et al. 2011</ref>). For this class of planet, our predictions should be more solid.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2.">Probability distributions</head><p>As in earlier studies, we use four Monte-Carlo variables to represent the variations of the initial conditions of planet formation. For the disk metallicity and the initial semimajor axis of the embryo we use the same probability distributions as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. (2009a)</ref>. For the distribution of the initial gas mass in the protoplanetary disks we now use the distribution found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Andrews et al. (2010)</ref> for the Ophiuchus star forming region. This replaces the much older observational data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Beckwith &amp; Sargent (1996)</ref>. The new distribution is characterized by a mean and standard deviation in log(M disk /M ) of -1.66 and 0.56, respectively. We have adjusted the external photoevaporation rates in order to get a distribution of lifetimes of the synthetic disks which is in good agreement with the observed distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Fedele et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the synthetic mass-radius diagram at four moments in time during the formation phase when planets grow in mass, i.e. in the first few million years when the protoplanetary disk is present. The color coding indicates the fraction of heavy elements in the planet Z = M Z /M. We assume for simplicity that all heavy elements sink to the core, so that M Z = M core . This might not be the case in reality since planetesimals can get destroyed in protoplanetary atmospheres, cf. . This means that our results should rather be associated with the total amount of heavy elements in a planet, and not its actual core mass. Observations and modeling of the interiors of planets both in the Solar System and of extrasolar planets (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Nettelmann et al. 2011</ref> indicate that the assumption of a few chemically homogenous layers is an idealization. Interior models of Uranus and Neptune that consist of pure rocky, icy and H/He layers seem not to be consistent with the gravity field data ( ). The gravitational moments can instead be reproduced with models without hard density jumps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Helled et al. 2011</ref>). Such a more complex distribution of the heavy elements would affect the planets in several ways: During the formation phase, the efficiency of gas accretion is higher for strongly enriched envelopes, and the critical mass for runaway is reduced ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Hori et al. 2011</ref>). During the evolutionary phase, the evolution of the radius of the planet is affected as discussed in Sect. 2.2.2, and the assumption of an effective convective energy transport may break down due to composition gradients (e.g. Stevenson 1985; <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012)</ref>. Finally, also the structure of the (remaining) solid core would differ, since its mass would be lower compared to the sinking approximation we currently use. For these reasons, it is important to take these effects into account in future models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1.">Basic structure</head><p>The basic structure of the plots can be understood when considering the evolution of the radius as seen in the Jupiter in situ formation and evolution simulation presented in Paper I. When looking at the top left hand panel showing the M − R relation at 1 Myr, we can identify different regimes:</p><p>At low masses (M 30M ⊕ ) planets are in the attached phase and sub-critical for gas runaway accretion. Their radius is approximately equal to the Hill sphere radius R H = (M/(3M * )) 1/3 a (or their Bondi radius in hotter parts of the nebula, Paper I). Depending on the semimajor axis of planets, the radius can therefore be very large, between 100 to 1000 R ⊕ . We see that in this regime, the outer radius increases with mass, as expected from the functional form of R H . Planets thus move diagonally upwards in the M − R plane as they grow. The substructures which are seen in the M − R diagram at low masses come from different semimajor axes and different migration behaviors. Planets in this mass regime are dominated by solids and contain less than ∼ 20% gas (for M 10M ⊕ ). The lower the planet mass, the lower the envelope mass fraction. This is because the timescale of the envelope accretion increases nonlinearly with decreasing core mass (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>At high masses (M 100M ⊕ ), planets have in contrast a small radius between roughly 20 and 30 R ⊕ (∼2-3 R ). This are giant planets which are undergoing gas runaway accretion. They are in the detached phase, and their radius has collapsed (Paper I). As they grow in mass, they move nearly horizontally towards the right in the M − R plane. In terms of internal bulk composition, these planets contain ∼ 50% gas or more.</p><p>The transition from the first to the second group occurs typically at a total mass of about 40 to 60M ⊕ . At this moment the gas accretion rate found by calculating the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale of the planet becomes so high that the disk can no longer deliver the necessary amount of gas to keep the envelope in contact with the nebula, so that the radius detaches and collapses. These planets have hence just started runaway gas accretion. In this stage, planets move nearly vertically downwards in the M − R plane, as the collapse is a rapid process. The colors show that the core and the envelope have at this moment roughly the same mass, again as seen in the Jupiter models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2.">Development for t &gt; 2 Myrs</head><p>The top right panel shows the situation at 2 Myrs. The global structure is similar as at 1 Myr, but there is one exception. At 1 Myr, all low-mass planets are still in the attached phase, and thus have a relatively large radius. As an example, for planets with a mass less than 10 M ⊕ , the smallest radius at 1 Myr is about 7 R ⊕ . This is because our synthetic disks all have a lifetime of at least 1 Myr. At 2 Myrs, in contrast, some gaseous disk have disappeared. As we have seen in Sect. 6.1, this triggers for lowmass planets the rapid contraction of the envelope. Therefore, at 2 Myrs, there are now some low-mass planets which are already in the evolutionary phase and have a radius of 2 to 3 R ⊕ .</p><p>At 3 Myrs, this group has grown in number, as more disks have disappeared. The global structure is otherwise similar. One also notes that some extremely massive planets have formed (M 10 000M ⊕ ≈ 31M ) which did not yet exist at 1 Myr. This is because the formation of very massive planets is only possible in disks which have a long lifetime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>). It is clear that such massive planets can only form in the simulation because we consider the limiting case that gap formation does not reduce the planetary gas accretion rate. Such a situation arises if the eccentric instability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Papaloizou et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kley &amp; Dirksen 2006</ref>) allows the planets to efficiently access disk material even after a gap has formed. For circular orbits, gap formation would in contrast strongly reduce the gas <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Temporal evolution of the planetary mass-radius diagram during the formation phase.

This is simply because almost all protoplanetary gas disks have now disappeared.</p><p>7.3. Mass-radius relationship during evolution <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the M − R diagram during the evolution of the planets at constant mass. Since we do not include atmospheric mass loss, outgassing, deuterium burning or any special inflation mechanisms (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Batygin et al. 2011</ref> and reference therein), all planets only move vertically downwards in the M − R plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1.">Evolution at early times</head><p>At an age of 10 Myrs (top left panel), some planets still have very large radii. The mass-radius relationship is at this moment still considerably different from the shape at later times. For massive giant planets we see that for one mass, there is a significant spread in associated radii. This is a visible imprint of different formation histories, namely of the initial entropy of these planets. The initial entropy for giant planets depends on the way the gas and the solids have been accreted during the formation phase. High gas accretion rates in the runway phase for example make the "cold start" scenario become more similar to the "hot start" scenario (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>. This is because at a high gas accretion rate, a planet accretes a lot of matter when its radius is still relatively big. This means that the accretion shock is weak, leading to a relatively high entropy of the accreted gas. This in turn leads to a large radius. The entropy of young planets <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Temporal evolution of the planetary mass-radius diagram after the final masses have been reached. The colors show the fraction of heavy elements Z = M Z /M in a planet. Orange: Z ≤ 1%. Red: 1 &lt; Z ≤ 5%. Green: 5 &lt; Z ≤ 20%. Blue: 20 &lt; Z ≤ 40%. Cyan: 40 &lt; Z ≤ 60%.

Black: Z &gt; 99%. will be studied in a dedicated work on the planetary luminosities ( <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. in prep)</ref>.</p><p>At an age of 50 Myrs, we start to recognize the characteristic shape of the planetary mass-radius relation. It first consists of small radii for low-mass planets, followed by an increase of the radius with mass up to a local maximum of the radius at about 4 Jovian masses, and finally a decrease of the radius with mass in the Super Jupiter domain. The latter is a consequence of the well known fact that the degree of degeneracy in the interior increases (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chabrier et al. 2009</ref>). This gives the planetary mass-radius relationship an overall shape reminiscent of an elongated "S".</p><p>We currently do not include deuterium burning. This means that the radii of objects more massive than 13 M at times when D burning occurs (t 0.1 -1 Gyr) will be too small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2.">Evolution at late times</head><p>The relative shape of the M − R relation hardly changes between an age of 500 Myrs and 5 Gyrs. The planets slowly contract on Gyr timescales, and thus move vertically downwards, keeping their relative position. The vertical movement can be seen by looking e.g. at the local radius maximum in the giant planet domain.</p><p>At these late times, the spread in radius at a given mass no longer comes directly from their different accretion histories, but instead from their different heavy element contents. The fact that for a given mass, a planet with a higher heavy element content has a smaller radius gives rise to the diagonal pattern seen in the color coding, as illustrated by the following example for t=5 Gyrs. When we move at a fixed radius of, say, 7 R ⊕ from left to right across the envelope of points, we first encounter planets with a mass of about 20 M ⊕ and a heavy element content of 40% to 60% (cyan). When moving further right to higher masses, in order to keep the same radius of 7 R ⊕ , Z must increase. Therefore, at a mass of about 100 M ⊕ , the color changes from cyan to magenta, indicating that the planets now have a heavy element fraction of 60 to 80%. In other words, when we fix the heavy element content, and increase the mass, then the radius increases also, leading to diagonal bands of identical color. Obviously, this is only true in the domain where the radius is an increasing function of mass (M 4M ).</p><p>Also the distance from the star plays a certain role for the radius, with objects closer to the star having a larger radius (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. 2007</ref>). As the minimal allowed radius is 0.1 AU, the effect is, at least for giant planets, not so large, and of order 0.5 to 1 R ⊕ . This is different for the few close-in, low-mass (M &lt; 10M ⊕ ), gas-rich (up to 20% gas) planets that are visible close to the left-hand border of the plot. Such planets have, as expected ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>) large radii (up to 5 or 10 R ⊕ , depending on age) which are increasing with decreasing mass. Note that the radius of these planets is affected by the simple gray atmosphere model as discussed in Sect. 2.2.2. It is also clear that such objects are sensible to envelope evaporation, especially at early times just after formation when they have very large radii, sometimes exceeding 15 R ⊕ . The effects of envelope loss will be included in future work.</p><p>The calculation of the radius for a given age, composition and orbital distance can be done in a purely evolutionary model, too. But only a combined formation and evolution model in a population synthesis calculation gives a prediction for the spread of the radii for a given mass domain, and the distribution of the radii. When looking at the vertical width in radius that the envelope of points covers, we see that depending on mass, there are regimes where all planets nearly have the same radius (very massive giant planets). In other mass domains, there is a very significant spread in possible radii. In Sect. 7.9 below we show histograms of the radius distribution for different mass domains. For example, at t = 5 Gyrs and a mass of about 40 M ⊕ , we find planets with radii between about 3 and 9 R ⊕ i.e. a variation of a factor 3. The reason is that in this mass domain, both clearly solid dominated planets (95 &lt; Z ≤ 99%) as well as small gaseous planets (20 &lt; Z ≤ 40%) exist. Not all types are however found at all semimajor axes (see Sect. 7.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.3.">General shape of the mass-radius relation</head><p>Concerning the overall shape of the planetary mass-radius relation, we see that low-mass planets have small radii, as they consist mostly of solids, while high-mass planets have large radii as they consist mostly of gas. This is clearly visible from the color coding showing the decrease of the heavy element fraction Z = M Z /M with mass. This is a direct consequence of the fact that during formation, low-mass cores cannot accrete large amounts of gas as their Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale is too long. Such planets never undergo gas runaway accretion. In a symmetrically way must massive, super-critical cores always accrete significant amounts of gas (at least if they form during the lifetime of the gaseous disk) as they necessarily must trigger runaway gas accretion. Neither a (nearly) core-free e.g. 10M ⊕ planet (which would have a radius of ∼ 1R at 1 AU, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. 2007</ref>), nor a pure 3M ice planet (which would have a radius R ∼ 0.4R , Sect. 2.1.1) can form in the core accretion scenario. This leads, combined with the fundamental properties of matter as expressed in the EOSs, to the two "forbidden" regions in the planetary M − R plane in the top left and bottom right, resulting in a shape of the mass-radius relationship similar to an elongated "S". We see that the synthetic M − R relationship contains the imprint of the basic concepts of the core accretion formation theory. It is clear that the age of the observed planets is not exactly 5 Gyrs, therefore the comparison can only be approximate. For a more exact comparison, each planet should be compared individually with the synthetic population at its specific age. A comparison of the general structure of the M − R diagram can however still be made, for two reasons. First, all host stars shown here are thought to be old main sequence stars, causing typical uncertainties in the age of an individual star of several Gigayears, often allowing for an actual age of 5 Gyrs. Second, the evolution of the radius at such late time is very slow. The radius of a 1 M planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>. Comparison of the synthetic and the observed mass-radius relationship. The synthetic population, and all actual planets with known mass and radius (both in the Solar System and around other stars) and a semimajor axis of at least 0.1 AU are shown. For extrasolar planets, error bars are given. The color code for the internal composition of the synthetic planets is the same as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. The synthetic population only contains planets with primordial H 2 /He atmospheres, thus at low masses, discoveries of planets lying below the synthetic population are expected. The two "forbidden" regions in the top left and bottom right are a consequence of the core accretion formation process (and the EOS). This leads to a characteristic, elongated "S" shape of the planetary mass-radius relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Comparison with the observed mass-radius relation</head><p>decreases for example between an age of 1 and 5 Gyrs only by about 0.4 R ⊕ (Paper I).</p><p>Looking at the envelope of the actual and synthetic planets, we note that the observed planets all lie in the envelope covered by the synthetic population if we take into account the error bars, for the clear exception of KOI-423b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. 2011</ref>). Except for this planet, there is thus a good agreement between the model and the observation.</p><p>For planets with a mass similar to Jupiter or higher, we see that the observed planets seem to be distributed over the entire vertical width of the envelope of the synthetic planets. For planets with a mass similar to Saturn or less, one notes that the observed planets cluster at the upper boundary of the envelope covered by the synthetic planets. As discussed in Sect. 7.7 below, an explanation for this could be an imprint of the semimajor axis. It is recalled that synthetic planets at all semimajor axes are shown here (i.e. between 0.1 AU and ∼ 20 AU), while the observed exoplanets are close to the lower limit of this range. For planets at even lower masses, in the Neptunian mass region, observed planets of a similar mass can have very different radii, as illustrated by <ref type="bibr">Kepler-18d (Cochran et al. 2011</ref>) which has a mass similar to Neptune, but which is about 1.8 times as large in radius. Clearly, this reflects that the spread in possible heavy element contents is large. Note that we assume that the atmospheric composition is always solar. It is clear that different chemical compositions would lead to different opacities, which in turn lead to different cooling histories and radii (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Burrows et al. 2011</ref> for the brown dwarf regime). This would further increase the vertical width of the envelope. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1.">Individual objects</head><p>The internal composition of the actual extrasolar and Solar System planets shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref> has been analyzed in numerous works with more detailed physics than used here. It is therefore important to understand to what extent the results of these studies can be reproduced with our simpler model. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> we list the inferred fraction of heavy elements Z in the individual planets shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>, assuming again an age of 5 Gyrs. To derive these fractions, only the position in the M − R plane was used. Additional constraints like the semimajor axis or the metallicity of the host star were not considered here. The third column of the table shows the composition of the synthetic planet which lies closest to the observed values in the M − R plane. A ∼ symbol means that either no reasonably close synthetic planet was found in M − R plane, or that for the planet, observationally, only upper limits of the mass are known. The fourth column shows possible Z found in the rectangle in the M − R plane covered by the error bars of the observations. Values for Solar System objects are assumed to be exact.</p><p>The general trend that the heavy element fraction Z = M Z /M decreases with increasing mass is obvious. It is worth looking at some extrasolar planets individually. Starting at the smallest masses ( 10M ⊕ ), we see that the low-mass planets around Kepler-10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Fressin et al. 2011</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-20 (Gautier et al. 2012</ref>) can be reproduced with envelopes masses of ∼1 to ∼20 % of the total mass of the planets, similar as found by <ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. (2011a)</ref>.</p><p>It is expected that at such low masses, and a ≥ 0.1 AU, planets will be found in future with radii smaller than in the synthetic population. Such objects have already been found at very small orbital distances like for example Kepler-10b, with M = 4.6M ⊕ , R = 1.4R ⊕ and a semimajor axis of 0.017 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>). This is much closer than the domain we currently model in our simulations. Objects with an Earth-like composition without H 2 /He are however also expected to exist at larger semimajor axis, as demonstrated by the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. From the comparison of such objects with the domain covered in the synthesis, it will become possible to constrain the transition from terrestrial and water planets to mini-Neptunes (with primordial H 2 /He envelopes). This helps to understand various processes of primordial envelope accretion and loss, which is difficult from the Solar System alone with its large gap in mass between the Earth and the ice giants.</p><p>Kepler-18d ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Cochran et al. 2011</ref>) is a remarkable planet with a mass (16.4 ± 1.4M ⊕ ) approximately between the one of Neptune and Uranus, but a radius that is 80% larger than Neptune. It thus seems to have a clearly lower heavy element fraction than the two Solar System planets. As can be seen in Such a composition of about half gas, and half solids does not exist in the Solar System. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref>, we find that planets of such a composition can only form if the grain opacity in the envelope during the formation phase is much smaller than the interstellar grain opacity. This object is thus important to constraint uncertain parameters of the core accretion model. A complication arises from the fact that at a semimajor axis of about 0.12 AU, this planet might still get affected by the irradiation of the host star in a more complex way than modeled here. Then it could have a relative composition closer to the Solar System ice giants.</p><p>The system of the two Saturn-mass planets <ref type="bibr">Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c (Holman et al. 2010</ref>) has been analyzed in details in The smaller nominal values in our analysis are not surprising, as the effect of additional heating in the envelope of the planet due to stellar irradiation is not taken into account in our simulations. Therefore, lower core masses are sufficient to explain the observed radius. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Havel et al. (2011)</ref>, the effect of irradiation leads to an uncertainty of about 30% for the value of Z. The error bars in their analysis are larger (and more realistic) because more sources of uncertainties like atmospheric opacities are taken into account.</p><p>For Jupiter, we find that the closest synthetic planet contains about 31 M ⊕ of heavy elements, similar as in Paper I. This is in good agreement with the allowed range for the total amount of heavy elements found by Guillot (1999) of 11 to 41 M ⊕ . For Saturn, the derived heavy element mass is 25.6 M ⊕ , also in good agreement with Guillot (1999) who finds masses between 19 and 31 M ⊕ . For the ice giants, we find that they contain about 10 to 12% of gas, similar as e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Hubbard et al. (1991)</ref>.</p><p>CoRoT-10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bonomo et al. 2010</ref>) has a mass of about 880±51 M ⊕ and is interesting because it seems to contain a high fraction of heavy elements despite its high mass, as already noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Bonomo et al. (2010)</ref>. These authors infer that 120 to 240 M ⊕ of heavy elements should be contained in the planet. We find that this planet should contain about 150 M ⊕ of metals, assuming that the star is 5 Gyrs old, compatible with their result. In the M − R plane, the planet lies towards the lower boundary of the domain covered with synthetic planets, but still well within it. Planets with such high solid masses can form by core accretion also without collision in metal-rich disks (high <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and high gas mass) at large semimajor axes of ∼ 10 AU. An example of the formation of such a planet is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. (2009a)</ref>. Compared to the formation of Jupiter, the isolation mass is much larger under such circumstances, allowing for the accretion of many more planetesimals so that the plateau phase II ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) is skipped. It should however be noted that such a formation is probably only feasible if the random velocities of the planetesimals remain low while the planet grows ("monarchical" growth, Weidenschilling 2005).</p><p>The most massive object in the comparison, KOI-423b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. 2011</ref>) with a mass of approximately 5800M ⊕ (≈ 18M ), cannot be explained with our model which assumes standard cooling sequences with solar composition opacities. The same conclusion was reached by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. (2011)</ref>. These authors show that large, ad-hoc increases in the atmospheric opacities are necessary to reconcile the measured mass and radius with cooling models given the high age of the host star, estimated to be between 3.6 and 6.6 Gyrs. With the assumptions of our model (solar opacities, no bloating mechanisms), we can only reproduce the large radius if we assume an age of the planet of less than 100 to 500 Myrs. This object is currently difficult to understand from a theoretical point of view, as stated already by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>In summary we see that our simple model leads to estimated heavy element contents which agree relatively well with the results from more detailed models. However, an important factor for this agreement is unfortunately that despite great efforts, also the latter studies can deduce the internal composition, including the one of the Solar System planets, only with significant error bars. This is due e.g. to the uncertainties in the equations of state, the distribution of heavy elements (mixed vs. layered structure), the efficiency of convection, and the currently limited amount of observational data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.">Bimodal planetary radius distribution</head><p>A prediction of the planetary radius distribution is one of the most important results of a population synthesis calculation, and similar in its importance as a prediction of the planetary mass function <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Ida &amp; Lin 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">, Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref> shows the distribution of the radii of all synthetic planets with a radius larger than 2 R ⊕ at an age of 5 Gyrs. Planets at all semimajor axes are included. The distribution is normalized i.e. the sum of the fractions in all bins is unity. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> lists the corresponding fractions at ages of 1, 5 and 10 Gyrs.</p><p>The distribution has a characteristic, bimodal shape (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Schlaufman et al. 2010</ref>; Wuchterl 2011): A global maximum at the smallest radii, and a second, lower local maximum at a radius of about 1 R . The increase towards small radii is due to the increase of the underlying mass distribution towards small masses, combined with the fact that with decreasing mass, the fraction of heavy elements increases (Sect. 7.3). This means that low-mass planets also have small radii. Note that it is well possible that the increase towards small radii may be even stronger in reality than predicted by the model. This is due to the fact that we only include (relatively large) primordial H 2 /He envelopes and one embryo per disk.</p><p>The second maximum at about a Jovian radius has a fundamental reason, too. It is due to the fact that in the giant planet domain (M 100M ⊕ ), planets all have approximately the same radius, independent of their mass. This is in turn due to the property of matter to become degenerate for such massive objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chabrier et al. 2009</ref>). This property of the EOS makes that a high number of planets from a wide range of different masses all fall into the same radius bin (radii between ∼0.9 and 1.1 R ), causing the maximum in the distribution. The local minimum of the distribution occurs at a radius of 7 to 8 R ⊕ . As can be deduced from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>, this corresponds to masses between ∼ 20 to ∼ 200M ⊕ , with a typical mass of ∼ 70M ⊕ . This coincides roughly to the mass domain of the "planetary desert" where several planet formation models based on the core accretion theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Ida &amp; Lin 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">, Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>) predict a lower abundance of planets. This additional effect makes the second maximum even more prominent. The figure shows the radius distribution at the specific age of 5 Gyrs. In reality, stars of a given observational sample will have a distribution of ages. The evolution of the radii at late times (t 1 Gyr) is, however, slow. The distribution of the radii in an age range between 1 to 10 Gyrs indeed only changes slightly. As expected, there is still a slow general contraction, which makes for instance that at an age of 1 Gyr instead of 5 Gyrs, the local maximum in the giant planet domain is shifted by one bin to the right (i.e. by about 0.1 R ). But the general shape remains very similar, as can also be seen from <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>Note that our results become increasingly uncertain with decreasing radius. This is due to the fact that we do not model several effects which are important for planets with small radii, like for example the concurrent formation of many planets in one disk, or the loss of the gaseous envelope due to evaporation. This, and the fact that we only include primordial H 2 /He envelopes whereas in reality, there are also planets with other types of atmospheres (or without atmosphere) means that the actual radius distribution could be substantially different from the synthetic one for smaller radii. The comparison of the synthetic and the actual distribution then helps to quantify these effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.">Comparison with Kepler results</head><p>It is interesting to compare the radius distribution as found in the synthesis with the one observed by the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> have analyzed the radius distribution of Kepler planet candidates with high S/N transits for a subsample of bright, GK dwarfs. They corrected for the observational bias to derive the underlying radius distribution for planets with R &gt; 2R ⊕ and an orbital period of less than 50 days. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> we compare their observational result with the synthetic radius distribution.</p><p>In the left panel we show as <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> the number of planets per star in a given radius bin and a semimajor axis &lt; 0.27 AU. Synthetic planets which migrate to the inner border of the computational disk at 0.1 AU are evolved at this orbital distance. Note that the majority of planets analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> are found outside of 0.1 AU, as the planetary frequency is increasing with distance, especially for companions which are not giant planets. This means that the comparison of our synthetic planets with 0.1 ≤a/AU≤0.27 with the sample of <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> which includes all planets inside ∼0.27 AU, can still be made, at least in an approximate way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.1.">Agreement for R 2R ⊕</head><p>The number of planets per star can be directly calculated from the synthesis as the outcome for all simulated planets is known <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . We see that the synthetic and the observed result are in good agreement, especially for the new, preliminary analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Howard et al. (2011)</ref> for the updated Kepler data set released in Sep. 2011 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>). We see that both data sets are characterized by an increase of the frequency with decreasing radius. The slope of the increase is similar in both cases, with the synthesis predicting a somewhat higher number of planets with a small radius. But not only the relative increase, also the absolute number of planets is similar in the model and observation. This could indicate that the inward migration of planets (especially at low masses, i.e. in type I) is quite efficient. The total fraction of stars with a planet with P &lt; 50 d and R &gt; 2R ⊕ in the synthesis is 20.1%. The value derived from Kepler is 16.5% to 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Howard et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Howard et al. , 2011</ref>.</p><p>We must however note that the very good agreement also in absolute terms must be regarded with caution. This is in particular because we are using the one-embryo-per-disk approximation, so that we cannot catch the fact that the occurrence rate calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> includes multiple-planet systems and gives the number of planets per star, which can be higher than one, while it is exactly one in our simulations by construction when considering all synthetic planets. Including only one planet per star would reduce the number of Kepler candidates by about 20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012)</ref>, and mainly lead to a reduction of planets with small radii. Planets with small radii are more frequently found in multiple systems, while giant planets are more often single ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Latham et al. 2011</ref>). But the basic result that both the model and the synthesis find a strong increase towards small radii, and that this increase follows a similar slope, remains.</p><p>7.6.2. Divergence for R 2R ⊕ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows that the synthetic radius distribution decreases for radii smaller than ∼ 2 R ⊕ . The reason for this is that low-mass planets with a H 2 /He atmosphere, even when it is only tenuous (0.1 to 1% of the core mass) have radii of at least ∼ 2R ⊕ at the relevant equilibrium temperatures for a &lt; 0.27 AU and ages (i.e. intrinsic luminosities), see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. This is in agreement with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. As we only model this type of atmospheres, and even low-mass cores accrete such amounts of gas during the formation phase, there are not many synthetic planets with a radius smaller than ∼ 2R ⊕ . It is clear that our quantitative results for the distribution of the radii of very lowmass planets are strongly affected by the various simplifications in the model like for example the assumption of chemically homogeneous layers (in particular of a pure H 2 /He envelope) or the fact that we neglect the evaporation of the envelope. On the other hand, the basic mechanism responsible for the decrease of the radius distribution, which is the mass-radius relationship of close-in, low-mass planets with H 2 /He atmosphere, should not be affected by this. We have checked that the decrease remains similar if we start the simulations with embryos with a mass of 0.1 instead of 0.6 M ⊕ .</p><p>This decrease is in contrast to the (however incomplete) observational result <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Howard et al. 2012</ref>) where the fraction remains at least constant for R &lt; 2R ⊕ (see also Youdin 2011). The good agreement of the synthetic and the actual radius distribution for R &gt; 2R ⊕ , and the divergence at smaller radii is interesting. It could indicate that for planets larger than ∼ 2R ⊕ , H 2 /He atmospheres are dominant (mini-Neptune type of planets), while for smaller radii, other types of planets (silicate-metal terrestrial planets or ocean planets without primordial H 2 /He) dominate. While our quantitative results are as mentioned to be taken with great caution, this result seems to be in agreement with detailed analyses of the combined constraints coming from the Kepler data for the radius, and from radial velocity for the mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gaidos et al. 2012</ref>). These studies show that with decreasing radius, a transition from low planetary densities to higher densities occurs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin (2012)</ref> in particular find that when they use a mixture of planets with H 2 /He atmospheres and rocky planets, the later type of planets becomes dominant for radii R 2.5R ⊕ for their simulation that best reproduces the combined constraints from HARPS and Kepler. This is similar as the result found here from theoretical calculations. The results on the radius distribution of planets with primordial atmospheres presented here, and below in Sect. 7.8, should allow for an even better understanding of the dividing line between these types of planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.3.">Local maximum at ∼ 1R</head><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> shows the synthetic planets in the same bins as the observed data. No peak in the giant planet regime can be seen due to the broadness of the bins. The right panel shows the same synthetic planets, but now using finer bins (and R &gt; 2R ⊕ ). The bimodal shape of the radius distribution becomes visible again. The local maximum at about one Jovian radius is, however, about 2 to 3 times smaller than for the distribution that includes synthetic planets at all semimajor axes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 11)</ref>. This is due to the fact that giant planets are less frequent inside 0.27 AU than further out.</p><p>We thus see that at the resolution of the radius distribution in the current observational data, and the restriction that P &lt; 50 d, it is difficult to see the bimodality. If we use finer bins (which will be possible with a higher number of transiting planets), or if we keep the same broader bins, but include planets at all semimajor axes, the peak at about 1 Jovian radius should become visible. This is an important prediction which is in agreement with other models of planet formation and evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Schlaufman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Wuchterl 2011</ref>). It will be tested in the next years with the Kepler mission as an increasing number of planets at large semimajor axes will be found. Concerning the local maximum at about 1 R , we must distinguish two aspects of it: First the local minimum at a radius of about 8 R ⊕ , and second the sharp absence of planets larger than ∼ 1.2R . The second aspect is more fundamental, as it is a direct consequence of the equation of state. When making the comparison, we must keep in mind a number of possible complications which could cause differences between the synthetic and the actual radius distribution.</p><p>1) First of all it is clear that the results shown here can only be compared with planets which are not affected by the various proposed inflation mechanism (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>). An inflation to larger radii naturally blurs the maximum at one specific radius as found in standard cooling calculations as conducted here. In this context it is interesting to note that Demory &amp; Seager (2011) find that at irradiation fluxes of less than about 2 × 10 8 erg cm −2 s −1 , giant planets seem not be significantly affected any more by inflation. For a solar-like star, the critical irradiation level corresponds to a semimajor axis of about 0.07 AU. Instead all giant planets in their sample are characterized by a constant radius of ∼ 0.87 ± 0.12R . This is compatible with our results for the location of the local maximum in the radius distribution.</p><p>2) It is possible to construct a mass distribution which has no maximum at about one Jovian radius. First, such a mass distribution must contain a higher number of planets with intermediate radii compared to the synthetic mass distribution, so that the local minimum at about 8 R ⊕ disappears. This would mean that the "planetary desert" <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Ida &amp; Lin 2004</ref>); dedicated discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>) is more populated than found in the model. In this case, the radius distribution between ∼ 6 and 12 R ⊕ would simply be flat, or decreasing with R. Second, the mass distribution could contain a lower number of giant planets. This would naturally lower the number of planets in the second maximum. When comparing the fraction of planets with radii close to 1 R in the model and in the data of the Kepler satellite (left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>) one notes that the number of synthetic giant planets is in good agreement with the observed fraction. This would mean that this second possibility is in fact not feasible.</p><p>3) Demory &amp; Seager (2011) find that the majority of Kepler candidates of their sample which receive only a modest irradiation flux, but still have large radii 1.1R have to be classified as "ambiguous" candidates i.e. as cases where the secondary eclipse signature is consistent with both a planetary or stellar companion, and not as relatively clear planetary companions as it is the case for most candidates with smaller radii. This could indicate that a part of the Kepler candidates which are difficult to understand from a theoretical point of view (radius clearly larger than 15 to 20 R ⊕ , orbital period longer than 10 to 20 days, high age) are false positives. False positives would also blur the upper radius limit of planets. A finding of Traub (2012) could also point in this direction: He finds that in the Kepler data, for large planets with radii of about 8 to 40 R ⊕ , there are significantly more candidates around faint stars than around brighter host stars. This is not expected from astrophysical reasons, therefore Traub (2012) puts forward the explanation that it is more difficult to distinguish background eclipsing binaries from planetary transits when the stars are faint. This would mean that this radius class is more affected by false positives. As more data is accumulated by Kepler, it should become possible to better assess such a reason. It is further interesting that when Kepler candidates in multiple systems only are considered ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Latham et al. 2011</ref>), then the observed radius distribution is bimodal. A minimum at about 1 R , and a local maximum at about 1.2 R is seen, which is at least qualitatively similar as found in the simulations here. The number of planets in the relevant bins is however very small, so that it is currently unclear whether this is a statistically significant result.</p><p>4) The synthetic radius distribution shows planets which all have exactly the same age. While also in the Kepler data, the majority of the host stars are on or close to the main sequence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Batalha et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Latham et al. 2011</ref>) the spread in ages will still blur to some extent the maximum at about 1 R , especially its upper edge, which is in contrast very sharp in the synthetic population at one single age. A similar effect is expected from our simplification that all planets have identical atmospheric opacities.</p><p>5) Finally, objects like KOI-423b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bouchy et al. 2011</ref>) which is quite far from the theoretical expectations, could indicate that our theoretical understanding of the planetary radius evolution does not take into account all relevant mechanism which affect at least some planets. Possible mechanism could for example be tidal heating for very eccentric planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Dong et al. 2012</ref>) or giant impacts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Anic et al. 2007</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 10</ref> shows the M − R relationship for synthetic planets at all semimajor axes, including thus in particular also planets at large orbital distances. Observationally, most of the known transiting planets have in contrast small semimajor axes. To see the impact of the semimajor axis on the radii, we plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig.  13</ref>, left panel again the M − R relationship, but now including only synthetic planets with a semimajor axis between 0.1 and 1 AU. The extrasolar planets in the observational comparison sample all have semimajor axes less than 1.1 AU (the planets of the Solar System are found at larger distances, of course).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7.1.">Semimajor axis -radius anticorrelation</head><p>Comparing the synthetic planets at smaller distances with the entire population shows that there is a clear difference. At all masses, the lower part of the envelope of M − R points corresponding to those planets with the smallest radii for a given mass are not found if only the planets inside 1 AU are considered. This reduces the vertical width of the area populated by M − R combinations, making that Kepler-10c and Corot-10b now lie at the lower boundary of the region populated by synthetic planets. When all semimajor axes are included, they are more embedded in the cloud of points.</p><p>The reason for this finding is that the maximum mass fraction of heavy elements Z for a given total mass is lower for planets inside 1 AU than for those further out. For example, planets with a total mass of 100 M ⊕ can contain up to ∼ 90 % solids (in rare cases, though) when considering all semimajor axes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 10)</ref>. When limiting to a ≤ 1 AU, the heavy element fraction is at most ∼ 60%, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 13</ref>. This is a consequence of the following. The reservoir of solids available for a planet to accrete in a disk with a dust-togas ratio f D/G scales with distance r as f D/G Σ(r, t = 0)r 2 , where Σ(r, t = 0) is the initial surface density of gas. This quantity is given by equation A.1, and thus scales in the inner, relevant parts of the disk as r −0.9 . This means that the amount of mass contained in an annulus increases with semimajor axis. This trend gets amplified by the increase of the solid surface density at the iceline. It is clear that this radial dependence gets blurred by orbital migration, but as the simulations show, the general pattern remains conserved.</p><p>It is interesting to see that the actual known extrasolar planets of the comparison sample (which have semimajor axes between 0.1 and 1.1 AU) mostly cluster close to the upper edge of the synthetic population at least for intermediate masses between ∼ 50 to 300 M ⊕ , and thus seem more similar to the synthetic population inside 1 AU than to synthetic planets further out. No planet with a mass of e.g. 100 M ⊕ and a radius of only 6 R ⊕ has been detected to date, despite such metal-rich objects existing in the synthetic population at large distances <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 10)</ref>. The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 13</ref> compares the distribution of radii for a similar mass domain for planets in-or outside 1 AU. The difference is very obvious. The better match of the observed planets with the synthetic population inside 1 AU could indicate that also in nature, close-in giant planets contain a smaller fraction of heavy elements than their counterparts further out which formed in a larger reservoir of solids. Kepler-18d has a mass similar as the ice giants in the Solar System, but is much poorer in solids (Sect. 7.4.1). This could point into the same direction.</p><p>This allows to make the following two statements: First, for the ongoing high precision transit searches, it is predicted that they will find intermediate and giant planets with a higher fraction of heavy elements (i.e. smaller radius) as they detect planets at larger semimajor axes. Second, this anti-correlation of semimajor axis and radius via Z might offer a possibility to distinguish between disk migration and other mechanisms like scattering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Malmberg et al. 2011</ref>) or Kozai migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref> as formation mechanisms of close-in hot Jupiters. This is because it is at least not obvious that the latter two mechanism would also lead to a semimajor axis -Z correlation as found here for disk migration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7.2.">Possible complications</head><p>Note that a number of complications arise: First, it seems reasonable to assume that a higher bulk content in metals goes along with a higher atmospheric opacity. Higher opacities are well know to delay the contraction of giant planets (e.g. Burrows et al. 2011; Paper I). In this work, in contrast, we use opacities for solar composition gas in all cases. The impact of higher opacities for more metal rich planets would counteract the semimajor axis-radius anti-correlation. Second, the evolution of the radius of a giant planet is influenced also directly by its semimajor axis, via the intensity of the stellar irradiation. When the irradiation flux is not deposited deep in the interior of the planet, this has not a very drastic influence on the radius for a &gt; 0.1 AU. For instance, a Jovian mass planet at 0.1 AU has at 4.5 Gyrs a radius that is about 6% larger than a counterpart at 10 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fortney et al. 2007)</ref>. At least for planets inside 0.1 AU, there are however special inflation mechanisms which affect the radius much stronger, as illustrated by the large number of transiting planets with anomalously large "bloated" radii. It is currently not clear out to which distance these inflation mechanisms are effective deepening on e.g. the planetary mass or composition. The inflation also leads to an anti-correlation of semimajor axis and radius, i.e. goes in the same direction as the correlation describe here due to the composition, and thus complicates the picture.</p><p>In summary we see that the combined constraints of planet mass, radius, semimajor axis and metallicity provide powerful observational constraints for planet formation and evolution theory, in particular when they are coupled to population synthesis calculations which allow to see the correlations between these quantities. A step which has however to be taken in future for more accurate analyses is a more self-consistent coupling of bulk interior composition and atmospheric properties in terms of composition and opacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.">Mean radius as function of mass</head><p>Several studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gaidos et al. 2012</ref>) have analyzed combined RV and Kepler datasets as this allows to get insight into the mean density of the planets. An important quantity in this context is the power law exponent β which relates planetary mass and radius</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">R R ⊕ = k M M ⊕ β . (23)</formula><p>It is clear that in reality, there cannot be a single value of β (and k) for all planetary masses and compositions. Still it remains a useful quantity when comparing theory and observations. Observationally, a fit to the terrestrial planets of the Solar System yields β = 0.33 as for constant density spheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Laughlin &amp; Wolfgang 2012)</ref>, while a fit including the Earth and Saturn ( <ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2011b</ref>) gives β = 0.48, with k = 1 in both cases. From theoretical calculations, one expects for scaled versions of the Earth in the 1-10 M ⊕ regime β ≈ 0.27 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Valencia et al. 2006</ref>) while for massive gaseous planets of about 10 M , β ≈ −1/8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chabrier et al. 2009</ref>), as expected from polytropic models. The negative values show that in this domain, the radius decreases with mass. At the maximum of the mass-radius relationship at about 4 M <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 10)</ref>, β must be equal to zero. This means that with increasing mass, a decrease of β occurs. This is a consequence of the combined effects of a change in the interior composition of the planets with mass (the gas fraction increases), and increasing degeneracy of the matter. The specific dependence of β on mass is a proxy for the bulk interior composition of the planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.1.">Analytical expression for the mean radius</head><p>To calculate β, we first have to find an analytical expression for the mean radius as function of mass ¯ R(M) for which the best fitting parameters for the synthetic population are determined. We employ the function proposed by Traub (2011) which has four parameters b, M 0 , w, p and is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">¯ R(M) = b 1 + log(M/M 0 ) w p ,<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where log denotes the logarithm to the base 10. The units in the fit are Earth masses and radii. Compared to the original function of Traub (2011), we have omitted an additional additive constant which is found to be unnecessary. In the equation, the parameter p controls how abruptly the radius increases when going from terrestrial planets to the maximum in the giant planet regime. It also controls how flat the maximum in the giant planet regime is. The parameter w controls the width of the peak in the radius function. The parameter M 0 is the mass (in units of Earth masses) corresponding to the maximum radius (i.e. 4 to 5 Jovian masses), while b provides a vertical scaling. The value of b corresponds to the radius (in units of Earth radii) at M = M 0 .</p><p>We have fitted our nominal population at 5 Gyrs with this function using a nonlinear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to find the parameters. We only include planets with a mass larger than 2M ⊕ . The result is shown in Tab. 5 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 14</ref>. The best fitting parameters are given for all planets which have not reached the inner border of the computational disk (i.e. 0.1 &lt; a/AU), and for a selected semimajor axis range 0.1 &lt; a/AU ≤ 1 to study again the effect of the semimajor axis. Planets that reach the inner border of the computational disk are excluded from the analysis since their fate is more uncertain.</p><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 14</ref> shows that the fit (thick lines) yields a good representation of the mean synthetic mass-radius relationship. In the plot, the thin colored lines show the mean radius found directly with a running mean with a window 0.15 dex wide in log(M/M ⊕ ). The fitting function and the running mean lie in general close to each other, expect for a few special, fine features that the fitting function cannot reproduce.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.2.">Mass-radius power law exponent</head><p>The power law exponent β is given as d ln ¯ R/d ln M. The power law exponent for Traub's (2011) fit is given as (ln is the natural logarithm)</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">β(M) = p | log(M/M 0 )| w p ln(M 0 /M) 1 + | log(M/M 0 )| w p (25)</formula><p>Three different regimes can be distinguished for β. The mean planetary density decreases with increasing mass for β &gt; 1/3, is independent of mass for β = 1/3, while values of β smaller than 1/3 indicate that the density is increasing with mass. The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 14</ref> shows the value of β as a function of mass, again for the two different semimajor axis ranges. Note that the exact numerical values of β partially depend on the specific fitting function. Using for instance polynomial functions instead of eq. 24, leads to variations of β by of order 0.05 to 0.1, but preserves the general pattern. At small masses, the values of β are relatively large. For M 30M ⊕ and when all planets with a &gt; 0.1 AU are included (blue line), then β lies between 0.3 and 0.33, close to the constant density case. This is the result of two counteracting effects: The increase of the gas mass fraction in the planets with increasing mass tends to lower β, while the growing effect of gravitational self-compression of the more compressible gas tends to increase β. When only planets inside 1 AU are included (red line), then β is higher (0.35 to 0.4) showing that for these planets, the density is decreasing with increasing mass, due to the smaller heavy element content (Sect. 7.7). At a mass of roughly 100 M ⊕ , β starts to decrease, as the effect of self-gravitational compression takes over, reaching β = 0 at a few Jovian masses, as expected.</p><p>Towards the lowest masses (2 M ⊕ ), β decreases slightly with decreasing mass. This is a consequence of the following: at sufficient irradiation from the host star, the radius of low-mass planets with a significant H 2 /He atmosphere increases with decreasing total mass when the heavy element fraction Z is hold constant (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). This would correspond to negative values of β. The effect that for the synthetic planets, Z is itself increasing with decreasing mass however overcompensates this. Due to this imprint of formation (lower mass cores can only bind smaller envelopes during the formation phase), very low values of β do not occur at low planetary masses, especially as we have excluded planets with a ≤ 0.1 AU. The fact that the power law exponent for low-mass planets with H 2 /He atmospheres is found to be similar as for solid planets without atmospheres could make the observational distinction more difficult. In terms of absolute sizes, the two planetary types are however clearly distinct.</p><p>We stress that it is not expected that the fit provides a good representation of the planetary mass-radius relationship at low masses in the terrestrial and super-Earth regime. The terrestrial planets of the Solar System, as well as some low-mass extrasolar planets like Corot-7b or Kepler-10b do not posses primordial H 2 /He envelopes. But the comparison of the predicted and the actual mass-radius relationship allows to gain insight about the actual nature of such objects, in particular when studying the fraction of silicate-iron or water planets versus mini-Neptunes <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Gaidos et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.9.">Radius distribution for given mass intervals</head><p>In the previous section, the mean radius as function of mass was studied. The mean radius can however not catch that for every mass, planets with different internal compositions and thus different radii form in the synthesis. The importance of such a multi-valued mass-radius relationship for the interpretation of Kepler and radial velocity data has been stressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin (2012)</ref>. These authors consider also terrestrial planets without any atmosphere, while we only consider planets with primordial H 2 /He atmospheres. But already for this single type of planets, there is a large diversity in mass-radius relations. We therefore plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 15</ref> the distribution of the radii for nine mass intervals, ranging from super-Earth planets to objects in the brown dwarf regime. In each panel, the radii of planets with semimajor axes of 0.1 &lt; a/AU ≤ 3 are included. Planets reaching the feeding limit are not included here, as their evolution is most affected by mechanism we do not model (e.g. evaporation). The outer border is chosen so that the distributions do not become too dominated by planets at even larger distances, facilitating comparison with observational data.</p><p>In each panel, the distribution for the nominal population is shown. Additionally, we here also plot the radius distribution of another, non-nominal population. This population was calculated in an identical way as the nominal one, except that instead of the new type I migration model (Sect. 7.1.1), we use the migration rates derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref> for a locally isothermal disk, reduced by a global efficiency factor f I = 0.1. The comparison of the results for the two populations allows to quantify the impact of an aspect of the planet formation model that is still not very well understood.</p><p>In the first two panels showing the lowest mass intervals, we also plot the core radius distribution. One sees that the total radii are typically much larger than the core radii, despite the fact that these planets are dominated by solids, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>. The effect that an H 2 /He envelope of e.g. 1% in mass around a super-Earth planet strongly increases the radius is well known (e.g. Rogers et al. 2011; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). We comment that the low grain opacity which is assumed during the formation phase ( f opa = 0.003, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Mordasini et al. 2012c</ref>) is responsible that already cores of e.g. 5 M ⊕ can accrete envelopes with masses up to ∼ 15% of the total mass during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> lists the numerical values of the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the radius distribution of the different mass bins. A positive (negative) skewness indicates that an asymmetric tail is extending to larger (smaller) radii, while a distribution which is approximately Gaussian has a vanishing skewness.</p><p>The histogram and the table show that the mean is increasing with mass except for the highest mass range, as expected. Note that the mean values listed here only agree in an approximative way with the mean radius ¯ R found with eq. 24. This is due to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 15</ref>. Distribution of radii of planets with primordial H 2 /He envelopes for nine mass domains as indicated in the plot. Synthetic planets with 0.1 &lt; a ≤ 3 AU are included. The red solid line is the nominal population, while the blue dashed-dotted line is a population where isothermal type I migration rates reduced by a factor 10 were used. In the panels showing the lowest mass domains, the fine gray lines show the distribution of the core radii. The age of the population is 5 Gyrs.</p><p>two reasons: first, the two values were derived with a different ansatz (fit over the entire population versus mean in a given mass domain), and second, the semimajor axis domains of the planets included in the analyses are different, too. The table shows that the standard deviations can be significant, as also the total spread of the radii.</p><p>Regarding the skewness, one sees that a clear pattern only develops for the largest masses. In the mass bin going from 300 to 1000 M ⊕ , the clearly negative skewness is due to the general shape of the planetary mass-radius relationship (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>), and the fact that some planets in this mass regime contain so many solids that this has a non-negligible effect on the total radius. For the largest mass bin (M &gt; 3000M ⊕ ), the negative skewness is in contrast caused by the decrease of R with M at such masses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.9.1.">Impact of the migration model</head><p>While the distributions of the two populations are to first order similar, we note that in almost all panels, the distribution of the non-nominal population (isothermal type I migration) is shifted towards larger radii. This means that the planets in the non-nominal population have in general a smaller heavy element fraction Z. This can be understood from the different migration models: the new type I migration model allows for both in-and outward migration. In some cases, this means that the net inward migration is smaller, saving in this way planets from getting close to the star. This does however not mean that the total annulus in the disk visited by the planet is small, as the absolute migration rates are high also in the non-isothermal regimes, at least as long as a planet gets not captured into a convergence zone (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Lyra et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Mordasini et al. 2011a</ref>). Since we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> in assuming low planetesimal random velocities, the total amount of heavy elements that a planet can accrete is proportional to the annulus of the disk swept by it. This annulus is larger for the non-isothermal migration at full strength than for the isothermal migration reduced arbitrarily by a factor 10. This leads to the difference in the heavy element fraction. Only for the planets more massive than 3000 M ⊕ , the difference in the heavy element content between the two populations has nearly no visible consequences any more for the total radius. These planets are too strongly dominated by gas. When comparing the distributions found here with observations, one should keep in mind that the lower the mass range, the larger the uncertainties. Planets with a mass less than ∼ 10M ⊕ will be affected in the strongest way by the limitation that we do not model any growth process once the protoplanetary disk is gone, only consider primordial atmospheres, and neglect evaporation, compositional changes due to outgassing and non-solar opacities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.10.">Core and total radius</head><p>In Sect. 2.1 we studied the radius of the solid cores of the planets as a function of mass, composition and external pressure. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  16</ref> shows besides the normal mass-radius diagram also the masscore radius relationship. Lines indicate the theoretical M − R for planets without a gaseous envelope.</p><p>Concerning the core radius of low-mass planets, we see that at low total masses (M 10M ⊕ ), the core radii cluster close to two groups, which are found at (or slightly below) the dashed and solid lines which indicate a purely "icy" and "rocky" composition, respectively. This is expected, as the composition of the two classes of solids is the same in all simulations and corresponds to a solar-like composition (see Sect. 2.1.1). In reality, due to the fact that stars do not have simply a scaled solar composition (e.g. Delgado <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mena et al. 2010</ref>), there will be a spread both in the composition of refractory and volatile material in the planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bond et al. 2010</ref>). Giant impacts can additionally modify the iron and water fraction (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Marcus et al. 2009)</ref>. At these masses (M 10M ⊕ ), there are however also some cores which <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 16</ref>. Total and core radius as a function of mass for all planets with M &gt; 2M ⊕ at 5 Gyrs. The total radius is shown by blue, diagonal crosses, while the core radius is shown by red, open squares. The dashed line is the M − R relation for solid planets with an "icy" composition (approximative solar composition beyond the iceline with 75% ice, 17% silicates and 8% iron). The solid line is for solid planets with an Earth-like "rocky" composition (2:1 silicate-to-iron ratio). These two lines show the radius if no external pressure is acting. lie between the solid and the dashed line. This are planets which have migrated from outside the iceline into the inner part of the disk, so that they have a mixed composition. The frequency of such close-in "ocean" planets is an important and possibly observable diagnostics of the efficiency of migration. Some core radii lie slightly below the two lines. This comes from the fact that for such cases, the pressure exerted by the gaseous envelope is already sufficient to compress the core by a small degree.</p><p>When comparing total and core radii if low-mass planets, we see that there are some cases which have a total radius which lies between the solid and the dashed line. This are planets which are made of a "rocky" core and tenuous amounts of gas, resulting in a radius smaller than the one of an atmosphere-free icy planet. This is a manifestation of the well known degeneracy of the mass-radius relation for low-mass planets. The combination of mass and radius measurements with spectroscopy (e.g. with the EChO mission, <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Tinetti et al. 2011</ref>) is therefore very import for a better understanding of this part of the planetary mass-radius relationship.</p><p>At masses between 10 to 100 M ⊕ , the effect of the compression of the core due to a massive envelope becomes clearly visible, so that the points indicating the actual core radii diverge from the lines indicating radii of planets without significant envelopes. At very high masses (M 10M ) cores get very strongly compressed, to sizes that are smaller than the core radii of the low-mass planets (R core 1R ⊕ ). Clearly, it is questionable whether a solid core can survive for 5 Gyrs at the extreme conditions found in the center of such planets without being eroded as we currently assume for simplicity. Recent results on the solubility of ice in conditions as found in Jupiter's center <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Wilson &amp; Militzer 2012</ref>) indicate that at least for this planet, core erosion is possible. It is therefore of interest to take such effects into account. On the other hand, it is also clear that the higher the total mass, the smaller the relative fraction it contains in solids as indicated by the color coding in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>. This plot shows that planets with masses higher than ∼ 10M have a core mass fraction Z of 5% to less than 1%, decreasing with total mass. This means that the total radius is only slightly influenced by the core mass. This is reflected in the vertical width of the M − R relationship in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>, that becomes very narrow at such large masses. This finding could partially be changed if we would include different opacities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Burrows et al. 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary</head><p>In the first part of this paper, we have described several improvements and extensions of our combined formation and evolution model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Planet module</head><p>First, we have included the calculation of the radius of the solid core as a function of its mass, composition and (for giant planet cores) external pressure by solving the internal structure equations for a differentiated planet. We have compared our results with previously published studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Seager et al. 2007</ref>) and found very good agreement (Sect. 2.1.1). We can therefore make relatively accurate predictions for the radii of core-dominated planets, necessary for comparison with high-precision transit missions like Kepler. We have further found that the variable core density only has a small impact on the formation phase of a giant planet, but that it needs to be considered for correct total radii of (giant) planets at late times. These radii are essential to estimate the heavy element content of a giant planet (Sect. 5).</p><p>Second, we have developed a simple model for the core luminosity due to the decay of long-lived radionuclides. We assume a chondritic composition of the mantel and take into account the temporal decay of the nuclides (Sect. 2.3). We have demonstrated for of a low-mass, close-in super-Earth planet with a ∼ 1% primordial H 2 /He atmosphere, that the radioactive decay becomes the dominant intrinsic heat source at late times. This leaves traces in the temporal evolution of the radius of the planet. We have compared our results with <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, and found good agreement (Sect. 6). This means that we can address in population synthesis calculations the radii of low-mass planets with tenuous primordial envelopes. This is an important subject as low-density, low-mass planets are currently detected in large numbers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Borucki et al. 2011)</ref>, and because this question is linked to the habitability of low-mass planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Disk module</head><p>We have presented improvements of the protoplanetary gas disk module which is a 1+1D α model including the effects of stellar irradiation and photoevaporation. We now use more realistic initial conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Andrews et al. 2009</ref>), a free outer radius of the disk allowing spreading and shrinking and an updated photoevaporation model taking into account external and internal photoevaporation (Sect. 3.1). With this model we studied the stability against self-gravity and found that disks with masses up to 0.091 or 0.16 M (without and with stellar irradiation, respectively) are stable for the characteristic radius and initial surface density slope we assume. We have also found that the radius of the lowest Toomre parameter in these disks occurs around 25 AU, close to the location we determined analytically (Appendix A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Planetary mass-radius relationship</head><p>In the second part of the paper, we have used the updated model to conduct planetary population synthesis calculations. In contrast to earlier syntheses, we can now not only calculate the planetary semimajor axis-mass diagram, but also the mass-radius diagram. Also the mass-luminosity and semimajor axis-luminosity diagrams are now a self-consistent result of the model that will be presented in future work. The planetary mass-radius diagram is of similar importance as the semimajor axis-mass diagram as it allows to make a first characterization of a planet via its bulk composition.</p><p>We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship for planets with primordial H 2 /He envelopes (the only type of atmosphere we currently model) comes into existence during the formation phase (when planets grow) and how it then evolves over Gigayear timescales during the evolutionary phase at constant mass. During the presence of the nebula (Sect. 7.2), two regimes exist for the radii: low-mass, subcritical cores have very large radii comparable to the Hill sphere (or Bondi) radius as their envelopes are attached to the background nebula, whereas supercritical cores have massive, collapsed envelopes with radii of a few R . Most planets however do not trigger runaway gas accretion but instead undergo a phase of rapid contraction when the nebula disappears.</p><p>During the evolutionary phase (Sect. 7.3), for t 0.5 Gyrs, the basic shape of the mass-radius relationship is similar to an elongated "S" which can be understood from the fundamental principles of the core accretion model, and the EOS. Due to their long Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, low-mass planets cannot bind massive gas envelopes, whereas super-critical cores necessarily must trigger runway gas accretion (at least if they form during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk). This naturally leads to two "forbidden" regions in the M − R plane: one at low masses with large radii, and one at high masses with small radii (Sect. 7.3.3).</p><p>The radius of a planet for a given composition and age can be calculated also in purely evolutionary calculations. The spread in possible associated radii for a given mass interval (i.e. the vertical width of the mass-radius relationship), and the distribution of the radii in a specific mass range can however only be obtained from combined formation and evolution calculations. We find that, depending on the mass domain, there is a large diversity in the associated radii. At a mass of ∼ 40M ⊕ for example, radii vary by a factor ∼ 3. This is mainly due to different bulk compositions, reflecting different formation histories. We present the synthetic radius distribution for various mass intervals in Sect. 7.9.</p><p>When comparing the synthetic M − R relationship with the observed one (Sect. 7.4), one finds good agreement with the planets of the Solar System and for actual exoplanets with a &gt; 0.1 AU, which corresponds to the minimal orbital distance of the synthetic planets. All exoplanets with a ≥ 0.1 AU and the planets of the Solar System fall in the M −R envelope populated with synthetic planets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 10)</ref> except for one case (KOI-423b). We derive approximate heavy elements contents for the individual observed planets (Sect. 7.4.1). The general trend is that the fraction of iron, silicates and ices decreases with increasing mass, but there is significant spread for individual objects.</p><p>We then show the synthetic planetary radius distribution at 5 Gyrs which is a fundamental result of population synthesis calculations (Sect. 7.5). The radius distribution is bimodal and characterized by a strong increase towards small radii, and a second, lower local maximum at a radius of about 1R . The increase towards small radii is a consequence of the increase of the planetary mass function towards low M, and the fact that low-mass planets cannot accrete much nebular gas. This means that lowmass planets also have small radii. The second local maximum at about 1R is due to a fundamental property of matter (degeneracy) causing the radius to be nearly independent of mass in the giant planet domain. Due to this, planets from a wide mass range all fall in the same radius bin, leading to the local maximum at about 1 R .</p><p>A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with the observations of the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Howard et al. 2012</ref>) shows a good agreement for R 2R ⊕ , but a divergence for smaller radii <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 12)</ref>. While our quantitative results for low radii are to be taken with great caution, this could indicate that for R 2R ⊕ , the radius distribution can be well relatively described with planets with primordial H 2 /He atmospheres as in the model, while at smaller radii, planets of a different nature dominate. This result seems to be in good agreement with analyses combining data from <ref type="bibr">Kepler and RV surveys (Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Gaidos et al. 2012</ref>). We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at about 1 R . We also predict that the typical radii of planets with 10 M/M ⊕ 1000 will decrease with distance. This stems from a positive correlation of the semimajor axis and the typical fraction of heavy elements in a planet. The reason for this is that the amount of solids in an annulus increases for our disk surface density profile (Sect. 7.7).</p><p>To facilitate comparison with observations, we use the analytical expression of Traub (2011) to derive the mean radius as function of mass in the synthetic population (Sect. 7.8), and study the mass-radius power law index β (M ∝ R β ). The value of β is between 0.3 to 0.4 for planets with M 100M ⊕ . At higher masses, β decreases to reach zero at about 4 M , and negative values at even higher masses. As we only consider primordial H 2 /He atmospheres, it is expected that at low masses, the observed mass-radius relation will diverge from the synthetic result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusion</head><p>With the extensions and improvements presented in Paper I and this study, we are now able to characterize extrasolar planets in their most important physical quantities like semimajor axis, mass, composition, radius and luminosity from one single model. These quantities are calculated in a self-consistent way for the coupled formation and evolution of a planet during its entire life, from a tiny seed embryo in the protoplanetary disk to a gigayear old planet. Our goal is to have in the end synthetic populations that can be compared directly with all important observational techniques used to find and characterize exoplanets. We believe that a better theoretical understanding of the very complex patterns in the various data sets (like transiting planets of very different compositions, systems of compact close-in low-mass planets, cold Neptunes beyond the iceline or massive, directly imaged giant planets at large distances) can best be developed by comparing theoretical results to a combination of all these data sets. In the current case, the combined results of transit and radial velocity measurements allow to conclude that first, for a &gt; 0.1 AU, the actual and the synthetic mass-radius relationship are in good agreement, and second that for radii larger than roughly 2 R ⊕ , the synthetic radius distribution is similar as the one detected by Kepler. Finally, we find that the planetary radius distribution is bimodal, with the global maximum at low radii, and a second smaller maximum at about 1 R . We predict that Kepler should detect this maximum in the next few years.</p></div>

(2009a)</ref> have therefore cut off the uppermost part of the observed disk mass distribution with the argument that they cannot be stable. The cut off was usually done at the (often assumed) disk mass stability limit of about a tenth of the stellar mass, without a direct calculation of this stability limit. Observationally, high disk masses can be mimicked by residual dust in the remains of the envelope from which the star formed, contributing to the observed flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Andrews &amp; Williams 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In this appendix, we use our upgraded disk model to determine the maximum stable disk mass for both irradiated and non-irradiated disk, and make some more general remarks about the stability of irradiated α disks against the development of spiral waves, and of clumping.</p><p>For simplicity, we use for the initial disk profile (Eq. 7) a power law exponent γ = 0.9 and a characteristic radius R c = 30 AU. Both values correspond to the maxima of the distributions observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Andrews et al. (2010)</ref>. With these values, the initial gas surface density is It is clear that this procedure faces a difficulty: it implicitly assumes that we can use the observed dust grains to trace the mass and evolution of the gas. Especially grain growth could make this assumption partially invalid (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Andrews &amp; Williams 2007)</ref>. Integration Eq. 7 from r = 0 to infinity using the parameters mentioned before, one finds a total initial disk mass (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Miguel et al. 2011</ref> Thus, the <ref type="bibr">MMSN of Weidenschilling (1977</ref>), corresponds to Σ 0 ≈ 200 g/cm 2 , while for <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Hayashi's (1981)</ref> MMSN of 0.013 M , Σ 0 ≈ 108 g/cm 2 . It is likely that the true initial mass of the solar nebula was a few times larger than these minimal masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Weidenschilling 2005)</ref>. Note that we do not allow in the model accretion rates larger than 3 × 10 −7 M /yr in order to avoid convection in the vertical direction, but reduce if necessary locally the initial Σ in order not to exceed this limit. Therefore, the initial gas mass for disks with Σ 0 larger than ∼1000 g/cm 2 are somewhat smaller than predicted by Eq. A.2. For Σ 0 = 2000 g/cm 2 the initial mass is for example about 20% smaller than given by Eq. A.2. Note further that in contrast to earlier models, we can now include the total disk mass inside the computational domain, and not only the fraction contained in the innermost 30 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>).</p><p>A.1. Q Toomre and τ cool Ω as function of distance <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.1 shows Q Toomre (solid red lines) and τ cool Ω (blue dotted lines) as a function of distance from the star for two disks (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bell et al. 1997</ref>) at t ≈ 0 (the moment we start the disk evolution). The left panel shows a 1-2 x MMSN disk (M d (t=0)=0.024 M , Σ 0 = 200 g/cm 2 ), while the right one shows a more massive disk with M d (t=0)=0.11 M (Σ 0 = 1000 g/cm 2 ). Both examples are calculated including the effect of stellar irradiation on the disk temperature structure, M * = 1M , α = 7 × 10 −3 and the initial surface density profile discussed above.</p><p>We see that for both disk, Q Toomre reaches a minimum at about 25 AU. For the MMSN disk, the minimum value is about 12, while for the more massive C. Mordasini et al.: Characterization of exoplanets from their formation II <ref type="figure">Fig. A.1</ref>. Toomre parameter Q Toomre (red solid line) and τ cool Ω (blue dotted line) as a function of semimajor axis a, at a moment shortly after the beginning of disk evolution. The horizontal lines correspond to the critical values of Q Toomre,crit =1.7 and τ cool Ω = 3, respectively. The left panel is for a disk with an initial mass M d (t = 0) = 0.024M , while the right one corresponds to a higher mass, M d (t = 0) = 0.11M . disk, it is 2.5. The critical value of Q Toomre,crit ≈1.7 is not reached. Regarding the cooling, the particular structure of the curve is due to opacity transitions. We see that in the inner parts of the disk, and outside 15-25 AU, there are parts of the disk which could in principle cool quickly enough so that τ cool Ω &lt; 3. The cooling timescale is the time on which the disk would cool if we would suddenly switch off the heating mechanisms. This is however meaningless for gravitational fragmentation due to the too high values of Q everywhere in the disks. Therefore, fragmentation does not occur either.</p><p>We have studied the overall minimal Q Toomre,min occurring in a disks as a function of time, radius, and Σ 0 in order to determine the maximum Σ 0 which can be used. In these calculations we again assume α = 7 × 10 −3 and M * = 1M . It is found that the minimal Q Toomre are always occurring very shortly after the start of the disk evolution (within some 10 4 years), and that afterwards, Q Toomre is always increasing. Thus, the minimal Q Toomre are a direct consequence of the initial conditions (as expected), and the disks evolve towards stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Radius of maximum instability</head><p>The orbital distance where the overall minimal Q Toomre,min are occurring correspond to about 20 AU for disks calculated without stellar irradiation, and, as also seen in the two examples in <ref type="figure">Fig. A.1</ref>, to about 25 AU for disks with irradiation, independent of the disk mass as long as M d (t = 0) 0.1 − 0.2M . For more massive disks, the distance of the minimal Q increases. This result can be understood at least for the irradiated disks if we assume that in the outer parts, the temperature structure is given by the stellar irradiation only. We can consider two cases: First, an optically thin disk with T mid ∝ r −1/2 . In this case, the orbital distance R Toomre,min,t where the minimal Q Toomre,min occurs is given for γ &lt; 7/4 as (using eqs. 7, 10 and T mid ∝ r −1/2 ) This corresponds to ratios R Toomre,min,t /R c =1/4, 3/4, 0.791, 0.886 for a disk surface density exponent (Eq. 7) γ=3/2, 1, 0.9, and 1/2. Second, we can consider a passively irradiated disk without viscous dissipation, where for orbital distances between about 0.4 and 84 AU, T mid ∝ r −3/7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Chiang &amp; Goldreich 1997)</ref>. In this case, one finds an orbital distance R Toomre,min,p where the minimal Q Toomre,min occurs at This corresponds to ratios R Toomre,min,p /R c =0.18, 0.71, 0.76, 0.87 for γ=3/2, 1, 0.9, and 1/2. We see that the results for an optically thin and a passively irradiated disk are similar. This is due to the fact that the temperature depends in both cases in a similar way on the distance. of initial gas surface density at 5.2 AU, Σ 0 which is a direct proxy of the initial disk mass (Eq. A.2). The red solid line is for disks with irradiation, the dotted blue one is for disks where viscosity is the only heating source. The dashed line gives the critical value of 1.7.</p><p>For R c = 30 AU and γ = 0.9, this leads for a passively irradiated disk (which is the situation assumed here, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fouchet et al. 2012</ref>) to a R Toomre,min,p = 22.8 AU, close to the result (≈ 25 AU) seen in the simulations. The somewhat larger value in the simulations is likely due to residual viscous heating.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>2 we plot the overall minimum Q Toomre,min (i.e. the lowest value reached at any distance and time) as a function of Σ 0 (or equivalently the initial disk mass), for disks with (red solid) and without (blue dotted) irradiation. In both cases, Q follows a simple power law which scales as Σ −1 0 , as expected from Eq. 10.</p><p>One sees that Q is higher in disks with irradiation, which is expected as these disks are hotter and thus more stable, in particular in the outer regions where Q becomes small, and where viscous heating is not important.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.

2.3.1. Chondritic radiogenic heating 

Urey (1955) was the first to point out that the presently mea-
sured surface heat flux of the Earth roughly corresponds to the 
radiogenic heat released in the interior if the Earth has a chon-
dritic composition. This results still holds today, even though 
the details depend on the exact type of chondritic material that 
is assumed to have formed the Earth (Hofmeister &amp; Criss 2005). 
Estimates for the total flux vary, but are of order 3 × 10 20 erg/s 
(Hofmeister &amp; Criss 2005). Due to these findings, we model the 
radiogenic heat production as the consequence of the decay of 
the three most important long-lived nuclides 40 K, 238 U and 232 Th

1.8 and 1.6 R ⊕ for a 1 M ⊕ planet. Clearly, this is a consequence 
of only simulating planets with primordial H 2 /He atmospheres.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We use the expression core in the astrophysical &quot;giant planet&quot; sense denoting the part of the planet not consisting of hydrogen and helium. This is different from the geophysical meaning where the core is the central part of a planet consisting of iron-nickel, but not including the silicates (the mantle) and possibly ices. 2 With super-Earth, we denote planets with masses between 1 and 10 M ⊕ , independent of their composition.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Characteristic disk evolution under the influence of photoevaporation</head><p>In this appendix we illustrate the characteristic evolution of the protoplanetary disks under the combined action of viscosity and photoevaporation as found in the update model, in order to check our results against previous studies. <ref type="figure">Figure  B</ref>.1 shows the gas surface density as a function of time for a disk with α = 7 × 10 −3 , Σ 0 = 200 g/cm 2 , and a mean external photoevaporation rate over the lifetime of the disk of about 7 × 10 −9 M /yr. The effects of irradiation on the thermal structure of the disk is taken into account as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fouchet et al. (2012)</ref>. These initial conditions result in a disk lifetime of 2.0 Myrs (remaining disk mass 10 −5 M ). In the figure, a line is plotted all 2 × 10 4 years, and the minimal allowed surface density is set to 10 −3 g/cm 2 . The two panels of the figure differ only by the inner boundary condition at R min = 0.1 AU. In the left panel, we use the same boundary conditions as in our earlier models which means that the flux through the innermost cell instantaneously adopts to the flux coming from further out. This is equivalent to the statement that the disk structure would continue to some smaller radius inside 0.1 AU, which is not modeled. In the right panel, Σ is forced to fall to zero at 0.1 AU. Physically, we can associate the two situations with different sizes of the magnetospheric cavity, i.e. with a weak and a strong magnetic field of the host star, respectively (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Bouvier et al. 2007)</ref>. A detailed description of the structure of the disk close to the host star taking into account magnetic fields will be presented in oncoming work ( <ref type="bibr">Cabral et al. in prep.)</ref>.</p><p>While the inner boundary condition has a very strong impact on the migration behavior of low-mass planets close to the star ( <ref type="bibr">Benitez-Llambay et al. 2011</ref>), it has otherwise no effect on the characteristic evolution of the disk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. Phases during disk evolution</head><p>Figure B.1 shows that the evolution of the disk can approximatively be separated in four phases:</p><p>1. The initial exterior radius specified by the initial conditions gets quickly reduced by external photoevaporation to a radius where mass removal due to photoevaporation, and the viscous spreading of the disk are in a quasiequilibrium as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Adams et al. (2004)</ref>. In the specific case, the radius decreases from initially about 200 AU to ∼ 100 AU. In the inner part, the disk very quickly evolves from the initial profile towards equilibrium. 2. In the second, dominant phase a quasi self-similar evolution of the disk occurs. The inner part of the disk (r 10 AU) is in near equilibrium (i.e. the mass accretion rate is nearly constant as a function of radius), and the slope of the gas surface density γ is approximately -0.9 (but varying between -0.4 and -1.5 due to opacity transitions). The outer radius is slowly moving inwards, from about 100 AU to 60 AU. For more massive disk, this equilibrium radius is further out. 3. Once the surface density has fallen to about 0.01 -0.1 g/cm 2 at ∼10 AU, a gap opens somewhat outside of R g,II . The evolution of the disk now speeds up which correspond to the so called "two-timescale" behavior ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Clarke et al. 2001</ref>). 4. Quickly afterwards, the total disk mass has fallen to 10 −5 M , where we stop the calculation. Note that the evolution at very small Σ is not important for our purpose of planet formation modeling. Therefore, we currently do not include the effect of the direct radiation field which would clear the disk quickly from inside out once the gap has opened <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Alexander &amp; Armitage 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Such an evolution is very similar to the findings of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Matsuyama et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Clarke et al. 2001</ref>). Note that the evolution can become more complex if there is additionally a planet accreting significant amounts of gas. This is the case if the planetary core becomes massive enough to trigger gas runaway accretion, so that a giant planet forms. Such a planet then effectively acts as a sink cell in the disk (see Paper I), so that another gap would form at its position towards the end of disk evolution, even if we neglect the tidal gap formation.</p><p>With the inclusion of a detailed model for the photoevaporation, but also of the calculation of the luminosity of the planets in the gas runaway accretion phase (where forming giant planets can be bright, cf. Paper I), we are able to address new observational constraints. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fouchet et al. (2012)</ref> we can use the disk structure to calculate the SED, in which we can now include the contribution from the star, the disk but also of the growing planet. From a giant planet undergoing rapid gas accretion, we expect itself two contributions, similar as for an accreting star. A contribution in the IR coming from the internal luminosity, and a hard component from the accretion shock. This will be addressed in a dedicated study <ref type="bibr">(Mordasini et al. in prep)</ref>. With upcoming observational facilities like ALMA, observing planet formation as it happens ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wolf et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Klahr &amp; Kley 2006</ref>) will become possible, and put a whole new class of constraints on formation models.</p></div>			</div>
