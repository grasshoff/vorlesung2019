				<p>Context. A first characterization of extrasolar planets by the observational determination of the radius has recently been achieved for a large number of planets. For some planets, a measurement of the luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly im-aged planets expected in the near future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the mass-distance diagram. Aims. Our aim is to extend our planet formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to calculate from one single model in a self-consistent way all basic quantities describing a planet: its mass, semimajor axis, composition, radius and luminosity. We then want to use this model for population synthesis calculations. Methods. In this and a companion paper, we show how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope of a pro-toplanet not only during the early formation phase, but also during the gas runaway accretion phase, and during the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We improve the model further with a new prescription for the disk-limited gas accretion rate, an internal structure model for the planetary core assuming a differentiated interior, and the inclusion of radioactive decay as an additional heat source in the core. Results. We study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of giant planets, the influence of the core mass on the radius and the luminosity both in the &quot;hot start&quot; and the &quot;cold start&quot; scenario. We put special emphasis on the validation of the model by comparison with other models of planet formation and evolution. We find that our results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications we make in our calculations. Conclusions. The upgraded model yields the most important physical quantities describing a planet from its beginning as a tiny seed embryo to a Gyr old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the observational constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where its is difficult to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture. Our comprehensive formation and evolution model should be helpful in this situation for the understanding of exoplanets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The number of known transiting extrasolar planets or planet candidates has recently increased exponentially, thanks both to ground-based observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gillon et al. 2011</ref>), and to space missions like CoRoT (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2009</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Borucki et al. 2011</ref>). Combined with radial velocity measurements which yield the mass of the planet, one gets the planetary mass-radius (M-R) diagram, which is an observational result of similar importance as the semimajor axis-mass (a-M) diagram.</p><p>The latter relation is available through the success of ongoing radial velocity surveys (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). It is a goal of population synthesis models to understand the structure of the a-M distribution, due to the multitude of clues it contains for planet formation theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ida &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mordasini et al. 2009a)</ref>. A recent comparison of numerous theoretical and observational results mostly obtained by the radial velocity technique can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alibert et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. (2012a)</ref>.</p><p>Send offprint requests to: Christoph MORDASINI, e-mail: mordasini@mpia. <ref type="bibr">de</ref> The reason for the important role of the M-R diagram which is now available for a statistically significant number of planets is that one can derive the mean density of the planet. This constrains the internal planetary structure which is of central importance to understand the nature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leconte et al. 2011</ref>), but also the formation of the planet. The formation and evolution of the planetary mass-radius relationship is studied in the companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mordasini et al. (2012b)</ref>, hereafter Paper II (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. 2011c</ref>).</p><p>Besides transiting planets, also the number of planets detected by direct imaging has increased significantly in the past few years, even though in absolute numbers, much less such planets have been found to date. But already these discoveries, like the planetary system around HR 8799 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Marois et al. , 2010</ref> have triggered numerous theoretical studies regarding the formation of these objects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kratter et al. 2010)</ref>. Two points about these planets are particularly interesting: Their large semimajor axis a and the fact that we measure the luminosity L of young giant planets at some time t. Both quantities are important to understand the formation mechanism (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson et al. 2011</ref>). In the near future, more capable instruments like SPHERE at the VLT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beuzit et al. 2007</ref>) or GPI at Gemini South ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McBride et al. 2011</ref>) and later EPICS at the E-ELT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kasper et al. 2008</ref>) will come online. We can therefore expect that the number of points we can put in the t-L, the a-L and (for cases with an independent, dynamical mass determination) the M-L diagram will increase from a handful at the moment to hundreds in a few years, similar to what has happened for the M-R diagram in the past few years.</p><p>This shift from an era of discovery to one of a first physical characterization of extrasolar planets by their radii and luminosities has profound implications for planet formation theory. Until recently, planet formation models studied mostly giant planets detected by radial velocity measurement, of which only the minimal mass and some orbital elements were known. Now we are confronted with a multitude of different sets of observational data and constraints, each regarding primarily planets of different types: Transiting, close-in planets, most of them with a small radius (as found by Kepler, see also Paper II); directly imagined, self-luminous massive young giant planets at large distances from their host star; and a wide range in masses going from super-Earth to Jovian mass planets at distances varying from close to the star out to several AU found by RV measurements (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The final goal of planet formation theory to develop one theory to explain the formation (and evolution) of all these very different planets is a challenging one, and will require many efforts in the coming years. Nevertheless, the approach to bring together all these different observational data in a coherent way (which in itself is a non-trivial task, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2012</ref>) to constrain planet formation and evolution theories seems to be a promising route. In the end, one is not interested in a theory which can explain certain types of planets, but fails for other classes.</p><p>In this and the companion paper we take a first step in this direction. We present multiple upgrades of our formation model (introduced first in Alibert, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Mordasini &amp; Benz 2004</ref>). The most important addition is that we now calculate not only the formation of the planets, but couple formation in a self-consistent way with the subsequent evolution at constant mass once the protoplanetary disk is gone. With this approach, we can now calculate directly from one single model not only the planet's mass and semimajor axis, but also the planet's main physical characteristics like the radius, luminosity, surface gravity, effective temperature as well as the composition in terms of iron and silicates, ices and H 2 /He.</p><p>These basic characteristics are available for a planet at any time during its "life" starting as a tiny sub-Earth mass seed in the protoplanetary disk to a mature, billion of years old planet. A direct coupling of the planet's formation and its evolution is necessary, as it is well known that the formation has important, direct consequences for the evolution, in particular for the luminosity of giant planets at young ages ("cold" vs "hot" start models, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012</ref>). With this model development, we can now compare our simulations directly with observational constraints coming from radial velocity (and microlensing), transits as well as direct imaging.</p><p>Other upgrades are the following: a detailed description for the rate at which gas is accreted by the planet in the disk-limited gas runaway accretion phase, an internal structure model for the solid (iron/silicate and possibly ice) part of the planet, the inclusion of radioactive decay for the luminosity of the core, a new initial profile for the gaseous disk, a new prescription for the photoevaporation of the disk, including external and internal photoevaporation, and finally a realistically low grain opacity for the gaseous envelope (presented in a dedicated work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Mordasini et al. 2012c</ref>).</p><p>We thus deal in this paper and in Paper II mostly with improvements of the physical description of one planet. In other papers, we addressed upgrades regarding the disk model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fouchet et al. 2011</ref>), the migration of low-mass planets <ref type="bibr">(Dittkrist et al. in prep)</ref> or the effect of the concurrent formation of several embryos in one disk (Alibert et al. in prep.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Organization of the paper</head><p>The organization of the paper is as follows: In Sect. 2 we give a short overview of the model. In Section 3, we describe the modifications of the computational module that describes the gaseous envelope structure of the planet, extending it to calculate the structure not only during the pre-runaway formation phase as in our previous models, but also during the gas runaway accretion/collapse phase and the subsequent evolutionary phase after the disk is gone. In Section 4 we address a related subject, namely how to calculate the gas accretion rate in the disk-limited regime, i.e. once gas runaway accretion of forming giant planets has started.</p><p>In Paper II, we present further upgrades regarding the planet module, namely a realistic model for the density of the solid core of the planets and the inclusion of radiogenic heating in it. In Paper II we also describe shortly some modifications regarding the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we use in Paper II the upgraded model in population synthesis calculations to study the formation and evolution of the planetary M-R diagram, the distribution of planetary radii, and the comparison with observational data.</p><p>In the remainder of this first paper, we show specific results obtained with the upgraded model: In Sect. 6 we study the coupled formation and evolution of a Jovian mass planet at 5.2 AU from the Sun. Many of the effects seen during this particular simulation are characteristic for the effects encountered during the formation and evolution of the planets in a general population synthesis calculation (Paper II). In Sect. 7 and 8 we discuss our results concerning the radii and luminosities of giant planets, putting special weight on the comparison with other, more complex models. The luminosity of young Jupiters is further addressed in a dedicated paper <ref type="bibr">(Mordasini et al. in prep.)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Combined model of planet formation and evolution</head><p>The formation model used here relies on the core accretion paradigm, coupled to standard models of protoplanetary disk evolution and tidal migration of protoplanets. The basic concept of core accretion is to follow the concurrent growth of an initially small solid core and its surrounding gaseous envelope, embedded in a disk of planetesimals and gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Perri &amp; Cameron 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Mizuno et al. 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986)</ref>. Within the core accretion paradigm, giant planet formation happens as a two step process: first a solid core with a critical mass (of order 10 M ⊕ ) must form, then the rapid accretion of a massive gaseous envelope sets in. This process is thought to take typically several million years. Two other processes in the protoplanetary disk happen on a similar timescale: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk itself, and the orbital migration of the protoplanets due to angular momentum exchange with the gaseous disk. As described in , we have therefore coupled a classical core accretion model (very similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) to models describing the latter two processes, using for the disk a standard α model, and prescriptions for the type I and II migration of the protoplanets. While we use simple, 1D models for the individual processes, we consider the full coupling between them, which alone leads to complex formation scenarios (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Limitations: no accretion after disk dissipation, primordial H 2 /He envelopes only</head><p>From its conception, our model mainly deals with the formation and evolution of relatively massive, Neptunian and Jovian planets even though that the vast majority of planets that actually form in a population synthesis are low-mass, failed core (prototerrestrial) planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>). We currently do not include the giant impact stage (after the gaseous disk has disappeared) during which terrestrial planet acquire their final mass. Therefore, our model is incomplete in the description of the formation of planets less massive than ∼ 10M ⊕ (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref> for a discussion).</p><p>Regarding the long-term evolution, we only consider primordial H 2 /He envelopes for which we assume that the mass remains constant after the protoplanetary disk is gone, neglecting a possible evaporation of the primordial gaseous envelope, as well as the outgassing of a secondary atmosphere. Such atmospheric mass loss for planets close to the host star will be considered in future work. Note that the minimal allowed semimajor axis for model planets is at the moment 0.1 AU, so that no simulated planets are exposed to the very intense radiation field occurring on very tight orbits like for example CoRoT-7b (a = 0.017 AU), where atmospheric mass loss may be very important ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Valencia et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>An exact lower boundary in mass down to which the model can be applied is difficult to specify, as we find in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref> that already planets of just a few Earth masses can accrete non-negligible amounts of H 2 /He during the presence of the nebula, provided that the grain opacity in the envelope is low, which is probably the case ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. 2010)</ref>. In Paper II we study the formation and evolution of a close-in super-Earth (∼ 4M ⊕ ) planet with a tenuous 1% primordial H 2 /He envelope. We find good agreement of the radius with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, showing that the evolution also of this kind of low-mass planets can be modeled.</p><p>We describe in this paper only improvements (or the inclusion of new physical effects) relative to the original model described in , to which the reader is referred to for the remaining description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Gaseous envelope calculation during the attached, detached and evolutionary phase</head><p>We now turn to the most important improvement of the model, which is the ability to calculate planetary envelope structures during the entire formation and subsequent evolution of the planets. In previous models, we calculated the gaseous envelope only during the phase when the planet had a subcritical core mass less than the one needed to trigger gas runaway accretion (about 10 M ⊕ ). This is sufficient if one is interested in the mass of the planets only. In order to characterize the planetary structure (and thus to have R and L, too), we now include also the gas runaway phase (which is attained by planets becoming supercritical during the lifetime of the nebula) and the evolution at constant mass after the dissipation of the nebula. This phase is eventually attained by all planets. Note that the calculations of the gaseous envelope in all phases allows to obtain the core mass more accurately: We can now calculate the capture radius for planetesimals R capt in the gas runaway accretion phase. This capture radius is necessary to calculate the core accretion rate ˙ M Z . In previous calculations, we had to extrapolate the capture radius as found in the pre-runaway phase into the runaway phase. The behavior of R capt is discussed in Sect. 6.2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Structure equations</head><p>The gas accretion rate of the planet (in the early phases before runaway, cf. 6.2.1) is obtained by solving the one dimensional, hydrostatic planetary structure equations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986</ref>). These equations are similar to those for stellar interiors, except that the energy release by nuclear fusion is replaced by the heating by impacting planetesimals, which is the dominant energy source during the early formation stage. The other equations are the standard equations (except for the assumption of a constant luminosity within the envelope, as discussed further down) of mass conservation, hydrostatic equilibrium and energy transfer (e.g. Broeg 2009):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dm dr = 4πr 2 ρ dP dr = − Gm r 2 ρ (1) dl dr = 0 dT dr = T P dP dr (T, P)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In these equations, r is the radius as measured from the planetary center, m the mass inside r (including the core mass M Z ), l the luminosity at r, ρ, P, T the gas density, pressure and temperature. The quantity (T, P) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(T, P) = d ln T d ln P = min( ad , rad )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the radiative gradient (in radiative zones) in the diffusion approximation is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">rad = 3 64πσG κlP T 4 m ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where κ denotes the opacity (given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bell &amp; Lin 1994 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Freedman et al. 2008</ref>), while σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The adiabatic gradient (in convective zones) ad is directly given by the equation of state SCvH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Saumon et al. 1995</ref>).</p><p>We thus assume zero entropy gradient convection and use the Schwarzschild criterion to determine whether a layer is convectively unstable. This means that our model builds on two interlinked traditional assumptions about the interiors of (giant) planets. These assumptions are mainly made for simplicity of the models, but are in fact not necessarily correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Stevenson 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012)</ref>: First, it is assumed, as just stated, that the interiors are adiabatic due to efficient large-scale convection. In this case, for Jupiter and Saturn at present time, the degree of super-adiabaticity (which is the fractional degree by which the actual temperature gradient is larger than the adiabatic gradient) is very small (10 −8 − 10 −9 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012)</ref>. There are however several situations where the assumption of an adiabatic interior may break down <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Saumon &amp; Guillot 2004)</ref>. Additionally, at early stages of the evolution, the planets could be going through regions in the surface gravity-effective temperature parameter space where the formation of H 2 leads to a non-linear response of the atmospheric structure which influences the degree of super-adiabaticity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baraffe et al. 2002)</ref>. We are currently working on including the mixing length theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kippenhahn &amp; Weigert 1990</ref>) in order to better quantify this issue (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Rafikov 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The second traditional assumption is that the planet consists of a few well separated regions, which are chemically homogeneous. In our model, we assume that the envelope consists purely of hydrogen and helium. In reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Stevenson 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chabrier &amp; Baraffe 2007)</ref>, it is well possible that compositional gradients exist, originating for example from the dissolution of the core <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wilson &amp; Militzer 2012)</ref>, or the destruction of planetesimals in deeper layers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mordasini et al. 2005</ref>). If a stabilizing compositional gradient is present, it is likely that the large-scale convection breaks up into many thin chemically homogeneous convective layers which are separated by narrow, diffusive interfaces with large compositional gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stevenson 1979)</ref>. Due to the large number of diffusive interfaces, the efficiency of heat transport is strongly reduced, resulting in a super-adiabatic temperature gradient. As recently shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Leconte &amp; Chabrier (2012)</ref>, such a semiconvective model is able to reproduce the observational constraints coming from the gravitational moments and the atmospheric composition of Jupiter and Saturn. This shows that an adiabatic interior cannot be taken for granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">A new, simple method for the calculation of the total luminosity and evolutionary sequences</head><p>In a planetary population synthesis model, the evolution of thousands of different planets is calculated, covering an extremely wide parameter range of planetary core and envelope masses, accretion rates and background nebula conditions. We therefore need a stable and rapid method for the numerical solution of these equations. We have therefore replaced the ordinary equation for dl/dm = −T ∂S /∂t (where S is the entropy) by the assumption that l is constant within the envelope, and that we can derive the total luminosity L (including solid and gas accretion, contraction and release of internal heat) and its temporal evolution by total energy conservation arguments, an approach somewhat similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Papaloizou &amp; Nelson (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hartmann et al. (1997)</ref>. We first recall that −dE tot /dt = L and that in the hydrostatic case, the total energy (neglecting rotation) is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E tot = E grav + E int = − M 0 Gm r dm + M M z u dm (5) = −ξ GM 2 2R (6)</formula><p>where u is the specific internal energy, M the total mass, and R the total radius of the planet. The integration of the gravitational energy includes the core, for which we assume for simplicity a density which is constant as as a function of r. This is strictly speaking not self-consistent, as we assume that the core is differentiated, see Paper II. Then, the binding energy of the core is given as −(3/5)GM 2 Z /R core . Note that, by differentiating this energy with respect to time, assuming a constant density, the resulting luminosity from the growth of the core is equal to the accretion luminosity of planetesimals falling onto the core with a velocity equal to 0 at infinity. On the other hand, the core does not contribute to the internal energy as we do not consider the thermal evolution of the core. In Eq. 6 we have introduced a parameter ξ, which represents the distribution of mass within the planet and its internal energy content. This last formula is indeed nothing else than a definition of ξ. For example, a fully convective, nearly isentropic star that can be approximated by a n=3/2 polytrope would have ξ = 6/7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hartmann et al. 1997</ref>).</p><p>The quantity ξ can be found for any given structure at time t with the equations above. Then one can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">− d dt E tot = L = L M + L R + L ξ (7) = ξGM R ˙ M − ξGM 2 2R 2 ˙ R + GM 2 2R ˙ ξ<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ˙ M = ˙ M Z + ˙ M XY is the total accretion rate of solids and gas, and ˙ R is the rate of change of the total radius. This equation corresponds to a generalization of Eq. 6 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hartmann et al. (1997)</ref>. All quantities except ˙ ξ can readily be calculated at time</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">t.

By setting C = L ex /L</formula><p>one obtains the correction factor so that exact energy conservation would have occurred. As an approximation, we then use this C for the next time step. One finds that with this method, the estimated luminosity L and the actual luminosity L ex agree generally very well, provided that dt is small enough <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . With this prescription, we can thus always calculate the total luminosity at t + dt, which is one of the necessary boundary conditions for the envelope calculations, allowing us in the end to construct evolutionary sequences. We will show below that this method leads to results in terms of luminosity and radius evolution which are in very good agreement with traditional calculations based on the entropy like <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>. In this method, the (core) luminosity due to the accretion of planetesimal during the formation phase, but also the release of energy due to the contraction of the core at constant massthe dominant contribution from it during the evolution phase for giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>) -is automatically included. To this luminosity we finally add the radiogenic luminosity L radio (see Paper II) to get the total intrinsic luminosity. Note that with planetary luminosity we always mean the one emitted from the interior, without the contribution from absorbed stellar radiation which makes up for Jupiter today about 40% of the total flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Note that we plan on further improving our scheme to estimate the luminosity at the next timestep, which is possible by considering the contribution from the core and the envelope separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Hydrostatic approximation</head><p>Equation 5 assumes that the planet is always in hydrostatic equilibrium, in particular also during the rapid contraction phase at the moment the planet detaches from the nebula (see the left bottom panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) which we shall call the collapse phase independent of its true nature. To check if this assumption is selfconsistent, we performed an order of magnitude estimate: Using the temporal change of the total radius v(R) = dR/dt (which is of order -10 m/s during the fastest contraction), we have assumed that the contraction of the layers in the interior is homologous. This allows us to estimate the total kinetic energy as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E kin = M M Z 1 2 v(R) r R 2 dm.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Comparing E kin with the total energy, we find that E kin is always many orders of magnitude smaller than the total energy during the entire formation and evolution of a giant planet. During the collapse, it is smaller by about 6-8 orders of magnitude (and during the subsequent slow long-term contraction even by about 20 to 30 orders). This very large difference makes one think that the hydrostatic approximation is justified. A caveat is that first, our check is only looking at global quantities and, therefore, would not catch if in certain layers of the planet hydrodynamic effects become locally important. Second, one cannot exclude a priori that the usage of the hydrostatic approximation itself forces the evolution of the planet to behave hydrostatically. The large security margin of 6 to 8 orders of magnitudes, and the fact that <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack (1986)</ref> reached the same conclusion seems however indeed to indicate that the evolution does not become a dynamical collapse, but remains just a rapid gravitational contraction, validating our approach. We must however note that opposite views do exist (Wuchterl 1991).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Simplification using dl/dr = 0</head><p>The method introduced above only yields the total luminosity at the surface, and not l(r) which is necessary to solve the structure equations. We use the simplest setting, namely that dl/dr = 0. This seems at first sight not to be a reasonable approximation as it (formally) means that the complete luminosity originates in the core, which is, of course, not the case except for the early phases. One however finds that the solution of the structure equations is very insensitive to the specific form that l takes in the interior. This results can be understood due to the following physical reasons: l enters into the remaining three structure equations only in radiative zones of the planet (see Eq. 3 and 4). In convective zones, l does not enter at all. Note that this is only true for the assumption that convection is strictly adiabatic, which might not be the case, as discussed at the end of Sect. 3.1.</p><p>However, significant radiative zones (in terms of contained mass) only exist during the very early phases of formation of the planet (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986)</ref>. But then the dominant part of the luminosity is generated by the accretion of planetesimals by the core, so that L ≈ L core , or in other words dl/dr ≈ 0, so that our approximation is close to the exact solution. The core luminosity due to the accretion of planetesimals is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L core = GM Z R core ˙ M Z (11)</formula><p>where M Z is the mass of the core, R core its radius, and ˙ M Z is the accretion rate of planetesimals. This means that we use the sinking approximation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>During the collapse phase and during the long-term evolution when no planetesimals are accreted any more, l varies strongly inside the envelope, from a very small value (L radio ) at the core to a typically much larger total luminosity at the surface for giant planets due to the cooling and contraction of the envelope. However, in this phase the planet is nearly fully convective (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Guillot 2005</ref>), with a radiative gradient dominant over the adiabatic one by orders of magnitude ( ), so that the radial variation of l is irrelevant for the structure. A radiative layer still exists, but only near the very surface of the planet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. 1997)</ref>, containing negligible amounts of matter ( 1%, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Guillot &amp; Gautier 2009)</ref>. Therefore, they do not contribute significantly to the contractional luminosity which comes from the deeper interior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kippenhahn &amp; Weigert 1990)</ref>, so that dl/dr = 0 is again a good approximation in those parts where l matters. This also means that the Schwarzschild criterion, which uses l to decide if a layer is convective or not, remains valid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Tests of the simplification</head><p>Regarding the assumption that dl/dr = 0, we performed a number of tests. We adopted different prescriptions for the form of l as a function of radius (or mass). First, we (arbitrarily) assumed a linear increase with m from l(R core ) = L core at the core to the total luminosity at the surface.</p><p>For the second set of tests, we proceed as follows. Knowing the planetary internal structure at two timesteps (say t and t−dt), we compute the Lagrangian change in the specific entropy S (m, t). From this, we compute l(m, t) = −T (S (m, t) − S (m, t − dt))/dt, where T is the mean temperature for mass shell m between t−dt and t. Then, we compute the planetary internal structure at time t + dt by scaling this l(m, t) onto the new core and total mass, and the new L core and total luminosity. This rescaled, variable l(m, t + dt) is then used to calculated the structure.</p><p>In all cases, one finds only very small differences between these calculations and the simulations with a constant l. For example, for the time needed to go to runaway gas accretion in a <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> J1 like calculation (see the appendix A), one finds differences of 2-5% by which it takes longer in the dl/dr = 0 simulation compared to the variable l case. This is a difference which is much smaller than those introduced by e.g. the uncertainties regarding the grain opacity or the planetesimal size. For the long-term evolution phase, the differences are virtually vanishing, because the planets are almost fully convective. This large independence of the results on the form of l has also been noticed by others <ref type="bibr">(A. Fortier, personal communication, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we have tested the impact of the simplified luminosity calculation during the attached and collapse phase by comparing with simulations based on the solution of the full set of structure equations using the traditional entropy method, obtained by a completely independent model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Broeg &amp; Benz 2012)</ref>. As described in details in their paper, these authors solve the structure equations in the quasi-hydrostatic approximation on a self-adaptive 1-dimensional grid using the classical Henyey method <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kippenhahn and Weigert, 1990</ref>). For a simulation similar to the J1 case discussed in the Appendix A, we compared the accretion rates of gas and solids, the luminosity, and the radius of the forming planet. Also in this case, we found very good agreement.</p><p>The tests presented before may seem complicated, and one may wonder why we do not simply solve the whole set of equations, replacing Eq. 2 by its standard form dl/dm = −T ∂S /∂t . The reason is the following: population synthesis requires the computation of thousands of formation models, starting from different initial condition. Such a computation is done in an automatic way, using programs generating the initial conditions, then computing the formation model, and finally compiling the important results (e.g. mass, semimajor axis, radius, and luminosity of the formed planets). In this situation, it is very important that only very few simulations do not converge, since non converging simulations could introduce a bias in the results (e.g. if all simulations leading to massive planets were not to converge, one would predict only low-mass planets). We have therefore chosen not to use the standard Newton-Raphson in order to compute the planetary internal structure, but to use a shooting method, which converges extremely well (less than 0.3 % of our simulation in the synthesis in Paper II have problems to converge using this method). However, the shooting method is possible in practical only if one knows the luminosity profile a priori, which is the case assuming a constant luminosity or in the two sets of tests presented above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Cold versus hot start conditions</head><p>Finally one must take into account that a part of the released gravitational energy of newly accreted material is not incorporated into the planetary structure but already lost as L acc in the accretion shock on the planet's surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bodenheimer, Hubickyj, &amp; Lissauer 2000)</ref> or in the surrounding circumplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Papaloizou &amp; Nelson 2005)</ref>. For matter falling in free fall onto the planet, the released luminosity at the surface of the planet is approximately given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L acc = GM R ˙ M XY (12)</formula><p>where ˙ M XY is the gas accretion rate. The same amount of energy is also lost in total if the matter spirals onto the planet through a circumplanetary disk, with the difference that some fraction (half of it for a Keplerian accretion disk) is already lost in the disk.</p><p>We can now consider two limiting scenarios (see Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012 for intermediate "warm start" simulations). First, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Papaloizou &amp; Nelson (2005)</ref> we assume that all energy liberated in the shock is radiated away from the planet, and does not contribute to the luminosity inside the planet's structure. This is the physically likely scenario ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Stahler et al. 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chabrier, per- sonal communication, 2010)</ref>. The opposite extreme is to assume that no energy at all is radiated away at the shock. While physically unlikely, it is of interest to consider this case: In absence of radiative losses at the shock, our simulations become similar to the so called "hot start" calculations. This is because also for these "hot start" models, there is no mechanism which can act as a sink of entropy, which is the central role of the radiative losses at the accretion shock. As demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fortney et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref>, the smaller initial entropy of models which assume radiative losses at the shock has very important consequences for the luminosity of young Jupiters ("cold start" models, see Sect. 8.2.2).</p><p>The luminosity within the planetary structure L int for the two cases is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L int = L − L acc "Cold start" L "Hot start (accreting)"<label>(13)</label></formula><p>while an observer would see the total luminosity L coming from both the intrinsic and accretional luminosity 2 . We have added the 2 It is interesting to note that we should have in principle two components: A cooler (IR) component from the internal luminosity of the planet, and a harder one from the accretion shock. This is similar as for accreting stars. The fact that gas runaway accretion can only occur when there is still a sufficiently massive disk, means that the radiation from the planet likely gets strongly reprocessed by the surrounding disk material, which should make the observable signature more complex. suffix "accreting" for our "hot start" calculations, in order to distinguish them from traditional "hot start" calculations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>) where one starts with a fully formed planet (i.e. at the final mass) with some high, arbitrary entropy. It is clear that our treatment is a strong simplification of the exact physics of the accretion shock (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Stahler et al. 1980</ref>). As already mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref>, three dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamic calculations resolving the shock physics would be necessary to get more accurate results. We will show in a dedicated paper (Mordasini et al. in prep.) how our results for the luminosities depend on a number of parameters which should be indicative of general trends for the behavior of the luminosity of newly formed giant planets.</p><p>3.6. Possible issues for "hot" accretion and dl/dr = 0</p><p>The following concern occurs when "hot" accretion is simulated with the dl/dr = 0 simplification in the envelope. When the internal energy of the infalling gas (or a part of it) is incorporated into the growing object rather than radiated away, this can lead to important modifications of the internal structure, as illustrated by several papers studying the effects of accretion onto low-mass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hartmann et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mercer-Smith et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio 1985)</ref>. These studies show that under some circumstances, the heating of the surface layers by the rapid accretion of hot, high-entropy gas can reduce the temperature gradient to a degree that convection stops. This means that a radiative layer develops in the interior, even at considerable depth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio (1985)</ref> studied in details the reaction of an initially fully convective 0.2 M star to the accretion of "cold" and "hot" gas at a wide range of accretion rates. For the case of "cold" accretion, they found that independently of the accretion rate, the objects remain fully convective, and contract as they grow, indicating that the dl/dr = 0 simplification is appropriate in this situation. Such a behavior of the radius is also found in our simulations of giant planet formation in the "cold" assumption presented in Sect. 8.2.2. If the gas keeps a fraction α h of L acc (Eq. 12), different scenarios occur, depending on α h , and the gas accretion rate. In this paper, we study the two limiting cases corresponding to α h = 1 for completely "hot" and α h = 0 for completely "cold" accretion (see <ref type="bibr">Eq. 13)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio (1985)</ref> find that if the gas accretion rate is very small ( ˙ M XY 10 −10 M /yr≈ 3 × 10 −5 M ⊕ /yr), the star remains fully convective also for "hot" accretion. If both the accretion rate and α h are high, a significant part of the entire star becomes radiative and the entire star expands by a large amount.</p><p>For intermediate values of α h and ˙ M XY (including planetary accretion rates expected in a protoplanetary disk 10 −2 M ⊕ /yr), ∼ 10 − 30% of the mass of the star becomes radiative, and the outer radius including the newly accreted matter expands, while the matter originally contained in the star contracts. An expansion of the star undergoing "hot" accretion is also seen in the simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mercer-Smith et al. (1984)</ref>.</p><p>As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio (1985</ref><ref type="bibr">, see also Hartmann et al. 1997</ref>), these results can be understood by comparing the accretion timescale of "hot" material with the thermal relaxation timescale of the newly accreted material. If the accretion timescale is short compared to the relaxation timescale, thermal equilibrium cannot be established, which would be needed for the star to remain convective. In the "hot start" simulations (Sect. 8.2.1) we also see that the radii of the planets reinflate during the gas runaway accretion phase, after the initial collapse. These results will be discussed in details in <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. (in prep)</ref>. It is clear that the presence of a deep radiative zone, which we can-not catch with the dl/dr = 0 simplification could cause strong departures from the results obtained with this assumption. This would also affect the luminosity and radius of the planets after formation.</p><p>The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio (1985)</ref> were obtained for spherically symmetric accretion. In reality, most of the matter would probably be accreted via a circumplanetary disks (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lubow et al. 1999</ref>), so that only a fraction of the planetary surface would be undergoing direct accretion, while the rest would be free to radiate. As for stars, it seems likely that this could be important for an accurate criterion when convection is inhibited by "hot" accretion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hartmann et al. 1997</ref>). Three dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations seem necessary to clarify the situation. We will investigate this issue in simulations with a variable luminosity in future work. For the moment, this concern means that our results for the luminosity of young giant planets formed with a "hot start" (and especially at high gas accretion rates) must be regarded with due caution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Inflation mechanism</head><p>At the moment, we do not include any mechanism which could lead to the so called "radius anomaly" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leconte et al. 2011</ref>) observed for many transiting Hot Jupiter. These planets have radii clearly larger than expected from standard internal structure modeling as performed here. There are several possible physical mechanisms leading to this bloating like tidal heating ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bodenheimer et al. 2001</ref>), dissipation of stellar irradiation deep in the interior <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Showman &amp; Guillot, 2002</ref>), ohmic dissipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Batygin &amp; Stevenson, 2010)</ref> or double diffusive convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chabrier &amp; Baraffe, 2007)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">Boundary conditions</head><p>In order to solve the structure equations, boundary conditions must be specified, which should also provide a continuous transition between different phases. For the formation and evolution of a giant planet, three different fundamental phases must be distinguished: attached, detached, and evolutionary. Lower mass planets stay in the first phase until the nebula disappears and then directly pass into the evolutionary phase. Five boundary conditions are given, namely the core radius, the luminosity, the total planetary radius (in the attached phase) or the total planetary mass (in the detached and evolutionary phase), and the surface temperature and pressure. The four differential equations with five boundary condition only have a solution for a given total planetary mass (attached phase) or radius (detached and evolutionary phase).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.1.">Attached (or nebular) phase</head><p>At low masses, the envelope of the protoplanet is attached continuously to the background nebula, and the conditions at the surface of the planet are the pressure P neb and approximately the temperature T neb in the surrounding disk. The total radius R is given in this regime by about the minimum of the Hill radius R H and the Bondi (or accretion) radius R A . The gas accretion rate is found by the solution of the structure equations and is given by the ability of the envelope to radiate away energy so that it can contract (i.e. its Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale), so that new gas can stream in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>).

We therefore follow these authors in setting k liss = 1/3. Regarding the temperature, Eq. 15 reflects the fact that the planet has to be hotter in order to radiate into the nebula <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 1999</ref>). Equation 16 finally means that the planet emits energy from the interior and is concurrently embedded in the protoplanetary nebula with a certain temperature, where T neb is the midplane background nebula temperature as given by our disk model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.2.">Detached (or transition) phase</head><p>The solution of the structure equations together with the specified boundary conditions leads to the well known result that the gas accretion rate starts to increase exponentially once the core has grown to a mass of the order of 10 M ⊕ (see Sect. 6). This means that at some moment, the gas accretion rate obtained in this way (i.e, through the planets Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale) must become higher than some external maximal possible gas supply. At this point, the planet enters the second phase and contracts to a radius which is much smaller than the Hill sphere radius. This is the "detached" regime of high-mass, runaway gas accretion planets. The planet adjusts its now free radius to the boundary conditions that are given by an accretion shock for matter falling at free fall velocity v ff from about the Hill sphere radius to the planet's surface. Probably more realistic boundary conditions would be those appropriate for the interface to a circumplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Papaloizou &amp; Nelson 2005</ref>). The maximal possible gas accretion rate ˙ M XY is given by how much gas is supplied by the disk and can flow through the gap onto the planet ˙ M max (e.g. Lubow, Seibert, &amp; Artymowicz 1999). The calculation of this rate is specified in Section 4.

In Eq. 20, A is the albedo assumed to have the same value of 0.343 as Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Guillot 2005)</ref>, g is the gravitational acceleration GM/R 2 , and for the luminosity we still have l(R) = L int . In future work, we will use an albedo which depends on planet parameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>). Numerically, one now iterates in this (and the next) phase on the radius R.</p><p>For the "hot start (accreting)" models, which (artificially) assume no radiative losses at all at the shock, it is not completely obvious if we should not include the pressure due to the accretion shock. However, we found that the dominant term for P is the photospheric pressure for all accretion rates we considered, and that the results are similar both with and without the ram pressure. For a gas accretion rate of 10 −2 M ⊕ /yr the photospheric pressure is always a factor 15 or more larger than the ram pressure, while for 10 −1 M ⊕ /yr, it is still larger by a factor of at least about 2. This dominance of the photospheric pressure over the ram pressure stems from the low opacities at the typically relevant temperatures (∼1500-3000 K) and densities at the surface of a giant planet undergoing gas runaway accretion. This temperature range approximately corresponds to the interval where grains have already evaporated, but where the atomic and molecular opacities are still low, resulting in low κ ∼ 0.01 cm 2 /g even for full grain opacities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bell &amp; Lin 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Freedman et al 2008)</ref>. The dominance of the photospheric pressure is increased even more by the low grain opacity reduction factor f opa = 0.003 which is normally used in the simulations. In simulations which are instead made with a full grain opacity, and ˙ M XY = 10 −1 M ⊕ /yr, the ram pressure becomes dominant by a factor of a few for a short time at the beginning of the detached phase.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Disk-limited gas accretion rate of the planet in the runaway regime</head><p>The second improvement of the model presented in this first paper regards the planetary gas accretion rate in the gas runaway accretion phase. It occurs for supercritical cores with a mass larger than about 10 M ⊕ . In this phase, the gas accretion rate is no longer limited by the planet's envelope structure, but it is limited by the rate at which gas can be provided by the disk. The gravitational interaction of the protoplanet and the surrounding disk determines the accretion rate across of the growing gap (e.g. D' <ref type="bibr">Angelo et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>The actual gas accretion rate ˙ M XY must be given by the smaller of the two rates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">˙ M XY = Min ˙ M Tkh , ˙ M XY,max<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where ˙ M Tkh denotes the gas accretion rate as found through the solution of the structure equations in the attached phase, which is determined by the ability of the envelope to radiate away the potential energy of the accreted matter, while ˙ M XY,max is the disklimited rate.</p><p>In our previous models, we used for the disk-limited rate simply</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">˙ M XY,max = ˙ M disk,equi = 3π˜νΣ3π˜νΣ (24)</formula><p>which is the viscous accretion rate in a protoplanetary disk in equilibrium (i.e. where the mass flux is constant as a function of distance from the star). This expression however neglects three points: (i) the presence of the planet acting as a mass sink locally brings the disk out of equilibrium. (ii) only a fraction of the gas flux through the disk will be accreted onto the planet, while some part will flow past it <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lubow &amp; D'Angelo 2006</ref>). (iii) there can be (initially) a local reservoir of gas around the planet that can be accreted faster than on a viscous timescale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Non-equilibrium flux</head><p>The inner part of a viscous accretion disk evolves in absence of a planet relatively quickly into equilibrium. However, the sucking action of the planet and photoevaporation at late stages disturbs the purely viscous evolution and brings the disk out of equilibrium. Then, the mass flux at a distance r from the star is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">˙ M disk = 3π˜νΣ3π˜νΣ + 6πr ∂˜νΣ∂˜νΣ ∂r<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where the second non-equilibrium term becomes dominant close to the planet when it is in runaway gas accretion. In order to model the mass flux onto the planet, we have to consider different flow geometries of the gas in the gas feeding zone around the planet. We look at the outer flux ˙ M O at R O = R p + 1/2R out and the inner flux ˙ M I at R I = R p − 1/2R out . Here, R p is the orbital distance of the planet, and R out is its gas capture radius which is given in Eq. 14.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Flow geometries</head><p>Four different flow geometries have to be considered, where we count a mass flux towards the star as positive. First we can have a situation where both ˙ M O and ˙ M I are positive. This is the regular situation. It takes place when the planet is inside the radius of maximum viscous couple R MVC (or radius of velocity reversal) At R MVC , the flow in the disk changes from inward accretion to outward spreading. Second, we can have a situation where both ˙ M O and ˙ M I are negative. This is the case if the planet is outside R MVC . The third case occurs when the planet is exactly at R MVC . Then, decretion on both sides happens. This could in principle mean that only a very small amount of gas can be delivered to the planet. But since we take into account the local reservoir of gas (Sect. 4.2), this regime has no practical meaning. The fourth flow geometry occurs when gas flows towards the planet from both sides. This regime occurs due the sucking action of the protoplanet at the beginning of runaway gas accretion, and then again near the end of the disk lifetime, when the global fluxes through the disk are small.</p><p>For these four geometries, the flow limited maximal gas accretion rate ˙ M XY,max,F are calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">˙ M XY,max,F =                ˙ M O for R p &lt; R MVC ˙ M I for R p &gt; R MVC Abs ˙ M I − ˙ M O for R p = R MVC Abs ˙ M I + ˙ M O for two sided accretion.<label>(26)</label></formula><p>For the first two cases, we have assumed that the planet migrates slower than the gas flows. This is due to the fact that planets which are in gas runaway accretion typically are also in the planet-dominated type II migration regime, where this condition is fulfilled. For the third case, we consider the net flux, and for the last case, the sum of both fluxes is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Local reservoir</head><p>A local reservoir of gas which is already in the vicinity of the planet can be accreted at a rate larger than ˙ M XY,max,F , at least for some time. This is relevant at the moment when the planet just passes into runaway gas accretion. Such a higher accretion rate is important for the depth of the so-called "planetary desert" (Ida &amp; Lin 2004): The higher the possible accretion rates, the lower the number of planets of intermediate masses (ca. 10-100 M ⊕ , see the discussions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mordasini et al. 2009a and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Mordasini et al. 2011b</ref>).</p><p>In order to calculate the accretion rate allowed by the local reservoir we use an approach directly based on the local gas surface density, and not on the fluxes. Following D <ref type="bibr">'Angelo &amp; Lubow (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zhou &amp; Lin (2007)</ref>, we assume a spherical, homogenous, unimpeded accretion flow for a planet with a cross section σ cross in a gas of density ρ ≈ Σ/H (taken as the mean over the gas feeding zone) and a relative velocity v rel ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">˙ M XY,max,R = ρσ cross v rel .<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Gas is captured at some radius R gc so that σ cross ≈ πR 2 gc . For simplicity, we set R gc equal to the radius defined in Eq. 14. The relative velocity is approximately given as v rel ≈ R gc Ω. Therefore, the gas accretion rate in runaway, limited by the local reservoir ˙ M XY,max,R is approximately given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">˙ M XY,max,R ≈ Σ H ΩR 3 gc .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>As shown by D' <ref type="bibr">Angelo &amp; Lubow (2008)</ref>, such a simple description of the gas accretion rate is in fairly good agreement with results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. It is, however, strictly speaking only valid in the intermediate phase where the planet's Hill sphere R H is still smaller than the disk scale height H. The accretion flow is no more spherical and homogenous once the planet has grown so massive that R H &gt; H. Instead it has a more complex geometry due to the tidal interaction of the planet and the disk, leading to gap formation and accretion streamers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zhou &amp; Lin 2007)</ref>. However, we find that ˙ M XY,max,R is larger than ˙ M XY,max,F and, therefore, the relevant quantity only during an intermediate phase just after the start of the disk-limited gas accretion phase (as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 below)</ref>. In this phase, planets have typically still masses so small that R H &lt; H, so that the simple prescription is valid.</p><p>The final accretion rate in runaway is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">˙ M XY,max = k lub Max ˙ M XY,max,R , ˙ M XY,max,F<label>(29)</label></formula><p>where we have introduced a factor k lub which takes into account that some gas flows past the planet. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lubow &amp; D'Angelo (2006)</ref> we use values of k lub of 0.75 to 0.9. Finally, we also make sure that not more gas is accreted than the amount present in the feeding zone M feed , i.e. that ˙ M XY,max &lt; M feed /dt, which is however found to be automatically fulfilled with the above equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Example for the disk-limited gas accretion rate</head><p>To illustrate the calculation of the gas accretion rate in runaway described in the last section, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> an example. The figure shows gas accretion rates of a growing giant planet, and accretion rates in the disk during the phase where the planet starts gas runaway accretion. The planet is at about 10 AU in a gas and solid rich disk. The parameter k lub is set to 0.9, and the viscosity parameter α in the disk is 0.007.</p><p>The thick solid black line shows the accretion rate of the planet ˙ M XY . The thin solid black line shows the disk-limited accretion rate, ˙ M XY,max . Shortly after 1.33 Myr, the accretion rate found by the solution of the structure equations ˙ M Tkh increases very rapidly, so that shortly afterwards, the disk-limited rate is reached. In this phase, ˙ M XY,max is given as k lub ˙ M XY,max,R . This is because ˙ M XY,max,R (shown by the magenta dashed-dotted line) is larger than ˙ M XY,max,F (shown by the red dotted line). We thus find that the local reservoir allows for some time for an accretion rate higher than given by the viscous rate, namely about 0.03 M ⊕ /yr. A typical peak accretion rate of a few times 10 −2 M ⊕ /yr has also been found in other studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. 2009</ref>). Later on, however, (starting at about 1.35 Myrs), we note that both ˙ M XY,max,R and ˙ M XY,max,F converge on approximately the same value. Also M feed /dt (cyan long-dashed-dotted line) takes then approximately the same value.</p><p>From the curves showing the mass flux inside and outside of the planet, ˙ M I (blue dashed line) and ˙ M O (green longdashed line), we can also deduce in which flow geometry we are. Initially, both fluxes are positive, which means that we are in the standard case where the planet is inside of the radius of maximum viscous couple R MVC , and the disk is globally flowing towards the star. At about 1.325 Myrs however, we see that ˙ M I becomes negative, meaning that the flow geometry changes into the "two sided accretion" case. This is a consequence of the accretion onto the planet at a rate higher than the viscous one. Later on (at about 1.6 Myrs, not shown in the figure) the flow geometry changes back into the standard geometry, and ˙ M I is then about ten times smaller than ˙ M O . This corresponds to the 10% of gas that are allowed to flow past the planet. Now, a new equilibrium has established, with the planet acting as an additional sink.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>We address three different subjects: First, we present a combined formation and evolution calculation for a Jovian mass planet at 5.2 AU. We show the evolution of the most important observable quantities like the mass, radius and luminosity, but also the evolution of the central temperature and pressure. The calculation can be compared with the calculations of, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bodenheimer et al.

Second, we compare the planetary mass-radius relation for giant planets (see also Paper II) and the influence of the core mass on the radius as found in our model with several other studies. Third, we use our model to study the luminosities of young Jupiters. The results for "cold starts" can be compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al.

These simulations are strongly simplified in comparison to the calculations performed for the complete populations synthesis models <ref type="bibr">(Paper II)</ref>: In the full model, the moment of the onset of limited gas accretion (and thus the detachment from the nebula), the disk-limited runaway gas accretion rates (Sect. 4), as well as the final mass of the planet result in a self-consistent way from the evolution of the gaseous disk ( ). Here, the evolution of the disk is switched off. Instead, we fix the maximal allowed ˙ M XY to some prespecified value, and artificially switch off accretion on a short timescale when the mass of the planet approaches the desired value. Also migration is completely switched off, which is otherwise a central component of the formation model as it can lead to much more complex accretion histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Mordasini et al. 2009a</ref>). But in this way we allow for direct comparison with numerous previous works which used similar assumptions as, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Grain opacity reduction factor f opa</head><p>A new parameter in our models is the reduction factor of the grain opacity in the envelope relative to the ISM grain opacity, f opa . We have determined this factor in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Mordasini et al. (2012c)</ref> in the following way: <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. (2010)</ref> coupled for the first time self-consistently a giant planet formation simulation with the concurrent calculation of the grain growth and settling inside the planet's gaseous envelope. They found very low resulting effective opacities, and thus very short durations of the (plateau) phase II ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>). Such grain evolution calculations are currently beyond the scope of our model, also because they are computationally extremely expensive. But to still get an approximative representation of this important effect, we have, for different values of f opa , and the three planetesimal surface densities considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. (2010)</ref>, compared the duration of the phase II as found in our model, with the duration found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. (2010)</ref>. There is a a very clear relationship between f opa , the planetesimal surface density, and the duration of phase II. We have found that on the mean (for the three planetesimal surface densities), the duration of phase II becomes the same in both models if we reduce the interstellar grain opacities by a factor 0.003. This is a strong reduction, which is even clearly smaller than the previously studied "low opacity case" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) which arbitrarily assumed a f opa = 0.02. Note the following two points: First, it is clear that already the calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Jovian mass planet at 5.2 AU</head><p>For this simulations, we use the same initial planetesimal surface density, disk pressure and temperature as <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al.

The luminosity is calculated as in the "cold start" assumption, i.e. we assume that the shock luminosity does not contribute at all to the luminosity inside the planetary structure. The formation of Jupiter is of particular importance as a benchmark for any planet formation model. This is because for no other giant planet an equally high number of detailed observational constraints exist. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A</ref>.1 in the appendix we list the most important quantities characterizing the planet like the total mass, core mass or luminosity at particular, important moments in time.

This duration is in good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. (2010)</ref>. The crossover mass is M cr = 16.3M ⊕ . This is in very good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> with M cr =16.2M ⊕ or <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hubickyj et al. (2005)</ref> who obtained M cr =16.1M ⊕ for the same initial planetesimal surface density.</p><p>Shortly after the crossover point, the gas accretion rate increases strongly because of beginning runaway accretion, so that it hits the maximal allowed value of 10 −2 M ⊕ /yr at t=0.923 Myrs. The total mass of the planet is then 86.7 M ⊕ , and τ KH is as short as ∼1640 yrs. At this moment, the second detached phase begins and the collapse of the envelope starts, which is in fact a rapid, but still hydrostatic contraction as discussed in section 3.3 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986)</ref>. This phase is indicated with the label D in the plot.</p><p>At a high gas accretion rate of 0.01 M ⊕ /yr, a mass of 1M is approached quickly, so that at 0.935 Myrs we start to artificially ramp down the accretion rates (see top left panel of <ref type="figure">Fig.  2</ref>). Shortly afterwards, at about 0.961 Myrs, the final mass of the planet is almost reached (99.5% of the final mass). This marks the beginning of the evolutionary phase, labelled with an E. Note that the accretion rate of planetesimals also increases strongly during the runaway phase because of the fast expansions of the planet's feeding zone. It reaches a maximum of about 7 × 10 −4 M ⊕ /yr and then starts to decrease already before we ramp it down artificially 3 . This is due to the fact that ejection of planetesimals becomes increasingly important as the mass of the planet grows (see ), and because the capture radius of the planet shrinks (bottom left panel). The final core mass that is obtained is therefore very similar to the one that is found without stopping the accretion artificially, as becomes clear when looking at <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.</p><p>The final total mass of the planet is 316.6 M ⊕ , while the final mass of the core is 32.9 M ⊕ . In this paper, we assume that all accreted planetesimals can reach the core. In reality, once the envelope has grown above a certain mass (about 1-2 M ⊕ for 100 km planetesimals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mordasini et al. 2005</ref>), planetesimals cannot penetrate any more to the core of the planet but get destroyed in the envelope. Therefore, the 32.9 M ⊕ value should rather be associated with the total mass of heavy elements contained in the planet than the core mass.</p><p>The theoretical estimates for the actual core and total heavy element mass in Jupiter vary. Among other factors, especially uncertainties in the EOS of hydrogen and helium (but also in the efficiency of convection) introduce considerable difficulty in an exact determination of the enrichment. Based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Saumon &amp; Guillot (2004)</ref>, the total heavy element mass was estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Guillot &amp; Gautier (2009)</ref> to lie between 10 to 42 M ⊕ . Besides classical equations of state like the EOS SCvH which are based on the free energy minimization method, in the past few years EOS based on ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations have become available. The results for the <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Simulation of the in situ formation of Jupiter at 5.2 AU.

The top left panel shows the evolution of the core mass (red solid line), the envelope mass (green dotted line) and the total mass (blue dashed line). The top right panel shows the accretion rate of solids ˙ M Z (red solid line) and of gas ˙ M XY (green dotted line). The limiting gas accretion rate is fixed to 10 −2 M ⊕ /yr. The bottom left panel shows the evolution of the core radius R core (red solid line), the total radius R (blue dashed line) and the capture radius for planetesimals R capt (green dotted line). The bottom right panel shows the luminosity of the planet in present day intrinsic luminosities of Jupiter (L =8.7×10 −10 L ). The red solid line is the total luminosity L, the blue dashed line is the internal luminosity L int and the green dotted line is the core luminosity L core . core and total heavy element mass of Jupiter derived from this method, however, vary: Militzer et al. (2008) find a massive core of M core = 16±2M ⊕ and M Z = 20±4M ⊕ , which is quite different from the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Nettelmann et al. (2012)</ref> of M core = 0 − 8M ⊕ and M Z = 28 − 32M ⊕ . Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Leconte &amp; Chabrier (2012)</ref> who use again EOS SCvH, but allow for semiconvection due to stabilizing compositional gradients, find high M Z = 41 − 63M ⊕ as the interiors are hotter. These results demonstrate that the investigations regarding the composition of Jupiter have not yet settled on a definitive conclusion.</p><p>In our model, the accretion of the core occurs in two steps: about 10-15 M ⊕ are accreted in phase I and phase II, while the rest is accreted in the gas runaway accretion phase. Then, the mass of the envelope is already high, and planetesimals should be destroyed in the envelope. Therefore, we can estimate that the actual core mass should rather be of order 12 M ⊕ (this is when the envelope mass reaches 2 M ⊕ ), while the remaining 21 M ⊕ of metals should be dissolved in the envelope, unless they sink to the core-envelope interface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Formation phase: Radius</head><p>The bottom left panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows the evolution of the total radius, the core radius and the capture radius. The total radius is initially (during the attached stage) very large, as it is approximately equal to one third of the Hill sphere radius. When the limiting gas accretion rate is hit, the planet detaches from the nebula and collapses to a radius of initially about 2 to 3 Jovian radii. The shape of the curve showing the total radius is very similar to that found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>The capture radius (which is found by integrating the orbits of planetesimals inside the envelope, see ) is during phase II much larger than the core radius, namely by a factor between ∼10 and 60. This is very important for the core growth, as the capture radius enters quadratically into the growth rate. After the envelope has started to collapse, R capt becomes equal or slightly less than the total radius. This is due to the fact that in the collapse the envelope structure becomes much more compact. Before the collapse, it is characterized by very large scale heights of thousands to several ten thousands of kilometers, where planetesimals get captured in a soft catch. Durning the collapse the planet develops a well defined surface (i.e. a much smaller scale height near the surface) at which planetesimals are captured.</p><p>Looking at the core radius, we note that in the gas runaway accretion phase when the planet grows very quickly in mass, it first increases a bit in size, but then decreases, even though the core grows in this phase by about 20 M ⊕ . The reason is that the external pressure on the core by the accreted gas increases so much that the resulting strong increase of the core density over-compensates the mass increase (see Paper II for a dedicated discussion).</p><p>The bottom right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows the core luminosity L core , the total luminosity L and the luminosity within the planetary structure L int . The difference L − L int is thus the shock/accretion luminosity L acc . The first peak in the curve is due to the rapid accretion of the core, and the second to the combined effects of runaway gas accretion and envelope collapse. During the second peak, for about 2 × 10 4 years, the accretional luminosity is larger than L int by up to a factor ∼3. For more massive planets discussed below, this ratio can become much larger. The second luminosity maximum occurs at 0.94 Myrs with L = 2.6×10 6 L corresponding to log(L/L ) = −2.65. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. (2009)</ref> find in their simulations with the same limiting gas accretion rate peak luminosities of about log(L/L ) = −2.35, which is similar to our value.</p><p>We note that the classical <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> picture with three well defined phases might not be a realistic formation scenario for Jupiter. Several factors including migration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alibert et al. 2004</ref>), a slower core growth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fortier et al. 2007</ref>) or the opening of a gap in the planetesimal disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Shiraishi &amp; Ida 2008)</ref> might suppress in particular phase II. We had two reasons for investigating the classical scenario: First, we want to compare our model with previous studies and second, we are primarily interested in the collapse and evolutionary phase which should be similar in modified scenarios. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the radius and luminosity of the planet as a function of time, now including the long-term evolution over Gigayears when the mass is constant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.4.">Central conditions</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, left panel we show various central conditions during both the formation and evolution phase. With "central" conditions we mean here the envelope-core boundary, and not the actual center of the planet.</p><p>The solid red line in the left panel shows the central temperature. It belongs to the scale on the left. Initially, the temperature at the bottom of the envelope is about 3000 K, rising to values between 10 000 and 20 000 K during phase II. When gas runaway accretion starts, and the envelope collapses, there is a sharp upturn of T cent . The maximal value of 69 700 K is reached at 0.98 Myrs, afterward it declines again. At an age of 4.6 Gyr, T cent has fallen to about 17 600 K, which is in good agreement with the estimates of Guillot (1999) ranging from 15 000 to 21 000 K.</p><p>The second quantity for which the scale is shown on the left is the central pressure, indicated by the black dotted line. It is found to have a value of 4317 GPa at the current age of the Solar System. Guillot (1999) gives a value of 4000 GPa.</p><p>The other two lines in the figure belong to the y-axis on the right. The green long-dashed line is the mean density of the core, while the blue dashed line is the gas density at the envelope-core boundary. As described in Paper II, the core consists of iron, followed by a silicate layer and finally an ice layer, with an ice fraction expected for a body forming outside the iceline. During phase II, ρ core lies between 3 and 4 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . This is close to the typically assumed constant value of 3.2 g/cm 3 in other formation calculations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Movshovitz et al. 2010</ref>). During the collapse, the external pressure exerted onto the core increases dramatically, so that the the core density increases to about 10 g/cm 3 , leading to the mentioned shrinking of the core size, despite its growth in mass. At 4.6 Gyr, we find ρ core = 14.3 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The central gas density quantitatively follows a similar pattern, starting of course at a smaller value of about 0.1 g/cm 3 during phase II. At 4.6 Gyr is has reached a fluid like density of about 4 g/cm 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.5.">Surface conditions</head><p>The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> shows the conditions at the surface of the planet. The solid red line is the surface temperature T surf calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">T 4 surf = T 4 + L acc 4πσR 2 ,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where T is defined in Eq. 20. It thus contains the contributions from the intrinsic luminosity, the accretional luminosity which is however important only for a short period (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> bottom right panel) and the absorbed stellar light. When the accretional luminosity is negligible, T surf = T , which is the temperature used as the outer boundary condition for the structure. When both L int and L acc are negligible, T surf = (1 − A)T equi . This happens for a Jovian planet at 5.2 AU after 10 Gyrs when the intrinsic luminosity of the planet becomes small compared to the incident stellar flux. The background temperature is indicated by the black dotted line. The background temperature during the attached and detached phase is equal to the (constant) nebula temperature T neb = 150 K, while in the evolutionary phase, it is given by the equilibrium temperature with stellar irradiation T equi at 5.2 AU (Eq. 22). The two temperatures belong to the left scale. One finds that in phase I, T surf can become about a factor 2.5 larger than T neb , as L is quite large in this phase. In phase II, T surf ≈ T neb , in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Papaloizou &amp; Nelson (2005)</ref>. During the collapse, there is a strong increase of T surf , which reaches a maximal value of 2050 K. At the moment the final mass is reached, T surf ≈ 1350 K. At the current age of Jupiter, T surf = 126 K, while the measured value is about 124 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Guillot &amp; Gautier 2009)</ref>. We see that at late times, the decrease of T surf starts to flatten out as it approaches the constant value of (1 − A)T equi . In the figure the dashed-dotted red line is (L int /(4πσR 2 )) 1/4 i.e. the temperature due to the intrinsic flux only. This quantity continues to fall. Note that the nomenclature for the different temperatures is unfortunately not homogenous in the literature: Our quantity T surf corresponds during the evolutionary phase to T therm according to the definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref>, but to T eff in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann (2010)</ref>. In addition, we show the pressure P at the surface of the planet. This curve belongs to the right axis. During the attached phase, it is simply equal to the (constant) nebula pressure <ref type="bibr">(Eq. 14)</ref>. Then, at the moment that the planet detaches, P increases as P edd = 2/3 g/κ becomes large. The dynamic/ram pressure ρv 2 also contributes to P in this phase <ref type="bibr">(Eq. 19)</ref>. The ram pressure remains however always 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than P edd which is related to the low grain opacity (Sect. 3.8.2). At late times, after the accretion is over, we see that P has a peculiar shape which is given by opacity transitions. At 4.6 Gyr, the pressure is about 0.18 bars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.6.">Atmospheric pressure-temperature profile</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> we show the pressure as a function of temperature for the uppermost part of the planet down to a pressure of 1 kbar at different moments in time. The evolutionary sequence starts at the first structure (at the right) at a time of 1 Myr (i.e. shortly after the planet has reached the final mass), while the last structure (at the left) corresponds to 4.6 Gyr. Structures are shown at irregular intervals between these times. We recall that the surface of the planet and thus the upper end of the lines corresponds to the τ = 2/3 surface. During the evolutionary sequence, the radius of the planet shrinks from 2.36 to 0.99 R , which causes an increase of the gravitational acceleration g from 444 at the beginning to 2546 cm/s 2 at 4.6 Gyrs. In the figure, the thick black lines indicate radiative zones, while the blue dotted line shows the p − T structure measured by the Galileo probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lodders &amp; Fegley 1998</ref>). We find a very good agreement.</p><p>The figure can be approximately compared with <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref>. These authors use non-gray atmospheres, but indicate the location which corresponds to our outer surface. One must also take into account that they keep the gravity at a constant value of 2200 cm/s 2 so that we cannot expect to see identical results, especially at early times. But a comparison shows that the two p−T profiles nevertheless have a similar general structure. In both works, there exists for example a detached radiative zone at temperatures around 1500 K.</p><p>In summary we see from the in situ formation and evolution calculation for Jupiter that our combined formation and evolution model, despite the simplifications, leads to a planet with basic properties in very good agreement with the most impor- tant observational constraints coming from Jupiter, and that the new simple method to calculate evolutionary sequences leads to equivalent results as the traditional entropy based method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Radii</head><p>We now generalize the results from the last chapter concerning the radius and study the radii of giant planets of different masses and of different compositions. The goal is to validate our model by comparison with existing work (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">or Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>We do this by performing the same combined formation and evolution calculations as shown for Jupiter, with the only difference that we vary the initial planetesimal surface density (which will eventually lead to different core masses) and the moment when we terminate the gas accretion, so that we get different total masses. Otherwise, the calculations are identical, which means for example that our calculations apply for planets at a distance of 5.2 AU from a solar like star.</p><p>Such calculations are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. The plot shows for planets of final masses of 0.15, 1, 2, 5 and 10 M the total and core mass as a function of time. The lines for the 1 Jupiter mass planet are the same as in Sect. 6. The gas accretion rate in runaway is 0.01 M ⊕ /yr in all cases. Therefore, more massive planets reach their final mass later. It is interesting to note that all planets have a final core mass of about 33 M ⊕ , except for the lowest mass planet (total mass 0.14M = 44.5M ⊕ ) which has a core of about 18 Earth masses. The lower core mass in this case is due to the fact that for this planet, gas and solid accretion are (externally) ramped down before it reaches the gas runaway phase. The nearly identical core mass of all other planets is in contrast not externally imposed. It is rather a natural consequence of the decrease of the capture radius at the moment when the planet collapses (which happens always at the same mass, independent of the final mass) and the ejection of planetesimals which becomes important as the planet grows in mass (Sect. 6.2.1). <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Total mass (solid lines) and core mass (dotted lines) as a function of time for planets with final masses of 0.14, 1, 2, 5 and 10 M . For the lowest mass planet we shut down accretion before it passes into the runaway gas accretion regime. Note that the four more massive planets have a nearly identical core mass, which is not externally imposed, but a natural consequence of the decrease of the capture radius and the increase of planetesimal ejection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> shows the internal pressure-temperature structure of these planets (plus also of a 20 M planet) at an age of 4 to 5 Gyrs. The left end of the lines corresponds to the surface of the planet, while the right end corresponds to the envelope-core interface. The 0.14 M planet has near the surface a significant radiative zone. Otherwise the planets are nearly fully convective, and characterized by a single adiabat. Near a pressure of about 1 Mbar we see a change in slope which comes from the molecular to metallic transition of hydrogen, also visible in a similar figure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Guillot &amp; Gautier (2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Mass-radius relation</head><p>The mass-radius relation of (giant) planets has been studied for a long time (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter 1969)</ref>. The interest in the relation lies in its connection to the composition of the planet and the state of matter in its interior. For recent reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chabrier et al. (2009)</ref> or .</p><p>The general result qualitatively already found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zapolsky &amp; Salpeter (1969)</ref> is that the M-R relationship in the giant planet regime is characterized by a local maximum in R. This behavior can be understand with polytropic models with a polytropic index that increases with mass. This change is in turn due to the increasing importance of degeneracy pressure of electrons relative to the classical coulomb contribution of ions with planet mass (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chabrier et al. 2009)</ref>. Another general result is that the radius of giant planets decreases with core mass and increases with proximity to the star (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> we show the mass-radius relation for planets with masses between 0.14 and 20 M . This are the same models as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6 and 7</ref>. Except for the lowest mass planet with a core of about 18 M ⊕ , the core mass is approximately 33 M ⊕ . The radii are shown at 0.1, 1, 4.6 and 10 Gyrs. The planets were calculated using the cold start assumption, which however plays only a role at t = 0.1 Gyrs and for planets more massive than 5 M . In the top right corner of the figure we show with the magenta dotted line the radius for simulations performed with the "hot start (accreting)" scenario. The radii are as expected larger, by about 0.07R for the most massive planet. For all other cases the imprint of the formation is lost by ∼0.1 Gyrs, and the radii are virtually identical. The radii decrease with time, as expected. At all times, there is a maximum of the radius at a mass of about 3-5 M , in agreement with e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chabrier et al. (2009)</ref> or . For comparison, we also show the results from a more detailed model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>. The very light blue dotted lines show the radius as found by them at an age of 4.5 Gyrs for planets with a core of 25 M ⊕ (and thus similar as here) at orbital distances of 1 AU (upper line) and 9.5 AU (lower line). We see that these lines bracket our red line at almost all masses, which is exactly what we expect when the two models yield very similar results. Only for the most massive planets 10M we see that our models yields slightly larger radii, by a few 0.01 R . Also the lowest mass planet has in our simulations a somewhat larger radius than the counterpart in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>. This is however not a surprise as it has a smaller core by about 6 M ⊕ , which is relevant due to the small total mass of about 44 M ⊕ (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Influence of the core mass</head><p>The fact that a more massive core for a given total mass leads to a smaller radius has important implications for the study of planets. It allows us for example (within certain limits) to infer <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Radius of giant planets as a function of mass, for different moments in time. The lines correspond from top to bottom to t=0.1 (magenta, long-dashed), 1 (blue, dashed-dotted), 4.6 (red, solid) and 10 Gyrs (green, short-dashed). All planets are at 5.2 AU from the sun, and have a core of 33M ⊕ except for the 0.14 M planet which has a core of about 18 M ⊕ . The two dotted, very light blue lines show the result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> for planets with cores equal 25 M ⊕ at 1 AU (upper line) and at 9.5 AU (lower line), at 4.5 Gyrs. The dotted branch of the magenta line in the top right corner shows the result for "hot start (accreting)" simulations. Otherwise the radii are virtually identical for the "hot" and "cold start" scenario at these late times. the bulk composition of transiting extrasolar planets, which in turn constrains formation models (see Paper II). It is for example clear that giant planets formed by the core accretion mechanism must be enriched in heavy elements like it is also the case for Jupiter. For the competing formation model, the disk instability model, the situation is in contrast less clear ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Boley et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Another important application is to connect the inferred core masses of transiting extrasolar planet with their formation environment. In this context, it was found that the core mass of giant planets and the metallicity of their host star is positively correlated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Guillot et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>). This is reproduced by planet population synthesis calculations based on the core accretion paradigm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mordasini et al. 2009b</ref>). Recent findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Miller &amp; Fortney 2011</ref>) even indicate that all transiting giant planets contain a minimum amount of 10-15 M ⊕ of metals, as predicted earlier by the core accretion mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mordasini et al. 2011c</ref>).</p><p>It is therefore important to study the dependence of the total radius on the core mass and to compare this with previous studies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref> shows the radius as a function of core mass for planets with a total mass of 1 M . The red solid line shows the result from this work for five planets at an age of 4.6 Gyrs. We see that for an increase of the core mass from ∼ 10 to ∼ 50 M ⊕ , there is a reduction of the radius by about 0.07 R . We also show the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref>. Our result for a = 5.2 AU are located between the curves for An interesting aspect of the combined formation and evolution calculations is that we can directly relate the radius (respectively the core mass) with the initial surface density of planetesimal during formation, which is not possible for purely evolutionary models. In the current case, the five different core masses correspond to planetesimal surface densities of 3.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 g/cm 2 . We must however take into account that there is no unique mapping between planetesimal surface density and core mass, as other factors like migration or the distance where the planet forms also influence this quantity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Comparison and limitations</head><p>We conclude from the different comparisons that our upgraded model allows to get evolutionary sequences and thus radii with very good accuracy starting with self-consistent initial conditions.</p><p>It is however also clear that we have mostly addressed relatively "simple" cases of massive, gas-dominated planets at large distances from the star. Already in the solar systems, there are planets which could not be very accurately modeled with a simple model as used here: It is for example well known that for Saturn, He demixing and settling is necessary to explain the measured luminosity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hubbard et al. 1999</ref>). We must also expect that for low-mass, core-dominated planets, possibly with strongly enriched envelopes, we would get less accurate cooling curves and radii, as we do not model the thermodynamics of the core, assume that all solids are in the core (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2008</ref>), and also ignore effects of the composition on the opacity. Other limitations apply for strongly irradiated planets. These effects will be added in later modifications of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Luminosities</head><p>The other fundamental observable quantity apart from the radius which we obtain from our upgraded model is the planetary luminosity. It is obviously central for direct imaging observations. For transits observations, the discovery of giant planets with radii much larger than expected from standard internal structure modeling was a surprise. Regarding the direct imaging technique, there is on theoretical grounds an open question, too: what is the luminosity of young Jupiters? Currently, two classes of models are discussed in the literature: "hot start" models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. 2003)</ref>, and "cold start" models" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fortney et al. 2005</ref>). In the "hot start" model, one assumes as the initial state an already fully formed planet at an (arbitrarily) high entropy state, and thus a large radius and luminosity. In the "cold start" scenario one assumes that the planet is gradually built up by accretion of gas through an accretion shock on the surface of the planet. The radiative losses of the liberated gravitational energy at the shock lead to a lower entropy, and thus lower luminosity and radius.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Relationship of cold/hot start and core accretion/gravitational instability</head><p>The importance of the two different initial states stems from the fact that the luminosity of young planets is an observable quantity establishing links to the physical mechanisms occurring during the formation. The currently known directly imaged planets seem to be incompatible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Marley et al. 2012</ref>) with the "cold start" model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref>, since the observed temperatures and luminosities are higher than predicted by this model. It should be kept in mind that the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> studies the limiting case of a shock that is 100% efficient in radiating away the accretional energy (and makes a number of assumptions concerning the formation process, cf. below). This limiting case is studied as detailed, possibly multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculations of the shock properties have not yet been conducted. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> have therefore studied a broad range of intermediate "warm-start" models showing that this leads to significant differences in the brightness of the planets depending on the mass and spectral band. The related question about the initial thermodynamic state of newly formed brown dwarfs and stellar objects has been studied in various works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prialnik &amp; Livio 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Hartmann et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Commerçon et al. 2011</ref>). These studies indicate that depending on the fraction of accretion luminosity radiated away or absorbed by the protostar, the formation through gravitational collapse can lead to bright, extended objects ("hot accretion" leading to a "hot start") or faint and compact objects ("cold accretion" leading to a "cold start"). The latter is the case if the accretion shock during the formation process is supercritical, i.e. if all the accretion shock energy is radiated away, as found recently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Commerçon et al. (2011)</ref> for accretion on the first Larson core.</p><p>For giant planets, two formation mechanisms are currently discussed. If a "cold" or "hot start" can preferentially be associated with one of the two formation mechanisms, then the understanding of the luminosity of young Jupiters has important implications for the understanding of giant planet formation as a whole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.1.">Core accretion</head><p>The first proposed formation mechanism is core accretion, which is the paradigm underlying this work. A number of observational findings indicate that core accretion represents the dominant formation mechanism at least for planets inside a few AU (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mordasini et al. 2012a</ref>). Whether core accretion can also explain the directly imaged, massive planets at orbital distances 10 AU is the subject of an ongoing debate (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kratter et al. 2010</ref>). The core accretion, "cold accretion" simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> lead as mentioned to very low initial luminosities, incompatible with the observed values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Marley et al. 2012</ref>). We will however show in <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. (in prep.</ref>) that this result (found for a specific set of parameters during the formation process) does not mean that planets formed by core accretion in a "cold accretion" scenario must necessarily (for all reasonable parameters) have luminosities as low as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> (see also the recent calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, the results in the next two sections show that the formation of giant planets via core accretion, but with "hot accretion" leads to high initial luminosities which very quickly converge on the luminosity of classical "hot start" calculations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. 2003</ref>). We thus see that depending on currently ill constrained physical mechanisms occurring during the formation phase (in particular the nature of the accretion shock), the luminosity of planets formed by core accretion can probably vary significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2.">Gravitational instability</head><p>For the second formation mechanism, the gravitational instability (GI) model, the question about the associated luminosity might also be relatively complex as indicated by the explorative discussion in this section. More solid results are expected once multidimensional, radiation-hydrodynamic calculations following the entire formation by gravitational instability from the first instability in the disk to a compact planet at the final mass will become feasible.</p><p>In a qualitative way, we could expected that the postformation luminosity of planets formed by GI depends on the specific way these objects grow in mass: Hydrodynamic simulations show that the initial mass of the clump which becomes self-gravitationally unstable is typically 3-20 M (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Forgan &amp; Rice 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Helled &amp; Bodenheimer 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zhu et al. 2012</ref>). These masses roughly correspond to the ones expected analytically from the mass contained in the disk patch with a length scale similar to the most unstable mode. The objects that form at this stage are self-gravitating, relatively cold, extended objects. Their radius is comparable to the Hill sphere radius (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zhu et al. 2012</ref>). For example, a 10 M clump at 50 AU from a 1 M star which may represent a typical outcome (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson et al. 2011</ref>) has a Hill sphere radius of about 7.4 AU. These clumps consist of molecular hydrogen and, once formed, contract slowly (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Helled &amp; Bodenheimer 2011</ref>). In their nature they correspond to the first Larson core of star formation.</p><p>The mass contained in such an object has not gone through an accretion shock, since they form from the spontaneous selfgravitational binding of a extended part of the disk, typically within an over-dense spiral arm (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boley et al. 2010</ref>). We therefore expect that the specific entropy of the gas in the clump should be high. This is confirmed by numerical simulations: T. Hayfield (personal communication, 2012, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Galvagni et al. 2012</ref>) finds that the specific entropy in a clump taken from the radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boley et al. (2010)</ref> is about 15 k B /baryon at the moment when the clump should undergo the second collapse (cf. below). If this is representative of the entropy of the final object, this corresponds to a "hottest start" <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref>. This allows to make a first supposition: If the final mass of a GI planet is the same (or similar) as the mass of the initially unstable clump (an approximation which is regularly made, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson et al. 2011</ref>), then we may expect that these objects have a "hot start", simply because there is no accretion shock involved during their formation.</p><p>However, since the clump necessarily forms in a massive disk, it appears more likely that the clump continues to accrete mass (in principle, gap formation can stop accretion, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zhu et al. 2012)</ref>. In this case, we have to distinguish two sub-scenarios. As the first core contracts quasi-statically, its interior heats up, until a central temperature of about 2000 K is reached. Then, molecular hydrogen dissociates, and a dynamical collapse of the entire clump occurs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bodenheimer et al. 1980</ref>). This correspond to the formation of the second core in star formation. The timescale until this second collapse occurs is estimated to be roughly 10 3 to 10 4 years, with more massive clumps collapsing earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Helled &amp; Bodenheimer 2011</ref>).</p><p>In the first sub-scenario the clump grows to its final mass predominately before it collapses. Accretion in this phase is efficient, since the cross section is approximately given by the large Hill sphere radius. This results in high to very high accretion rates of 10 −7 to 10 −4 M /yr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boley et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zhu et al. 2012</ref>). The object therefore may grow quickly out of the planetary mass regime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kratter et al. 2010</ref>). Independently of this issue, for the "hot" vs. "cold accretion" question, it is relevant in which way the gas is incorporated into the clump, in particular if it is accreted via a supercritical shock. The escape speed from the Hill sphere of a 10 M object at 50 AU is about 1.5 km/s. For comparison, in the calculation of the accretion onto the first (stellar) core in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Commerçon et al. (2011)</ref>, the shock velocity is about 2.4 km/s, which is comparable. Because we are in a shearing disk, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boley et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zhu et al. (2012)</ref> however find that the relevant velocity with which they can reproduce the numerically obtained accretion rates is not the free fall velocity, but the Keplerian shear velocity across the Hill sphere. The velocity with which the newly accreted matter joins the clump is thus of order ΩR H where Ω is the Keplerian frequency. In the example, this corresponds to about 0.6 km/s. Whether or not this is sufficient to produce a supercritical shock must be evaluated for realistic velocities, pre-shock densities and temperatures. If it is not, as we may suspect due to the rather low velocity, then the material accreted in this phase should be added at a high specific entropy. This leads to the second supposition: If a GI planet accretes most of its final mass before it undergoes the second collapse, and the accretion onto the AU sized clump is relatively gentle, we may again expect a "hot start".</p><p>In the second sub-scenario, the clump accretes most of its final mass after it has undergone the second collapse which leads to an object with a size of a few Jovian radii <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Helled &amp; Bodenheimer 2011</ref>). Now, the accreted gas hits the protoplanet at a much higher velocity of several 10 km/s as in the runaway gas accretion phase in the core accretion scenario. This leads to the third supposition: The larger the fraction of the final mass in a GI planet accreted after the clump has undergone the second collapse, the "colder" it should be, provided that the accretion shock in the post-collapse phase is supercritical. The effect that the higher the fraction of the final mass processed through the shock, the lower the initial luminosity, is seen in the simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marley et al. (2007)</ref> where it causes more massive planets to be less luminous than their lighter counterparts ("luminosity inversion").</p><p>This discussion (see also the related discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012)</ref> shows that with the currently limited knowledge both about the specific way matter is accreted, and the involved thermodynamics in general, it is difficult to firmly associate a "hot/cold start" with a specific formation mechanism. Some of the general trends for the impact of formation on the initial luminosity of core accretion planets will be presented in a dedicated paper <ref type="bibr">(Mordasini et al. in prep.</ref>).</p></div>

It is however clear that the precise shape of L(t) (there is for example a small bump in our cooling curves when log L/L ≈ −6.25) depends directly on the opacities, so that we expect that our predictions are somewhat less accurate during the long-term evolution. One sees that the assumption of no radiative losses at the shock, but still a gradual building up of the planet (as in our simulations) leads to very similar results as the classical "hot start" scenario where one starts with a fully formed planet. The physical reason for the similarity is that in both cases, no entropy sink exists, and that the resulting short Kelvin-Helmholtz timescales make that the initial conditions are quickly "forgotten" in a rapid convergent evolution, as discussed at the end of this section.

(2007)</ref>, because we see that the shock structure has an influence which is as important as the formation mechanism. Progress on the shock structure is an important task for future studies (see <ref type="bibr">Commerçont et al. 2011</ref> for a recent study of the stellar case).</p><p>Note that the assumption of dl/dr = 0 in the envelope for the "hot start" scenario could lead to significant departures from the actual interior structure and the associated luminosity of the planets during the gas runaway accretion phase. This is due to the fact that we cannot catch the effects of a possible deep radiative zone, as discussed in Sect. 3.6. This would also affect the luminosities at the beginning of the evolutionary phase i.e. just after the end of formation.</p><p>The comparison of the luminosity at this moment as found in our simulations, and as assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> indicates that we have luminosities which are similar (for the 10M case) or higher (for lower masses). A higher luminosity means that the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale is very short, so that the models converge on a timescale of only 10 5 −10 6 yrs. Such a rapid convergence of "hot start" and "hotter start" models has been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baraffe et al. (2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al.

The effect of a variable luminosity on "hot start" objects, calculated as described in Sect. 3.4.1, will be studied in future work. This should allow to better describe the properties of very young "hot start" objects.</p></div>

The picture is somewhat complicated by the fact that the low-mass planets start with the highest L but also cool the quickest, as their KH-timescale GM 2 /(RL) is the shortest. The reason for the "luminosity inversion" is that the higher the total mass, the higher the fraction of gas in the envelope that has been process through the entropyreducing shock. The total mass of the planets at the moment when they start to collapse is about 87 M ⊕ , with a core mass of 22 M ⊕ and an envelope of 65 M ⊕ (cf. Table A.2). This is equal for all planets (their evolution is identical up to the point where for the lower mass planets, accretion is shut off). This means that for a 1M planet, about 20% of its final envelope mass is accreted in the attached phase, and thus without going through the entropy-reducing shock. The ratio is proportionally smaller for higher mass planets, leading to the inversion.</p><p>Another identical result is that the higher the mass, the longer it takes until "hot start" and "cold start" luminosities become equal, a result that can be understood from the KH-timescales.

In a companion paper we describe further extensions and improvements relevant during the evolution of the planets, like an internal structure model for the solid core assuming a differentiated planet which gives realistic radii also for planets without significant atmospheres, or the radiogenic luminosity of the planet's mantle.

We must assume that our cooling curves are probably less accurate for lowmass, core-dominated planets, possibly with heavily enriched envelopes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Conclusion</head><p>In earlier versions of the model, we calculated the internal structure of the gaseous envelope only during the attached, pre-gas runaway accretion phase. This is sufficient if one is only interested in the final mass of the planets, and thus sufficient for comparisons with planets found by the radial velocity method. Now we calculate the structure also during the gas runaway accretion phase (which is also the phase when the planet's radius collapses) and during the evolutionary phase at constant mass over Gigayear timescales. With that we now know all major quantities (mass, semimajor axis, radius, luminosity, composition) characterizing the planets during their entire formation and evolution. This allows to compare our population synthesis models directly and consistently with results coming from all major observational techniques used to detect and characterize extrasolar planets (see Paper II for a comparison of the synthetic and actual mass-radius relationship, the predicted distribution of radii, and the comparison with Kepler).</p><p>Extrasolar planet research has entered an era in which massive amounts of observational data regarding very different subpopulations of planets are brought to us from different techniques. They should all be explained consistently by planet formation and evolution theory, but it is a difficult task to unite the different elements and observational constraints into one consistent global picture.</p><p>We think that a fruitful approach in this situation is to work with theoretical models able to make testable predictions in a consistent way for all important observational techniques. With the work presented in this paper we make a development in this direction, allowing us to test and improve theoretical formation models using the wealth of data coming from observations. type I) migration model, protoplanets are often seen to first migrate outwards, and then back in. On their way back in, they move into the region of the planetesimal disk which they have cleared from planetesimals while migrating outwards (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mordasini et al. 2011a</ref>). In the second situation, one planet can migrate into a region which has previously been cleared by another growing planet. In both situations, a faster gas accretion will result. From this we see that migration and accretion can interact. With this appendix, we want to check whether our simplified luminosity calculation reproduces the effect found by P96, and in general compare quantitatively our results with the published ones.</p><p>The J1 initial conditions in particular mean that the initial planetesimal surface density Σ p is 10 g/cm 2 as in Section 6. The grain opacities are now however at 100 % of the interstellar value ( f opa = 1). The density of the core is constant at 3.2 g/cm 3 as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, and also the nebular boundary conditions are the same as in this work. For the J1a, J1b and J1c cases, we switch off planetesimal accretion at the same moments as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>. The parameters used for the simulations are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A.</ref>1. It is clear that the two simulation still cannot yield exactly identical results, as they differ in some other aspects, like a different equation of state, or a different model for the planetesimal-envelope interaction.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.1 we show the core mass, envelope mass, and total mass for the four models, and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A.2 we</ref> give the values of the most important quantities at specific moments in time. We first focus on the nominal J1 case. The crossover point, i.e. the moment when the core and the envelope mass are identical and equal to M cr is found to occur at t cr = 7.49 Myrs at M cr = 16.62M ⊕ . This is very close to <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> with t cr =7.58 Myrs and M cr =16.17M ⊕ . Note however that the very good agreement in t cr is partially a chance result, because it is well known that changing for example just the opacity tables or the EOS can lead to variations of several million years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hubickyj et al. 2005</ref>). These authors found for identical conditions, but an updated version of the model used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, a t cr =6.07 Myrs and M cr =16.16M ⊕ . At crossover, the core and gas accretion rate are 2.37 × 10 −6 and 1.19 × 10 −5 M ⊕ /yr, which are both in very good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref> .</p><p>The limiting gas accretion rate of 0.01 M ⊕ /yr is reached at 8.02 Myrs, about half a million year after crossover. The core mass is then about 22.90 M ⊕ and the envelope mass 75.8 M ⊕ . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, a similar, but somewhat smaller gas accretion rate is reached 0.42 Myrs after crossover, at M Z = 21.5M ⊕ and M XY = 64.4M ⊕ . In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, we have taken the calculation also through the detached end evolutionary phase. The second luminosity peak occurs shortly after the limiting gas accretion is reached, at 8.036 Myrs, when the planet has already contracted to a radius of 4.49 R , and grown to a mass of 267 M ⊕ . The luminosity is then log(L/L ) = −2.77. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lissauer et al. (2009)</ref> find peak luminosities for planets accreting with the same limiting gas accretion rate of log(L/L ) ≈ −2.4 to −2.3.</p><p>The case J1a (red lines) is identical to case J1, except that at t = 1.5 Myrs, the solid accretion rate is artificially ramped down to zero on a short timescale as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>. This results in a faster growth of the envelope, i.e. an increase of the gas accretion rate. Our model thus reproduces this important effect. In this simulation, crossover occurs already at t cr =3.38 Myrs and M cr =12.98M ⊕ . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>, the values are 3.32 Myrs, and 12.24 M ⊕ which shows that also quantitatively, there is very good agreement. The results for the other two cases, J1b and J1c, are comparable, even though the differences in timescales are somewhat larger. In summary we see that there is also quantitatively a very good agreement between the Pollack et al. (1996) simulations and the ones presented here. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A.</ref>2.

ity as a function of radius in the envelope. It nevertheless leads 
to envelope structures which are at least similar, especially in 
the deeper layers. These two points mean that using a uniform 
grain opacity reduction factor, calibrated via the simulations of 
Movshovitz et al. (2010), is a strong simplifications of the ac-
tual processes in a protoplanetary envelope. It nevertheless rep-
resents a better approximation than using arbitrarily reduced val-
ues. The reader is referred to Mordasini et al. (2012c) for details.

			<note place="foot">C. Mordasini et al.: Characterization of exoplanets from their formation I</note>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> The timestep dt for a calculation as in Sect. 6 is set to ∼ 10 4 years in phase II. During the collapse phase, dt must be reduced to ∼1 year. Afterwards dt can increase again, reaching ∼1 Gyr late during the evolutionary phase. The latter two values correspond to about 0.1-1% of the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale of the planet at these moments.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> The point where the decreases changes from the &quot;natural&quot; one to the artificially forced one is visible in the ˙ M core line in the top right panel as a tiny shoulder. This is due to the tanh-like function (smoothed step function) we use for the artificial ramp down.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> The data plotted is from http://www.astro.princeton.edu/∼burrows/ and http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/isabelle.baraffe/.</note>
