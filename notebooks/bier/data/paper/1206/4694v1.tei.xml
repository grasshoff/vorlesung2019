			<abstract>
				<p>During their main sequence lifetimes, the majority of all Galactic Disc field stars must endure at least one stellar intruder passing within a few hundred AU. Mounting observations of planet-star separations near or beyond this distance suggest that these close encounters may fundamentally shape currently-observed orbital architectures and hence obscure primordial orbital features. We consider the commonly-occurring fast close encounters of two single-planet systems in the Galactic Disc, and investigate the resulting change in the planetary eccentricity and semimajor axis. We derive explicit 4-body analytical limits for these variations and present numerical cross-sections which can be applied to localized regions of the Galaxy. We find that each wide-orbit planet has a few percent chance of escape and an eccentricity that will typically change by at least 0.1 due to these encounters. The orbital properties established at formation of millions of tight-orbit Milky Way exoplanets are likely to be disrupted.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>After leaving their birth clusters, most stars undertake a potentially harrowing multi-Gyr journey through the Galactic Disc. The stars are continuously perturbed by global Galactic phenomena and are periodically nudged by individual stellar encounters. Occasionally, an encounter is close enough to cause major disruption to any planets orbiting in the approaching systems. The currently observed exoplanet population may be shaped in part by these encounters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Typical Closest Encounter Distances</head><p>Using simple arguments (e.g. from Pg. 3 of Binney &amp; Tremaine 2008), one can crudely estimate an upper bound for the typical encounter distance, renc, over a main sequence lifetime. If n denotes the space density of stars in the Galactic Disc, and vran is the random velocity of stars, then renc ≈ (4πnvrantMS) −1/2 , where tMS is the main sequence lifetime. This estimate is conservatively large because gravitational focusing is not included. We can estimate tMS through simulations from the SSE stellar ⋆ E-mail:veras@ast.cam.ac.uk † E-mail:nickolas1@gmail.com evolution code <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hurley et al. 2000</ref>). Doing so yields <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, which plots the closest encounter main sequence distance as a function of progenitor mass from 1M⊙ − 2M⊙, which represents a common range of exoplanet host masses. The majority of stars drawn from a standard stellar initial mass function (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parravano et al. 2011</ref>) will have masses under 1 M⊙, further suggesting that the typical encounter separations in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> represent overestimates. The solid and dashed lines represent Solar and very low (1/200th of Solar) metallicities, respectively. The metallicity of a star helps dictate its main sequence lifetime, and hence the expected close encounter distance. The plot partially illustrates that differences in the metallicity of stars have little (indirect) effect on the close encounter distance.</p><p>The figure demonstrates that the majority of all stars will suffer a close encounter of just a few hundred AU for a reasonable range of n and vran values. Even in sparse environments, like the Solar neighborhood (with n ≈ 0.1 pc −3 ), Sun-like stars will approach one another at least once within a few hundred AU. This estimate corroborates the rough estimate of 500 AU given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref>, who consider only a 5 Gyr encounter timescale. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Upper bound estimates for typical main-sequence closest encounter distances, renc, between exosystems in the field of the Galactic Disc. Solar metallicity stars and very low metallicity stars are represented by solid and dashed lines, respectively. The random velocity of stars is vran and the space density of stars is n. Fiducial values of n (0.6pc −3 ) and vran (50km/s) are represented by the black curves. Because the majority of Galactic Disc stars are less massive than 1M ⊙ , they will have renc values less than hundreds of AU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Stellar Encounter Orientations with Respect to Galactic Centre</head><p>Given that close encounters within hundreds of AU will typically occur, we can now attempt to characterize the orientations of the collisions with respect to the Galactic Centre. As outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Quillen et al. (2011)</ref>, the distribution of velocities in the Galactic Disc is affected by a multitude of factors. Potential perturbers include Galactic Lindblad resonances (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yuan &amp; Kuo 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lépine et al. 2011</ref>), stellar streams from past mergers and interactions with satellite subhaloes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bekki &amp; Freeman 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gómez et al. 2010)</ref>, and transient spiral density waves (e.g. De <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Simone et al. 2004</ref>). Stellar velocities may also be highly dependent on the phase and pattern speed of the Milky Way's spiral arms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Antoja et al. 2011</ref>), suggesting drastic differences in the velocity distribution in different regions. These factors might help explain why the velocity components of the stars in the Solar neighborhood are neither isotropic nor Gaussian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Binney et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nakajima et al. 2010</ref>). Generally, the orbits of Disc stars are modulated vertically and epicyclically (e.g. pgs. 164-166, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Binney &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>, and may undergo significant radial migration (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Schoenrich 2011</ref>). Further, the amplitude of the epicyclic and vertical oscillations are of the same order of magnitude (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pg. 18, Binney &amp; Tremaine 2008)</ref>, and are orders of magnitude longer than then the physical radii of the stars themselves. Therefore, we should expect that stars suffer close encounters with each other at random orientations with respect to the Galactic Centre.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Planetary Orbit Orientations with Respect to the Galactic Disc</head><p>Now we assess whether the planes of the planetary orbits should have a preferential orientation to the Galactic Disc.</p><p>The severe misalignment of the Solar System's invariable plane with the Galactic plane at ≈ 60 • <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Huang &amp; Wade 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Duncan et al. 1987)</ref> foreshadows the likely answer. Observations constrain the distribution of exoplanetary orbital planes poorly because most extrasolar planets have been discovered by the Doppler radial velocity technique, which alone does not provide any information about line-of-sight inclinations. Similarly, the stellar rotational axis orientation -which is suggestive of planetary orbit orientation -of the vast majority of non-exoplanet host stars is unknown. However, in cases where this information has been obtained, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abt (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Howe &amp; Clarke (2009)</ref> find that the these axes are orientated randomly. For exoplanet-host stars that harbour transiting planets, we do have line-of-sight inclination information. According to the Exoplanet Data Explorer 1 , as of 15 January, 2012, there are 141 transiting exoplanets. At most, the orbital plane of any of these planets is misaligned with our line-ofsight by ≈ 13.4 • . However, the median misalignment angle is just ≈ 2.79 • and the standard deviation is ≈ 2.73 • . Therefore, effectively we observe transiting planets edgeon, and the locations of these planets on the sky might suggest a relation between the Galactic plane and planetary orbital planes. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, we plot the declination versus right ascension of the host stars of these 141 transiting planets from this database. In order to help assuage the strong observational bias in the plot, the plot markers are colored and shaped according to the planet names, which are often indicative of the program or collaboration who first discovered the planet. For example, the planets with names containing "Kepler" or "KOI" (Kepler Object of Interest) are all clustered in the same region on the plot. This is due to the the fixed field the Kepler space mission is observing. The plot definitively illustrates that observed planetary orbital planes are known to encompass a wide range of orientations with respect to the Galactic Disc.</p><p>These considerations lead us to treat close encounters between two planetary systems in arbitrary directions with orbital planes that are arbitrarily aligned with each other. However, we must sensibly restrict the vast phase space of these encounters. We do so first by reviewing some published literature related to this topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Extending Previous Scattering Studies</head><p>The three-body problem which includes a star-planet pair experiencing a perturbation from an intruder star has been the subject of several studies, and is well-characterized in many regions of phase space.

An exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref>, who do consider perturbations in the field from a stellar intruder, but on a multi-planet system.

Among their several useful results are i) about 10% of all stars experience close encounters within 200 AU, ii) planetary eccentricities may be excited up to 0.1 in the field, and iii) the extent of the excitation is strongly dependent on system size and phase.</p><p>Here, we provide a multi-tiered extension to that work. First, we consider the potential of all four bodies in the close encounter of two one-planet systems, as most Milky Way stars are now thought to have planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>). Previous studies of the 4-body problem often consider the more general case of the interaction of two stellar binaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mikkola 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hut 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bacon et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heggie 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Giersz &amp; Spurzem 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fregeau et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pfahl &amp; Muterspaugh 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sweatman 2007</ref>) or a planet-less intruder perturbing a multi-planet exosystem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Malmberg et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boley et al. 2012</ref>). However, none of these studies consider the close encounter of two single-planet systems.</p><p>Second, because field encounters are fast, we develop an analytical method based on impulses that can determine the change in orbital parameters without resorting to numerical simulations. We consider two extremes in phase for our analysis, although the method can in principle be generalized to arbitrary phases, and even arbitrary numbers of planets.</p><p>Third, we do perform numerical simulations, here specifically for the purpose of obtaining normalized cross sections. These quantities then enable one to determine the overall rate of encounters and eccentricity excitations over a main sequence lifetime in localized patches of the Milky Way. As already argued earlier, we consider encounters of all mutual orientations, independent of their locations with respect to the Galactic Centre.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Plan for Paper</head><p>We outline some of the key quantities in the hyperbolic 4-body problem in Section 2 before our analytical (Section 3 and the Appendix) and numerical (Section 4) explorations. Of particular note are the two specific orientations we model without numerical integrations (Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4) and the eccentricity excitation frequencies arising from our numerical integrations (Section 4.3). In Section 5, we interpret the results. Section 6 discusses related topics, and Section 7 provides a short conclusion. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> delineates the variables applied throughout this paper.

We plot typical values of Vcrit in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, showing that Vcrit is nearly 23 times lower for two MJ planets and two M⊙ stars than for four M⊙ stars, where MJ is the mass of Jupiter. Hence, comparison of typical stellar velocities in the Galactic Disc (≈ 10km/s -100km/s) implies that one-planet systems are moving too fast to ionize all four bodies through encounters regardless of the values of a10 and a20. Now we can compare the circular velocity of a planet with respect to its parent star, V circ,k , to typical values of V∞. We have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V circ,k = 29.79 km s M sk + M pk M⊙ 1AU a k0<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Therefore, for wide orbit planets and typical Disc velocities, V∞ ≫ V circ,k .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMPULSE ANALYTICS</head><p>Although we must resort to numerical simulations to fully explore the 4-body problem consisting of two planet-star systems, here we investigate how this cases of this problem may be solved analytically in the impulse regime. As suggested by Eq. (5), perturbations on wide orbit planets due to passing planetary systems may be treated in the impulse approximation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref> claim that this assumption holds for their planetless intruder if the stellar perturber is fast and if the planetary period is much longer than the characteristic timescale of the encounter, tenc ≈ b/Vperi. This condition is analogous here to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">T k ′′ tenc ≈ 2π a k ′′ b Vperi V circ,k ′′ ≫ 1,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where k ′′ indicates the planet with the smaller orbital period. As demonstrated by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(7)</ref>, the impulse approximation is well-suited for wide orbits due to the resulting low value of V circ,k ′′ . In the impulse regime, the planets do not progress in their orbits around their parent stars during the encounter (i.e., the mean anomaly is approximated as stationary). The impulse approximation allows us to isolate and estimate analytically the planets' mutual perturbations during the encounter. For simplicity, let us treat both planets on circular orbits. By symmetry, in the impulse approximation the only net perturbation is perpendicular to the velocity vector of the perturber. For ease of reference to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref>, we also take both planetary systems to be coplanar with each other and with the perturber's velocity vector. We will be estimating the perturbations on Planet #2. By symmetry, the perturbations on Planet #1 will yield the same change in orbital parameters.</p></div>

Here, the value of b may be any value from 0 to ∞. In the second case, which we denote by close, the direction of the vectors from each star to its child planet are pointing towards each other. Here, a value of b that we denote bmin will cause both planets to collide. For b &lt; bmin, the orbits will overlap. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  4</ref> shows a cartoon of the encounters at pericenter for different cases.</p><p>We have derived analytical formulae for the critical points of the motion, asymptotic limits, and the individual contribution to the perturbations from the planets alone.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Consequences</head><p>The analytics show that a planet's eccentricity can be raised to any value due to a realistic close encounter. Even in the limiting case where both planets are furthest from each other during the encounter, if the stars endure a close enough approach, then the planets will be ejected. In the other extreme, measurable eccentricity excitation can occur over a wide, realistic range of impact parameters. When a star crosses in between another star and planet, the eccentricity excitation is at least a tenth, but is likely many tenths. When any two bodies narrowly miss each other, planetary escape may occur. However, there are locations at which this net perturbation is zero; this range of locations increases along with planetary mass. This analytic exploration helps us to gauge expectations for the outcomes of numerical simulations, and perhaps more importantly, provides an explanation for some of the trends seen in the outputs of our numerical simulations. We describe these simulations in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NUMERICAL CROSS SECTIONS</head><p>We now calculate cross sections of various encounter outcomes via numerical scattering experiments. Cross sections of this type, introduced in stellar dynamical research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hut &amp; Bahcall (1983)</ref>, represent the effective surface area for some outcome of a scattering event between involving stellar or planetary systems. Coupled with a velocity distribution and density of systems, the cross section yields a total outcome frequency. By suitably setting up random stellar encounters and performing many experiments, the probabilistic outcome of these potentially chaotic encounters can be obtained.</p><p>Here, we are interested in the frequency of planetary systems whose planets have eccentricities that are perturbed by a particular amount, Υ. The cross section is a function of Υ, ǫ ≡ a10/a20, and η ≡ V∞/Vcrit such that one example is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">σ(|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η) = πb 2 max N (|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η) N total<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where N total represents the total number of experiments and N (|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η) represents the number of experiments with a given ǫ and η that yield |∆e1| &gt; Υ. One may compute errors in σ(|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η) by using Gaussian counting statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hut &amp; Bahcall 1983)</ref>. Doing so gives error bars which are equal to the RHS of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> divided by N (|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Characterizing Finite Separations</head><p>Strictly, our numerical simulations cannot treat infinite distances. Therefore, we must propagate forward the 2-body star-star hyperbolic solution until the mutual distance between the stars, r(t), reaches a specified distance r(t = tstart) ≡ |rstart|.

For any finite |rstart|, the components of the stars' velocity both parallel and perpendicular to the impact parameter segment will be different than their initial values at an infinite mutual separation. Denote the position and velocity components parallel to b by x and ˙ x, and the perpendicular components by y and ˙ y.

For each set of simulations, we wish to sample a representative range of impact parameters. We chose β = 2.5 and select values of b from 0 out to bmax according to b = √ RAND × b 2 max , where RAND is a low-discrepancy quasirandom Niederreiter number between zero and unity. The impact parameter is thus sampled according to its probability, and no weighting of the scattering experiment outcomes is necessary to account for the larger frequency of wide encounters compared to nearly head-on encounters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">ǫ and η Range</head><p>We choose three values of the planetary semimajor axis ratio (≡ ǫ ≡ a10/a20 = 1, 10, 100), which represents a wide variety of both already observed planetary systems and systems with wide-orbit planets <ref type="bibr">which</ref> have not yet been observed. In order to determine a range of plausible η values, reconsider <ref type="figure">Fig.  3</ref>. For a10 = 1000 AU, our three values of ǫ, and plausible velocity values in the field (10 km/s V∞ 100 km/s), we obtain η ranges of roughly <ref type="bibr">[330 − 3300]</ref> , <ref type="bibr">[120 − 1200]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[50 − 500]</ref>, respectively. However, we need not restrict our η ranges to field values. We can also include typically slow cluster velocities of ≈ 1 km/s (by reducing the lower bounds on the ranges by an order of magnitude) and hyper-velocity stars (by increasing the upper bounds by a factor of a few). Therefore, for each value of ǫ, we choose between 15-20 values of η based on these broad ranges.</p></div>

There is no preferred dominant force or geometry (such as one central star or a circumbinary system). SuperHermite also contains collision detection; in all simulations, we set each star's radius to be a Solar radius and each planet's radius to be Jupiter's radius.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.6">Other Considerations</head><p>For each pair (ǫ, η), we ran N total = 10 4 scattering experiments. Strictly, the imposition of a finite separation means that due to the center of mass frame shift, numerically e k0 (t = tstart) and a k0 (t = tstart) deviate from their given initial values at infinite separations by a factor of roughly a few δ. For example, e k0 (t = tstart) ≈ 0.003. As we are primarily concerned with the change in eccentricity, this initial small nonzero eccentricity is not of concern. Regarding the change of orbital parameters, a k (t &gt; tstart) and e k (t &gt; tstart) do vary slightly as the stars approach each other, well before the close encounter. This variation, which increases with decreasing |rstart|, is natural and unavoidable, and is orders of magnitude less than the variation due to the close encounter.</p></div>

The black circles, orange squares and blue diamonds respectively show the cases ǫ = {1, 10, 100}. Each data point has vertical error bars; in some cases these are so small that they are not discernible. Due to symmetry, the black circles on both panels in each plot should be, and are, roughly equivalent. For most of the cross sections in the ejection <ref type="figure">figure (Fig. 11)</ref>, just one data point was obtained for a particular (η, ǫ) pair.

A few percent of planets on tight orbits could have their eccentricities perturbed by 10 −3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 16)</ref>, which is comparable to the smallest observational errors yet achieved on planetary eccentricity measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wolszczan 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Welsh et al. 2012)</ref>. A nonzero fraction of tight-orbit planets will experience greater perturbations, with ∼ 0.01% receiving a kick of over 0.1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 18)</ref>. Given that the current number of observed exoplanets is ∼ 10 3 , we have not yet observed enough exoplanets, on average, to have detected a tight-orbit planet with such a large kick. Nevertheless, at least millions of such planets should exist in the Milky Way, given the recent total exoplanet population estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cassan et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In multiple planet systems, the effect of flybys may be more pronounced. Two planets on the verge of dynamical instability could be driven to scatter off of one another after a sufficiently strong nudge from a flyby. Small, flyby-induced changes to particular dynamical signatures of formation, such as the circulation of the apsidal angle between two planets, can propagate over several Gyr to obscure the formative value.</p><p>If, however, core-accreted planets are not born in isolation, and instead are continually perturbed in dense clusters, then these planets will attain a nonzero eccentricity. A detailed comparison of the relative contributions to a planet's dynamical history from its birth cluster versus its middle-aged interactions in the Galactic Disc may be crucial in determining the types of planetary orbits seen in different Galactic environments. This study is a first step towards such a comparison. Subsequent studies could focus on merging the two types of simulations, or at least consider fast interactions with initial non-zero planetary eccentricities.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can provide a broad estimate here by computing an eccentricity distribution similar to that of <ref type="figure">Fig.  9</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boley et al. (2012)</ref>, which illustrates a post-cluster planetary eccentricity distribution. Assume a population of any number of Solar-mass stars each with a 10 Gyr Main Sequence lifetime and a space density of n = 0.5 pc −3 . Each star has a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting on a circular orbit all of the same semimajor axis. Then we can use Eq. (46) with ǫ = 1 and a given velocity distribution of the stars to compute N . Because σnorm(|∆e1| &gt; Υ, ǫ, η) is a discrete function computed numerically, we create an interpolating function based on those data points, for a given Υ. Then, for the velocity range of interest, we use the mean value theorem on the interpolating function to compute an averaged value of N for a given Υ. If N 1, then we say that 100% of that population suffered an eccentricity of at least Υ. Recall that because our numerical integrations modeled single encounters, we do not know how additive the eccentricities are due to repeated perturbations when N 2. We apply this procedure to 9 populations: for a = 10, 100, and 1000 AU, and for flat distributions of V∞ in the ranges  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2012)</ref> is difficult because of the different setups of the two papers. However, our <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 14</ref> does illustrate that a few percent of the planets at a = 100 AU experience eccentricity changes of at least 0.1, which may be comparable to those achieved in birth clusters. Further, for fast perturbers, the eccentricity change is a strong function of semimajor axis and a weak function of the velocity range chosen. Additionally, the values in the plot are dependent on n in a linear fashion, such that for dense environments, the fractions may increase by a factor of 2-3. Overall, more detailed comparisons are necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Dynamically Excited Galactic Regions</head><p>Given that N ∝ nησ(η) (Eq. 46), the extent of the planetary orbital disruption may significantly depend on the Galactic environment of the host star. Additionally, the migration history of an exoplanet host star through regions of differing spatial density and velocity dispersions will affect the resulting perturbations on orbiting planets. Unlike planetary motion, stellar orbits are typically not closed, and can suddenly transition from, for example, being ensconced in a dense tidal tail to traveling in the sparse region between two spiral arms. Even the region exterior to the Galactic Disc is complex: the two broadly overlapping structural components of the Milky Way's halo feature distinct spatial density profiles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carollo et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Exoplanet host star velocities can vary by approximately two orders of magnitude. HIP 13044, which is thought to be of extragalactic origin, has a measured systematic velocity of 300 km/s with respect to <ref type="bibr">Sun (Setiawan et al. 2010</ref>). Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Helmi et al. (1999)</ref> suggest that relic debris streams from Milky Way formation show internal velocity dispersions of just a few km/s.

This variation may be important for characterizing the abundance and location of exoplanets when assessing the Milky Way's global population. In particular, for dense enough environments, wide orbit planets may survive only for a small fraction of the host's main sequence lifetime. Conversely, sparse environments would allow planetary systems to retain their formation signatures for several Gyr. Generally, regions closer to the Galactic Centre are denser, and hence perhaps harbor more dynamically excited exoplanets than in the Solar neighborhood. Independently, this conclusion also arises from modelling the effect of galactic tides on exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Consequences for Wide-orbit Planets</head><p>At least three exoplanets have been detected orbiting their parent stars at semimajor axes exceeding 10 3 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kuzuhara et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Luhman et al. 2011</ref>). Several others are thought to orbit at separations of 10 2 AU -10 3 AU. The population of wide orbit planets may be large, but remains difficult to distinguish from the purportedly vast free-floating planet population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sumi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bennett et al. 2012</ref>). Unlikely to have formed in their current locations via core accretion, wide-orbit planets perhaps already represent the victims of internal dynamical jostling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Veras et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boley et al. 2012</ref>) or recaptured free-floaters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Perets &amp; Kouwenhoven 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>Here we consider a few potential extensions to this work. First, we remove the assumption that the planetary masses are equal and estimate how our results might change. Second, we discuss other related few-body interactions in the Galactic Disc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Unequal Planetary Masses</head><p>Here we briefly consider how orbital parameters might be perturbed when the planetary masses are unequal. The ratio of planetary masses should be most important when the planets are near each other during the close encounter of the two systems. Therefore, let us consider the close configuration, and specifically focus on the region around the planet-planet collision point (roughly bounded by bstat,&lt; and bstat,&gt;) Denote δ1 ≡ Mp1/Ms1 and δ2 ≡ Mp2/Ms2. For simplicity, choose Ms1 = Ms2 and a10 = a20, as in Section 3. If we carry out the same analytic procedure in that section and the Appendix, then we find that the eccentricity change of Planet #2 is similarly described by Eq. (17), except now:</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">Z4 = 2GMs1V 2 ∞ (6a20 − b (3 − 2δ2))<label>(48)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_60">Z5 = V 4 ∞ 4a 2 20 + b 2 (1 − 2δ2) − ba20 (4 + δ1 − 3δ2)<label>(49)</label></formula><p>The result is the critical points around the planet-planet collision region become:</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">b (c) stat,&lt; ≈ a20 4 − δ 2 1 + δ1 (8 − 6δ2) + δ2 (8 + 9δ2) 2 − 4δ2 (50) b (c) stat,&gt; ≈ a20 4 + δ 2 1 + δ1 (8 − 6δ2) + δ2 (8 + 9δ2) 2 − 4δ2 (51)</formula><p>which is equivalent to Eqs. (A15)-(A16) when δ1 = δ2. We plot these critical points as functions of the mass ratios in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Fig. 20</ref>. The plot demonstrates that given a Jupitermass Planet #1, the region of planet-planet gravitational influence changes by ≈ 0.1a20 if Planet #2's mass is an Earthmass versus a Jupiter-mass. In the latter case, the region of influence is greater. Note also how the asymmetry of the two critical bstat points is enhanced when the planetary masses approach the stellar masses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Other System Configurations</head><p>Scattering simulations for different hierarchical configurations of 4 bodies, or for more than 4 bodies, would provide a more complete picture of planetary orbital excitation from passing stars during the host star's middle age. However, the phase space to be explored is prohibitive. Nevertheless, because the few-body problem admits few analytical solutions, studies often must rely on numerical integrations.</p><p>Alternatively, in the Galactic Disc, the impulse formalism may be generalized to any number of bodies in any orientations. Although the resulting analytical formulas are unlikely to be as compact as those presented here, they -subject to the assumption in Eq. (7) -would be able to sample the entire phase space. Such a formalism could be useful, for example, in modeling how secular or resonant evolution of multi-planet systems might change naturally over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref> consider secular eccentricity propagation. For resonant systems, this same propagation might kick planets into a deeper or shallower mean motion resonance, if not out of the resonance entirely. Results from the Kepler mission illustrate that there is an abundance of near-resonant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In cases other than the close and far cases, impulses would cause both a perpendicular and parallel kick. The net effect could be modelled as a single impulse. If a planet is on an eccentric orbit before the kick, then the true anomaly of the planet must be taken into account. In principle, one could remove the error bars associated with Poisson counting statistics in Figs. 7-11 by generating those figures analytically, and then generalizing the figures with a given distribution of eccentricities. In this way, one can also quantify the preference of a planet's eccentricity to increase versus decrease given an initial nonzero value.</p><p>This formalism should also work for hierarchical systems: those with stars, planets and moons. The Solar System demonstrates that moons typically orbit planets within half of a Hill radius. Further, a planet's Hill radius is proportional to its semimajor axis. Therefore, wide orbit planets with moons 5 could feature a widely spaced moon orbit, one which extends to several percent of the planet's semimajor axis. At a distance of 1000 AU, such an orbit would be comparable to the Neptune-Sun separation, and hence could be disrupted by passing stars.</p><p>Also, given the possible vast population of free-floating giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sumi et al. 2011</ref>), passing giant planets might be more common than passing stars. Then, the resulting binary-single interactions with a passing free-floater and a planetary system could become important ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Varvoglis et al. 2012</ref>). If a giant free-floating planet of mass Mp were to pass by a system with a planet of mass Mp orbiting a star of mass Ms, then the critical velocity of this configuration is (2δ + 1)/(2 + δ) ≈ 71% of the critical velocity of the traditional stellar flyby binary-single scattering configuration. This reduction in Vcrit is not enough to claim that the system will be completely ionized; hence, this situation may be treated in a similar impulse situation as this work. In the perhaps more exotic situation of two pairs of free-floating planet binaries suffering a close encounter, Vcrit would be reduced from the traditional four-star encounter by a factor of 1/ √ δ ≈ 32. This reduction is significant enough that ionization would be much more likely in that case for typical Galactic field velocities.</p><p>5 Wide-orbit planets scattered out to their current locations could have retained moons, whether the moons were formed in the circumplanetary disc or were captured satellites. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have modeled the close encounter of two single-planet exosystems in the Galactic Disc, which mimicks a common occurence during middle-aged planetary evolution. We obtained analytical formulae and numerical cross sections which may be useful for future population studies of exoplanets in specific regions of the Milky Way. The resulting change in orbital parameters for wide-orbit (a ≈ 100−1000 AU) planets is significant (with a typical ∆e of several hundredths to over a tenth) and potentially measurable, suggesting that these planets are highly unlikely to retain a static orbit during main sequence evolution. Although tight-orbit planets (with a 10 AU) are more resistant to orbital changes, millions in the Milky Way will be affected, and lose their primordial orbital signatures. The most dynamically excited Milky Way exoplanets are likely to reside in the densest Galactic regions. close cases, respectively. In the close case, bmin is the value of b which gives bp1p2 = 0. Eq.

Further, the power-law dependence is reported in terms of pericenter distance. In the limiting case of b = bmin, the planets collide with each other, and the kicks on each other have no perpendicular component (as can be seen in Eq. 11). Further, the perpendicular kicks from both stars would cancel out. Therefore, in this limit -if the collision could be neglected -the planets' orbital parameters would remain nearly unchanged. However, even a slight nonzero distance between the planets would produce strong perpendicular kicks, much stronger than the kicks from the stars, and cause the planets to escape. This kick is highest at b (c) crit,p1p2 , which differs from bmin on the order of a giant planet radius (Eq. A5). Therefore, around the vicinity of bmin, the planets either collide with each other or escape.</p><p>As b deviates from bmin, eventually the kick contributions from both Star #1 and Planet #1 will cancel out the back reaction from Star #1 on Star #2.

This can be seen by the dependence of e 2f on δ, even though in route to the derivation of e 2f , we neglected a higher order term due to δ. The fully general case (Eq. 14) makes no assumptions whatsoever about δ, meaning that the formula is just as applicable to four stars as it is to two stars and two planets.
