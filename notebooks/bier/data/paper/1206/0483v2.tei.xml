			<abstract>
				<p>We present previously unpublished July 2005 H-band coronagraphic data of the young, planet-hosting star HR 8799 from the newly-released Keck/NIRC2 archive. Despite poor observing conditions , we detect three of the planets (HR 8799 bcd), two of them (HR 8799 bc) without advanced image processing. Comparing these data with previously published 1998-2011 astrometry and that from re-reduced October 2010 Keck data constrains the orbits of the planets. Analyzing the planets&apos; astrometry separately, HR 8799 d&apos;s orbit is likely inclined at least 25 • from face-on and the others may be on in inclined orbits. For semimajor axis ratios consistent with a 4:2:1 mean-motion resonance, our analysis yields precise values for HR 8799 bcd&apos;s orbital parameters and strictly constrains the planets&apos; eccentricities to be less than 0.18-0.3. However, we find no acceptable orbital solutions with this resonance that place the planets in face-on orbits; HR 8799 d shows the largest deviation from such orbits. Moreover, few orbits make HR 8799 d coplanar with b and c, whereas dynamical stability analyses used to constrain the planets&apos; masses typically assume coplanar and/or face-on orbits. This paper illustrates the significant science gain enabled with the release of the NIRC2 archive.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The nearby, young A-type star HR 8799 <ref type="bibr">(d = 39.4 pc, ≈ 30 Myr;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zuckerman et al. 2011</ref>) harbors the first independently confirmed, directly imaged exoplanetary system and the only imaged multi-planet system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Marois et al. 2008</ref>). After the discovery of HR 8799 bcd (r proj ≈ 24, 38, and 68 AU) reported in November <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Marois et al. 2008</ref>), other studies identified at least one of these planets in archival data taken prior to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lafreniére et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fukagawa et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Metchev et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Soummer et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>HR 8799 planet astrometry derived from both pre and post-discovery images can help constrain the system's dynamical stability and, in turn, the planets' physical properties. At least two of the HR 8799 planets are likely locked in a mean motion resonance, otherwise the system would quickly become dynamically unstable <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fabrycky and Murray-Clay 2010)</ref>. The recently discovered fourth companion at ∼ 15 AU, HR 8799 e, generally makes dynamical stability less likely ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marois et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Currie et al. 2011a</ref>), favoring lower masses of M b,cde &lt; 7, 10 M J , an important constraint given the uncertainties in deriving masses from planet cooling and atmosphere models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Spiegel and Burrows 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Madhusudhan et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Studies focused on fitting the planets' orbits and/or testing dynamical stability typically assume that the planets are a) in resonance (4:2:1 for HR 8799 bcd or 2:1 for HR 8799 cd), b) in circular, face-on orbits, c) and/or in coplanar orbits (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Marois</ref>  Generally, more eccentric orbits destabilize the system. The system stability depends on the (mutual) inclinations of the planets (Fabrycky and Murray-Clay 2010; Sudol and Haghighipour 2012). Thus, the HR 8799 planets' true mass limits derived from dynamical stability arguments may slightly differ from those previously reported. Well-sampled HR 8799 d astrometry could help clarify whether HR 8799 d's orbit must be inclined, eccentric, and/or coplanar with the other planets. However, until now there is a ∼ 9-year gap between the 1998 HST detection and the next one <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Metchev et al. 2009</ref>). New astrometry for HR 8799 bce in between 1998 and 2007 could also help constrain those planets' orbits. By better determining the HR 8799 planets' orbital properties, we can more conclusively investigate system dynamical stability and thus better clarify the range of allowable planet masses.</p><p>In this Letter, we report the detection of HR 8799 bcd from unpublished, now-public Keck/NIRC2 data taken in 2005 supplemented with a re-reduction of published October 2010 data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marois et al. (2010a)</ref>. We use these data to better constrain the orbital properties of HR 8799 bcd.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">July 2005 Data</head><p>We downloaded HR 8799 data taken on July <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">2005</ref> from the newly-available Keck/NIRC2 data archive (Program ID H53BN2, P.I. Michael Liu). The data were taken in H band with the narrow camera (9.952 mas/pixel; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yelda et al. 2010</ref>) with the 0. ′′ 6 diameter coro-nagraphic spot and the "incircle" pupil plane mask. HR 8799 was observed in 10 s exposures in "vertical angle" or angular differential imaging mode ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Marois et al. 2006</ref>) through transit (Hour Angle = [−0.20,0.55]) with a total field rotation of 147.1 • . During these observations, the seeing conditions fluctuated and the observers periodically recentered the star behind the mask, changing the intensity profile of the stellar halo (and thus the quasistatic speckle pattern). During a few frames near transit the star did not properly center at all behind the coronagraph. We identify ∼ 11 minutes of science-grade data. Basic image processing followed standard steps previously used to process NIRC2 data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Currie et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>For a first-order reduction, we perform a simple "classical" ADI-based PSF subtraction (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Marois et al. 2006</ref>). To improve the signal-to-noise of our HR 8799 d detection, we incorporated several upgrades to enhance contrast which are being implemented in a new "adaptive" LOCI (A-LOCI) pipeline (T. Currie, 2012 in prep.; see also similar steps in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Marois et al. 2010b</ref>). We subtract off the seeing halo in each image to measure the static/quasistatic speckle pattern, determining the cross-correlation function for the speckle patterns in annular sections for all possible image pairs. While the speckle pattern is generally better correlated between frames taken close together in time, this is not always the case, especially when comparing frames before and after small telescope nods. Therefore, for each annular section of a science image we want to subtract, we filter reference image sections by their degree of correlation to remove those below a certain, predetermined threshold (r corr ).</p><p>HR 8799 b is detectable in most individual processed frames (SNR/frame ∼ 4-7), so we measure its position to identify and correct for any astrometric biases caused by a PA "jump" for frames obtained near transit due to imperfect mechanical alignment of the telescope's y axis. The position angles of HR 8799 b in frames more than 0.25 hours from transit are consistent, but the PA offset follows a bell-shaped curve with a maximum offset of ≈ 0.6 degrees centered on transit. We model and correct for this offset using a fifth-order polynomial. We also reran our pipeline with different rotation axis offsets due to image registration errors, setting an upper limit to this of 0.5 pixels in each coordinate.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike the original LOCI algorithm, we set the azimuthal length of the subtraction zone to be smaller (not identical) to the azimuthal length for the optimization zone, equal to dr (the length along the radial direction). We then center the optimization zone on the subtraction zone. Finally, we iteratively determine the algorithm parameters -δ, N A , g, dr Lafrenì ere et al. <ref type="bibr">2007</ref>), and r corr -that maximize the signal-to-noise of point sources and applied these settings to extract our final image <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .  <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>, although the individual measurements are consistent to within ∼ 1 σ. Photometry derived for HR 8799 bc using classical PSF subtraction agrees with that derived from our A-LOCI based reduction within errors. Bright residual speckles at r = 0. ′′ 3-0. ′′ 4 prevent detecting HR 8799 e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">October 2010 Data</head><p>To supplement the 2005 HR 8799 astrometry, we downloaded and reduced October 2010 L ′ -band NIRC2 data from the Keck archive (P.I. B. Macintosh). These data are the latest reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marois et al. (2010a)</ref> who focus on HR 8799 e astrometry: we use these data instead to extract astrometry for HR 8799 bcd. Individual exposures consist of 50 s frames totaling ≈ 80 minutes taken through transit without a coronagraph with periodic telescope nods for sky subtraction. Observing conditions appeared variable at a level comparable to the July 2005 data and worse than other recent Keck data (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Currie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rodigas et al. 2012</ref>), but we detect all four planets (SNR ∼ 6-20) with our pipeline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Method</head><p>We use our detections to better constrain the orbits of HR 8799 bcd, first by fitting the orbits of the planets separately, then identifying the subset of orbits consistent with systematically more stable mean motion resonance configuration. We calibrate our astrometry by assessing and correcting for biases introduced by LOCIbased processing in the same manner as our photometric calibration, using fake point sources. Using different telescopes and slightly different image processing techniques lead to systematic biases in planet astrometry.  <ref type="bibr">Keck/2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Metchev et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Galicher et al. 2011, this work)</ref>, VLT/2009 ( <ref type="bibr">Currie et al. 2011a</ref>), and LBT/Pisces ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Esposito et al. 2012</ref>). For the Pisces data, we include the substantial north position angle uncertainty. We furthermore modify the Keck/NIRC2 astrometry reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Marois et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Metchev et al. (2009)</ref> to reflect the updated NIRC2 astrometric calibration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yelda et al. 2010</ref>) accuracy, rescaling the position by a factor of 9.952/9.963, and putting in a P A north,new -P A north,old = 0.13 • clockwise rotation.</p><p>To separately determine the range of allowable HR 8799 bcd orbits, we follow our previously-adopted Monte Carlo-based approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Thalmann et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Currie et al. 2011b</ref>), comparing the HR 8799 planet astrometry to predictions from randomly-selected orbits. In a first set of "conservative" simulations, we consider the orbits separately. Dynamical stability analysis suggests that HR 8799 bcd are likely in resonance (Fabrycky and Murray-Clay 2010); the 4:2:1 resonance is particularly adept at stabilizing the system. To focus on dynamically stable orbits we then select the subset of best-fitting orbits that preclude the planets from crossing orbits and are consistent with a 4:2:1 resonance. Here we define "resonance" broadly, including orbits with ratios of periods between 1.9 and 2.1 for consecutive pairs of planets since, at least in some circumstances, exact period ratios may be rare (e.g. ν values are ≈ 1). However, we obtain nearly identical results for more relaxed cutoffs (see below). From the set of models passing our χ 2 cutoff, including the subset in resonance, we determine the weighted median value and the weighted 68% confidence interval about the median for each model parameter from amongst the set of bestfitting orbits.</p><p>Furthermore, we report a "most likely orbit " (MLO) simply defined as follows. First, over the best-fitting family of orbits, we calculate histograms for the following parameters: logarithm of the semi-major axis (h log a ), eccentricity (h e ), inclination (h i ), longitude of ascending node (h Ω ), and argument of periastron (h ω ). For each orbit n in the best-fitting ensemble, we then define the measure of likelihood L(n) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L(n) = h log a (log a n ) · h e (e n ) · h i (i n ) · h Ω (Ω n ) · h ω (ω n ) · W,</formula><p>(1) i.e., the product of all histograms values in the bins in which the orbit n lies, representing the individual likelihood of each measured orbital parameter, as well as the statistical weight, W , representing the likelihood of the observed planet position within the orbit (i.e., the anomaly) 8 . The most likely orbit is then the one orbit that maximizes the measure of likelihood, L(n MLO ) = max n L(n). Because of the highly skewed distribution of some parameters from the best-fit orbits, in particular log a, the MLO parameters can differ significantly from the weighted median parameters. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes our results, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref> displays the orbits in a/i/e space (left), the histogram distribution of i (middle), and the histogram distribution of the longitude of the ascending node, Ω (right). The top panels display properties for HR 8799 b, the middle for HR 8799 c, and the bottom for HR 8799 d. Assuming a χ 2 cutoff of χ 2 min + 1, the observations well constrain the HR 8799 d orbit -a ∼ 24-32 AU, i ∼ 32-42 • , e ∼ 0.03-0.23, and Ω ∼ 43-63 • . They limit the HR 8799 c's most plausible orbital parameters to a ∼ 36-42 AU, i ∼ 13-26 • , and e ∼ 0.03-0.13. As expected, the parameters for HR 8799 b are the most poorly constrained, showing the widest dispersion and the largest differences between the median parameter value and that from the MLO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Results</head><p>Our analysis clearly disfavors face-on orbits for all three planets, especially for HR 8799 c and d. Additionally, the inclination distributions for HR 8799 bc appear systematically skewed towards values lower than those for d. Formally, though, the set of acceptably-fitting orbits HR 8799 bcd include some that make the planets coplanar.</p><p>Assuming a 4:2:1 mean-motion resonance configuration, we place far stronger limits on nearly all of the HR 8799 bcd orbital properties <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). This assumption explicitly rules out e &gt; 0.18 for HR 8799 bc and e &gt; 0. For this configuration, HR 8799 d (c) must be in an orbit viewed more than 25 • (15 • ) from face-on while HR 8799 b is likely inclined by at least 5 • . Furthermore, the inclination distributions between HR 8799 d and HR 8799 bc are even more dissimilar, implying that HR 8799 d is most likely inclined relative to c by at least ≈ 7 • and b by more than ≈ 21 • . While our analyses cannot conclusively rule out coplanar orbits in a 4:2:1 meanmotion resonance, they suggest that few such orbits are compatible with 12 years of HR 8799 planet astrometry.</p><p>To confirm that we are fully sampling the subset of orbital parameters covering the χ 2 minima, we run our simulations with a more relaxed χ 2 cutoff of χ 2 ≤ χ 2 min + [5, 5, 3.5] for HR 8799 b, c, and d, which formally admit an additional average deviation from the data of ≈ 0.3-σ for each measurement. With this cutoff, we obtain nearly identical results (second set of rows in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Considering the planets' orbits separately, we find a ∼ 23-31 AU, i ∼ 27-41 • , e ∼ 0.01-0.31, and Ω ∼ 41-53 • for HR 8799d. We find similar ranges in orbital parameters for HR 8799 c and (for the resonance case) HR 8799 b. Likewise, the planets' range of inclinations exclude face-on orbits. HR 8799 d's inclination distribution is skewed to systematically higher values, expected if it is non-coplanar with b and c, although here there are more orbit combinations that could make the planets coplanar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>From analyzing HR 8799 bcd astrometry from our new "pre-discovery" image and other data, we provide new constraints on the planets' orbital properties. Treating the three planets separately, we narrowly constrain three major orbital parameters (a/i/e) for HR 8799 c and d. None of the planets are likely to be orbiting face-on and the inclinations for acceptably-fitting orbits are systematically higher for HR 8799 d than for HR 8799 b and c.</p><p>If HR 8799 bcd have semimajor axes consistent with a 4:2:1 resonance, our analysis strongly constrains the major orbital properties for all three planets. The three planets (especially c and d) then even more obviously have inclined orbits. Most acceptable solutions for HR 8799 d place the planet on an orbit inclined by more than 7 • (21 • ) relative to HR 8799 b(c)'s orbit: few orbital solutions consistent with the astrometry also place them on coplanar orbits. Adopting a less restrictive definition for "acceptably-fitting" orbits does not undo any of these trends, although there are more orbit combinations making the planets coplanar. Adopting the median parameter value or MLO instead of the more conservative 68% confidence interval likewise does not change these results.</p><p>These results provide valuable input for constraining the mass of the HR 8799 planetary system. Longer-term astrometric monitoring of HR 8799 (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Konopacky et al. 2011</ref>) will better clarify the planets' orbital properties. Limits on the planets' dynamical masses will provide crucial input for planet cooling models and even more firmly establish HR 8799 as a benchmark system to understand the properties of young, self-luminous planets.</p><p>Finally, this work and other recent studies of HR 8799 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Soummer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lafreniére et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fukagawa et al. 2009</ref>) clearly demonstrate the value of publicly archiving data on advanced telescopes. In our case, detecting at least two HR 8799 planets (HR 8799 bc) was rather straightforward and did not require advanced image processing techniques developed well after the data were taken. As data for Keck and many other 8-10 m class telescopes are now archived, they provide an indispensible resource with which to confirm and characterize directly imaged planets like HR 8799's and other substellar companions.</p><p>We thank Christian Marois, Scott Kenyon, and the anonymous referee for helpful comments.

The panels show the orbits in a/e/i space (left) and histogram distributions of the orbital inclination i (middle panels) and longitude of ascending node (right panels). In the left panels, the 'x' identifies parameters e and ap from the best-fit orbital solution; the 'plus' sign denotes the weighted median value for the same parameters. For the middle and right panels, the vertical blue dashed line identifies the MLO, the vertical red dashed line identifies the median parameter value, and the vertical red dotted lines bracket the 68% confidence interval.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> We also considered a &quot;reference PSF library&quot; derived from other 2004-2005 NIRC2 data obtained with the same setup (coronagraph size, filter, etc.) to further attenuate speckles. However, this library degrades the SNR of HR 8799 b and c by ≈ 30-60% and renders HR 8799 d undetectable, because HR 8799&apos;s speckle patterns are poorly correlated with library&apos;s.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> Dynamical simulations identify stable solutions for at least some planet masses where only HR 8799 c and d are in resonance, so our conclusions from this set of astrometric analyses may be less applicable for HR 8799 b.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Here, the statistical weight W is defined as the mean orbital velocity for the corresponding orbit divided by the orbital velocity at the observed epoch, W := v orbit /v(t obs ).</note>
