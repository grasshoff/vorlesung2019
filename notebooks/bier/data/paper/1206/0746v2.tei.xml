			<abstract>
				<p>Magnetic (or tidal) interactions between &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; and their host stars can potentially enhance chromospheric and coronal activity. An ideal testbed for investigating this effect is provided by the extreme WASP-18 system, which features a massive (∼10 times Jupiter) close-in (&lt; ∼ 1 day period) transiting planet orbiting a young F6 star. Optical and X-ray observations of WASP-18 were conducted in November 2011. The high-resolution echelle spectrograph MIKE was used on the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope to obtain 13 spectra spanning planetary orbital phases of 0.7-1.4, while the X-ray Telescope on Swift provided contemporaneous monitoring with a stacked exposure of ∼50 ks. The cores of the Ca II H and K lines do not show significant variability over multiple orbits spanning ∼8 d, in contrast to the expectation of phase-dependent chromospheric activity enhancements for efficient star-planet interaction. The star is also X-ray faint, with log L X &lt; 27.6 erg s −1 (0.3-2 keV), indicating that coronal activity is likewise low. The lack of detectable star-planet interaction in this extreme system requires that any such effect must here be transient, if indeed present. We demonstrate that searches for Ca II H and K variability can potentially mistake a stellar hotspot, if observed over a short segment of the rotation period, for planet-induced activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the utility of star-planet interaction as a robust method of estimating exoplanet magnetic field strengths may be limited.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The possibility of magnetic star-planet interactions was initially explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuntz et al. (2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Rubenstein &amp; Schaefer 2000)</ref>, and this and subsequent work has indicated that reconnection events could be an important effect in "hot Jupiter" systems, acting to produce enhancements <ref type="bibr">5</ref> in chromospheric and coronal activity co-rotating with the planet rather than with the stellar rotation. It has been conjectured that the energy available from reconnection events should scale with the product of the stellar and planetary magnetic field strengths, as well as the relative velocity of the magnetic field lines, and inversely with approximately the square of the orbital semi-major axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cuntz et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashyap et al. 2008</ref>). Consequently, a calibrated relationship between the amplitude of star-planet interaction and stellar and orbital parameters could permit estimation of exoplanet magnetic field strengths. Throughout this work we quantify interaction strength in otherwise similar systems as M P /a 2 , where a is the semi-major axis in AU and the planetary magnetic field strength is taken to scale with the planetary mass M P (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arge et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stevens 2005)</ref>; this is broadly consistent with the various proposed trends investigated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashyap et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Scharf 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Poppen- haeger et al. 2010</ref>). Numerical studies suggest that starplanet interactions can potentially generate sufficient energy to be observable as, e.g., phase-variable core Ca II H and K or X-ray emission (probing chromospheric and coronal activity, respectively) in monitoring of individual hot Jupiter systems, or as a greater average level of activity in systems with more massive or closer-in planets. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lanza et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lanza et al. ( , 2011</ref>) modeled chromospheric hot spots in several systems (offset from the subplanetary point by varying degrees) as arising from star-planet magnetic reconnection events, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cohen et al. (2009</ref>) carried out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrating that close-in giant planets can produce an increase in overall stellar activity and generate (non-persistent) coronal hot spots that rotate synchronously with the planet (albeit potentially shifted in phase); see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pillitteri et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Observational evidence of magnetic star-planet interaction has now been presented for several individual systems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shkolnik et al. (2005)</ref> examined 10 stars (K1 to F7) known at the time to possess massive, close-in planets (median minimum planetary mass M P sin i = 0.6M Jup , median orbital period P = 3.4 d), in low-eccentricity orbits, and claimed evidence of starplanet interaction in HD 179949 and υ And (both F8) based on slight Ca II H and K emission variability 6 synchronized with the planetary period (see also discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gu et al. 2005</ref>), although this synchronization is apparently transient <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shkolnik et al. 2008)</ref>. Chandra observations of HD 179949 showed variable X-ray emission with an apparent maximum near the phase associated with Ca II H and K enhancement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Saar et al. 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fares et al. (2012)</ref> carried out spectropolarimetric observations of HD 179949, finding that the stellar magnetosphere is highly tilted (producing two maxima per rotation period) and that chromospheric activity is primarily linked to stellar rotation, although low-level fluctuations near the beat period could be planet-induced (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gurdemir et al. 2012</ref>). Later Chandra observations of υ And (as well as concurrent optical spectroscopy) did not find any indications of star-planet interaction <ref type="bibr">(Pop- penhaeger et al. 2011a</ref>). Interaction was claimed for τ Boo (F7) based primarily on photometric spot modeling, although the tidal-locking of the star to the planet complicates interpretation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Walker et al. 2008</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. 2008</ref>). HD 189733 (K0) twice showed an X-ray flare after secondary eclipse ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pillitteri et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pillitteri et al. , 2011</ref>) but chromospheric variability appears to be tied to stellar rotation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fares et al. 2010)</ref>. Optical spectroscopy of several systems (including υ And and τ Boo) carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lenz et al. (2011)</ref> did not find evidence of planet-induced chromospheric activity, but did identify potential interaction between the M dwarf HD 41004B (which has binary, planet-bearing K dwarf companion HD 41004A) and its brown-dwarf companion HD 41004Bb. As a counterexample, 51 Peg (G5) is one of several systems in which a sensitive search did not uncover evidence of star-planet interaction; its low L X and low log R ′ HK suggest it may in fact be in an extended state of especially low activity, analogous to the Sun's Maunder minimum ( <ref type="bibr">Poppenhaeger et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Several other studies have used large samples of planetbearing stars to test for significantly increased activity in hot Jupiter systems, statistically averaging over orbital phase. X-ray investigations of potential planetinduced enhancements in coronal activity have to date provided mixed results. This may be due to the difficulty of controlling for selection effects (more active stars, which tend to be brighter in X-rays, are disproportionately identified as planet-bearing with high mass, close-in planets, since those stellar properties limit detectability of low mass, distant planets) or may be related to sampling a heterogeneous mix of late-type (typically F, G, K, and M) stellar classes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashyap et al. (2008)</ref> considered a large sample primarily drawn from ROSAT pointed and all-sky survey (RASS) observations (containing ∼30%/70% X-ray detections/upper limits) and found that, after attempting to control for selection effects, stars with close-in planets (a &lt; 0.15 AU) were 1.3-4 times more X-ray luminous than stars with distant (a &gt; 1.5 AU) planets. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Scharf (2010)</ref>, using RASS data again with a high percentage of upper limits, did not find enhanced X-ray emission for closein planets (note that their distant planets encompassed a &gt; 0.15 AU) and estimated their L X − M P correlation to be robust against observational bias. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr">Poppenhaeger et al. (2010)</ref> looked at a volumelimited (d &lt; 30 pc) sample of stars observed with XMMNewton or ROSAT and found no significant correlations of L X /L bol with M P or a; they explain the possible correlation of L X with M P /a as arising entirely from selection effects. Importantly, <ref type="bibr">Poppenhaeger et al. (2011b)</ref> demonstrated that distance in shallow RASS datasets covaries with both L X and M P (indicating that deeper observations are essential to sidestep selection effects) and that apparent correlations with L X vanish when L X /L bol is used instead (thereby controlling, to first order, for spectral class). Large-sample studies of potential planetinduced enhancements in chromospheric activity have also given mixed results; Canto <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Martins et al. (2011)</ref> find no obvious correlations between planetary mass or semi-major axis and the Ca II H and K activity indicator log R ′ HK , whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krejčová &amp; Budaj (2012)</ref> do find these variables to correlate but only within the subset of cooler host stars with T eff &lt; 5500 K.</p><p>In this paper, we present a sensitive search for starplanet interaction in the extreme WASP-18 system. If star-planet interaction is to become a useful probe of exoplanet magnetic field strengths in hot Jupiter systems, additional convincing instances, beyond the handful suggested to date, must be identified. Observations of a strongly-interacting system could constitute a contextual template to guide interpretation of results in more weakly-interacting systems (including those already studied). Additionally, a robust measurement of star-planet interaction in an extreme high-mass, shortperiod system would supply productive leverage for uncovering and later quantifying scaling relations. Conversely, a failure to detect planet-induced stellar activity in an extreme system would severely constrain the practical relevance of star-planet interaction and could impact theoretical understanding and numerical modeling of this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">WASP-18 in context</head><p>We identified WASP-18 as the potentially most strongly interacting system among currently discovered exoplanets, a distinction it retains as of April 2012. We obtained a list of all confirmed planets with M P &gt; 0.1M J (i.e., planetary mass greater than 10% that of Jupiter), orbital period P &lt; 100 d, and V &lt; 15 from the Exoplanet Orbit Database <ref type="bibr">7 (Wright et al. 2011</ref>). As may be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, WASP-18b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hellier et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">South- worth et al. 2009</ref>), with M P = 10.4M J , P = 0.941 d, and a = 0.020 AU, has the largest value of the interaction strength proxy M P /a 2 within this sample (and would also rank first for other plausible parameterizations of interaction strength). More specifically, after excluding brown dwarfs (with M P &gt; 13M Jup ), of the 551 entries in the Exoplanet Orbit Database, the M P /a 2 ≃ 25000 M Jup AU −2 for WASP-18 is nearly 2.5 times greater than the next largest value (CoRoT-14b), and only 5 systems have M P /a 2 &gt; 5000 M Jup AU −2 . Because WASP-18 is a transiting system, the planetary properties are securely established by lightcurve and radial-velocity measurements. The values of M P /a 2 are also labeled for several systems described in §1; for example, HD 179949 has M P /a 2 ≃ 500 M Jup AU −2 .</p><p>The stellar and planetary properties for the WASP-18 system are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, as are those for previously identified star-planet interaction candidates HD 179949, υ And, and τ Boo (but recall τ Boo is tidally locked, with stellar and orbital periods of ∼3.2 d, which may suppress magnetic interaction). The value of M P /a 2 for WASP-18b exceeds that for the other candidate systems by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Such extreme planetary systems are difficult to maintain, and WASP-18b itself is expected to have a short lifetime against infall from tidal drag ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hellier et al. 2009</ref>). The star WASP-18 has spectral type F6, effective temperature T eff = 6400 ± 100 K, and stellar mass M * = 1.22 ± 0.03 M ⊙ (values from the Exoplanet Orbit Database, from which original references may be obtained); conveniently, these are similar to the properties of HD 179949 (F8, 6170 K, 1.18 M ⊙ ), υ And (F8, 6210 K, 1.31 M ⊙ ), and τ Boo (F7, 6390 K, 1.34 M ⊙ ). WASP-18 is slightly hotter than HD 179949 and υ And, and consequently likely possesses a slightly shallower outer convection zone. On the other hand, the stellar rotation period is shorter, at ∼5.6 d, estimated from v sin i = 11 km s −1 ; the orbit and stellar rotation are aligned 8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Triaud et al. 2010)</ref>. HD 179949 and υ And have rotational periods of 7.6 d <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fares et al. 2012</ref>) and ∼12 d <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shkolnik et al. 2008</ref>), respectively. Further, WASP-18 appears to be a younger star, with an age of ∼500-700 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hellier et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. 2011</ref>). The age-rotation-activity relation would then predict relatively greater intrinsic activity in WASP-18, apart from any planet-induced modulation or enhancement (but see §3.2 for caveats). Observationally, WASP-18 has other appealing features: the star is among the brighter transit-detected systems, and the short planetary period facilitates rapid accumulation of phase coverage across multiple orbits. Due to its extreme properties, WASP-18 has been studied at a range of frequencies; for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nymeyer et al. (2011)</ref> used Spitzer observations of secondary eclipse to infer that the planet has T ≃3100 K with near-zero values for both albedo and day/night side energy redistribution. However, highresolution, high signal-to-noise Ca II H and K spectroscopy and sensitive X-ray observations have not been published prior to the observations presented here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data acquisition and reduction</head><p>Optical spectroscopy was carried out with the 6.5m Clay Telescope on Nov. 6-7 and 10-13 2011 using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE), a highthroughput double echelle spectrograph. A 0.7×5 ′′ slit was used throughout, providing a resolution of R≃40000 near the Ca II H and K lines. A communication board failure prevented use of the blue-side CCD on Nov. 10 and bad weather limited observing on Nov. 11. In total, 13 visits to WASP-18 were obtained, with combined exposure times of 20-40 minutes per visit. The planetary orbital phase coverage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>) spans 0.7-1.4 and includes one visit at central planetary transit.</p><p>The spectra were reduced using the IDL MIKE Redux 9 package. Briefly, milky flats (taken of δ Ori with the diffuser) were combined and normalized to correct pixel response variations; trace flats (from internal lamps) were combined for order and slit tracing; arc images (including one associated with each science exposure) were processed and used to derive two-dimensional wavelength maps, using a fifth-degree polynomial fit along the orders which was found to give generally structureless residuals; the slit profile was determined for each order; science exposures were processed (bias-subtracted from overscan and flat-corrected), the object was traced and the sky subtracted, and the object flux was optimally extracted. Flux is retained in relative units (i.e., no spectrophotometric standard star calibration was conducted) as we are interested in normalized spectra. Automated cosmic ray correction was not performed due to concern about potential introduction of spurious variability; two science frames with an obvious cosmic ray located near the twodimensional center of the Ca II K line were discarded.</p><p>Contemporaneous monitoring was obtained with the Swift satellite from Nov. 1-17 (Target ID 32149), notably with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) through 58 snapshots of 500-1500 seconds each.The XRT observations were reduced using HEASARC version 6.11.1. An exposure map was generated for each sequence, including a vignetting correction and with time-dependent instrument maps used whenever attitude variations exceeded 2.4 ′′ . Images were extracted in both the full (0.3-10 keV) and soft (0.3-2 keV) bands. The stacked XRT effective exposure from all sequences at the position of WASP-18 reached ∼50 ks. The UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) was also used to obtain both photometry (with the U, UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 filters) and UV grism spectroscopy, with coverage of the Mg II h and k lines which are also chromospheric activity indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Buccino &amp; Mauas 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Analysis and results</head><p>We checked for phase-dependent variability, as from one-sided enhanced chromospheric activity, within the cores of the Ca II H and K lines, focusing primarily upon the latter. The Ca II K line and nearby stellar continuum were isolated through selecting wavelengths spanning 3920-3950Å3950Å, which included contributions from two orders. For each visit, the flux from individual exposures was summed, and the wavelength scale was ad- justed through subtraction of a center-of-mass velocity of 3.1961 km s −1 and a stellar reflex velocity with an amplitude of 1.8183 km s −1 , using the values and ephemeris from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hellier et al. (2009)</ref>. Continuum normalization near the Ca II H and K regions is difficult because the absorption lines are quite broad relative to the blaze function, there are a large number of nearby metal lines, and the Wien tail is falling off steeply. We used a similar normalization method to that conducted and detailed by <ref type="bibr">Shkol- nik et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr">Shkol- nik et al. ( , 2008</ref>, removing a slight linear trend over ≃7Å≃7Å centered near the line cores, such that unity represents approximately one-third of the local stellar continuum. The normalized Ca II H and K spectra for all 13 visits are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3 (top)</ref>.</p><p>Residuals from median normalized Ca II H and K spectra were calculated for each visit, and then stacked (weighted by exposure times corrected for seeing) within orbital phase bins of 0.70-0.93, 0.99-1.19, and 1.21-1.41; these bins then contain spectra from 4, 5, and 4 visits, respectively. The residuals were boxcar smoothed with a width of 0.4 ˚ A and then any remaining slight linear trend was subtracted to avoid influencing comparison of the line core. There is no obvious difference in the residual spectra within the three separate phase bins, to an amplitude of 0.003 of the normalized continuum <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig- ure 3, bottom)</ref>.  core, and lags rather than leads the subplanetary point; these effects are inconsistent with planetary magnetic interaction.</p><p>The XRT observations were initially planned for similar phase-resolved analysis, but the star proved to be unexpectedly X-ray faint (see also §3.2) and so all sequences were combined for an effective exposure of ∼50 ks. WASP-18 is not detected by XRT in the stacked exposure, in either the soft <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref> or the full bands. Specifically, within an aperture of 20 ′′ centered on the SIMBAD optical position of WASP-18, there are 3.8 counts in the 0.3-2 keV band, where the expected background is 3.7 counts. The 95% upper limit on the source counts within 20 ′′ is &lt; 5.9 net counts (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kraft et al. 1991</ref>), corresponding to &lt; 8.1 total net counts after accounting for the XRT point spread function ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moretti et al. 2005)</ref>. For a coronal model with kT =1 keV and solar abundances the unabsorbed 0.3-2 keV X-ray flux is &lt; 3.3×10 −15 erg s −1 , calculated using the Portable Interactive Multi-Mission Simulator (PIMMS 11 ) for a plasma/APEC model presuming an intervening column of N H = 10 18−19 cm −2 ; other plausible models give similar results to within &lt; ∼ 30% (or 0.1 dex). At the Hipparcos distance to WASP-18 of 100 ± 10.6 pc, this corresponds to a limiting X-ray luminosity of log L X &lt; 27.6 erg s −1 (0.3-2 keV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We compare the observed persistent low activity in WASP-18 to expectations for planet-induced variability, as well as to the intrinsic properties of similar stars, and additionally explore the general possibility of stellar hotspots acting to mimic star-planet interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Expected variability in WASP-18</head><p>Past work would seem to suggest that the degree of planet-induced Ca II H and K variability expected for WASP-18 could be substantial. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. ( , 2008</ref> report "on/off" Ca II H and K variability phased with the planetary orbital period in HD 179949 and υ And (see also <ref type="bibr">Poppenhaeger et al. 2011a</ref>), which have stellar types of F8 and do not show obvious core emission within the deep photospheric absorption (similar to WASP-18). The amplitude of residual flux associated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. (2008,</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>; 2005, <ref type="figure">Figure  6</ref>) with star-planet activity in HD 179949 (υ And) is ≃0.017 (≃0.008). <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The value of M P /a 2 for WASP-18 could suggest an effect 50 (130) times greater than for HD 179949 (υ And). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In contrast to such predictions, the level of phase-binned variability observed for WASP-18 is &lt; ∼ 0.003 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>; §2.2), below the levels detected in HD 179949 and υ And.</p><p>The degree of X-ray variability expected in WASP-18 is more difficult to estimate, as only a handful of X-ray brightening events have been attributed to potential star-planet interaction. For example, HD 179949 displayed an increase in X-ray emission by ∼30% near the phase associated with the Ca II H and K enhancement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Saar et al. 2008</ref>); with a stellar X-ray luminosity of log L X = 28.6 erg s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashyap et al. 2008)</ref>, this is an increase of log L X = 28.1 erg s −1 . HD 189733 showed two X-ray flares near phase 0.53 (i.e., shortly after occultation), peaking at twice the baseline count rate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pillitteri et al. 2011</ref>); with a stellar X-ray luminosity of log L X = 28.4 erg s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kashyap et al. 2008)</ref>, this is an increase of log L X = 28.4 erg s −1 . Cohen et al. (2011) used their MHD modeling of the HD 189733 system to estimate that the energy available from magnetic reconnection to accelerate particles into the stellar corona is ∼10 28 erg s −1 (after applying conservative efficiency assumptions). From these examples, WASP-18 might be expected, taking into account its exceptional value of M P /a 2 , to possess interaction energy available for coronal activity enhancement sufficient to generate absolute increases in its X-ray luminosity by several times 10 28 erg s −1 . However, the observed XRT upper limit of log L X &lt; 27.6 erg s −1 indicates that the X-ray luminosity did not achieve this level for any more than &lt; ∼ 10% of the Swift coverage. Without even a stacked X-ray detection it is not possible to evaluate the relative amplitude of phase-dependent X-ray variability, if any, in WASP-18.</p><p>The scaling of star-planet interaction strength with <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The ratio of residuals for HD 179949 and υ And is ∼2, while the ratio of M P /a 2 is ∼2.5. However, given the dissimilarity of other parameters, such as intrinsic stellar activity, and the apparent variability of any star-planet interaction in these systems, we do not consider this necessarily informative. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> While less physically motivated, alternative scalings with either separately 1/a 2 or M P would still predict a substantially greater effect for WASP-18, by a factor of 4.8 (8.7) or 11 (15) compared to HD 179949 (υ And). M P /a 2 that we (and others; §1) have adopted approximately holds for otherwise similar systems. We briefly consider the impact upon the energy available for starplanet interaction due to potentially differing planetary or stellar magnetic field strengths in WASP-18 compared to HD 179949 and υ And. The planetary magnetic field strength depends most relevantly upon M P but also scales inversely with the planetary rotational period. For tidally-locked planets, as all these are believed to be (out to ∼0.15 AU; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bodenheimer et al. 2001</ref>), the planetary rotation period is identical to the orbital period, and both are substantially shorter for WASP-18 than for HD 179949 or υ And. This suggests ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arge et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sánchez-Lavega 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stevens 2005</ref>) an increase in baseline planetary magnetic field strength by a factor of a few, which would enhance any star-planet interaction. The relative velocity between magnetic field lines, which is governed by the difference between the planetary and stellar rotation rates, is v rel = K(R * /a)−v rot for tidally-locked planets, where K is the orbital velocity and v rot is the equatorial stellar rotational velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cuntz et al. 2000)</ref>. This would suggest a further increase in interaction strength by a factor of a few. On the other hand, the interaction strength approximately scales with the stellar magnetic field, B * ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuntz et al. 2000;</ref>; see Lanza 2009 and Scharf 2010 for slightly different formulations), which appears to be substantially weaker in WASP-18 than in at least HD 179949 and perhaps also υ And. This is evident by the X-ray nondetection of WASP-18, as B * is observed to depend approximately linearly upon L X ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pevtsov et al. 2003</ref>). That log (L X /L bol ) is at least one order of magnitude lower in WASP-18 than HD 179949 possibly offsets any gains in interaction strength due to faster planetary rotation, although the difference in inferred stellar magnetic field strengths is less between WASP-18 and υ And. However, since the observed amplitude of Ca II H and K variability in WASP-18 is already &gt; ∼ 5 times lower than that suggested to arise from star-planet interaction in HD 179949, B * would need to be &gt; ∼ 50 times lower in WASP-18 than  Note. -Data is taken from the Exoplanet Orbit Database (http://www.exoplanets.org ), except for planetary mass and system age which are from the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia (http://www.exoplanet.eu), and log L X which is from this work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Poppenhaeger et al.

Starplanet interaction in WASP-18 would seem to be at best highly transient as it was not demonstrably present during our observations. For reference, Ca II H and K variability has been described as phased with the planetary orbit in &lt; ∼ 50% of the epochs at which HD 179949 and υ And have been observed. Further, the timescale for a magnetic reconnection event in the simulations of Cohen et al. (2011) is short, ∼0.25 orbits. On the other hand, our spectroscopic coverage of WASP-18 extends over 8 complete planetary orbits, and the X-ray observations cover many more (albeit at lower sensitivity per orbit). To the extent that star-planet interactions are transient, they should intuitively occur with greater frequency in extreme systems such as WASP-18, which contrasts (if not definitively) with our findings. It might be alternatively suggested that, if our observations did not simply happen to take place within a period of relative quiescence, the efficiency of star-planet interaction for WASP-18 could be lower than has been identified in the past for less extreme systems. However, we emphasize again that WASP-18 is not notably distinctive in terms of stellar properties from HD 179949 and υ And. (Below, we explore the possibility that the particularly massive and close-in planet in WASP-18 actually acts to suppress stellar activity.)</p><p>Regardless of its underlying cause, this lack of observed variability in WASP-18 demonstrates that even extreme systems, arguably the best candidates to display planet-induced activity enhancements, challenge prevailing ideas concerning star-planet interaction. The appealing prospect of calibrating star-planet interactions to estimate exoplanet magnetic field strengths would currently appear to require additional unambiguous evidence of such interactions occurring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Expected intrinsic activity in WASP-18</head><p>We next consider the overall baseline level of chromospheric and coronal activity in WASP-18, to provide context for the non-detection of planet-induced variability. WASP-18 shows atypically low Ca II H and K core emission for its spectral class and inferred age (contrast with, e.g., HD 111456; Freire <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ferrero et al. 2004</ref>). When stellar age is calculated from Ca II activity, main-sequence F, G, K, or M stars with inferred ages of 340-740 Myr (i.e., similar to the age of WASP-18, which is not based on Ca II activity 14 ) are chromospherically "active" (following the definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Henry et al. 1996)</ref>, with characteristic values of −4.5 &lt; R ′ HK &lt; −4.4 (from data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wright et al. 2004</ref>). While stars with 0.48 &lt; B − V &lt; 0.52, as for WASP-18, display a wide range of activity, they are significantly less likely to have R ′ HK &lt; −5.0 (19%, versus 37% for F, G, K, and M stars; from data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wright et al. 2004</ref>). However, R ′ HK in WASP-18 is low; if estimated indirectly based on the R ′ HK − log (L X /L bol ) correlation presented in <ref type="bibr">Mama- jek &amp; Hillenbrand (2008)</ref>, the measured X-ray limit for WASP-18 suggests R ′ HK &lt; ∼ − 5.0. 15 The X-ray luminosity for WASP-18 is also lower than predicted. Nine nearby stars of spectral class F5V-F7V (i.e., matched to WASP-18) in a volume-limited ROSAT sample have X-ray luminosities of 27.5 &lt; log L X &lt; 29.0 erg s −1 , with mean and median values of log L X ≃ 28.3 erg s −1 (from data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmitt &amp; Liefke 2004</ref>). However, WASP-18 is younger than typical main-sequence stars and should consequently be more X-ray luminous. While we are not aware of a specific comprehensive study of young F stars, in general the X-ray luminosity of F5+ stars modestly exceeds that of G stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schmitt 1997)</ref> and Hyades G stars (hence of a similar age to WASP-18) have mean log L X ≃ 28.8 erg s −1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stelzer &amp; Neuhäuser 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Preibisch &amp; Feigelson 2005)</ref>. Consequently, the XRT-derived limit of log L X &lt; ∼ 27.6 erg s −1 marks WASP-18 as notably X-ray-faint relative to comparable stars, with a log (L X /L bol ) &lt; ∼ −6.2 similar to that of the Sun.</p><p>In summary, not only is there no apparent enhancement in chromospheric or coronal activity in WASP-18 that might be linked to interaction with the planet, but rather the above results, taken together, suggest that WASP-18 is unusually quiet for a young F6 star. It is possible that the stellar age is incorrect; the 1σ error bars on the measurement given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hellier et al. (2009)</ref> encompass &gt; ∼ 1 Gyr, and the Brown et al. (2011) estimate depends upon complicated planet-star interactions. If the planet has acted to spin-up the star (recall the orbital plane and the stellar rotation axis are aligned), the current relatively rapid stellar rotation rate would not be reflective of true age. Stellar age has proven difficult to determine in some other hot-Jupiter systems; for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schröter et al.(2011)</ref> find that CoRoT-2a is X-ray bright and young but a late-K companion is X-ray undetected, inconsistent with the inferred system age, and a similar situation may apply for HD <ref type="bibr">189733 (Pillitteri et al. 2011</ref>). If WASP-18 were 2-3 times older than current estimates, the intrinsic activity would still be somewhat low but to a much less unusual degree. If the age is indeed correct, it is natural to consider whether the extremely massive and close-in planet could act to suppress, rather than enhance, stellar activity. The tidal force exerted by WASP-18 upon its parent star is much greater than is typical even for hot Jupiter systems, and in fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arras et al. (2012)</ref> note that the small but apparently non-zero eccentricity indicated by radial-velocity data is likely due to tidal fluid motion on the star. Midtype F stars have shallow outer convective zones; perhaps the tidal pull is sufficient to repress dynamo activity in WASP-18 or comparably extreme systems (of which none are, however, currently known). This possibility could be assessed through magnetohydrodynamic simulations.</p><p>3.3. An additional challenge to observations of star-planet interaction Here we explore the possibility that a hotspot rotating upon the stellar surface can potentially mimic a shorter-period signature of star-planet interaction if only observed over a small fraction of the stellar rotation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows simulated examples for HD 179949 and υ And, which have stellar/planetary periods of 7/3.09 and 14/4.618 days, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shkolnik et al. 2008</ref>). The half and full sinusoid models for planet-induced activity chosen for these examples are similar to those applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shkolnik et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. ( , 2008</ref>) to these systems, but here for an edge-on inclination and with arbitrary normalizations. (By construction the stellar hotspot amplitude is taken as unity, and the relative amplitude of the interaction model is then greater for HD 179949 than for υ And, also qualitatively similar to the published models.) The probability of the stellar and planetary phases co-aligning to mimic star-planet interaction for these particular models is not very large (e.g., ≃3% of 10000 random phase offsets for each example yield total squared residuals less than 0.1), but with additional freedom to adjust the relative amplitudes, or to consider additional parameters (such as spot latitude or system inclination, within a limited range) or to choose from alternative model functional forms, or with a greater tolerance for (apparent) outliers, this effect could potentially present a significant source of contamination within a large sample of tested stars. For the particular cases of HD 179949 and υ And it must be emphasized that several observing runs were conducted, and in some (but not all) of those runs variability of similar amplitude similarly phased with the planetary orbit was observed <ref type="bibr">(Shkol- nik et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">(Shkol- nik et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Poppenhaeger et al. 2011a</ref>), which clearly decreases the probability of mistaking a stellar hotspot for one co-rotating with the planet.</p><p>We note that, in general, searches for star-planet interaction based on Ca II core variability can guard against this type of false positive at a given epoch through obtaining coverage over at least one complete stellar rotation and over multiple planetary orbits (as was done with our coverage of WASP-18). If searches over multiple epochs find some instances in which core variability phases with the stellar rotation and others in which it apparently matches the orbital period, a comparison of the amplitudes can also check whether the observed activity is likely to arise from distinct (intrinsic versus planet-induced) sources. It would be odd if the activity in the "off" state (phased with stellar rotation rather than orbital period) had a similar amplitude to that seen in the "on" state, during which there is no obvious physical reason that the star should otherwise go silent. It is not clear to us that the current data for HD 179949 and υ And can definitively pass this test, but see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fares et al. (2012)</ref>. In any case, the conclusion is that complete and extended coverage, preferably across multiple epochs and multiple orbits per epoch, is essential for high-confidence detections of star-planet interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have carried out a sensitive search for planetinduced stellar activity within the extreme WASP-18 system, selected as an ideal testbed for investigating potential magnetic (or tidal) interactions between "hot Jupiters" and their host stars. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Ca II H and K lines was conducted with the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope and contemporaneous X-ray monitoring was obtained with the Swift satellite. Our primary results are the following:</p><p>1. The Ca II H and K cores do not show significant variability over ∼8 d. Stacking residual spectra from 13 visits into phase bins of 0.70-0.93, 0.99-1.19, and 1.21-1.41 does not show any significant structural changes that could be attributed to planetary influence.</p><p>2. WASP-18 is not detected in a stacked 50 ks XRT exposure, constraining the X-ray luminosity to be unusually low for a young F6 star, with log L X &lt; 27.6.</p><p>3. The lack of observed variability phased with the planetary orbit suggests any magnetic star-planet interaction in WASP-18 must be transient, if present at all.</p><p>4. The low level of chromospheric and coronal activity is consistent with an intrinsically weak magnetic field on WASP-18, perhaps indicating that the inferred young stellar age is not reliable, or alternatively potentially related to particularly strong planetary tidal effects.</p><p>5. It is demonstrated that a stellar hotspot can potentially mimic star-planet interaction, for observations truncated to a short segment of the rotation period.</p><p>6. Current ideas concerning star-planet interaction do not appear to be supported by the above results, therefore it may be optimistic at present to conceive of star-planet interaction as a robust estimator of exoplanet magnetic field strengths.</p><p>Further high-quality Ca II H and K spectroscopy (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shkolnik et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shkolnik et al. , 2008</ref> of previously monitored and newly discovered systems would refine understanding of the observational signatures of star-planet interaction. In addition, we are currently carrying out a Chandra survey of solar analogs to check whether stars with close-in planets are systematically enhanced in X-ray luminosity, and this experiment has been designed to sidestep many of the selection biases that necessarily challenged previous large-sample X-ray studies. That investigation will help further clarify whether the difficulties in establishing observational evidence of star-planet interaction in WASP-18 are anomalous or typical.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
