				<p>We consider the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the gravitational field of the Sun within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We solve Maxwell&apos;s equations for the EM field propagating on the background of a static mass monopole and find an exact closed form solution for the Debye potentials, which, in turn, yield a solution to the problem of diffraction of EM waves in the gravitational field of the Sun. The solution is given in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function and, as such, it is valid for all distances and angles. Using this solution, we develop a wave-theoretical description of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) and derive expressions for the EM field and energy flux in the immediate vicinity of the focal line of the SGL. Aiming at the potential practical applications of the SGL, we study its optical properties and discuss its suitability for direct high-resolution imaging of a distant exoplanet.</p>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to Einstein's general theory of relativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, gravitation induces refractive properties on spacetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with massive objects acting as lenses by bending photon trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and amplifying brightness of faint sources. Experimental confirmation of the general relativistic gravitational bending of light nearly a century ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> unambiguously established that celestial bodies act as gravitational lenses, deflecting light from distant sources. The properties of gravitational lenses, including light amplification and the appearance of ringlike images (Einstein rings), are well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and have a rich literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Compact, opaque and spherical bodies acting as gravitational lenses could be used as diffractive telescopes to form images of distant objects at extreme resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Unlike an optical lens, a gravitational lens is astigmatic, with the bending angle inversely proportional to the impact parameter of a light ray with respect to the lens. Therefore, such a lens has no single focal point but a focal line. Although all the bodies in the solar system may act as gravitational lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, only the Sun is massive and compact enough for the focus of its gravitational deflection to be within the range of a realistic deep space mission. Its focal line begins at ∼547.8 astronomical units (AU). A probe positioned beyond this distance from the Sun could use the solar gravitational lens (SGL) to magnify light from distant objects on the opposite side of the Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, the unique properties of the SGL garnered increasing attention. On the one hand, the discovery of numerous exoplanets by the Kepler telescope, including those that may be Earth-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, created interest in methods to image these distant worlds. On the other hand, the success of the Voyager-1 spacecraft, operating at a distance of nearly 140 AU from the Sun, demonstrates the feasibility of long-duration deep-space missions to the outer solar system, including regions where images are formed by the SGL. The idea of using the SGL for direct megapixel high-resolution imaging of an object of extreme interest, such as a habitable exoplanet, was only recently suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It was extensively discussed within the context of a recent study at the Keck Institute for Space Studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the past, only the amplification properties of the SGL under a set of idealized physical conditions were explored, considering only the gain of a combined receiver consisting of a large parabolic radio antenna, at the focus of which there was a single pixel detector situated on the focal line of the SGL <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The SGL's imaging properties, where the image occupies many pixels in the immediate vicinity of the focal line, are still not fully explored (except perhaps for some introductory considerations on geometric raytracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>), especially in a deep-space mission context. In addition, the SGL's potential for high-resolution spectroscopy should also be considered.</p><p>The reason for the large amplification of the SGL is the fact that, as a typical gravitational lens, the SGL forms a folded caustic <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> in its focal area. As the wavelength of light is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, the wavefront in the focal region of the SGL is dominated by the caustic and singularities typical for geometric optics. In reality, the geometric singularities are softened and decorated on fine scales by wave effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Despite leading to divergent results, geometric optics may be used to predict the focal line, and make qualitative arguments about the magnification and the size of the image. However, designing a telescope entails addressing practical questions concerning the magnification, resolution, field of view (FOV), and the plate scale of the imaging system. These parameters are usually estimated by a wave optics approach and are needed to assess the imaging potential of the SGL. Recently, we reported on a method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> of providing a wave-theoretical description of the SGL, demonstrating that with its light amplification power of ∼ 10 11 (for λ = 1 µm) and angular resolution of 10 −10 arcsec, the SGL may be used for direct megapixel imaging of an exoplanet. In this paper we provide details of this derivation. This paper is structured as follows: In Sec. II, we consider propagation of electromagnetic waves in the Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR). We establish a set of equations that guide the evolution of EM wave in the presence of a static gravitational monopole. We solve these equations in the post-Newtonian approximation of the GR. In Sec. III we find exact solutions for the Debye potentials for the EM waves traversing the field of a static gravitational monopole. We derive the components of the entire EM field and determine the components of the relevant Poynting vector. Our results yield a wave-optical description of a monopole gravitational lens and are valid for any distances and angles, including those in the immediate vicinity of the focal line. In Sec. IV we provide preliminary considerations for imaging with the Solar Gravitational Telescope (SGT) and its potential application for direct multipixel imaging and spectroscopy of an exoplanet. In Section V we discuss our results and the potential of using the SGL for remote investigations of faint distant objects. In an attempt to streamline the discussion, we placed some important but technically lengthy derivations into appendices. Appendix A contains a summary of results concerning the (3 + 1) decomposition of a general Riemannian metric and relevant useful relations. Appendix B is devoted to a description of light propagation in a weak, static gravitational field. We solve the geodesic equation and model the phase evolution in the context of geometric optics. We also discuss spherical waves in the post-Newtonian gravity. In Appendix C we present useful properties of the confluent hypergeometric functions. Appendix D discusses Coulomb functions. Appendix E introduces Debye potentials as a means to represent the electromagnetic field. Finally, Appendix F discusses the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN A STATIC GRAVITATIONAL FIELD</head><p>To describe the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL), we use a static harmonic metric 1 in the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. The line element for this metric may be given, in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ds 2 = u −2 c 2 dt 2 − u 2 dr 2 + r 2 (dθ 2 + sin 2 θdφ 2 ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where, to the accuracy sufficient to describe light propagation in the solar system, the quantity u can be given in terms of the Newtonian potential U as u = 1 + c −2 U + O(c −4 ), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U (x) = G ρ(x ′ )d 3 x ′ |x − x ′ | .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The metric (1)-(2) allows us to consider the largest effects of the gravitational field of the Sun on propagation of light, those due to the static distribution of matter inside the Sun. One may also want to consider including solar rotation, but its effect, although measurable, is much less than those of the solar monopole and quadrupole <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Thus, the solar spin is not present in the metric above. Nevertheless, if needed, one can always consider the effect of the solar rotation on the properties of the SGL using the same methods that are developed in this paper. Also, the gravitational field of the Sun is weak: its potential is GM/c 2 r 2 × 10 −6 everywhere in the solar system. This allows us to carry out calculations to the first post-Newtonian order, while dropping higher-order terms.</p><p>The generally covariant form of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic (EM) field is well known:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∂ l F ik + ∂ i F kl + ∂ k F li = 0, 1 √ −g ∂ k √ −gF ik = − 4π c j i ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where F ik is the antisymmetric Maxwell tensor of the EM field <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, g mn is a Riemann metric tensor with g = det g mn its determinant, and ∂ k are coordinate derivatives.</p><p>Note that in this paper we study the propagation of the EM waves on the background of the Sun without accounting for the corona. That is to say, we do not consider contributions of the solar plasma to light propagation. The refractive properties of the solar corona are such that for high-frequency EM waves such as visible light, one may neglect the refractive effects of the solar plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. This may not be the case for any noise contribution to an image due to the brightness of the corona. These issues will be addressed elsewhere. Here we consider only a purely gravitational case, accounting only for the shadow due to a spherical Sun, but ignoring the corona.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Maxwell's equations in three-dimensional form</head><p>To study the problem of gravitational lensing, we need to present equations (3) in a three-dimensional form. To this effect, we consider a (3 + 1) decomposition of a generic metric g mn (e.g., using methods discussed in §84 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). We introduce quantities describing physical vectors of the EM field, namely the 3-vectors E, D and antisymmetric 3-tensors B αβ and H αβ : E α = F 0α , D α = − √ g 00 F 0α , B αβ = F αβ , H αβ = √ g 00 F αβ (see the Problem in §90 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). These quantities are not independent. In the case of a static metric, such as that given by (1), for which g 0α = 0 and ∂ 0 g mn = 0, they are related by the following identities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D = 1 √ g 00 E = uE, B = 1 √ g 00 H = uH.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Given the definitions above, Eqs. (3) can be written in the following three-dimensional form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">curl κ E = − 1 √ κ ∂ 0 √ κ B , div κ B = 0,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">curl κ H = 1 √ κ ∂ 0 √ κ D + 4π c j, div κ D = 4πρ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the differential operators curl κ F and div κ F, for the static metric (1), are taken with respect to the threedimensional metric tensor κ αβ = −g αβ (see (A1)-(A2) and (A9)-(A10) in Appendix A for details).</p><p>We consider the propagation of an EM wave in the vacuum where no sources or currents exist, i.e., j k = (ρ, j) = 0. For the metric (1), using the definitions (4) together with (A2) and (A9)-(A10), we obtain the following form for Maxwell's equations (5)-(6):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">curl D = −u 2 ∂ B c∂t + O(G 2 ), div u 2 D = O(G 2 ),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">curl B = u 2 ∂ D c∂t + O(G 2 ), div u 2 B = O(G 2 ),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the differential operators curl F and div F are now with respect to the usual 3-space Euclidean flat metric. Using the standard identities of vector calculus involving the ∇ operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> and a bit of algebra, one can verify that D and B obey the following wave equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆ D − u 4 ∂ 2 D c 2 ∂t 2 − [curl D × ∇ ln u 2 ] + ∇ D · ∇ ln u 2 = O(G 2 ),<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆ B − u 4 ∂ 2 B c 2 ∂t 2 − [curl B × ∇ ln u 2 ] + ∇ B · ∇ ln u 2 = O(G 2 ).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>All the properties of a propagating EM wave in the presence of a weak and static post-Newtonian gravitational field are encoded in (9)-(10). Note that the last two terms in (9) and (10) are important for establishing the directional and polarization properties of EM field represented by the vectors D and B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> As we show in this paper, omitting these terms (e.g., as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) may lead to the loss of important information about the propagation direction and the amplitude of the EM field. These equations can be used to study propagation of EM waves in the presence of a weak and static gravitational field. In particular, in the case of solving the problem of diffraction of the EM waves, they can be used to describe both incident and scattered waves. This is the knowledge that helps us study the properties of the EM field in the image plane when dealing with the imaging properties of the SGL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Solving Maxwell's equations</head><p>We look for a solution to the wave equations (9)-(10) for the fields D and B in the following generic form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D = ψde −iωt and B = ψbe −iωt ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ψ(r) is a scalar function representing the intensity of a monochromatic EM wave along the path of its propagation, d(r) and b(r) are unit vectors specifying the direction of the wave's propagation and its polarization, and ω is the frequency of the wave. Although (11) gives the two fields as complex quantities, the actual physical fields D and B are given by the real part of these expressions. Then, for example, the wave equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(9)</ref> can be presented in terms of equations for the new quantities ψ and d as ∆ψ</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">+ k 2 u 4 ψ d + 2(∇ψ · ∇)d − d(∇ψ · ∇ ln u 2 ) + 2∇ψ (d · ∇ ln u 2 ) + + ψ ∆d − 2 [∇ × d] × ∇ ln u 2 + (∇ ln u 2 · ∇) d + (d · ∇) ∇ ln u 2 = O(G 2 ),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where k = ω/c is the wave number, as usual. As we intend to work with optical frequencies, Eq. (12) may be simplified. For high-frequency propagation, the representation of D given in (11) implies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">|∇ 2 d| |d| 1/2</formula><p>, |∇d| |d| , and 1 r ≪ |∇ ln ψ|,</p><p>which means that L d ≫ L ψ and r ≫ L ψ , where L d and L ψ represent the typical length scales over which the changes in d and ψ, respectively, are significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> (same applies to b). In other words, we can see that d (and b) vary slowly, but ψ varies rapidly when k → ∞, resulting in the following relationships:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">|∇ D| ∼ |kD|, |∇ 2 D| ∼ |k 2 D|.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Thus, in the case of high-frequency EM wave propagation, the following two equations hold simultaneously 3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∆ψ + k 2 u 4 ψ = O(G 2 ),<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">(∇ψ · ∇)d = −(d · ∇ ln u 2 ) ∇ψ + 1 2 (∇ψ · ∇ ln u 2 )d + O(G 2 ).<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Below, we focus our discussion on the largest contribution to the gravitational deflection of light, namely that produced by the field of a gravitational monopole. In this case, the Newtonian potential in (2) is given as U (r) = r g /2r + O(r −3 , c −4 ), where r g = 2GM/c 2 is the Schwarzschild radius of the source 4 . Therefore, the quantity u in (1) and its logarithmic gradient ∇ ln u 2 have the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">u(r) = 1 + r g 2r + O(r −3 , c −4 ) and ∇ ln u 2 = − r g r 3 r + O(r −3 , c −4 ).<label>(17)</label></formula><p>As a result, the system of Eqs. (15)-(16) takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">∆ψ + k 2 (1 + 2r g r )ψ = O(r 2 g ),<label>(18)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">(∇ψ · ∇) d = r g r 3 (d · r) ∇ψ − 1 2 (∇ψ · r)d + O(r 2 g ).<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Experiments in the presence of weak gravitational fields, such as those present in our own solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, are often described using geodesic equations. These equations determine the direction of light propagation and related relativistic frequency shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. However, geodesic equations provide no information about gravitationally induced changes in the intensity of light. In the solar system, such changes are quite small and very difficult to detect. This is precisely the focus of our interest when we consider the solar gravitational telescope scenario.</p><p>To investigate the intensity changes that result from the gravitational amplification of light, we need to develop a wave-theoretical treatment of light propagation in gravity. <ref type="bibr">Equations (18)-(19)</ref> could be used for this purpose. These are derived from the wave equations (9)-(10) and provide a complete description of an EM wave propagating in a weak and static gravitational field (which, according to Fock <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, acts as a variable index of refraction). Specifically, (18) determines the change in the intensity of the EM field, while (19) describes the changes in the direction of propagation of the EM wave and its polarization.</p><p>We can solve Eqs. (18)-(19) iteratively to first order in G. This can be done along the path of wave propagation, which is established by relying on the geodesic equation (see Appendix B).   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> describing the propagation of a wavefront (from left to right) diffracted by a point source gravitational lens. Drawn in arbitrary units for qualitative description; actual values cannot be plotted due to their differing orders of magnitude.</p><p>To find the formal solution for the EM field, we begin with (18). This equation is well known: it is nearly identical to the time-independent Schrödinger equation that describes the scattering problem in a Coulomb potential in nuclear physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . We take a spherical coordinate system (r, θ, φ) and also use Cartesian coordinates such that the x and z axes, r and angle θ are given as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>We consider the propagation of a monochromatic EM wave along the z-axis coming from a source at infinity. As is known from textbooks on quantum mechanics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>), (18) has a solution that is regular at the origin, which can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ψ(r) = ψ 0 e ikz 1 F 1 ikr g , 1, ik(r − z) ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where z is the projection of r onto the optical axis (i.e., a coordinate along that axis; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), ψ 0 is an integration constant and 1 F 1 is the confluent hypergeometric function <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> (also known as Kummer's function of the first kind, M [α, β, w]; see Appendix C for more details and useful relations). The solution (20), also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, describes a wave coming from a large distance along the z axis (for the relevant geometry, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) and generalizes the incoming plane wave solution ψ 0 (r) = e ikz , which is familiar from studying wave propagation in Euclidean spacetime. In fact, <ref type="bibr">Eq. (20)</ref> reduces to e ikz when r g → 0. Thus, one may use the solution (20) to describe the incident "plane wave" that is sourced at infinity, in the presence of a gravitational monopole with a 1/r potential. All the important contributions to ψ 0 (r) from gravitation are contained in the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">F 1 [α, β, w].</formula><p>Given the asymptotic properties of 1 F 1 [α, β, w] from (C22) (see details of derivation in Appendix C 2), we obtain the asymptotic form of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ψ(r) = ψ 0 e − π 2 krg Γ(1 − ikr g ) e ik z−rg ln k(r−z) + r g r − z Γ(1 − ikr g ) Γ(1 + ikr g ) e ik r+rg ln k(r−z) + O ikr 2 g r − z .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>5 A choice of constants rg = −γ/k makes (18) identical to the time-independent Schrödinger equation describing the scattering problem in a Coulomb potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, where γ = Z 1 Z 2 e 2 /v with Z 1 e, Z 2 e are the charges of the two particles and v is their relative velocity. The first analytical solution to (18) was given by Mott in 1928 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. A more elegant form was found a few months later by Gordon <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, using the ansatz ψ(r) = e ikz f (r − z). The complex-valued function f describes the perturbation of the incoming plane wave and transforms (18) into a solvable differential equation for f <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The same equation appears in other problems of modern physics: for instance, in problems describing photothermal single-particle Rutherford scattering microscopy that involves the scattering of waves by a 1/r refractive index profile formed by the presence of a point-like heat source in a homogeneous medium (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>).</p><p>This approximation is valid for large values of the argument k(r − z) ≫ 1 and for angles θ satisfying θ 2r g /r (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). This region is relatively far from the optical axis; light refraction here is well described by geometric optics. This solution offers a good starting point for the development of the wave-theoretical treatment of the SGL.</p><p>Typically, one normalizes the solution at large distances from the deflecting center by requiring that the function ψ behaves as lim k(r−z)→∞ ψψ * = 1 (a.k.a.

However, in our case, we require that at larger distances from the deflector the intensity of the EM field, ψ, is to be equal to that at the source, namely lim k(r−z)→∞ ψψ * = E 2 0 (in the vacuum E 0 = H 0 ).

Nonetheless, with some algebra (see Appendix B 2, Eq. (B33)), we can show that (23) is consistent with a solution for the phase of an EM wave propagating in the background of a weak and static gravitational field. For a wave moving from a remote source along the z-axis, (k · r) = z, where k is the unperturbed unit vector of the photon's trajectory (see Sec. B 1 for details). Therefore, from (B33) and (B14), for a wave moving along a geodesic, we obtain, for the change of phase along the path,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">δϕ = k (k · (r − r 0 )) + r g ln(r + (k · r))/(r 0 + (k · r 0 )) + O(r 2 g ) = k z − z 0 − r g ln(r − z)/(r 0 − z 0 ) + O(r 2 g )</formula><p>.

One can see that the phase in the first expression in (25) is consistent with the phase of a radial geodesic or that of an outgoing spherical wave (see discussions in Appendix B 4, Eq. (B55)). From (25), for the change of phase along a radial geodesic, we have δϕ = k 0 r − r 0 + r g ln r/r 0 + O(r 2 g ) , which indicates that the time-independent part of the phase of a scattered wave is that of a spherical wave given by (B55) as ϕ(r) = k(r + r g ln 2kr + O(r 2 g ) and is consistent with the phase of a radial geodesic (B34). The quantity f (θ) in (25) is the scattering amplitude that was first derived by Rutherford for the electron scattering problem in nuclear physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and has been confirmed in many experiments. This amplitude modifies the outgoing spherical wave (B55) (discussed in Appendix B 4).</p><p>Therefore, the two solutions to the time-independent wave equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> are both consistent with the familiar geodesic solutions in a weak and static gravitational field (as discussed in Secs. B 1 and B 2). The phase of the incident wave is consistent with the geodesic solution (B33), while the scattered wave is consistent with a spherical wave solution (B55) or, equivalently, with radial geodesics (B34). With this knowledge we may already identify these features in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Solution to this equation is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, which clearly shows the presence of both of these waves, namely the Coulomb-modified incident wave and the outgoing spherical wave modified by the scattering amplitude.</p><p>To interpret the approximate solutions (23)-(24), it helps to study the schematic geometry shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Light from a distant source reaches the point of observation (black dot on the right-hand side) via two paths. When the point of observation is a significant distance away from the focal line, these two paths are qualitatively different.</p><p>Perturbations to the path on the same side of the focal line as the point of observation (the "top" ray of light in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) are dominated by deflection. Neighboring rays in a tight family of rays diverge ("spread out") minimally. Therefore, this path is well approximated by Eq. (23), which describes a plane wave slightly perturbed by deflection. This wave is shown in the top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. We call this part of the solution the (perturbed) "incident" wave.</p><p>In contrast, perturbations to the path on the side of the focal line opposite to the point of observation (the "bottom" ray of light in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) are dominated by scattering. These rays reach the point of observation because they have a small impact parameter and a large angle of deflection. As a result, even neighboring rays, with only slightly different impact parameters, will suffer noticeably different deflections. The resulting wavefront is dominated by this divergent ("spreading out") behavior, and thus it is well approximated as a spherical wave emanating from the gravitational lens itself; that is to say, Eq. (24), which is depicted in the top right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.

The phase becomes divergent along the optical axis. Units are arbitrary.</p><p>The combination of the deflected plane (incident) wave and the perturbed spherical (scattered) wave, shown in the bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>, offers a good approximation of the propagating wavefront everywhere except for the vicinity of the focal line. The bottom left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> compares this approximation to the original form of (20) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). The conical region on the right-hand side of this figure is where the geometric optics approximation fails <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. It is inconvenient, since the total solution for the wave function <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> gives the correct asymptotic expression for any angle. Technically, this is because there are no known approximations of the confluent hypergeometric function 1 F 1 that are simultaneously valid both for large distances and also for small angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>For a monopole lens, the very fact that any two rays intersect at the focal line means that these rays essentially have identical impact parameters. In this case, an observer will see a thin annulus around the lens representing the Einstein ring formed by the amplified intensity of the incident light coming from the direction of the source. At any given point outside the focal line, the rays will have different impact parameters. An observer will see two images of unequal brightness of a distant point source, one on each side of the lens. Far enough from the focal line, one ray will suffer minimal deflection due to its large impact parameter. Meanwhile, the other ray will not only be deflected but also dispersed as neighboring rays diverge. The approximation given by (23) describes the ray with minimal deflection, i.e., a slightly perturbed version of the incident wave. A weaker contribution dominated by the factor r g /(r − z) is given by (24), which approximates these diverging rays with a small impact parameter (passing close to the lens) as a perturbed spherical wave originating from the lens.</p><p>At a sufficient distance from the focal line, the impact parameter needed for one of the rays to reach these points will be smaller than the physical radius of the Sun. Therefore, these incident rays will be blocked by the Sun and no scattered rays will be produced. In these cases, an observer will see only one image described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</p></div>

So, as expected, the components orthogonal to the wave vector do not change as a photon moves along its trajectory, which, in the case of D inc , (38), is in the plane spanned by e x and e z . Thus, the gravitational field of a static monopole does not change the polarization of an EM wave. At the same time, the component along the wave vector is mixed with the orthogonal component and rotates by a small angle δθ = (r g /b 0 )(1 + (r · k)/r) as it moves along the trajectory with the entire EM wave being perpendicular to the wave vector (similar results were reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>).

To do that, we will use Stirling's formula that approximates the gamma function for large values of its argument |α| → ∞ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">Γ(α) = 2π α α e α 1 + O(α −1 ) .<label>(55)</label></formula><p>As a result, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">e 2iσ0 = Γ(1 − ikr g ) Γ(1 + ikr g ) = e −2ikrg ln(krg /e)−i π</formula><p>Therefore, to a sufficient accuracy, for large values of the argument |α| = kr g (i.e., when considering the propagation of high frequency EM waves), the quantity σ 0 may given as 2σ 0 = −2kr g ln(kr g /e) − π 2 . This allows us to compute the interference term and present it in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">¯ S × = c 8πu E 2 0 r g 2r sin 2 θ 2 sin 2kr sin 2 θ 2 − 2kr g ln r g e −1 2r sin 2 θ 2 ˆ i r 1 + cos θ − ˆ i θ sin θ 1 + r g 2r sin 2 θ 2 + O(r 2 g ), (57)</formula><p>where the second term in the argument of sin() comes both from σ 0 and from the argument of the exponent in the expression (25) for the scattering amplitude, f (θ). One can see that pretty much for every value of r and θ the Poynting vector of the incident wave ¯ S inc (53) dominates the interference term ¯ S × (57). However, when θ becomes smaller, the interference term starts to grow. If, for a particular r, the ratio r g /2r sin 2 θ 2 approaches 1, the magnitude of ¯ S × becomes comparable to that of ¯ S inc , reaching the value of ¯</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">S × = (c/4πu 2 )E 2 0 sin 3kr g ˆ i r − ˆ i θ 2r g /r + O(r 2 g</formula><p>). If θ continues to decrease, i.e., when θ → 0, the terms representing the scattered (54) and interferometric (57) terms continue to grow, and ultimately diverge on the optical axis, where θ = 0. This is precisely the area where geometric optics breaks down, necessitating a wave-theoretical treatment. We develop that treatment in Sec. III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Boundary conditions in the geometric optics approximation</head><p>Lastly, we note that to develop a solution to a diffraction problem, we need to introduce a set of boundary conditions. These conditions are necessary to select specific values for the arbitrary integration constants that are appropriate for a particular problem under consideration. Considering the case of diffraction of the EM wave by the gravitational field of a large star (i.e., an idealized spherical sun with no luminosity and no corona), we need to consider only two of such conditions: (i) the asymptotic boundary conditions and (ii) the physical boundary conditions (as was done, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>).</p><p>As far as the asymptotic boundary condition is concerned, we already introduced such a condition when we selected the value for the constant ψ 0 in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> in the form of <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref>. This choice was made to satisfy the condition that at large distances from the deflector the incident wave must resemble the Coulomb-modified plane wave with a unit magnitude (i.e., Gamow conditions), but scaled to match the field intensity at the source, namely lim k(r−z)→∞ ψψ * = E 2 0 . This condition led to the solutions for both incident and scattered waves, given by (40)- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(41)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(49)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(50)</ref>, correspondingly.</p><p>However, the solutions for the EM waves that we established describe scattering on an object that is characterized only by its Schwarzschild radius, r g . This may be sufficient for the problems describing scattering of massless scalar waves by black holes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>), but is not enough to describe scattering by the Sun, whose physical size is much larger than its Schwarzschild radius, i.e., R ⊙ ≫ r g . Therefore, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> we introduce another requirement that our solution must to satisfy: the fully absorbing boundary condition. This condition requires that for rays with impact parameter less than the solar radius, i.e., b 0 ≤ R ⊙ , no wave propagates behind the Sun and no diffracted wave exists. In the geometric optics approximation this condition introduces the shadow behind the Sun, determines its shape, and moves the interference region to heliocentric distances beyond z 0 = 547.8 AU (i.e., the point where two gravitationally deflected rays of light that are just grazing the Sun on its opposite sides will intersect.) Both of these boundary conditions are useful and will take an explicit analytical form in the case of the wave optics treatment of the scattering of an EM wave by the gravitational field of a large star that we discuss next.</p></div>

II G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Boundary conditions</head><p>As we discussed in Sec. II G, the physical size of the Sun necessitates a proper treatment. Usually, this is done by selecting a form of the Debye potential for each of the regions in question, imposing the relevant boundary conditions, and matching the potentials on the boundary. We will follow a similar approach. First we note that, in order to match the potentials (81) to those of the incident and scattered waves, the latter must be expressed in a similar series form but with arbitrary coefficients. Only the function F ℓ (kr g , kr) may be used in the expression for the potential, since G ℓ (kr g , kr) is divergent at the origin. On the other hand, the scattered wave must vanish at infinity and the Hankel functions, H + ℓ (kr g , kr) (see Appendix D 2 for a discussion of the Hankel and Coulomb functions, their relationships and their relevant properties), will impart precisely this property. This function is suitable as a representation of the scattered wave. For large values of the argument (kr), it behaves as e ik(r+rg ln 2kr) and the Debye potential will satisfy Π ∝ e ik(r+rg ln 2kr) /r for large r. Thus, for distances r ≫ r g , the diffracted wave is spherical, with its center at the origin r = 0. Accordingly, it will be used in the expression for the diffracted wave:</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">rΠ (s) = E 0 u k 2 ∞ ℓ=1 i ℓ−1 2ℓ + 1 ℓ(ℓ + 1) e iσ ℓ a ℓ H + ℓ (kr g , kr)P<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_104">l (cos θ) + O(r 2 g ).<label>(86)</label></formula><p>To select the arbitrary coefficients a ℓ we will use the fully absorbing boundary condition discussed in Sec. II G. For this, we first consider the effective potential in Eq. (68) for the radial function R ℓ . We notice that a transition from small-</p><note type="other">(kr) power law behavior to large-(kr) oscillatory behavior occurs outside the classical turning point, which is the point where the effective potential in (68) vanishes, namely 1 + 2r g /r − ℓ(ℓ + 1)/(kr) 2 = O(r 2 g ). Solving this quadratic equation, we determine the turning point</note><formula xml:id="formula_105">r t = −r g ± r 2 g + ℓ(ℓ + 1)/k 2 .<label>(87)</label></formula><p>As r is positive, then with purely Newtonian (or, in nuclear scattering, Coulomb) and centrifugal potentials (68) there is only one turning point corresponding to the + sign in (87). Classically, the turning point is at the distance of closest approach or at the impact parameter. These quantities are related in the same manner as the classical impact parameter b 0 is related to the quantum mechanical partial wave ℓ <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_106">k b 0 = ℓ(ℓ + 1) ≈ ℓ + 1 2 .<label>(88)</label></formula><p>To set the boundary conditions, we realize that rays with impact parameter b 0 ≤ R ⊙ are absorbed by the Sun. Thus, the fully absorbing boundary condition signifies that all the radiation intercepted by the body of the Sun is fully absorbed by it and no reflection or coherent reemission occurs. All intercepted radiation will be transformed into some other forms of energy, notably heat. Thus, we require that no scattered waves exist with impact parameter b 0 ≪ R ⊙ or, equivalently, for ℓ ≤ kR ⊙ It means that we need to subtract the scattered wave (86) from the incident wave for ℓ ≤ kR ⊙ . In other words, to derive the solution for the Debye potential Π (I) in the region outside the Sun (denoted by Latin superscript I), we set a ℓ = −1 in the expression for the scattering potential Π (s) given by (86) and add to the expression for Π inc from (81). This results in</p><formula xml:id="formula_107">rΠ (I) (r, θ) = E 0 u k 2 ∞ ℓ=1 i ℓ−1 2ℓ + 1 ℓ(ℓ + 1) e iσ ℓ F ℓ (kr g , kr)P<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_108">ℓ (cos θ) − − E 0 u k 2 kR⊙ ℓ=1 i ℓ−1 2ℓ + 1 ℓ(ℓ + 1) e iσ ℓ H + ℓ (kr g , kr)P<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_109">l (cos θ) + O(r 2 g ).<label>(89)</label></formula><p>This is the second asymptotic boundary condition which is set on the "future infinity" light cone and deals with the fact that the physical boundary of the Sun is much larger than its Schwarzschild radius, R ⊙ ≫ r g . This is in addition to the earlier condition that was established in "past infinity", to fix the value for ψ 0 in (73). We have thus obtained the Debye potential representing the total solution for the problem of diffraction of EM waves by a large spherical star. Solution (89) describes the EM field outside the Sun, which is our primary interest, and which we discuss next.</p></div>

Due to the presence of the Bessel function of the zeroth order, J 2 0 (2 √ x), the PSF falls off more slowly than traditional PSFs, which are proportional to J 2 1 (2 √ x)/x 2 , as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Thus, a non-negligible fraction of the total energy received at the image plane of the SGL is present in the side lobes of its PSF. This indicates that for image processing purposes, one may have to develop special deconvolution techniques beyond those that are presently available (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>), which are used in modern microlensing surveys. Most of these techniques rely on raytracing analysis and typically are based on geometric optics approximation. Note that the first zero of the PSF of the SGL much closer in, but it falls out slower than the traditional PSF.</p><p>Furthermore, the light amplification µ weakly depends on the distance from the Sun. For practical purposes, it is easier to show this property by plotting the gain of the SGL, g, which is related to light amplification as g(λ, z) = 10 log 10 µ(λ, z). <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> plots the gain of the SGL at two heliocentric distances z = 600 AU and 1, 000 AU for two wavelengths λ = 1.0 µm and 2.0 µm.</p><p>We may express the argument of the Bessel function in (135) in terms of the quantities of interest, namely the heliocentric distance along the optical axis z, the distance in the image plane ρ (as measured from the optical axis), and the impact parameter b 0 . With the help of (122) we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_157">2 √ x = 2π ρ λ 2r g z → 2 √ x = 2πα 0 ρ λ z 0 z = 2πα 0 ρ λ R ⊙ b 0 ,<label>(136)</label></formula><p>where α 0 = 2r g /R ⊙ = 8.490 × 10 −6 rad = 1.751 ′′ is the angle of deflection by the SGL for the light rays just grazing the Sun. Given numerical values of various quantities involved, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_158">2 √ x = 53.34 1 µm λ ρ 1 m z 0 z ,<label>(137)</label></formula><p>or, equivalently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_159">2 √ x = 53.34 1 µm λ ρ 1 m R ⊙ b 0 .<label>(138)</label></formula><p>This result clearly shows the dependence of the SGL's light amplification on the observing wavelength, λ, the distance along the focal line, z, and the distance from the focal line in the image plane, ρ. The value of maximum amplification of the SGL, µ 0 = 4π 2 r g /λ, is independent of z. For optical wavelengths, this amounts to µ 0 ∼ 1.2 × 10 11 , giving the SGL its enormous light amplification. For small deviations from the optical axis, the light amplification (135) drops sharply, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, but the overall envelope decreases more slowly than that of a traditional PSF <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>.</p><p>The ability of a lens to resolve detail is ultimately limited by diffraction. Light coming from a point source diffracts through the lens aperture, forming a diffraction pattern in the image plane known as an Airy pattern (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). The angular radius of the central bright lobe, called the Airy disk, is measured from the center to the first null. Therefore, we define the resolution of the SGL using the location where J 0 (2 √ x) = 0, which is satisfied for the value of the argument of 2 √ x ≈ 2.40483. We can then solve (136) for θ SGL = ρ/z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_160">θ SGL ≃ 0.766 λ D ⊙ z 0 z , or, equivalently, θ SGL = 0.766 λ D ⊙ R ⊙ b 0 ,<label>(139)</label></formula><p>where D ⊙ = 2R ⊙ is the solar diameter. For the wavelength λ = 1 µm, the resolution of the SGL at z 0 = 547.8 AU is θ 0 ≈ 5.50 × 10 −16 rad = 0.11 nas. The resolution increases with z as θ 0 z 0 /z as</p><formula xml:id="formula_161">θ SGL ≃ 0.11 λ 1 µm z 0 z nas, or, equivalently, θ SGL ≃ 0.11 λ 1 µm R ⊙ b 0 nas.<label>(140)</label></formula><p>For an exoplanet situated at the distance z p from the Sun, the angular resolution (139) translates into resolvable surface features of δρ SGL = θ SGL z p , which improves with heliocentric distance as</p><formula xml:id="formula_162">δρ SGL ≃ 510 z p 30 pc λ 1 µm z 0 z m, or, equivalently, δρ SGL ≃ 510 z p 30 pc λ 1 µm R ⊙ b 0 m.<label>(141)</label></formula><p>Depending on the impact parameter, the deflection angle of the SGL is given as α = 2r g /b 0 = α 0 (R ⊙ /b 0 ). Rays with impact parameter b 0 will intersect the optical axis at the distance of z = b 0 /α = 547.8 (b 0 /R ⊙ ) 2 AU. In the pencil-sharp region along the focal line the amplification (135) of the SGL stays nearly constant well beyond 2,500 AU, while its angular resolution (140) increases by a factor of ∼ 1/ √ 5 in the same range of heliocentric distances. Across the image plane, the amplification oscillates quite rapidly. For small deviations from the optical axis, θ ≈ ρ/z. Using this relation in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(140)</ref>, we see that the first zero occurs quite close to the optical axis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_163">ρ SGL0 ≃ 4.5 λ 1 µm z z 0 cm, or, equivalently, ρ SGL0 ≃ 4.5 λ 1 µm b 0 R ⊙ cm.<label>(142)</label></formula><p>(Note in (142) the inverse ratio of z vs. z 0 and b 0 vs R ⊙ .) Equation (142) favors larger wavelengths and larger heliocentric distances or, similarly, impact parameters. Thus, we have established the basic optical properties of the solar gravitational lens. By achromatically focusing light from a distant source <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, the SGL provides a major brightness amplification and extreme angular resolution. Specifically, from (135) for λ = 1 µm, we get a light amplification of the SGL of µ ≃ 1.2 × 10 11 , corresponding to a brightness increase by δmag = 2.5 ln µ = 27.67 stellar magnitudes in case of perfect alignment. Furthermore, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(140)</ref> gives us the angular resolution of the SGL of θ SGL ≃ 1.1 × 10 −10 arc seconds.</p><p>We note that if the diameter of the telescope d 0 is larger than the diffraction limit of the SGL (i.e., larger than the diameter of the first zero of the Airy pattern), it would average the light amplification over the full aperture. Such an averaging will result in the reduction of the total light amplification. To estimate the impact of the large aperture on light amplification, we average the result (135) over the aperture of the telescope:</p><formula xml:id="formula_164">¯ µ z = 4 πd 2 0 d 0 2 0 2π 0 µ(ρ)ρdρdφ = 4π 2 1 − e −4π 2 rg /λ r g λ J 2 0 π d 0 λ 2r g z + J 2 1 π d 0 λ 2r g z .<label>(143)</label></formula><p>For an aperture of d 0 = 1 m at z = 600 AU, this results in the reduction in light amplification by a factor of 0.025, leading to the effective light amplification of ¯ µ z = 2.87 × 10 9 (i.e., 23.65 mag), which is still quite significant. The effect of the large aperture is captured in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, where we plot the behavior of each of the two terms in curly braces in (143) and also their sum. Although each term oscillates and reaches zero, their sum never becomes zero.</p><p>As seen from a telescope at the SGL, light from a distant target fills an annulus at the edge of the Sun, forming the Einstein ring. At a distance z on the focal line, an observer looking back at the Sun will see the Einstein ring with an angular size that is given by α ER = 2b 0 /z = 4r g /b 0 . Using this equation, we determine the angular size of the ring as</p><formula xml:id="formula_165">α ER ≃ 3.50 ′′ z 0 z , or, equivalently, α ER ≃ 3.50 ′′ R ⊙ b 0 .<label>(144)</label></formula><p>A telescope with aperture d 0 , placed at the heliocentric distance z on the optical axis, receives light from a family of rays with different impact parameters with respect to the Sun, ranging from b 0 to b 0 + δb 0 . Using (144), these rays are deflected by different amounts given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_166">α 1 = (b 0 + 1 2 d 0 )/z = α 0 R ⊙ /(b 0 + 1 2 d 0 )</formula><p>, for one edge of the aperture, where α 0 = 2r g /R ⊙ , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_167">α 2 = (b 0 + δb 0 − 1 2 d 0 )/z = α 0 R ⊙ /(b 0 + δb 0 − 1 2 d 0 )</formula><p>, for the other edge. Taking the ratio of α 2 /α 1 , we can determine the relation between δb 0 and the telescope diameter, d 0 , which, to first order, is given as δb 0 = d 0 .</p><p>As a result, the area of the Einstein ring that is seen by the telescope with aperture d 0 , to first order, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_168">A ER = π((b 0 + δb 0 ) 2 − b 2 0 ) ≃ 2πb 0 d 0 .</formula><p>For different impact parameters the area behaves as</p><formula xml:id="formula_169">A ER ≃ 4.37 × 10 9 d 0 1 m b 0 R ⊙ m 2 .<label>(145)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the magnifying power of a 1 m telescope placed at heliocentric distance z on the focal line of the SGL is equivalent to a telescope with diameter of D = 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_170">√ 2b 0 d 0 = 74.6 (b 0 /R ⊙ ) 1</formula><p>2 km or, in terms of the heliocentric distances, it is given as D = 74.6 (z/z 0 ) 1 4 km, which is a weak function of the observer's position on the focal line. To image an exoplanet, observing this annulus with thickness of δb 0 = d 0 is, of course, the primary objective. A diffraction-limited 1 m telescope would have a resolution of δθ = λ/d 0 = 0.21 ′′ at λ = 1 µm. The thickness of the Einstein ring from the heliocentric distance of z = 600 AU is d 0 /z = 2.30 nas. Thus, although the thickness of the Einstein ring is unresolved by the telescope at the SGL, the ring itself is well-resolved and can be used for imaging purposes. In fact, the entire circumference of the ring at the same distance of z = 600 AU has the length of L ER = 2πb 0 /z = 10.05 ′′ (b 0 /R ⊙ ), and it is resolved with L ER /δθ ∼ 48.7 (b 0 /R ⊙ ) resolution elements. Thus, the ring could be used to provide information on a particular surface area on the target exoplanet. By sampling various parts of the ring, we will be able to collect data relevant to that particular surface area on the exoplanet.</p><p>Considering the plate scale: an Earth-sized exoplanet at z ep = 30 pc away from the Sun, when imaged from the focal region of the SGL at heliocentric distance of z ∼600 AU, has the the image size of 2R ⊕ z/z ep ∼ 1, 238 m (z/600 AU)(30 pc/z ep ). A single telescope would have to traverse this area in the immediate vicinity of the focal line to scan the image of the exoplanet. Such a scaling law suggests that to image this object with ∼ 10 3 × 10 3 pixels, the telescope would need to move in the image plane from pixel to pixel, each of which has the size of ∼ 1.2 m. Each surface element resolved on the surface of the exoplanet would form its own Einstein ring around the Sun. However, because of the properties of the PSF of the SGL (which has prominent side lobes, as seen <ref type="figure">Fig. 7)</ref>, the total flux within each Einstein ring corresponding to a particular surface element would also have contributions (in the form of Einstein arcs) from adjacent surface elements. Therefore, to form a reliable image of an exoplanet's topography, multiple such images must be deconvoluted. This can be accomplished as the properties of the Sun and, thus, of the SGL are well understood.</p><p>Considering a realistic mission to the SGL to image a preselected target, one would have to consider the effects of the proper motion of the host star with respect to the Sun, as well as orbital dynamics of the target exoplanet and its diurnal rotation. Even if these factors are accounted for by a trajectory design and raster scan in the image plane, the exoplanet may also change as it is being scanned, due to changes in illumination, seasonal changes, cloud cover, the presence of one or more natural satellites and other factors; therefore, image deconvolution must also take place in the temporal dimension, possibly aided with reasonable models of periodic changes in appearance.</p><p>This interesting problem set must be addressed before exoplanet imaging using the SGL can become reality. Nonetheless, the potential benefits of a solar gravitational telescope (SGT) are well considered in comparison with the parameters of a comparable diffraction-limited optical telescope. Given the very small angular diameter (∼ 1.4 × 10 −11 rad) of an Earth-like planet at 30 pc, obtaining a single-pixel image would require a diffraction-limited telescope with an aperture of ∼74.6 km. To match the magnifying power of the SGL and obtain an image at a resolution of a thousand linear pixels, a telescope aperture of 4 × 10 5 km (∼ 16R ⊕ ) would be needed. Building an optical imaging interferometer with such a set of baselines is not feasible. At the same time, a mission to the SGL offers access to unique conditions needed for direct imaging of an exoplanet. Perhaps, it is the time we start taking the SGL seriously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we considered the propagation of EM waves in the gravitational field of the Sun, which is represented by the Schwarzschild monopole taken within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We have developed a wave-theoretical treatment for light diffraction in the field of a static gravitational mass monopole and considered the case of a monochromatic EM wave coming from a point source at a large distance from the monopole. We obtained a solution for the EM field everywhere around the lens and especially in the immediate vicinity of its focal line, where the geometric optics leads to diverging results. As anticipated, because of wave effects in the focal region, our wave-optical treatment is immune to singularities, allowing us to describe the optics of the SGL and understand its image formation properties. As such, in contrast to models based purely on geometric optics, our approach allows us to consider practical questions related to the design of a SGT, in part by permitting the use of traditional tools of telescope design. The results that we obtained allow us to compute the PSF, resolution and FOV, as well as the evolution of these quantities at various heliocentric distances along the focal line. These will help improve our understanding of the unique properties of the SGL for imaging and spectroscopic investigations.</p><p>Our presentation is streamlined, taking full advantage of the weak-field gravity in the solar system. We also benefit from the tools and techniques borrowed from nuclear physics, specifically from the physics of scattering in a Coulomb field. Our approach can be extended to include higher-order solar gravity multipoles, if needed. We find that the formalism for Coulomb scattering from the nuclear physics literature is directly applicable. However, whereas nuclear particle physics studies focus on the scattering of scalar particles, we were able to develop the formalism required to describe the scattering of a vector EM field in the post-Newtonian approximation of the solar gravitational field.</p><p>Our results represent the first step towards developing a comprehensive theory of image formation by the SGL and the tools needed for mission design, data collection and processing, and ultimate image deconvolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Several effects of gravitational and dynamical areas will require further analysis. In particular: i) distinguishing the bright solar disk from the annulus of an Einstein ring, and the constraints it places on the performance of the SGT; ii) effects due to the solar corona and solar plasma on light propagation; iii) effects due to solar oblateness and solar rotation on the spatial and temporal properties of the caustic formed by the SGL; iv) effects of reflex motion of the Sun with respect to the solar system's barycentric coordinate reference system due to the presence of the giant gaseous planets in the solar system; v) effects of proper motion of the exoplanet's parent star, orbital motion of the planet around the barycenter of its planetary system, diurnal rotation of the planet, orientation of its axis of rotation, precision and nutation; vi) temporal changes in the targeted planet's appearance due to changing illumination, varying cloud cover, changes in atmospheric chemistry, varying surface features (ice cover, vegetation), varying illumination by its host star, and eclipses due to any satellites. Some of these aspects will be addressed in the upcoming study of a mission to the SGL that is to be conducted at JPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. The results of this study will be available elsewhere.</p><p>Concluding, we emphasize that our present understanding of the properties of the SGL and its value for imaging and spectroscopy is about at the same level as we knew gravitational waves back in the 1970s. At that time, the physics of gravitational waves was already well understood, but the technology needed for their detection was a long way in the future. That "future" for the research in gravitational waves came at the centennial of general relativity with the results of the first direct detection of the gravitational waves reported by the LIGO team <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. It is our hope and desire that by the theory's sesquicentennial, we will be in possession of a fully developed set of technologies as well as the spacecraft, instruments, and data analysis tools required to collect data and present us with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of habitable exoplanets, relying on the physics of the solar gravitational lens.</p><p>We summarize basic rules for vector transformations and differential operators in curvilinear coordinates, for convenience and also to introduce the notations used throughout the present paper.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> (see §84), we consider a generic interval and its 3 + 1 decomposition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_171">ds 2 = g mn dx m dx n = √ g 00 dx 0 + g 0α √ g 00 dx α 2 − κ αβ dx α dx β , (A1)</formula><p>where the three-dimensional metric κ αβ is given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_172">κ αβ = −g αβ + g 0α g 0β g 00 , κ = det κ αβ .

			<note place="foot" n="1"> The notational conventions used in this paper are the same as in [31, 32]: Latin indices (i, j, k, ...) are spacetime indices that run from 0 to 3. Greek indices α, β, ... are spatial indices that run from 1 to 3. In case of repeated indices in products, the Einstein summation rule applies: e.g., amb m = 3 m=0 amb m . Bold letters denote spatial (three-dimensional) vectors: e.g., a = (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ), b = (b 1 , b 2 , b 3 ). The dot (·) and cross (×) are used to indicate the Euclidean inner product and cross product of spatial vectors; following the convention of [3], these are enclosed in round and square brackets, respectively. Latin indices are raised and lowered using the metric gmn. The Minkowski (flat) spacetime metric is given by γmn = diag(1, −1, −1, −1), so that γµν a µ b ν = −(a · b). We use powers of the inverse of the speed of light, c −1 , and the gravitational constant, G as bookkeeping devices for order terms: in the low-velocity (v ≪ c), weak-field (rg/r = 2GM/rc 2 ≪ 1) approximation, a quantity of O(c −2 ) ≃ O(G), for instance, has a magnitude comparable to v 2 /c 2 or GM/c 2 r. The notation O(a k , b ℓ ) is used to indicate that the preceding expression is free of terms containing powers of a greater than or equal to k, and powers of b greater than or equal to ℓ. Other notations are explained in the paper.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Equations (9) and (10) are rather well known. In fact, they are similar to (5)-(6) in Chapter 1.2 of [37], written for an EM wave propagating in a refractive medium. A form of Maxwell&apos;s equations, similar to (9)-(10), appears any time when one deals with EM waves propagating in a medium with a variable index of refraction, such as in the case of optical waveguides [38, 39]. This form emphasizes the fact that a weak gravitational field also induces effective refractive properties on spacetime [3]. These properties may be investigated using the tools of classical optics [31, 37].</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Note that representations similar to (15)-(16) occur when raytracing methods are used to describe the propagation of high-frequency EM waves in optical waveguides [39]. The numerical tools developed in that area may be quite useful to model imaging with the SGL. 4 If needed, our approach, in conjunction with the tools developed in [42, 43], may be used to account for the contributions from higher order gravitational multipole moments. For details, see Appendices B 1 and B 2.</note>

These can both be derived from the corresponding Debye scalar potentials e Π and m Π.</p><p>Given e ˆ B r = 0, e ˆ D φ and e ˆ D θ in (E6) can be represented as a scalar field's gradient:</p><p>Using</p><p>It can be seen that (E11) and (E12) are satisfied by</p><p>If we substitute both of (E20) into (E3) we obtain</p><p>Substituting expressions (E20) into (E13)-(E14) yields</p><p>e., the derivative of the same expression with respect to both φ and θ vanishes.

In a similar way we may consider the magnetic wave. We find that this wave can be derived from a potential m Π which satisfies the same differential equation (E22) as e Π. The complete solution of the EM field equations is obtained by adding the two fields (as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>),</p><p>Both potentials e Π and m Π are solutions of the differential equation (E24), which, in the case of the weak gravity characteristic for the SGL, is given by (E26).</p><p>Appendix F: Solution for the radial equation in the WKB approximation</p><p>We consider Eq.
