				<p>Observations of infrared and optical light curves of hot Jupiters have demonstrated that the peak brightness is generally offset eastward from the substellar point [1,2]. This observation is consistent with hydrodynamic numerical simulations that produce fast, eastward directed winds which advect the hottest point in the atmosphere eastward of the substellar point [3,4]. However, recent continuous Kepler measurements of HAT-P-7 b show that its peak brightness offset varies significantly in time, with excursions such that the brightest point is sometimes westward of the substellar point [5]. These variations in brightness offset require wind variability, with or without the presence of clouds. While such wind variability has not been seen in hydrodynamic simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, it has been seen in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations [6]. Here we show that MHD simulations of HAT-P-7 b indeed display variable winds and corresponding variability in the position of the hottest point in the atmosphere. Assuming the observed variability in HAT-P-7 b is due to magnetism we constrain its minimum magnetic field strength to be 6 G. Similar observations of wind variability on hot giant exoplanets, or lack thereof, could help constrain their magnetic field strengths. Since dynamo simulations of these planets do not exist and theoretical scaling relations [7] may not apply, such observational constraints could prove immensely useful. Main Text To demonstrate magnetic effects on the winds of HAT-P-7 b, we simulate the atmosphere of a hot giant exoplanet with parameters similar to HAT-P-7 b using a spherical, three-dimensional (3D), anelastic MHD code [8,6]. We start with a hydrodynamic simulation of HD209458 b in terms of gravity, radius and rotation, but with a mean temperature (2200K) and temperature differential (1000K) of HAT-P-7 b (tempera-ture and magnetic diffusivity profiles are shown in Supplementary Figure 1). The strong day-night temperature differential drives strong eastward atmospheric winds, consistent with previous simulations [9,10]. This simulation is run for ∼100 rotation periods before a magnetic field is added after which both the hydrodynamic and MHD simulations are run for an additional 280 rotation periods. Details of the numerical code and simulation can be found in the Methods section. The extreme temperatures of HAT-P-7 b give rise to significant thermal ionization of alkali metals [11,12], which leads to coupling of the atmosphere to the deep seated magnetic field [13] and could also lead to an atmospheric dynamo [14]. The Lorentz force arising from this magnetic interaction disrupts the strong eastward directed atmospheric winds typically seen in hydrodynamic simulations, leading to variable and even oppositely directed winds [6]. Figure 1 shows a time-snapshot of magnetic field lines in the simulation looking onto the eastside termi-nator (a corresponding video of its complex evolution and variability is available in the Supplementary Material). The zonal-mean zonal-wind, averaged within 17 • of the equator and over the upper 1 mbar of the simulated domain, as a function of time is shown in Figure 2, along with the position of the hottest point in the atmosphere (also determined by an average over the same latitudes and height). There we see that, the hydrodynamic model retains a strong, eastward jet and associated positive hotspot displacement throughout the simulation (dotted line in Figure 2a and 2b). When a magnetic field is added, the zonal winds slow dramatically, reverse and then settle into an oscillatory pattern, with a timescale of ∼10 6 s, consistent with the Alfven time (τ A = √ 4πρλ/B) of the imposed 10 G field and is of the same order as the timescale of variability observed in HAT-P-7 b [5]. Variability in the hot spot displacement, including negative offsets, is seen on a similar timescale. 1 Figure 1: Magnetic Field lines in the atmosphere of a Hot Giant Exoplanet. Time snapshot of magnetic field lines in the numerical simulation of a hot Jupiter atmosphere (a model of HD209458 b but with a temperature structure similar to HAT-P-7 b). Magnetic field lines are color-coded to represent the azimuthal (toroidal) magnetic field with blue representing negative directed field (saturated at-50 G) and magenta positive (saturated at 50 G), with green and yellow ranging from-5 G to 5 G, respectively. The vantage point is looking onto the east-side terminator. Both the hydrodynamic and MHD models have more positive hot-spot displacements than the observations. This is expected given that the waves that force super-rotation can propagate further in HD209458 b than HAT-P-7 b before being damped [15]. Therefore, we expect a hydrodynamic model with HAT-P-7 b&apos;s gravity and rotation rate would show reduced hot-spot displacements compared to HD209458 b and we indeed find this (see Figure 3). While this magnetic model has some uncertainties (en-hanced viscosity, crude radiative transfer), it naturally explains the bright spot excursions as due to changes in the thermal structure of the planet caused by variable winds. In this model clouds may not be necessary as HAT-P-7 b is hot enough that even the optical signal could be dominated by thermal emission. Moreover, this 2 Figure 2: Atmospheric Dynamics of Simulated Hot Giant Exoplanet.] (a) Zonal Mean Zonal Wind in the hot Jupiter atmosphere averaged over 17 • around the equator and over the upper 1 mbar of the simulated domain. Dotted line shows the winds in the hydrodynamic model while the solid line shows the winds in the MHD model. (b) Displacement of the hottest point of the atmosphere from the substellar point, at the same location and averaged as in (a). Similar to the mean winds, the hot-spot displacement in the MHD model (solid line) shows strong variability with excursions to points west of the substellar point. Hydrodynamic models show a stable, positive offset. model may also explain the timescale of the observed fluctuations as due to Alfven waves. At the very least, it can provide the wind variability needed for models requiring clouds [5]. The effect of magnetism on zonal winds depends on the ratio of the magnetic to inertial terms in the momentum equation, which can be approximated as the ratio of magnetic to wave timescales τ mag /τ wave , where τ mag = 4πρη/B 2 and τ wave = L/ √ gH. Here ρ is the density, η is the magnetic diffusivity, B is the magnetic field strength, g is the gravity, L is the characteristic length scale of the horizontal flow and H is the depth of the atmosphere [11,15]. As magnetic effects are increased, either through increased magnetic field strength or increased conductivity , their effect on atmospheric zonal winds progressed from little to no effect (when τ mag &gt; τ wave), to oscillatory winds (when τ mag ∼ τ wave) to completely reversed (westward) winds (when τ mag &lt; τ wave) [6]. Assuming the variable winds observed on HAT-P-7 b are due to magnetism and applying the oscillatory wind condition we find B ∼ 4πηρ/τ wave. Using the nightside value of η, we find that HAT-P-7 b must have a minimum field strength of ∼6 G. This value is consistent with the theoretical scaling relation based on the Elsasser number [16] (Λ = 2ρΩ/µ 0 η ∼ 1) and with the upper limit placed on WASP-12 b [17], if we were to assume it had a similar field strength. To check this constraint, we ran additional 3 models of HAT-P-7 b, with the appropriate rotation , gravity, size and temperature [18]. The temperature and magnetic diffusivity profiles for this model can be seen in Supplementary Figure 2. After running a hydrodynamic model for 140 rotation periods a magnetic field was added and run an additional 15 rotation periods. We show the hot spot displacement for those models in Figure 3. We see that the hydrodynamic model (black line) has a steady hot-spot displacement of 2.8 •. The MHD model with a 3 G field (red line) shows a similar, stable hot spot displacement. However, both the 10 G (blue line) and 20 G (orange line) model show wind variability ranging from ∼−15 •-20 •. This range of displacement is more consistent with brightness variations observed (which range from ∼−25 •</p>

However, clouds could also play a role in enhancing the large displacements observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler [5]</ref>.</p><p>In our simulations wind variability sets in between 3 and 10 G, consistent with the 6 G lower limit based purely on a simple timescale analysis. If we had used the dayside magnetic diffusivity in the estimate the lower limit would have been ∼0.6 G, inconsistent with our follow up models, which show no variability at 3 G. This estimate depends only on the winds being variable and is independent of whether or not clouds are needed to explain the exact range of variability seen. Although these models are consistent with the 6 G lower limit, on this timescale we see no completely reversed winds and therefore, conclude that we can only place a lower limit on the field strength. While it may be possible to hone this constraint with more simulations, its likely not worthwhile given the other limitations of these simulations.</p><p>The continuous observations of HAT-P-7 b <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> were unique in that previous optical and infrared observations have generally only provided this measurement at a single epoch. The exception is the multiple epoch Spitzer observations of HD189733 b <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. That work showed a fairly stable, positive offset. This lack of variability is consistent with little or no magnetic effects in HD189733 b, a plausible conclusion given that the low temperatures of HD189733 b would require unrealistic magnetic field strengths of ∼100-1000 G to cause variability. In general, we would expect to see wind variability in objects where field-flow coupling is strong (as measured by the ratio of magnetic and wave timescales). Therefore, we would predict variability may also be found in other hot giant exoplanets, such as WASP-19b or WASP-12b.</p><p>While long timeline or multiple epoch observations of hot Jupiters' phase curves have not been carried out for many objects, such a campaign coupled with MHD models of those planets' atmospheres could be used to place constraints on the magnetic field strengths of hot Jupiters. Such constraints are rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and would be useful for dynamo theory, planetary evolution and interpretations of star-planet magnetic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. As recently shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, these types of constraints are already possible with Kepler but will become more readily available with upcoming space missions such as JWST, CHEOPS, TESS and PLATO. In particular, JWST will be able to measure infrared phase curves directly, thus testing this theory without the complication clouds might add to optical curves. </p></div>

The rotation rate, radius and gravity are all that of HD209458 b. The temperature and diffusivity profiles of this model are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1</ref>. While this model is clearly not HAT-P-7 b it has a temperature (and thus, conductivity) structure similar to that expected for HAT-P-7 b.

Although it was not included here a time-dependent conductivity could further complicate matters, particularly with regard to the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Currently, we see more Ohmic heating on the night side of the planet, which leads to reduction of the day-night temperature gradient. Naively, if we allowed this to react back on the flow and conductivity we would expect decreased wind driving and increased field-flow coupling. That is, we might expect wind variability at even lower magnetic field strengths.</p><p>Data Availability Statement The data that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Magnetic Field lines in the atmosphere of a Hot Giant Exoplanet.
