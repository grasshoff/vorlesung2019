			<abstract>
				<p>2 Investigating the overall brightness of planets (and moons) provides insight into their envelopes and energy budgets [1, 2, 3, 4]. Titan phase curves (a representation of overall brightness vs. Sun-object-observer phase angle) have been published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands [5, 6]. Such information has been key to the study of the stratification, micro-physics and aggregate nature of Titan&apos;s atmospheric haze [7, 8], and has complemented the spatially-resolved observations first showing that the haze scatters efficiently in the forward direction [7, 9]. Here we present Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The observations reveal that Titan&apos;s twilight (loosely defined as the view when the phase angle 150 •) outshines its daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and models, we show that at even larger phase angles the back-illuminated moon will appear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behavior is unique to Titan in our solar system , and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the efficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a solar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 Wm −2) of (2.84±0.11)×10 14 W, consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations with Titan&apos;s time-varying thermal emission spanning 2007-2013 [10, 11]. We propose that a forward scattering signature may also occur at large phase angles in the brightness of exoplanets with extended hazy atmospheres, and that this signature has valuable diagnostic potential for atmospheric characterization. 3 We produced Titan phase curves (Fig. 1) from calibrated, whole-disk images taken with the Narrow Angle Camera of the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) [12, 13]. The timespan of the images (2004-2015), phase angle coverage (α≤166 • ; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for sketch of the viewing geometry), sampling (∼400 datapoints/curve on average), and variety of filters (15, effective wavelengths λ eff =300-940 nm) in this work significantly expand on previous treatments [5, 6]. The phase curves are presented in the size-normalized way A g Φ(α), adopting Titan&apos;s solid radius of 2575 km for the normalization. A g is the geometric albedo and Φ(α=0)≡1 by definition. From full illumination (α=0) to α∼90 • , the curves describe Titan&apos;s progressive dimming as less of its dayside appears visible to the observer. Our Cassini/ISS data confirm the Pioneer 11 measurements in blue and red pass-bands for α≤96 • [5] (Fig. 1) and ground-based spectroscopic data at α∼5.7 • [14] (Fig. 2). The incomplete sampling near full illumination does not permit the confirmation of proposed strong backscattering at very small phase angles and short wavelengths [15, 16], a task that would require nearly continuous sampling for α≤5 • in the passbands with λ eff =441 and 455 nm (Fig. 1). We note though that the data for λ eff =343 nm do not show a discernible enhancement in the antisolar direction, which suggests that backscattering in the ultraviolet is less strong than recently proposed. The curve for the nar-rowband filter with λ eff =938 nm is particularly well sampled with nearly 2000 datapoints. In this passband, Titan&apos;s surface contributes to the emergent radiation (Fig. 3). The dispersion in the A g Φ(α) values for this passband at small phase angles (probing deeper in the atmosphere) is tentatively attributed to rotational effects as different surface patches enter and exit the field of view [17, 18]. For larger phase angles up to ∼140 • , the diminishing size of Titan&apos;s 4 visible dayside is compensated by efficient forward scattering of its upper-atmosphere haze, and the curves exhibit plateaus or mild increases in brightness. As Titan nears back-illumination (α≥150 •), the twilight brightness rises steeply and at α∼160-166 • it is comparable to or higher than at full illumination. This is particularly the case for wavelengths at which absorption by haze (600 nm) or atmospheric methane (strong bands occur at e.g. 619, 727, and 889 nm; Fig. 2) make Titan&apos;s dayside darker. The brightness surge is unrelated to the central flash caused by atmospheric refraction during stellar occultations [19]. We have investigated the empirical phase curves with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model that solves the multiple-scattering problem of reflected sunlight in stratified, spherical-shell atmospheres [20] (&apos;Methods&apos;). Our implementation of aerosol optical properties (extinction coefficients, single scattering albedos, scattering phase functions) is based on the latest interpretation of the in-situ measurements made by the Huygens Descent Im-ager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) [16]. The DISR observations were made from 150 km altitude down to the surface, but they were sensitive to aerosols above 150 km, as confirmed by this study. The model phase curves based on the DISR aerosol implementation (solid red curves, Fig. 1) reproduce well the Cassini/ISS data for wavelengths ≥440 nm unaffected by methane absorption. The DISR implementation is poorly constrained shortwards of 490 nm though [15, 16]. To reproduce the observations in the passbands with λ eff =306 and 343 nm, we slightly modified the aerosol absorption above 150 km, which led to better fits (dashed red curves) (&apos;Methods&apos;). In the passbands affected by methane, an adjustable amount of methane absorption at all altitudes provided the required attenuation to reproduce the observations (dashed red curves, λ eff ≥619 nm). The reported 5 best fits represented by the dashed red curves were the result of minimizing the relative measurement-model error. The grey areas of Fig. 1 quantify the amount of energy that Titan scatters in all possible three-dimensional directions with a phase angle α. This is mathematically expressed by Φ(α)sin(α) [1]. The integrated area (properly normalized) is the phase integral q, and depends on wavelength (&apos;Methods&apos;). Thus, our inferred phase integrals are passband-averaged values. According to our best-fitting models, phase angles α≥166 • contribute to q by 13% (λ eff =343 nm), 5% (649 nm) and 7% (928 nm). These non-negligible contributions originate from layers above 150 km (Fig. 3) and substantiate the role of the upper-atmosphere haze in Titan&apos;s energy balance by scattering part of the incident sunlight. The phase integrals calculated here (q=1.9-2.9) are notably larger than earlier estimates (q=1.3-1.7) based on incomplete phase angle coverage [5, 21]. At small phase angles, Titan&apos;s brightness is dictated by solar photons that scatter tens of times before exiting the atmosphere. Our model shows that the photons emerging from the α=0 configuration scatter preferentially at altitudes of 150-300 km (455-nm photons) and 50-250 km (938-nm photons) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the brightness for large phase angles is caused by photons undergoing only a few collisions. For 455-and 938-nm photons and α=166 • , the preferential range of scattering altitudes is 250-350 km and 200-350 km, respectively. As a rule, the larger phase angles are more sensitive to higher altitudes. Atmospheric stratification is key in the interpretation of the twilight brightness, and the product p a (θ→0)H a /R of the particles scattering phase function (θ is the scattering angle between the incident and exiting photon directions), p a (θ), times the ratio of the aerosol scale height to Titan&apos;s radius, 6 H a /R, becomes a key factor. Titan&apos;s haze particles are fractal aggregates, each comprising thousands of small (≤0.05 µm) spherical monomers [8, 22]. To the effects of radiative transfer modeling, the haze particles behave with their own aggregate-averaged properties, which may significantly differ from those of the monomers. The large effective size of the aggregates (equal-projected-area radii of 2-3 µm [15, 22, 23]) causes the prominent forward lobe in the particles scattering phase function that has been known since the times of the Voyager spacecraft [7, 9] and that translates into a large p a (θ→0). The DISR measurements, some of them obtained while looking less than 10 • away from the Sun, have shown that the forward lobe had been severely underestimated for decades [15, 16]. Titan&apos;s extended atmosphere results in H a /R∼45/3000∼1.5×10 −2 , much larger than e.g. ∼4/6150∼6.5×10 −4 and ∼27/70000∼3.8×10 −4 for Venus and Jupiter, respectively. This difference has an impact on their corresponding forward scattering components [20, 24]. The large value of p a (θ→0)H a /R in Titan&apos;s upper atmosphere is ultimately responsible for the whole-disk brightness surge at large phase angles. Based on our model&apos;s capacity to reproduce the measured phase curves for α≤166 • , we predict that Titan&apos;s brightness for α→180 • exceeds the full-illumination brightness by an order of magnitude or more, depending on the observation wavelength. The predicted A g Φ(α→180 •) are quoted in Fig. 1. The diminishment in particle sizes (and in the strength of their forward scattering lobe) above 400 km [22] has no impact on the brightness surge because the atmosphere at these altitudes is optically thin at the wavelengths investigated here. The Titan aerosols participate in vertical and horizontal structures, and in transient behaviors on diverse timescales [25, 26]. This complexity results from the strong ties of aerosol formation with super-rotating winds, seasonal 7 heating, and both neutral and ion photochemistry. The match between the Cassini/ISS phase curves and models over all measured phase angles supports the DISR implementation [16] as a functional representation of the globally-averaged optical properties of Titan&apos;s aerosols. This conclusion was unanticipated because Titan&apos;s brightness at the larger phase angles is dictated by the atmosphere above 150 km (Fig. 3), and also because in principle the DISR conclusions apply principally to the Huygens descent conditions. We have used the inferred whole-disk scattering properties to calculate the rate of solar energy deposited into the Titan atmosphere as the difference between the incident and scattered rates, P dep =P inc −P sca (&apos;Methods&apos;). For the incident contribution, scaled to a solar constant S =14.9 Wm −2 specific to Saturn&apos;s semi-major axis of 9.58 AU, we obtain P inc =(3.87±0.07)×10 14 W. For the rate of energy scattered by Titan, we obtain P sca =(1.03±0.08)×10 14 W, its uncertainty being comparable to that for P inc. Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 1 summarize the partial contributions to both P inc and P sca. Finally, we infer P dep =(2.84±0.11)×10 14 W and, from the definition of Bond albedo, A B =P sca /P in =0.27±0.02. This is strikingly similar to previous estimates of the Bond albedo [5, 21, 27] even though some of the intermediate quantities used in these works (including the phase integrals) were poorly constrained. Titan has been estimated to emit thermally at rates of P emi =(2.86±0.01)×10 14 W in 2007 (S ∼16 Wm −2) and (2.79±0.01)×10 14 W in 2013 (S ∼14 Wm −2) [10, 11], suggesting that the emitted energy dropped less than the solar irradiation during that period. Scaling P dep from our time-averaged treatment of P inc and P sca by the relevant solar constants, we obtain P dep =(3.05±0.11)×10 14 W in 2007 and (2.67±0.11)×10 14 W in 2013. Thus, P dep and P emi are consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations during 2007-2013. Our study cannot 8 rule out an energy imbalance, but it sets strict limits based on contempora-neous measurements of scattered sunlight and Titan&apos;s thermal emission. We note the order-of-magnitude difference in the uncertainties quoted for P dep and P emi , and the difficulty of further constraining a putative imbalance if either the optical radius (a measure of Titan&apos;s sunlight-intercepting cross section , &apos;Methods&apos;) or the wavelength-dependent reflectance change over time. Titan&apos;s brightness surge has direct implications on the characterization of exoplanets with extended and hazy atmospheres, two oft-cited properties amongst known exoplanets [28, 29, 30, 31]. For illustration, we estimate (assuming a hydrogen-helium bulk composition and equilibrium temperature of 930 K) the background scale height of the low-gravity hot sub-Neptune CoRoT-24b to be H/R∼3.5×10 −2 , and therefore larger than Titan&apos;s H a /R. Whether the haze on these exoplanets (provided it exists) produces significant forward scattering is difficult to anticipate, as current haze formation models [32, 33] have limited capacities to predict particle sizes and the corresponding p a (θ→0). Therefore, it remains plausible that some exoplanets will exhibit brightness surges at large phase angles such as that experienced by Titan, which may in addition affect the measured transit radius [34]. Indeed, for a typical hot Jupiter on an edge-on orbit around a Sun-like star, phase angles of ∼175 • are probed immediately before and after transit. In that viewing configuration, an extended atmosphere bearing Titan-like haze will appear a few times brighter than indicated by its geometric albedo. The eventual detection of this phenomenon will help constrain the scale height and particle size of their atmospheric haze. Future theoretical work must therefore assess whether forward-scattering haze forms in exoplanet atmospheres. Also, characterization efforts with existent data from the CoRoT and Kepler mis-9 sions, and with data from upcoming spacecraft such as CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO and TESS, should study the larger phase angles, as they offer diagnostic possibilities complementary to those usually explored with primary and secondary eclipses. 10</p>

Thus, P dep and P emi are consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations during 2007-2013. Our study cannot rule out an energy imbalance, but it sets strict limits based on contemporaneous measurements of scattered sunlight and Titan's thermal emission.

Indeed, for a typical hot Jupiter on an edge-on orbit around a Sun-like star, phase angles of ∼175 • are probed immediately before and after transit. In that viewing configuration, an extended atmosphere bearing Titan-like haze will appear a few times brighter than indicated by its geometric albedo. The eventual detection of this phenomenon will help constrain the scale height and particle size of their atmospheric haze. Future theoretical work must therefore assess whether forward-scattering haze forms in exoplanet atmospheres. Also, characterization efforts with existent data from the CoRoT and Kepler mis-sions, and with data from upcoming spacecraft such as CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO and TESS, should study the larger phase angles, as they offer diagnostic possibilities complementary to those usually explored with primary and secondary eclipses.</p><p>surements made inside and outside the atmosphere. <ref type="bibr">Icarus, 270, 355-375 (2016)</ref>.</p><p>[17] Lemmon, M.T., Karkoschka, E. &amp; Tomasko, M.

The profiles of γ, ω 0 , and p(θ) are represented in the radiative transfer model over a total of 250 vertical slabs, each of them 2-km thick.</p><p>Our baseline description of the aerosol optical properties is based on the latest revision of the DISR observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The implemented properties were interpolated/extrapolated in wavelength from the DISR prescriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> to the corresponding filter effective wavelengths. The DISR optical properties are well constrained between 490 and 950 nm for γ a and ω 0,a <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and down to 355 nm for p a (θ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Model calculations based on the DISR implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have proven consistent with past spectroscopic measurements of the geometric albedo between 500 and 950 nm <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, a fact that is confirmed in this work. Indeed, the solid red curves of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>, which are based exclusively on the DISR aerosol implementation plus Rayleigh scattering by the N 2 /CH 4 gas (but without methane absorption), reproduce well the measured phase curves over the available range of phase angles. For these filter combinations (CL1_BL2, BL1_CL2, CL1_GRN, CL1_CB1, CL1_CB2, CL1_CB3), the 'best fits' presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> as solid red curves are simply 28 the outputs of the radiative transfer model without adjusting any input.</p><p>For the atmospheric gas (98.4%-1.6% by volume of N 2 -CH 4 ), we determine the scattering coefficient β g and scattering phase function p g (θ) from the classical expressions for Rayleigh scattering. Number densities of the gas are based on the HASI profiles of temperature and pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[42]</ref>. Because the impact of Rayleigh scattering is relatively small, the uncertainties associated with the HASI profiles have a negligible effect on the calculations. A number of ro-vibrational absorption bands of methane occur at visible and near infrared wavelengths. In our radiative transfer calculations, we parameterize the effect of methane absorption over both broad-and narrowband filter combinations by invoking filter-specific single scattering albedos ω 0,g such that γ g =β g /ω 0,g and α g =(1/ω 0,g −1)β g for the corresponding gas extinction and absorption coefficients, respectively. This simplified approach intends to reproduce the empirical phase curves affected by methane absorption with a minimum number of free parameters, and does it by assuming an altitude-independent treatment of methane absorption over each specific spectral passband.</p><p>For the optical properties of the aerosol-plus-gas mixture, we follow the usual summation rules: α=α a +α g , β=β a +β g , γ=γ a +γ g , and βp(θ)=β a p a (θ)+β g p g (θ).</p><p>By definition, the solid red curves of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> described above assume ω 0,g =1, which means that in those passbands the gas scatters but does not absorb. In other passbands (CL1_MT1, RED_CL2, CL1_CL2, CL1_MT2, IR2_CL2, CL1_MT3, CL1_IR3), methane does absorb, a fact that is readily confirmed from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>. In these specific passbands, we ran a battery of radiative transfer calculations to explore the impact of ω 0,g (≤1) on the model phase curves. The best fits shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>  Initial calculations showed that the DISR aerosol implementation did not provide a good match to the measured phase curves for the UV2_CL2</p><p>(λ eff =306 nm) and CL1_UV3 (343 nm) filter combinations. This was expected as the effective wavelengths of these filters fall outside the wavelength validity range for the DISR aerosol implementation. In the calculations for these two filter combinations, we adopted altitude-independent p a (θ) functions, which were calculated as in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref>. Keeping with the ideas that led from the original DISR aerosol prescription <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to the latest version <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we modified by an adjustable amount the aerosol single scattering albedo ω 0,a above 150 km with respect to the values obtained with the DISR analytical expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. An iterative process in which we ran many radiative transfer calculations each of them with a different correction to ω 0,a (z&gt;150 km) led to the best fits shown with dashed red curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>The actual corrections were: ω old 0,a (z&gt;150 km)→ω new 0,a =1.275ω old 0,a (z&gt;150 km) (UV2_CL2) and ω old 0,a (z&gt;150 km)→ω new 0,a =1.175ω old 0,a (z&gt;150 km) (CL1_UV3).</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head>truncated.</head><label></label><figDesc>In the jargon of Monte Carlo photon simulations, each photon is assigned an initial 'life' of 1 at the beginning of the simulation. As the photon scatters in the optical medium, its 'life' progressively diminishes. The photon is considered to have been fully absorbed by the medium when its left-over 'life' falls below an established threshold (10 −6 in our simulations). Because in the backward treatment of the scattering problem the photon trajectory is independent of the location of the Sun, it is possible to conduct simulations with an arbitrary number of Suns simultaneously. In the simu- lations presented here, we considered 91 simultaneous Sun positions (from 0 to 180 • in steps of 2 • ), which allowed us to obtain the entire phase curve in a single simulation. Each phase curve was obtained by simulating one million photons.</figDesc></figure>

Values of ω 0,g ∼1 mean that little methane absorption must be introduced, whereas values 1 mean that methane absorption is very effective at controlling the amount of ra- diation exiting the atmosphere. The best-fitting values of ω 0,g were: 0.575 (CL1_MT1), 0.900 (RED_CL2), 0.500 (CL1_CL2), 0.075 (CL1_MT2), 0.200 (IR2_CL2), 0.005 (CL1_MT3), and 0.090 (CL1_IR3). These num- bers correlate with the strength of the methane bands in the corresponding filter passbands.</figDesc></figure>
