			<abstract>
				<p>One of the science drivers for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is imaging and spectroscopy of exo-solar planets located as close as 20mas to their parent star [1]. The application requires a well thought-out design of the high contrast imaging instrumentation. Several working coronagraphic concepts have already been developed for the monolithic telescope with the diameter up to 8 meter. Nevertheless the conclusions made about the performance of these systems cannot be applied directly to the telescope of the diameter 30-100m. The existing schemes are needed to be reconsidered taking into account the specific characteristics of a segmented surface. We start this work with the classical system-Lyot coronagraph. We show that while the increase in telescope diameter is an advantage for the high contrast range science, the segmentation sets a limit on the performance of the coronagraph. Diffraction from intersegment gaps sets a floor to the achievable extinction of the starlight. Masking out the bright segment gaps in the Lyot plane although helps increasing the contrast, does not solve completely the problem: the high spatial frequency component of the diffractive light remains. We suggest using the Lyot stop which acts on the light within gaps in order to produce the uniform illumination in the Lyot plane. We show that for the diffraction limit regime and a perfect phasing this type of coronagraph achieves a sufficient star light extinction.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The term "high contrast imaging" (HCI) is referred to a large number of optical techniques combined by one common aim. This aim is the detection and imaging of faint objects (planets, planetary disks, companions etc.) on the intensive background formed by scattered and diffracted light from the parent star. Generally speaking there are two characteristic inputs of this task: first is that the background is much brighter than the object (typically the difference is 4-5 orders of magnitude), and second, that the faint object is located relatively close to the star (as close as 20 mas angular separation). The purpose of coronagraph as a part of HCI is to suppress the star light in the area of the expected planet location with minimal suppression of the planet light.</p><p>All planets search projects are of two kinds. Thus one speaks about the "telescopes for coronagraph (nulling interferometer)" and designs the telescope (configuration of telescopes) in the way the most suitable for HCI <ref type="bibr">(DARWIN[2]</ref>, TPF <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Or one speaks about "coronagraph for the telescope" and designs the HCI system the most compatible with the telescope (VLT-PF <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, JWST <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). In a case of ELT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> we are in the second situation. In order to make a choice among a huge variety of HCI techniques and methods one has to have a very clear definition of the imaging system itself and take into account all telescope particularities. The first order task inputs here are: giant pupil of the diameter 30m-100m with a relatively large central obscuration and segmentation. The segments phasing errors must be also considered at the level of coronagraph design. The high precision wavefront control and speckle subtraction are necessary conditions for HCI, nevertheless they are external to the coronagraph itself: adaptive optics is applied before and speckle subtraction after the star extinction module.</p><p>Based on the prime input of our task -telescope diameter, -the first logical candidate to be considered for ELT is classical Lyot coronagraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> with the absorbing focal mask. This type of the coronagraph we present in the paper, showing its specifics with respect to the segmentation and also the possible way to overcome the segmentation problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Exposition</head><p>Classical Lyot coronagraph is barely efficient for the telescope of diameter from 2 to 8m; it may get a new life for ELT. This scheme <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>) includes the absorbing mask placed in the focal plane to block the core image of the star and the diaphragm in the next pupil plane to cut the remained light diffracted outside the pupil.</p><p>Vectors ξ and w were chosen for pupil and image planes correspondingly. We denote by U 1 (ξ) a complex amplitude, measured in the pupil plane. In the next focal plane its Fourier transform u 1 (w) is multiplied by the function t(w), describing the shape of the absorbing mask. The inverse Fourier transform of that product is the complex amplitude in the next pupil plane (Lyot plane) -U C (ξ). A diaphragm with diameter a bit less than a pupil size cuts the remaining light. In idealistic case this system totally suppresses the deterministic part of the star PSF ("perfect coronagraph"). In reality there is some leak of light, even in diffraction limit case, which contributes to the residual after coronagraph star image, u c (w). The intensity and the shape of the residual PSF C =|u c (w)| 2 characterizes the performance of the coronagraph and defines the contrast.</p><p>The efficiency of the Lyot coronagraph depends on the size of the focal mask measured in the number of Airy disks. On the other hand, the mask cannot be very large in order not to block the planet itself. Clearly, the larger telescope diameter the more number of Airy rings is covered by a mask of a given size measures in arc seconds, the more efficient the coronagraph. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrated this fact. It shows the location of the planet at 50mas with respect of the Airy pattern from the star for 0.5µm wavelength.</p><p>For the mathematical convenience it is better to operate not with the function ( ) w t , but with the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) ( ) w w t m − = 1</formula><p>. Following the equations of the Fourier optics it can be shown that the complex amplitude in the Lyot plane before applying a diaphragm is a difference between the initial complex amplitude U 1 (ξ) and its convolution with the Fourier image of the function m(w) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ξ d M U λ 1 U U 2 2 1 C ′ ′ − ′ − = ∫ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ 1 (1)</formula><p>Note, that as function m(w) equals unit in the center (t(0)=0), its Fourier transform M(ξ) has an aria equal to λ 2 regardless the shape of the mask:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ) 2 2 λ d M = ∫ ξ ξ .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>To achieve a full extinction of the star light the function Uc must equal zero within the pupil. It can be achieved by the choice of the mask profile such that M U U ⊗ = 1 1 within the pupil. From Eq.2 it follows that function M(ξ) must be limited within the pupil. Mask with this property is called band limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Top-hat mask is not  band limited. The rule of Fourier transform tells us that the band limited mask is not limited itself, i.e. has infinite wings. The planet may fall in one of the maxima of the wings, which leads to the lost of throughput: part of the planet photons is not absorbed by a coronagraph. Although, if the size of the mask is small or the planet is far from the star, the band-limited masks are efficient. In the following we study a case of a mask with the Gaussian profile, which behaves similar to the band-limited one, but easier for analytics. Note also, that the efficiency of a double stage coronagraph, describes in the section 3, will increase with the band limited mask in comparison with the results presented for the Gaussian one.</p></div>

The area within the segments is constantly illuminated. Two possible types of Lyot stop are evident. First possibility (Lyot stop type 1) is to keep only the diaphragm without removing the light from the bright gaps. Second possibility (Lyot stop type 2) is to manufacture an absorbing grid, duplicating the segmentation grid, totally masking the light in the gaps. As a gap for a planet is an absorbing area, the second type of Lyot stop does not affect the light from the plant. Even if this type of the stop can be accurately manufactured and precisely aligned, the second type of coronagraph does not give a full extinction due to the remaining "floor" 2ωU 0 .</p><p>To compare the residual PSFc for two types of Lyot stop we use the representation of the PSF for segmented mirrors developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The PSF for segmented mirror can be represented as the product of a periodical function of sharp peaks (grid factor -GF) and the PSF produced by one individual segment (PSF S ). For the PSF C after coronagraph the analogous representation is valid. The application of Lyot stop on U C reveals in the change of function PSFs, while the GF remains unchanged. For two types of Lyot stop </p><p>All functions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. For the first type of Lyot stop PSF s,cor coincides with PSFs in the location of GF peaks. Consequently, the coronagraph with stop type 1 does not affect the diffraction peaks in the PSF and reduces the central peak. For the second type of Lyot stop the difference with the PSF before coronagraph is in the presence of the multiplier 4ω 2 . Therefore PSFc=4ω 2 PSF everywhere including peaks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> cannot serve for the contrast estimation; curves are obtained for the exaggerated gaps to illustrate the principle. Nevertheless, qualitatively the relative behavior of GF's multipliers remains the same for a typical gap size of 5-10mm; and the efficiency of the second scheme remains much higher than for the type 1. The throughput in both schemes is the same.</p><p>In the following we estimate the efficiency of the second scheme. The pupil after this stop can be considered analogous to the pupil of the segmented telescope with the same gaps and uniformly illuminated with amplitude 2ωU <ref type="bibr">0</ref> . This telescope has a characteristic for segmented telescope PSF with the satellite peaks. Therefore, for the efficiency estimation we need to calculated the PSF from segmented mirror and then to multiply it by a factor 4ω 2 .</p><p>In the expressions for the PSF for segmented mirrors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> the circular outer and inner telescope masks were not taken into account. If the latter is included than the Airy rings start being a dominated pattern of the PSF. Suppose that there are no piston-tip-tilt segment errors, but only intersegment gaps are considered. As it is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, everywhere except for the vicinity of the diffractive peaks, the maxima of the normalized PSF (related to contrast) from the segmented mirror with the gaps coincides with maxima of the normalized PSF from the same mirror without intersegment gaps. The intensity of the peaks can be defined by the Eq.18. The contrast within the area of D λ 2 ± around each diffractive peak must be defined separately. This approach for contrast estimation is applicable as well to the telescope with the central obscuration.</p><p>Combining Eq.10 and 18 and taking into account the Strehl ratio due to the gaps equal to ( ) 2 ω 1 − we obtain an expression for the contrast around the peaks for the second type of Lyot stop:     <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> the estimated contrast for two typical size of the gap g=5mm and g=14mm. For size of the segment d=1.6m it gives correspondingly ω=0.003 and ω=0.009. We assume that the size of the focal mask is such that γ=0.8 provides a flat light distribution after the diaphragm, so the result is independent on the size of the focal mask.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">( ) [ ]<label>( ) ( ) ω</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Solving gaps problem</head><p>We have seen that the diffraction by gaps sets a floor to extinction achievable with the coronagraph in a classical scheme. The required contrast depends on scientific parameters: planet brightness and angular position, wavelength. Nevertheless, if the scientific requirements are such that the contrast estimated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> is not sufficient, the coronagraph can be modified to improve it. Of course this improvement is at the expense of the set up complications. The double stage scheme we present here is a possible modification.</p><p>According to Eq. 17, there is proportionality between complex amplitude U C within the segment pupil and the gap. So far we were removing the component U C,Gap completely by placing the reticulated Lyot stop with zero transmission in the gap, creating again "segmentation" in the Lyot plane. This can be avoided if we change the wave front in the gap area such that U C,Gap = U C,Segment , creating a uniform illumination in Lyot plane. For that we have to inverse the phase of the wavefront and attenuate the amplitude by a factor ( )  Note that the attenuation factor does not depend on the intensity of the light (star brightness). This modification of the grating does not affect the planet image, because the gaps for the planet are absorbing.

For comparison on the same graph we plotted the intensity of the A 1 peaks after the one stage coronagraph with Lyot stop of the second type. For the large bandwidth the performance of the double stage coronagraph is comparable with the performance of its simplified ancestor.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Coping with phasing errors</head><p>The principle of a double stage coronagraph can be utilizes to reduce the residual phasing error and release the requirement on the residual phasing rms. L. Jolissaint and J.-F. Lavigne have demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that the adaptive optics corrects any static aberrations up to spatial frequency system's bandwidth 1/2d a , where d a , is separation between actuators. If the wavefront on input of the adaptive optics system consists of segments static aberrations (including piston-tilt-tilt), the in the residual wavefront the phase error remains only in the vicinity a d ± around the segments border <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 12)</ref>. Masking the borders with an absorbing grid, we create the segmented telescope with the large gap (~d a ), although with the decreased phase error. Applying the double Lyot coronagraph on the masked mirror may increase the contrast in comparison with a simple coronagraph applied on the non-masked pupil. As the gaps after the reticulated mask are large and regular, the implementation and alignment of the phase shift attenuating Lyot stop becomes easier. On the other hand the increase of the gap size makes the double Lyot coronagraph more sensitive to the chromatic effects, as it was shown before. Besides, this scheme decreases the throughput. The efficiency of such a system with respect to segmentation error and the contrast-throughput trade-off is the subject of a future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Classical Lyot coronagraph for ELT benefits from the size of the focal mask. If the planet located at 4λ/D for 8m telescope, then for the same wavelength it will be located at 15λ/D for 30m telescope and 50λ/D for a 100m telescope.</p><p>The concept of segmentation increases the number of effects affecting the performance of the coronagraph. Among them there are the intersegment gaps which set a limit for the achievable star light extinction even for a very huge focal mask. This problem can be solved at the expense of the complication of the system. One of the solutions is the double stage coronagraph with the complex stop in a first stage. This concept allows increasing of contrast by 3-4 orders of magnitude. Typically, the one stage coronagraph applied on segmented telescope with 10mm gap and 1.6m segment gives a contrast ~10 -8 . The second stage will decrease this number to 10 -12 , which is sufficient to be considered as "perfect coronagraph."</p><p>The suggested concept introduces chromatic effect into initially achromatic scheme. Nevertheless only if the bandwidth increases ~30% the performance of a double scheme becomes worse than performance of a one stage coronagraph. For 10% bandwidth the gain in contrast is about 1 order of magnitude.</p><p>The contrast can be estimated by means of the contrast curve, connecting the maxima of the residual PSF. The approximate analytical expressions for the contrast curve allow avoiding the time consuming numerical </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .
