				<p>Many global circulation models predict supersonic zonal winds and large vertical shears in the atmospheres of short-period jovian exoplanets. Using linear analysis and nonlinear local simulations, we investigate hydrodynamic dissipation mechanisms to balance the thermal acceleration of these winds. The adiabatic Richardson criterion remains a good guide to linear stability, although thermal diffusion allows some modes to violate it at very long wavelengths and very low growth rates. Nonlinearly, wind speeds saturate at Mach numbers ≈ 2 and Richardson numbers 1/4 for a broad range of plausible diffusivities and forcing strengths. Turbulence and vertical mixing, though accompanied by weak shocks, dominate the dissipation, which appears to be the outcome of a recurrent Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. An explicit shear viscosity, as well as thermal diffusivity, is added to ZEUS to capture dissipation outside of shocks. The wind speed is not monotonic nor single valued for shear viscosities larger than about 10 −3 of the sound speed times the pressure scale height. Coarsening the numerical resolution can also increase the speed. Hence global simulations that are incapable of representing vertical turbulence and shocks, either because of reduced physics or because of limited resolution, may overestimate wind speeds. We recommend that such simulations include artificial dissipation terms to control the Mach and Richardson numbers and to capture mechanical dissipation as heat.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Strongly irradiated extrasolar giant planets-"hot Jupiters"-are expected to rotate synchronously with their orbits but to have strong longitudinal winds that redistribute heat from the day to the night side. The efficiency of redistribution is important for direct observables including infrared phase curves, the depth of secondary eclipses in transiting systems (i.e., eclipses of the planet by its star), and planetary spectra. Turbulence associated with the winds may contribute to chemical mixing of the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>), and might even inject heat into the convective interior of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guillot &amp; Showman 2002)</ref>, thereby perhaps explaining why some of these planets have lower densities than expected by standard evolutionary models at their estimated ages.</p><p>In a previous paper (Goodman 2009, hereafter Paper I), one of us has argued that these thermally driven winds can be understood as natural heat engines, which convert a fraction of the thermal power into mechanical work: namely, the work expended to accelerate the wind. As with any other heat engine, the continual production of work must be balanced by mechanical dissipation, else the kinetic energy in the winds would grow without bound. Paper I offered a brief discussion of possible dissipation mechanisms. Here we explore those mechanisms in greater detail. The goal is to lay the foundation for subgrid models of the dissipative process suitable for use by global circulation codes.</p><p>The outline of this paper is as follows. §2 gives an overview of the dissipation mechanisms we consider. §3 presents a linear analysis of hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of thermally stratified shear flows. We show that such flows can be destabilized by thermal diffusivity even at Richardson numbers greater than the well-known critical value Ri crit = 1/4. Under conditions relevant to exoplanet winds, however, we estimate that the associated growth rates are too slow and the longitudinal wavelengths too long to be important for dissipation, unless Ri &lt; 1/4, which requires transsonic flow unless the vertical width of the shear layer is small compared to a pressure scale height. Hence shocks may be as important as shear-driven turbulence for dissipation. To investigate this, as described in §4, we have used the ZEUS code in two dimensions to simulate a part of the atmosphere with horizontal and vertical dimensions comparable to the pressure scale height. Thermal diffusion and viscosity have been added to the code, and thermal driving of the wind is simulated by a horizontal body force with nonzero curl. We study the velocity and dissipation rate of the wind in a statistical steady state as a function of the strength of the driving compared to the acceleration of gravity. §5 discusses our results in the context of previous work on winds in jovian planets both within and beyond the solar system. §6 summarizes our main conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of dissipation mechanisms</head><p>We begin by reviewing the physical conditions in those parts of the atmosphere where strong winds may occur. Because of the strong stellar irradiation, the temperature should be approximately constant with depth,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T ≈ 1300 f L * L ⊙ 1/4 a 10R ⊙ −1/2 K (1)</formula><p>where L * is the stellar luminosity, a the orbital semi-major axis, and f a dimensionless factor of order unity that depends upon the local zenith angle of the star, the albedo, and the efficiency of lateral heat redistribution (f = 1 for complete redistribution and negligible albedo). For a solar-mass primary, the orbital period is P orb = 3.66(a/10R ⊙ ) 3/2 d. The sound speed in an atmosphere dominated by molecular hydrogen is c s ≈ 2.75(T /1300 K) 1/2 km s −1 . A characteristic circulation timescale is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t circ = 2πR P c s ≈ 1.85 T 1300 K −1/2 R p R J d ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R p is the planetary radius. Assuming that the planet rotates synchronously, by this definition t circ is comparable to the rotation period, as it is on Earth. Coriolis effects are likely to be important but not as dominant as on a more rapidly rotating and colder planet such as Jupiter itself.</p><p>Several considerations point to transsonic wind speeds, as discussed in Paper I. First, absent dissipation, flow along isobars from the day to the night side, starting from rest, would accelerate to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U ∼ g∆z ln T day T night ,</formula><p>where ∆z ∼ H p = c 2 s /γg is the range of depths over which the thermal forcing changes sign [see eq. (16)]. Indeed, repeated cycling between day and night could accelerate the wind indefinitely, were there no mechanical dissipation. Second, the strong entropy stratification tends to stabilize the flow against turbulent dissipation at small Mach numbers. And third, many numerical models of exoplanetary circulation do predict supersonic winds (see Paper I for references).</p><p>Another direct consequence of the radiatively induced temperature (1) is that the vertical density profile is approximately exponential, with a scale height H p = k B T /gm H 2 that is small compared to the planetary radius:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H p R p ≈ 2.9 × 10 −3 T 1300 K R p R J −1 g g J −1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where g = GM p /R 2 p is the surface gravity and g J ≡ GM J /R 2 J,eq ≈ 2500 cm s −2 . The pressure at the infrared photosphere is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p ph = 2g p 3κ r ≈ 1.7 κ r cm 2 g −1 −1 g g J mbar ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where κ r is the Rosseland mean opacity appropriate to the temperature (1). A larger characteristic pressure is that at which the thermal time is comparable to t circ . Taking t th = H 2 p /χ, where χ = 16σT 3 /κρ 2 c P is the thermal diffusivity and c P ≈ 3.5k B /m H 2 the specific heat capacity, we estimate the latter pressure at</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p th ≈ 70 κ r cm 2 g −1 −1/2 T 1300 K 5/4 g g J R p R J 1/2 mbar .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The Reynolds number of these winds is enormous. The dynamic viscosity of molecular hydrogen is <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Stiel &amp; Thodos 1963</ref>) ρν = 1.9 × 10 −4 (T /1000 K) 0.65 g cm −1 s −1 , and therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Re ≡ c s H p ν ≈ 5 × 10 8 p mbar T 1300 K −0.15 g g J −1 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>At pressures above a microbar at most, therefore, it is appropriate to regard the winds as inviscid.</p><p>By other dimensionless measures, however, these flows are less ideal. At these temperatures and pressures, thermal ionization of alkali metals yields magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm ≡ c s H p /η ∼ O(1), where η is the magnetic diffusivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batygin &amp; Stevenson (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Perna et al. (2010)</ref> have suggested that non-ideal MHD effects could exert a significant drag on the winds and perhaps even contribute to heating the convective interior in the presence of a background planetary magnetic field 10 G.</p><p>A dimensionless inverse measure of thermal (rather than magnetic) diffusion is the Peclet number</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P e ≡ c s H p χ ≈ 0.2 p mbar 2 κ r cm 2 g −1 T 1300 K −7/2 g g J −1 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Thus, at the pressure (5) where thermal and advection timescales may be comparable, P e ∼ 10 3 , with no direct dependence on κ r .</p><p>Another important dimensionless quantity is the Richardson number, which characterizes the relative strength of stratification and shear. The local Richardson number at altitude z is Ri(z) ≡ N 2 /(dU/dz) 2 , where N(z) is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency [eq. (11)]. In the limit of infinite Re and P e, a necessary condition for incompressible shear-driven instability is that Ri &lt; 1/4 somewhere in the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Drazin &amp; Reid 1981)</ref>. For a flow that changes smoothly by ∆U over a vertical distance ∆z, a characteristic value for Ri in a constant-temperature background is, using eq. <ref type="formula">(11)</ref> and noting H p = c 2 s /γg,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Ri ≈ (γ − 1) M 2 γ 2 ∆z H p 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where M = 2∆U/c s is the Mach number associated with the amplitude of the shear profile. Thus since γ ≈ 7/5 for an atmosphere dominated by molecular hydrogen, M 0.9(∆z/H p ) is required for instability. This linear stability criterion can be related to an energy principle and therefore should govern nonlinear instabilities also. However, when the stratification is primarily thermal rather than compositional, as we expect for the wind zone of these atmospheres, its stabilizing influence can be undercut by diffusion of heat. Thus instability may be possible at Ri &gt; 1/4 if the Peclet number <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> is not too large. One of the goals of the present study is to quantify this statement for hot-Jupiter winds.</p><p>From this survey of characteristic physical conditions and dimensionless numbers, three possible sources of mechanical dissipation for the winds come to the fore: (1) MHD effects, probably requiring B 10 G; (2) shear-driven turbulence, requiring Ri &lt; 1/4 and/or moderate P e; and (3) shocks, requiring M &gt; 1 as we have defined it. Another possibility, raised in Paper I, is the double-diffusive Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goldreich &amp; Schubert 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fricke 1968)</ref>, which we do not consider here for two reasons: first, although the linear GSF instability is axisymmetric, we believe that its saturation can be studied reliably only with high-resolution 3D simulations, whereas we limit ourselves to 2D; and second, because the instability shuts off when (in the usual cylindrical coordinates) ∂v φ /∂z = 0 and ∂(̟v φ ) 2 /∂̟ ≥ 0, which conditions are not inconsistent with strong vertical shears at equatorial latitudes. Nonlinear MHD effects present even greater numerical challenges. Therefore, we concentrate on Richardson turbulence and shocks.</p></div>

We are interested in the growth rates in the weak viscosity regime and their relevance to our numerical simulations.</p><p>Assuming a plane-parallel background state with horizontal flow</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">θ 0 = 0 = ˜ p 0 , v 0 = U(z)ˆ e x ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>we can expand all perturbations with the dependence exp(−iωt + ik x x + ik y y) to obtain the linearized 6 th order system of equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">v ′′′′ 1z = ik 2 σ ν − k 4 − ik x U ′′ ν v 1z + 2k 2 − iσ ν v ′′ 1z + (k 2 ) ν θ 1 ,<label>(14a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">θ ′′ 1 = − iσ χ + k 2 θ 1 + N 2 χ v 1z ,<label>(14b)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">σ = ω − k x U, k ≡ (k 2 x + k 2 y ) 1/2</formula><p>, and primes denote d/dz. We use a relaxation method to solve this system of equations, and we test our results against limiting cases of background velocity profile U and parameters ν, χ, and N 2 for which there are simple analytic solutions. See the Appendix for the limits and analytical solutions. We can nondimensionalize our parameters by defining the Richardon number as Ri = N 2 H 2 p /U 2 max , Reynolds number Re = H p U/ν, Peclet number P e = H p U/χ, and Prandtl number P r = ν/χ = P e/Re. (In §2, we scaled Re and P e by the sound speed rather than the flow velocity in the expectation of a Mach number of order unity, but that is not appropriate in the present Boussinesq context.) We give all our linear results in terms of these dimensionless numbers.</p><p>For the problem of interest we specify boundary conditions for the system (14) as follows We impose v 1z = 0 at z = ±z max so that the fluid perturbations do not penetrate the boundary. We further impose v ′′ 1z = −ik x v ′ 1x − ik y v ′ 1y = 0, corresponding to vanishing viscous stress, and θ 1 = 0, corresponding to fixed temperature, at both boundaries.</p><p>Consider now the limit ν → 0, χ → 0 of eqns <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(14)</ref> v</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">′′ 1z = − k x U ′′ σ + k 2 − (k 2 ) N 2 σ 2 v 1z .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>From WKB arguments, the time taken for a wavelike disturbance to reach z = 0 from z = z 1 = 0 is infinite if Ri &gt; 1/4. Further, from energy arguments the potential energy barrier separating two fluid elements at different heights exceeds the available kinetic energy that can be liberated if Ri &gt; 1/4 (Chandrasekhar 1961). From these considerations, we expect the stratified shear flow to be stable for Ri 1/4 in the inviscid case with no thermal diffusion.</p><p>As we turn up the thermal diffusivity the potential energy barrier between fluid elements at different heights can be more easily overcome, and we expect instabilities to survive to higher Richardson number.

We refer to this critical solution as the marginally stable mode.</p><p>For our stability analysis we pick background velocity profile U = U 0 tanh(z/H p ). Squire's theorem tells us that in the limit of vanishing thermal diffusivity the largest growth rates are obtained for k y H p = 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Drazin &amp; Reid 1981)</ref>, so we might expect this result to generalize to the case with thermal diffusion. <ref type="figure">In Fig 1 we</ref> show the marginally stable Richardson number as a function of k x H p for k y H p = 0, .1, .2 and P e = 10, Re = 10 3 . As |k y H p | increases, the critical Richardson number decreases for all k x H p . Growth rates at fixed Richardson number correspondingly decrease. We set k y H p = 0 hereafter because we are interested in the fastest growing modes. Note that we find two distinct instabilities at long and short wavelengths. The long wavelength instabilities have not converged with z max . The solid lines indicate solutions computed with z max = 3H p , and the dashed line indicates a solution computed at z max = 5H p . The long wavelength instability is driven to longer wavelengths as z max increases. We run into similar issues encountered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dudis (1973)</ref> in the long wavelength limit. We must integrate to larger and larger z max or use an appropriate asymptotic boundary condition as k x H p → 0 to obtain better convergence.</p><p>Although our code has not converged for long wavelengths, our results suggest that there <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-Marginally stable Richardson number as a function of k x H p for P e = 10, Re = 10 3 , and at a sequence of |k y H p | = 0, .1, .2.

The dashed curve shows a separate run at z max = 5H p , indicating the long wavelength results have not converged. may be a real inviscid instability in the limit k x H p → 0. This is demonstrated analytically in Appendix B. The dimensionless form of the equations of motion given in the Appendix suggest that the long-wavelength modes should be sensitive to the combination of parameters P eRi k z 2 max /H p , and the analysis guarantees the existence of the long-wavelength modes only where this combination is ≪ 1; some version of the long-wavelength modes may exist more generally, but we have not proven it. So it is not surprising that our numerical results for these modes have not converged with respect to z max .</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 2 we</ref> show the critical Richardson number as a function of k x H p at Re = 10 3 and at a sequence of Peclet numbers. As the Peclet number decreases below ∼ 40, the long wavelength instability begins to strengthen and survive above Ri = 1/4. The dashed line is a run at higher z max = 5H p and shows the convergence of short wavelength results. As the Peclet number decreases below ∼ 2.5 the flow at short wavelengths begins to destabilize above Ri = 1/4. For high Reynolds number and high Peclet number our short wavelength results are in rough agreement with the inviscid results of <ref type="bibr">Dudis (1974)</ref>.

The long wavelength growth rates at k x H p = 3.2/Re are well over two orders of magnitude smaller than shorter wavelength growth rates. This result agrees with our estimation that the inviscid instability in the limit k x H p → 0 has weak growth rate. For our numerical simulations we will be primarily interested in the more unstable short wavelength instabilities that have maximum growth at k x H p ∼ 0.5. Note that Ri crit increases with decreasing P e, so we are computing growth rates at higher Richardson number for the lower Peclet number curves. At fixed Ri, growth rates increase with decreasing P e, as we expect from simple heat diffusion arguments.</p><p>We conclude from Figs 2 and 3 that the linear growth rates of the fastest growing mode are unchanged in the parameter regime we are interested in, P e ∼ 10 2 − 10 4 .

Cartesian coordinates x and z correspond to longitude and altitude, respectively, each extending over a few pressure scale heights: typically 20H p × 5H p . Longitude x is periodic, though with a period much less than the true circumference of the planet.

This curl must vanish in the (nearly isentropic) convection zone. Furthermore, since thermal forcing by itself does not add any net momentum to the flow, 1 the nonpotential longitudinal force must reverse sign with depth within the radiative atmosphere. In fact one expects this nonpotential "battery" to be concentrated at pressures p th [(5)], which is quite shallow compared to the radiative-convective interface, typically ∼kbar. The nonpotential force must also reverse sign at least twice in longitude because (16) is periodic in φ, but the horizontal scale of variation of this force is probably small compared to its vertical scale since the radiative atmosphere is thin. Hence the profile (19), which is horizontally constant and extends over ∼ 2H p vertically, reversing sign within this depth, is a plausible representation of the horizontal forcing within our local computational domain.</p></div>

We nondimensionalize parameters according to these units.</p><p>We run our simulations over 20 scale heights in the horizontal direction. We are physically interested in P e −1 ≈ 10 −2 − 10 −4 , Re −1 → 0, but the viscosity must be large enough to maintain energy conservation, and ǫ ≤ 10 −2 . In the absence of a shear viscosity the grid loses energy to numerical dissipation at the grid scale. We must pick ν large enough such that the viscous dissipation length l ν ∼ (|∂ j v i |/ν) −1/2 is larger than the grid scale, and the dissipation of solenoidal turbulence is converted to internal energy. Our standard runs have N p = 10 grid points per pressure scale height, but for certain runs which conserve energy less well we use up to N p = 30 grid points per pressure scale height.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Tests</head><p>We run two simple test problems to verify proper implementation of the horizontal forcing and viscosity. Using a simplified shear viscosity ∂v/∂t = ν∇ 2 v and no viscous heating, there is an exact solution for the viscous decay of initial velocity profile given by U(z, 0) = sign(z)ˆ e x . The velocity is given at later times by U(z, t) = erf(z/2 √ νt)ˆ e x . Again using this simplified shear viscosity and horizontal forcing given by f (z) = ǫ2sech 2 (z/H p ) tanh(z/H p ), there is an exact laminar solution for the velocity profile. The laminar solution satisfies 0 = f (z) + νU ′′ (z), where U(z) = (ǫH 2 p /ν) tanh(z/H p ). We conclude from these two tests that there is negligible numerical dissipation in the laminar regime. We can also use the latter to estimate the wind speed in the laminar regime when the viscous heating is implemented.</p><p>We are interested in the behavior of the solutions to eqns 17 and 18 at different forcing amplitudes. We check that the parameter α has a second order effect on the forcing and that we can roughly characterize the amplitude of the forcing by the single parameter ǫ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Diagnostics of dissipation</head><p>We must also maintain energy conservation in our simulations. We are continually injecting energy onto the grid via the horizontal forcing, and to reach a statistical steady state this energy must first be converted into internal energy and then allowed to diffuse through the boundary walls. Because ZEUS is not based on a conservative form of the energy equation, numerical diffusion dissipates kinetic energy on the grid scale without converting it to internal energy; to avoid this, it is necessary to add an explicit shear viscosity (in addition to the artificial bulk viscosity used to mediate shocks).</p><p>We compute a fractional energy error</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">˙ E ˙ E in = ˙ E in − ˙ E kin − ˙ E int − ˙ E grav − ˙ E out ˙ E in ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">˙ E in = ρv x f (z)dxdz ˙ E kin = d dt 1 2 ρv 2 dxdz ˙ E int = d dt e dxdz ˙ E out = −ρc p χ ∂T ∂z zmax z min dx ˙ E grav = d dt ρgz dxdz</formula><p>We briefly mention here a number of strategies that we use to improve energy conservation. The fractional energy error will tend to decrease if we keep the amplitude of the forcing function lower so that there is less energy injection onto the grid. In a similar vein, if we localize the forcing function to the shear layer as opposed to distributing it over the entire vertical extent of the grid then there will be less energy injection and better energy conservation. Other strategies include increasing the kinematic viscosity or making the grid resolution finer in order to capture kinetic energy dissipation above the grid scale via the explicit viscosity. Finally, we can increase the thermal diffusivity so as to allow excess internal energy to diffuse off the grid. These considerations must be balanced against keeping the computation time reasonably low and keeping the solutions physically relevant to the problems of interest.</p><p>We consider that a statistical steady state is reached when ˙ E int t , ˙ E kin t , and ˙ E grav t are all ≪ ˙ E in , and when the Mach number [eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref>] and the rms vertical velocity v 2 z 1/2</p><p>x,y are constant for at least a horizontal sound crossing time, 20H p /c s .

The price paid for this approach is having to deal with a mixture of reversible and irreversible effects. Under adiabatic conditions, for example, the compressive heating term ˙ E pdV = −p ∇· v d 2 x would be completely reversible, but shocks and thermal diffusion make ˙ E pdV = 0 even in steady state. There is also a change in gravitational potential energy ˙ E grav = v z ρgd 2 x associated with the vertical gravity source step.

We find it easiest to monitor the combination ˙ E pdV + ˙ E grav . The time average of this term is largely the work done to mix the fluid vertically; absent thermal diffusion, this could lead to an almost adiabatic temperature-pressure profile, ∂ ln T /∂z ≈ −(γ − 1)g/c 2 s , but in steady state diffusion tends to restore the stratification. Thus vertical mixing acts as a refrigerator-a heat engine in reverse-absorbing mechanical work to drive heat up the temperature gradient.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results</head><p>Figs 4,5, and 6 respectively give the run of Mach number, defined in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref>, rms vertical velocity, and fractional energy error versus ν/c s H p for χ/c s H p = 0.094, ǫ = 0.1. The Prandtl number is less than one for all of these runs. Note the presence of four distinct solutions at ν/c s H p &gt; 10 −3 . There is a fast solution, denoted by filled triangles, a medium velocity solution, denoted by filled squares, and two slow solutions, denoted by filled circles and open stars. Where solution branches overlap, we trace each branch by starting from a representative member and then gradually varying parameters. We use a similar parameter deformation to verify that each branch is limited to a certain range of ν/c s H p as indicated in Figs 4-6. The solutions differ in the importance of laminar, turbulent, shock, and irreversible compressional dissipation. The fast solutions (triangles) have high laminar energy dissipation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig 5 indicates</ref> that there is a significant vertical component to the velocity field, but the bulk of the viscous dissipation is laminar rather than turbulent. This is reflected by wavelike oscillations in the flow as opposed to turbulent Kelvin-Helmholtz rolls. The medium and slow B solutions have stronger irreversible compressional heating and shocks, but they still have relatively high laminar dissipation. For the planetary wind problem of interest to us this laminar dissipation is unphysical, and as we increase the Reynolds number these solutions disappear. We conclude that these unphysical solutions are supported by  Extra filled circles at log 10 ν/c s H p = −3.03 in figs 4 -6 indicate higher resolution runs. The wind speeds and rms vertical velocities overlap, but the energy errors progress downwards at higher resolution.</p><p>We summarize these results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> by providing quantitative diagnostics for each solution type. We give the shear viscosity, turbulent viscosity, relative importance of artificial bulk viscosity, relative importance of turbulent dissipation, Mach number, and Richardson number for a representative solution of each type. The laminar and turbulent energy dissipation rates are directly proportional to the quoted shear and turbulent viscosities, as described in §4.3. At this stage we are only providing rough diagnostics to characterize each solution type, but we infer that shocks contribute weakly to the irreversible compression because the artificial-bulk-viscosity dissipations are relatively small. The Mach number is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">M ≡ max z ρ(x, z)v x (z)dx c s,wall ρ(x, z) dx − min z ρ(x, z)v x (z)dx c s,wall ρ(x, z) dx .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>We compute the minimum Richardson number in our flows via</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">Ri = min z N 2 (∂ ¯ U /∂z) 2 = min z ¯ p ¯ ρ ∂ ln ¯ p ∂z 2 ∂ ¯ U ∂z −2 ∇ ad − d ln ¯ T d ln ¯ p ,</formula><p>where overbar denotes horizontal average. The fastest and medium solutions are convective near the top wall. This is due to the higher wind speed and energy injection, which cause a steeper temperature gradient there. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> shows that the fastest triangle solution in the laminar regime has wind speed scaling roughly as 1/ν, as we expect from our tests in §4.2. Further, the perfectly laminar solution at ν/c s H p = −1.03 has Ri = 0.36, and we check that it should be linearly stable as well. From our runs at lower forcing we determine that for the fastest (triangle) solution, the viscosity that maximizes the wind speed scales in proportion to the forcing: ν peak /c s H p ∝ ǫ. The peak wind itself decreases only marginally. We can understand this behavior by assuming a steady-state balance between laminar dissipation of the mean flow and the forcing (19). These solutions are able to reach such a high wind speed because they are nearly laminar, until turbulent dissipation kicks in at low ν.</p><p>We map the solution space at lower forcing and thermal diffusivity and verify that there are four different solutions in the regime P r 1. Specifically, we looked at χ/c s H p = 0.094 and ǫ = .025, .05, and 0.1, and also at χ/c s H p = 0.047, ǫ = 0.1. These parameters correspond to the four values in the first three rows of table 3, discussed in greater detail below. There are small quantitative differences in the results at χ/c s H p = 0.047, ǫ = 0.1. The fastest solution in particular has peak horizontally averaged Mach number ∼ 15% higher. From our linear analysis we expect little difference in the results for any Peclet number in the range P e &gt; 10. In our simulations we are continually injecting energy onto our grid though, and the diffusivity affects how this energy is redistributed. We attribute the differences in the nonlinear behavior for P e ∼ O(10) to the important dynamical effect of this internal energy redistribution.</p><p>The main takeaway point from these runs at different forcing and thermal diffusivity is that in the high-Reynolds-number limit there is a unique solution, for which the direct viscous dissipation of the mean flow is negligible compared to turbulent and shock dissipation. Further, if the grid resolution is insufficiently low, with N p O(3), we may lock onto an artificially fast solution, even at ν/c s H p = 0. We check the latter result for the range of parameters we studied and not just for those relevant to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>.</p><p>We now attempt to extract an effective turbulent viscosity from the physically relevant slow A solution. First note that the energy errors in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 6</ref> are largest for the slow A solutions. In order to decrease the numerical dissipation we can either increase the shear viscosity ν/c s H p or we can make the grid resolution finer. We cannot increase the shear viscosity indefinitely because we will enter the multiple-solution regime <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4)</ref> or the laminar viscosity will become large enough to modify the properties of the solution. We must balance this against the increased computational cost of running the simulations at higher resolution. To calculate the turbulent viscosity we use sufficiently high grid resolution and shear viscosity such that the numerical energy dissipation rate is 5% of the energy injection rate, but shear viscosity is low enough such that the gross properties of the solution are not modified.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref> we give the Mach number and turbulent viscosity for a series of slow A solutions at different horizontal forcing amplitudes and thermal diffusivities. The exact value of the explicit viscosity we use is unimportant, so long as the viscous dissipation length is larger than the grid scale and the viscosity is small enough to leave the gross properties of the slow A solution unmodified. In general the runs satisfy Re &gt; 10 3 . The runs at χ/c s H p = 0.094 and ǫ = 0.025, 0.01 are done at the standard resolution of N p = 10 grid points per pressure scale height. The rest are done at twice the standard resolution (i.e., twice as many points in each dimension), with the exception of the run at χ/c s H p = 0.013, ǫ = 0.01, which is done at three times the standard resolution, and the run at χ/c s H p = 0.094, ǫ = 0.005, which is done at 1.5 times the standard resolution. We emphasize that these values of N p indicate the grid resolution required at each set of parameter values to conserve energy within 5%, not the resolution required to find the slow A solution at ν/c s H p = 0. At the standard resolution of N p = 10, we still find the slow A solution at ν/c s H p = 0 for all parameters surveyed, but the fractional energy error may be as large as 0.3 for the lowest diffusivity runs.</p><p>The Mach number decreases gradually with forcing amplitude ǫ for ǫ = 0.1 down to ǫ = 0.01, and is roughly independent of ǫ for ǫ = 0.005 − 0.01. It is also independent of the diffusivity strength for P e ∼ 10 − 100, at all forcing amplitudes surveyed. The latter is consistent with our linear analysis, and we attribute this result to the lower energy injection rate as compared to the faster solutions from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. There is less thermal redestribution of heat in the slow A solutions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref> shows the Mach number as a function of time for the run at ǫ = 0.01 and χ/c s H p = 0.013. The run has reached a statistical steady state after time ∼ 10H p /c s . The steady state is characterized by a drive-up phase in which the Mach number gradually rises, and a short slowdown phase in which the Mach number rapidly drops. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> we show the relative contributions of dissipation due to artificial bulk viscosity and turbulence, as defined in §4.3. Both dissipation terms are confined to the slowdown phases. Shocks appear briefly during slowdown, but the majority of the kinetic energy dissipation occurs in the absence of shocks. We thus conclude that shocks do not significantly contribute to the irreversible compressional heating.</p><p>We now characterize the nature of the sharp slowdown phases that limit the wind speed in our flow. The drive-up phase is relatively smooth with small changes in the state variables across the flow. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows the velocity vector field with temperature contours from T wall  to T max = 1.07T max for the starred point from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. At a short time before reaching the peak wind speed, t ≈ 0.2H p /c s , a vigorous instability with 3 wavelengths in our box develops. <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> shows the velocity vector field with temperature contours from T wall to T max = 1.46T max for the boxed point from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. The unstable mode is clearly visible in the temperature profile roughly halfway through the slowdown phase. Note the shocks at z/H p &lt; −1 and x/H p = −4.5, 2, 8.5. Following our previous determination that the shocks are weak, we conclude that turbulent mixing associated with this unstable mode is the primary agent for dissipating kinetic energy and reducing the wind speed.</p><p>The dimensions of our box enforce a periodicity under the transformation x → x+20H p . If the unstable mode is an ordinary Kelvin-Helmholtz mode, then from our linear analysis the only modes that can grow have either 1, 2, or 3 wavelengths in the box. Apparently the mode with 3 wavelengths and wavenumber k x H p ≈ .94 is the fastest growing of the three. The Richardson numbers satisfy Ri &lt; 1/4. We verify that the growth of this instability and its effect on the wind speed are independent of the dimensions of our domain. We increase the horizontal extent of our box from L x = 20H p to L x = 30H p and L x = 40H p and verify the presence of this instability. At L x = 30H p the fastest growing modes have 3 or 4 wavelengths in the box, and at L x = 40H p they have 4 or 5 wavelengths. These wave numbers are roughly consistent with our linear analysis. More importantly though, the time-averaged Mach number of the flow remains unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Ultimately we would like to provide a dissipation prescription for global simulations that do not resolve the turbulent nature of the wind profile. We first note that from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig  7 we</ref> find a horizontally and time averaged Mach number M ∼ 1.7 and peak horizontally averaged Mach number M ∼ 2.7. The peak occurs just before the rapid growth of instabilities, and so the latter corresponds to the absolute peak Mach number in the flow. Global simulations are often more strongly supersonic. For example, the model of HD 209458b by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cooper &amp; Showman (2005)</ref> finds v max ≈ 9 km s −1 at the 2.5 mbar level (see Paper I for a survey of the calculations prior to 2009).</p><p>Most of these studies of global circulation employ reduced equations of motion based on the approximation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium: shallow-water, equivalent barotropic, or primitive equations. This is done in order to cope efficiently with the large ratio of horizontal to vertical scales [eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref>], but the approximations used also have the effect of filtering out sound waves and shocks (even horizontally propagating ones). Such codes cannot directly represent the shocks and turbulent vertical motions studied here, although they can   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The turbulent dissipation is largely irreversible compression, and it dominates over the shock dissipation. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Velocity field for the slow A solution at χ/c s H p = 0.013, ǫ = 0.01 during the drive up phase (starred point in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>).

Periodic shocks occur at z/H p &lt; −1, but the bulk of the heating is due to irreversible compression. represent horizontal shears (which we do not) and hydraulic jumps (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2009)</ref>, which bear some resemblance to shocks but do not conserve energy and may not be triggered in the same circumstances. Therefore no particular reason exists as to why our results for the wind speeds should agree quantitatively with those obtained from the primitive equations, for example.</p><p>Comparison with the calculations carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burkert et al. (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Lin (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Dobbs-Dixon et al. (2010, herafter DCL)</ref> is potentially more revealing, because these calculations, like ours, use the full compressible hydrodynamic equations. The most recent of these studies included an explicit shear viscosity. It was found that the viscosity had little effect unless at least 10 10 cm 2 s −1 , above which the speed decreased monotonically. For reference, ν = 10 10 cm 2 s −1 corresponds to Re ≈ 600 referred to the sound speed and scale height. We find, however, that the wind speed is not monotonic or even single-valued in the viscosity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. (4)</ref>).</p><p>We would like to understand what accounts for the difference between our results and those of DCL. Compared to our body force and constant diffusivity, the thermal forcing and radiative transfer implemented by DCL is much more sophisticated and realistic, but it is hard to see what this has to do with the viscous effects, especially since the behavior seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. (4)</ref> exists for all choices of forcing and diffusivity that we have tried. Furthermore, our direct forcing is usually stronger than DCL's thermal forcing since, for example, a horizontal acceleration of f = 0.025 g would result in a Mach number 2πR p f /c s 7 after going half way around the planet without dissipation. And yet our Mach numbers are at most comparable to those of DCL, the latter peaking at ∼ 3 for low viscosity.</p><p>More likely the difference in results has to do either with the difference in the dimensionality and geometry of the calculations (3D and global for DCL; 2D and local for us), or with spatial resolution. It is well known that subsonic turbulence behaves differently in two and three dimensions; however, since two dimensions usually favor energy on large scales, our wind speeds might have been expected to exceed DCL's if dimensionality were the most important factor. Concerning numerical resolution, it appears that DCL's standard value is 4 cells per scale height, compared to our 10. Since we and DCL use similar numerical methods, their calculations are probably more diffusive than ours. When we use a resolution comparable to theirs, our wind speeds actually increase for the same forcing ( §4.4). The fact that we and they find comparable Mach numbers at our highest respective Reynolds numbers suggests that our stronger forcing is partly offset by our finer resolution.</p><p>A limitation of our local, two-dimensional models is the somewhat arbitrary assumption that the nonpotential horizontal force is compensated over a depth range ∆z ≈ 2H p . Other things being equal, one would expect the flow speed to scale as (∆z) 1/2 at constant forcing amplitude if Richardson number rather than Mach number is the controlling parameter. Inspection of DCL's figures suggests that the horizontal speed scales approximately linearly in ln p over the range 10 −4 -10 0 bar. The sign change is not always obvious in their velocity plots, although they infer the existence of return flow from their temperature profiles. However, since the momentum density ρ¯ v x ∝ v x (z) exp(−z/H p ), this is much better localized around its sign change than is v x itself.</p><p>We can use our turbulent viscosities to estimate a turbulent diffusivity for composition, K t , as may be required to keep the upper atmosphere turbulently mixed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>). The Schmidt number, defined by Sc t = ν t /K t , in general has a complicated dependence on flow properties (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huq &amp; Stewart 2008)</ref>. For Ri O(10 −1 ), however, Sc t is independent of Ri and of order unity. The data in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> then gives us mass diffusivities pertaining to the shear layers in Hot Jupiter atmospheres: K t 10 −3 c s H p ∼ 10 10 cm 2 s −1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spiegel et al. (2009)</ref> estimated that K t ∼ 10 7 − 10 11 cm 2 s −1 is required, depending on grain size, to maintain TiO as an optical absorber at p 1 mbar. Our values are toward the upper end of this range, but only in the shear layer (∼ 2H p ). To estimate K t elsewhere, we would need to estimate how much of the mechanical power dissipated in the shear layer can propagate upwards and downwards in the form of internal waves or shocks. This we have not attempted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We have investigated the balance between horizontal forcing and mechanical dissipation in model shear flows designed to imitate thermally driven winds of jovian exoplanets. Our main conclusions are as follows.</p><p>1. Following Paper I, some form of mechanical dissipation is required to offset the production of mechanical energy by the longitudinal entropy gradient. Plausible dissipation mechanisms include shocks, turbulence, and MHD drag.</p><p>2. Entropy stratification has a stabilizing influence on Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) modes, but thermal diffusivity (χ) tends to undercut this influence to a degree that can be quantified by the Peclet number P e ≡ c s H p /χ based on the sound speed (c s ) and pressure scale height (H p ). We estimate P e ∼ O(10 3 ) at the altitude where the thermal timescale is comparable to the circumferential flow time at Mach 1, but P e O(1) near the infrared photosphere.</p><p>3. Linear analysis indicates that for P e 10, thermal diffusion has little effect on the stability of KH modes whose horizontal wavelength is comparable to the vertical thickness of the shear layer; the usual adiabatic Richardson criterion Ri ≡ N 2 /(∂U/∂z) 2 &gt; 1/4 is sufficient for the stability of these short-wavelength modes. For typical conditions on the day sides of hot Jupiters, Ri &lt; 1/4 implies transsonic or supersonic winds, presuming that the shear layer is no narrower than a pressure scale height.</p><p>4. Nevertheless, at any finite P e and Ri, inviscid flows with an inflection point in the shear profile are unstable at sufficiently long horizontal wavelengths, at least when the flow is confined within a channel of finite vertical extent. We doubt that these long-wavelength KH modes are important for hot-Jupiter winds because their growth rates are very small (inversely proportional to wavelength) and because the planetary circumference is not large enough compared to H p to accommodate them at P e 10 3 .</p><p>5. We estimate a turbulent diffusivity for composition in hot Jupiter atmospheres. For P e ≈ 100, we find K t /c s H p ≈ 10 −3 , depending on the strength of the horizontal forcing. However, these values pertain to regions of maximum vertical shear; turbulent diffusivities may be much smaller elsewhere.</p><p>6. Nonlinear, two-dimensional (azimuth and depth), horizontally forced local simulations saturate at time-averaged Mach numbers ∼ 2 when the Reynolds number Re ≡ c s H p /ν 10 3 . Given the widths of our shear layers (∼ 2H p ) and background stratification, this corresponds to minimum Richardson numbers slightly below the adiabatic critical value of 1/4. In this regime, which is relevant to hot Jupiters, we find that the saturated wind speed depends only weakly on P e and on the strength of the forcing.</p><p>7. Dissipation in the high-Re regime is due mainly to the work expended to overturn the stratification rather than shocks, though weak shocks are present. It is highly intermittent, at least in our two-dimensional calculations, and appears to be triggered by a recurrent linear instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz type.</p><p>8. At Re 10 3 or at low numerical resolution (significantly fewer than 10 cells per pressure scale height), multiple sequences of solutions appear in overlapping ranges of Reynolds number, differing in their wind speed and predominant dissipation mechanisms. The fastest have Mach numbers at least twice as large as what we believe to be the correct inviscid values for our forcing strengths.</p><p>The last three points suggest that some global simulations of hot Jupiters may have overestimated wind speeds due to incomplete physics (e.g. neglect of vertical accelerations and sound waves) and/or insufficient spatial resolution. Pending sufficient computational resources to resolve the physical dissipation mechanisms directly in global simulations, we suggest that artificial dissipative terms be added to the equations of motion so as to prevent strongly supersonic shears and small Richardson numbers. The appropriate form for these terms will depend upon the equation sets and algorithms used, but presumably it is desirable that they conserve energy and momentum, and probably that they have a sharp threshold in Mach number or Richardson number.</p></div>
