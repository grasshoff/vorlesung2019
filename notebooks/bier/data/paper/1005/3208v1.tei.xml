			<abstract>
				<p>Context. Accurate parameters of the host stars of exoplanets are important for the interpretation of the new planet systems that continue to emerge. The CoRoT satellite recently discovered a transiting rocky planet with a density similar to the inner planets in our solar system, a so-called super Earth. The mass was determined using ground-based follow-up spectroscopy, which also revealed a second, non-transiting super Earth. Aims. These planets are orbiting a relatively faint (m V = 11.7) G9V star called CoRoT-7. We wish to refine the determination of the physical properties of the host star, which are important for the interpretation of the properties of the planet system. Methods. We have used high-quality spectra from HARPS@ESO 3.6m and UVES@VLT 8.2m. We use various methods to analyse the spectra using 1D LTE atmospheric models. From the analysis of Fe i and Fe ii lines we determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence. We use the Balmer lines to constrain the effective temperature and pressure sensitive Mg 1b and Ca lines to constrain the surface gravity. We analyse both single spectra and co-added spectra to identify systematic errors. We determine the projected rotational velocity and macroturbulence by fitting the line shapes of isolated lines. We finally employ the Wilson-Bappu effect to determine the approximate absolute magnitude. Results. From the analysis of the three best spectra using several methods we find T eff = 5250 ± 60 K, log g = 4.47 ± 0.05, [M/H] = +0.12 ± 0.06, and v sin i = 1.1 +1.0 −0.5 km s −1. The chemical composition of 20 analysed elements are consistent with a uniform scaling by the metallicity +0.12 dex. We compared the L/M ratio with isochrones to constrain the evolutionary status. Using the age estimate of 1.2-2.3 Gyr based on stellar activity, we determine the mass and radius 0.91 ± 0.03 M ⊙ and 0.82 ± 0.04 R ⊙. With these updated constraints we fitted the CoRoT transit light curve for CoRoT-7b. We revise the planet radius to be slightly smaller, R = 1.58±0.10 R ⊕ , and using the planet mass the density becomes slightly higher, ρ = 7.2 ± 1.8 g cm −3. Conclusions. The host star CoRoT-7 is a slowly rotating, metal rich, unevolved type G9V star. The star is relatively faint and its fundamental parameters can only be determined through indirect methods. Our methods rely on detailed spectral analyses that in turn depend on the adopted model atmospheres. From the analysis of spectra of stars with well-known parameters with similar parameters to CoRoT-7 (the Sun and α Cen B) we demonstrate that our methods are robust within the claimed uncertainties. Therefore our methods can be reliably used in subsequent analyses of similar exoplanet host stars.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The discovery of the first super Earth planet outside of the Solar system with a measured absolute mass and radius was recently announced, based on photometric data from CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baglin et al. 2006</ref>). This planet, CoRoT-7b, has a radius of 1.68 ± 0.09super Earth has been found from radial-velocity monitoring ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Queloz et al. 2009</ref>). These results have only been possible to achieve thanks to an extensive ground-based follow-up program of the relatively faint star CoRoT-7 (TYCHO ID 4799-1733-1; m V = 11.7) over more than one year.</p><p>In the derivation of the planetary parameters, one of the most important factors is the correct identification of the host star's fundamental parameters and evolutionary stage. It is particularly important to estimate the stellar radius which is imperative for determining the absolute planetary radius. A first analysis by several of the CoRoT teams has been carried out in Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>, based on a spectrum from the "Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph" <ref type="bibr">(UVES@VLT 8.2m</ref>) and a preliminary analysis of 53 coadded spectra from the "High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher" (HARPS@ESO 3.6m). <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. A section of the CoRoT 7/H1-7 spectrum illustrating how the spectrum is normalised with rainbow. The top panels show a wide range and the lower panels show a zoom near the edge of the same echelle order. The neighbouring order is shown with a short-dashed line. The thick long-dashed line is a spline fit to the continuum windows marked by circles. The normalised spectrum agrees reasonably well with the template synthetic spectrum (smooth green line). The agreement between the two overlapping orders is good and will finally be merged to improve the S/N.</p><p>Since then, a total of 107 spectra from HARPS have become available ). These spectra have higher spectral resolution and better signal-to-noise (S/N) than the UVES spectrum analysed by Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. We can therefore now refine the analysis of CoRoT-7 and possibly impose stronger constraints on the properties of the system. The methods we employ have been developed during the analysis of other CoRoT targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deleuil et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moutou et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rauer et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fridlund et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruntt 2009</ref>). In the current paper we have expanded these tools and we will describe our approach in greater detail than previously done. These tools will be the standard methods to be applied for the characterization of future CoRoT targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Spectroscopic observations</head><p>We initially acquired one UVES spectrum which confirmed that the star is a dwarf star, meaning the absolute radius of the planet must be small <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Léger, Rouan, Schneider et al. 2009</ref>). To constrain the mass of CoRoT-7b a series of 107 spectra were collected with the HARPS spectrograph between <ref type="bibr">March 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">and February 2009</ref>).</p><p>The HARPS spectrograph has a spectral resolution of 115 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mayor et al. 2003)</ref>, covering the optical range from 3827 Å to 6911 Å. With exposure times of 1800 or 2700 s, the signal-to-noise ratio of the individual spectra varies from ≃ 30-90, depending on the conditions at the time of observation.</p><p>We used the data from the standard HARPS pipeline, and each order was divided by the blaze function to get an approximately rectified spectrum. We shifted each spectrum by the radial velocity to set it to the heliocentric rest frame, using the values from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Queloz et al. (2009)</ref>. Each spectrum was rebinned to the same wavelength grid with a constant step of 0.01 Å.</p><p>We suspected that some of the exposures could be affected by reflected Moonlight. While such data can be used for measurement of the radial velocity variation, scattered light can potentially affect the relative line depths and hence systematically affect the analysis. In order to identify such potential systematic errors we made different combinations of the spectra as presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We selected seven spectra acquired during dark time, and with the highest S/N, computed in nearly linefree regions around 5830 Å. The co-addition, order per order, of these 7 spectra gives the H1-7 combined spectrum. We also analysed three individual HARPS spectra with the highest S/N (H1, H2 and H3). We finally co-added all HARPS spectra using weights w ∝ S/N to get the H1-107 spectrum. A preliminary analysis of the UVES spectrum of CoRoT-7 was described in Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. This spectrum has a lower resolution (R = 65000) than HARPS. We include our updated analysis here for completion.</p><p>To calibrate our methods, we analysed three HARPS spectra of the Sun, available from the ESO/HARPS intrumentation website <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . The spectra were acquired by observing Ceres, Ganymede and the Moon, and have S/N around 250, 350 and 450, respectively. We note that the "Moon" solar spectrum was observed in the high-efficiency EGGS mode which has resolution R = 80000. In addition, we analysed a co-added HARPS spectrum of α Cen B, which has similar parameters to CoRoT-7. α Cen B has been studied using direct, model-independent methods (interferometry, binary orbit) and therefore its absolute parameters (mass, radius, luminosity and T eff ) are known with high accuracy (Porto de <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mello et al. 2008</ref>). We will use this to evaluate our indirect methods that rely on the validity of the spectral analysis using 1D LTE atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Versatile Wavelength Analysis (VWA)</head><p>We used the VWA package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bruntt et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruntt et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruntt 2009</ref>) to analyse the spectra listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. It can perform several tasks from normalisation of the spectrum, selection of isolated lines for abundance analysis, iterative fitting of atmospheric parameters, and determination of the projected rotational velocity (v sin i). The basic tools of VWA have been described in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bruntt et al. 2002)</ref> and here we shall give a more complete description of some additional tools in relation to the results we determine for CoRoT-7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Normalisation of the spectra</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> we illustrate the principles of the rainbow program that we used to normalise the spectra. The top panels show a wide wavelength range in a single order and the bottom panels show a zoom near the edge of the same echelle order. The user . The abundances are from the analysis of the H1-7 spectrum for four different sets of atmospheric models. The top panel is for the preferred model, the second panel is for a lower T eff , the third panel for lower log g, and the bottom panel is for higher v micro . Also indicated is the solar Fe abundances (thin horizontal line) and a linear fit with 95% confidence limits indicated by the solid and dashed lines. must manually identify continuum points by comparing the observed spectrum with a template, which is usually a synthetic spectrum calculated with the same approximate parameters as the star. The top panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the spectrum before normalization where eight continuum points have been identified and marked by circles. A spline function -optionally a loworder polynomial -is fitted through these points and shown as the long-dashed line. The spectrum from the adjacent echelle order is shown with the short-dashed line. The lower panel shows the normalised spectrum along with the template spectrum. The agreement with the adjacent order is very good and there is acceptable agreement with the template. The overlapping orders are finally merged to improve the S/N by up to 40%.</p><p>When the continuum points have been marked for all orders the normalised spectrum is saved. When the first spectrum has been normalised the continuum points are re-used for the other spectra. We then carefully check the normalisation in each case since several readjustments are needed, especially in the blue end of the spectrum.</p><p>The high S/N in the spectrum shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> would indicate that the continuum is determined to better than 0.5%. This is only true if the adopted synthetic template spectrum is identical to that of the star, i.e. the atomic line list is complete and the temperature and pressure structure of the atmosphere model represents the real star. From comparison of the template and normalised spectra in several regions (an example is given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), we estimate that the continuum is correct to about 0.5%, while discrepancies of 1-2% may occur in regions where the degree of blending is high and in the region of the wide Balmer lines and the Mg i b lines. 5350 ± 31 4.57 ± 0.06 +0.15 ± 0.09 0.76 ± 0.07 4.14 ± 0.44 4.50 ± 0.09 4.77 ± 0.07 4.72 ± 0.26 1.1 1.2 H1-7 5280 ± 35 4.48 ± 0.06 +0.13 ± 0.09 0.80 ± 0.05 3.94 ± 0.52 4.47 ± 0.06 4.60 ± 0.08 4.32 ± 0.27 0.9 1.4 H1-107 5300 ± 25 4.54 ± 0.05 +0.13 ± 0.08 0.77 ± 0.05 3.91 ± 0.55 4.51 ± 0.06 4.58 ± 0.05 4.45 ± 0.18 H1-107 SME 5290 ± 44 4.49 ± 0.06 +0.13 ± 0.06 0.80 ± 0.05 4.43 4.49 4.49 U1 5300 ± 17 4.50 ± 0.03 +0.11 ± 0.06 0.70 ± 0.08 3.94 ± 0.49 4.42 ± 0.05 4.46 ± 0.06 4.41 ± 0.19 Ceres 5767 ± 17 4.44 ± 0.03 −0.01 ± 0.03 1.01 ± 0.03 4.50 ± 0.08 4.46 ± 0.20 4.43 ± 0.10 4.43 ± 0.42 1.4 2.1 Ganymede 5757 ± 17 4.43 ± 0.04 −0.00 ± 0.04 0.93 ± 0.03 4.51 ± 0.10 4.33 ± 0.17 4.38 ± 0.08 4.47 ± 0.37 1.1 2.3 Moon 5775 ± 25 4.48 ± 0.03 +0.02 ± 0.04 0.91 ± 0.04 4.41 ± 0.08 4.53 ± 0.20 4.41 ± 0.14 4.50 ± 0.33 2.1 2.2 α Cen B 5185 ± 25 4.50 ± 0.03 +0.31 ± 0.05 0.83 ± 0.04 4.01 ± 0.50 4.53 ± 0.07 4.51 ± 0.05 4.65 ± 0.16 1.0 0.8</p><p>Notes: Results are from VWA except H1 and H1-107 which are also given for the SME analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Determination of T eff and log g from Fe i-ii lines</head><p>This part of the VWA program has been described in some detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bruntt et al. (2002)</ref> and we will specify some updated details here. VWA uses 1D LTE atmosphere models interpolated in grids from MARCS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gustafsson et al. 2008</ref>) or modified ATLAS9 models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heiter et al. 2002)</ref>. We have adopted MARCS models for this study. The atomic line data are extracted from VALD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kupka et al. 1999</ref>), which is a collection from many different sources. The synthetic profiles are computed with synth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996)</ref>. The VWA abundances are measured differentially with respect to a solar spectrum. We have used the FTS spectrum by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kurucz et al. (1984)</ref> which was published in electronic form by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hinkle et al. (2000)</ref>. We found that making a differential abundance analysis significantly improves the precision on the determined T eff and log g (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruntt et al. 2008)</ref>. We assess the question of accuracy in Sects. 3.4 and 6.1. VWA consists of three main programs written in IDL. Each program has a graphical user interface, called vwaview, vwaexam and vwares. In vwaview the user can inspect the observed spectrum and select a set of isolated lines. They are fitted iteratively by computing synthetic profiles and adjusting the abundance until the observed and synthetic profiles have identical equivalent widths within a fixed wavelength range. The program vwaexam is used to inspect how well the synthetic profiles fit the observed lines. The user can manually reject lines or base the rejection on objective criteria like reduced χ 2 values and the relative line depths. It takes about one hour to fit 500 lines on a modern laptop. This is done using the program vwatask for fixed values of T eff , log g and v micro . The process is then repeated with various values of these parameters to measure the sensitivity of each line. The user can then investigate this sensitivity in the program vwares.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> we show an example from vwares using the H1-7 spectrum of CoRoT-7. The abundances from Fe i and Fe ii lines are plotted versus equivalent width (EW; left panels) and excitation potential (EP; right panels) for four different sets of atmospheric parameters. Open and solid red symbols are used for neutral and ionised Fe lines, respectively. The top panels are for the preferred parameters where we have minimised the correlation of Fe i with both EW and EP and the mean abundances of Fe i and Fe ii agree. The second panel is for T eff decreased by 300 K, resulting in a clear correlation with EP, and Fe i and Fe ii are no longer in agreement. For the third panel, log g was de- creased by 0.3 dex, leading to a low mean abundance of Fe ii. The bottom panel is for microturbulence increased by 0.4 km s −1 which leads to correlations of Fe i with both EW and EP. From such analyses we can determine the "internal" uncertainty on the atmospheric parameters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruntt et al. 2008</ref> for a discussion).</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> we show an example of the abundances of six elements determined for the H1-107 spectrum. The mean abundance and rms error is given in the right panels. While Fe has the most lines, Ti, Cr and Ni also show no strong correlation with equivalent with or excitation potential.</p><p>The atmospheric parameters for the six spectra of CoRoT-7 are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The applied method is indicated in angled brackets in the first row. There is good agreement between the results, although the H1 spectrum gives a systematically lower T eff and log g. This is due to the correlation between the two parameters as was also noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruntt (2009)</ref>. They proposed that this degeneracy could be a problem for spectra with relatively low S/N (H1 has S/N = 57). For our final value of T eff and log g of CoRoT-7 we adopt the weighted mean value of the analysis of the three composite spectra: H1-7, H1-107 and U1: T eff = 5297 ± 13 K, log g = 4.51 ± 0.02, v micro = 0.77 ± 0.03 km s −1 . The uncertainties stated here are internal errors. We will assess the question of "realistic uncertainties" in Sect. 6.</p></div>

(1997)</ref> to adjust the van der Waals constants (pressure broadening due to Hydrogen collisions) by requiring that our reference spectrum of the Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hinkle et al. 2000</ref>) produces the solar value log g = 4.437. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> we list the adjusted van der Waals parameters along with the values extracted from VALD (from <ref type="bibr">Barklem et al. 2000)</ref>. Following the convention of VALD it is expressed as the logarithm (base 10) of the full-width half-maximum per perturber number density at 10 000 K. The abundances of the fitted lines are determined from weak lines with EW &lt; 120 mÅ. The broadening due to v sin i and v macro is determined as described in Sect. 3.6. Examples of fitting the λ6122 Å and λ6162 Å lines are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> for the Sun (top panel) and CoRoT-7 (bottom panel). The hatched regions are used to renormalise the spectrum by a linear fit. The rectangles mark regions where reduced χ 2 values are computed and they are used to determine the best value of log g and the 1-σ uncertainty.</p><p>We found that the Mg i b line in CoRoT-7 is not very sensitive and gave lower values (log g ≈ 4.0 ± 0.5) than the Ca lines (log g ≈ 4.5 ± 0.1). The reason may be the high degree of blending with weaker lines for such a late type star. Since the higher value of log g is in good agreement with the result using Fe i-ii we neglect the results for the Mg i b lines. There is good agreement for the log g from the individual spectra. For the value of log g we adopt the weighted mean of the three composite spectra: log g = 4.50 ± 0.02. The stated error does not include systematic errors, see Sect. 3.4 and 6.1.</p></div>

The sensitivity of synthetic Ca lines fitted to the observed spectra of the Sun (top panel; Ganymede spectrum) and CoRoT-7 (bottom panel; H1-7 spectrum). The synthetic profiles computed for the Sun have log g = 4.04, 4.44 and 4.84. For the CoRoT-7 spectrum synthetic profiles have log g = 4.08 and 4.48. In each case a higher log g means the synthetic line becomes wider. The rectangles mark the areas used to compute the reduced χ 2 and the hatched regions are used to normalise the spectrum.</p><p>damental stars for which T eff and log g are known with very high accuracy: the Sun and α Cen B. We analysed three single HARPS spectra of the Sun and one co-added spectrum of α Cen B. The results are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The parameters from the three solar spectra agree very well with the solar values. The canonical value for T eff is 5777 K (Cox 2000) and log g calculated from the Solar mass and radius is 4.437. The largest deviation is 20 K for T eff based on the analysis of Fe i-ii lines. The surface gravity is constrained by several methods (Fe i-ii, Mg i, Ca lines) but the largest deviation from the canonical value is only 0.1 dex. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> it is seen that some lines are less useful for constraining log g: Ca λ6439 Å is the least sensitive line. For the weighted average, using the Mg and three Ca lines, we find excellent agreement for the three Solar HARPS spectra: log g = 4.47 ± 0.06, 4.42 ± 0.06, and 4.43 ± 0.06.</p><p>For α Cen B we find T eff = 5185 ± 25 K, log g = 4.50 ± 0.03, and [Fe/H] = +0.31 ± 0.05 (the quoted uncertainties do not include systematic errors). For this nearby binary star, T eff and log g can be determined by direct methods, i.e. methods are only weakly dependent on models. The angular diameter has been measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kervella et al. (2003)</ref>. Using the updated par-  allax from van Leeuwen (2007) we determine the radius R = 0.864 ± 0.005 R ⊙ . The mass has been determined from the binary orbit by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pourbaix et al. (2002)</ref>: M = 0.934 ± 0.006 M ⊙ . Coincidentally, this mass is nearly identical to that of CoRoT-7 (Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. 2009</ref>). Combing the mass and radius (g ∝ M/R 2 ) gives a very accurate value of the surface gravity for α Cen B: log g = 4.538 ± 0.008. This is in very good agreement with our spectroscopic determination. We note that as for CoRoT-7, Mg i b is not useful for constraining log g. The T eff can be determined from the angular diameter and the bolometric flux: T eff = 5140 ± 56 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruntt et al. 2010</ref>). This is in excellent agreement with the result from VWA. Porto de <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mello et al. (2008)</ref> listed the results of 14 different analyses of α Cen B, based on different methods and quality of the data. Our value of T eff is in good agreement with previous determinations but our metallicity is slightly higher than most previous estimates.</p><p>To conclude, our analysis of the spectra of the Sun and α Cen B show that we can reliably determine T eff and log g. Since these two stars bracket CoRoT-7 in terms of spectral type, we have confidence that the spectroscopic results are robust and do not suffer from significant systematic errors. We will discuss the uncertainties on the spectroscopic parameters in Sect. 6.1.</p></div>

We adopted this spectrum since it has the highest S/N but we note that the other spectra give very similar results. The mean metallicity is computed from the mean of the metal abundances for species with at least 30 lines in the spectrum: Ti, Fe, and Ni. The mean value is [M/H] = +0.12± 0.04 where the uncertainty includes the uncertainty on T eff , log g and v micro . The horizontal bar in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref> marks the mean value and the 1-σ uncertainty range.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Determination of v sin i and v macro</head><p>From the detailed profile shapes of isolated lines one can ultimately extract information about the granulation velocity fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dravins 2008)</ref>. However, this is not possible with our data where each single spectrum only has S/N ≈ 60. The intrinsic shape of a spectral line is determined by several factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gray 2008</ref>) but the broadening due to stellar rotation and velocity fields in the atmosphere can to a good approximation be described by two parameters: v sin i and macroturbulence (v macro ). These two parameters describe the projected velocity field due to rotation of a limb-darkened sphere and the movement of granules due to convection, respectively.</p><p>To measure v sin i and v macro we selected 64 isolated lines of different metal species: Ni, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe. The lines lie in the range 5800-6450 Å with equivalent widths from 25-125 mÅ. For each line we determine the small wavelength shifts needed so the observed line core fits the synthetic spectrum. This was done by fitting a Gaussian to the line cores of the observed and synthetic spectra. We then fitted the abundance of the line for the adopted T eff , log g and v micro . We made a grid of values for v sin i and v macro from 0-6 km s −1 with steps of 0.15 km s −1 . For each grid point we convolved the synthetic spectrum and computed the reduced χ 2 of the fit to the observed From the transit light curve, Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> constrained the inclination angle to be i = 80.1±0.3 • (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 19)</ref>. Thus, the equatorial rotational velocity is v rot ≈ v sin i = 1.1 +1.0 −0.5 km s −1 . This result is only valid if we assume that the inclination of the rotation axis of the star is the same as the inclination of the orbit. Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> proposed that the rotation period is 23 days 2 , based on the variation of the CoRoT light curve. Using the radius determined in Sect. 6 we get v rot = 1.7±0.2 km s −1 , in agreement with value determined from the spectroscopy.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> we list the mean values of v sin i and v macro that we have determined for several of the spectra. We did not use the U1 spectrum since it has a lower resolution than the HARPS spectra. We also did not consider the H1-107 spectrum since it is a combination of so many spectra, which inevitably leads to less well-defined line shapes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME)</head><p>In an independent analysis of the H1 and H1-107 spectra, we used the SME package (version 2.1; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Valenti &amp; Fischer 2005)</ref>. This code uses a grid of stellar models (Kurucz models or MARCS models) to iteratively determine the fundamental stellar parameters. This is done by fitting the observed spectrum to a synthesised spectrum and minimizing the discrepancies through a non-linear least-squares algorithm. SME is based on the philosophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996</ref>) that by matching synthetic spectra to observed line profiles one can extract the information in the observed spectrum and search among stellar and atomic parameters until the best fit is achieved. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We adopt an uncertainty on the rotation period of 2 days.</p><p>We use a large number of spectral lines, e.g. the Balmer lines (the extended wings are used to constrain T eff ), Na i D, Mg i b and Ca i (for T eff and log g) and metal lines (to constrain the abundances). Furthermore, the iterative fitting provides information on micro-and macroturbulence and v sin i.</p><p>By fitting the extended wings of the Hα and Hβ Balmer lines, we determine the T eff to be 5200 K and 5100 K respectively. Using instead the Na i doublet at λ5890Å, we find a T eff of 5280 K. The lower value derived from the Hβ line wings is explained by the many metal lines contributing to the profile. We tried to use the Mg i b triplet to evaluate log g but as for the VWA analysis we found that it is difficult to assign the continuum level, so instead we used the wide Ca i lines. From the SME analysis we find the log g to be 4.43 from Mg i and 4.49 from Ca i. Our evaluation of the metallicity gives [M/H] = +0.13 and v micro = 0.80 km s −1 .</p><p>The uncertainties using SME, as found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref>, and based on a large sample (more than 1000 stars) are 44 K in T eff , 0.06 dex in log g and 0.03 dex in [M/H], which we adopt for our SME analysis of CoRoT-7. In a few cases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> found offsets of up to 0.3 dex for log g. When we compare the results for CoRoT-7 for different lines and methods used to constrain log g, we find a scatter of 0.06 dex. This is consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> and we assign this as the 1-σ uncertainty.</p><p>In summary, the parameters determined with SME for the H1 and H1-107 spectra of CoRoT-7 give fully consistent results with the more extensive analysis with VWA. Our results from the SME analysis are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Absolute magnitude from the Wilson-Bappu effect</head><p>The width of the emission peaks seen in the core of the Ca ii H &amp; K lines (3934.8 and 3969.7 Å) in late-type stars are directly correlated to the value of log g, and thus to the mass and radius of the star. This implies that the width can be calibrated in terms of the absolute luminosity (Gray 2008). The calibration of the absolute magnitude is of the form: M V = a log W 0 + b, where W 0 is the width at the zero-level of the emission component, and where also the constants a and b need to be properly calibrated. This is usually done using data from clusters, and we have used the recent calibration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pace et al. (2003)</ref> who found a = −18.0 and b = 33.2, with a quoted uncertainty of 0.6 mag on M V . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>, we show the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of CoRoT-7. The emission components with self-reversal in the line cores are clearly seen. By measuring the width of both the H-and the K-line, following the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pace et al. (2003)</ref>, we find an absolute magnitude of M V = 5.4 ± 0.6. Given the spectroscopic effective temperature, the location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that CoRoT-7 is a main sequence star with spectral type in the range is G8V -K0V. That the star is not evolved is in good agreement with the log g determination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Evolutionary status</head><p>We will now evaluate the atmospheric parameters determined above for CoRoT-7 and compare with evolutionary models to constrain the mass, radius and luminosity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Final atmospheric parameters of CoRoT-7</head><p>There is generally good agreement for the determination of T eff using VWA and SME. With the VWA method we only used Fe iii lines while with SME we also used the Balmer lines to constrain T eff . As mentioned, the quoted uncertainties in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> only include the intrinsic error of the method, i.e. by varying the model parameters. However, the temperature and pressure profile of the atmospheric model may not fully represent the actual star. From the analysis of the Sun and α Cen B, we found good agreement for their T eff and log g determined from modelindependent methods (see Sect. 3.4). Thus, there appears to be no large systematic errors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruntt et al. (2010)</ref> analysed a larger sample of stars, comparing the spectroscopic T eff s with those from fundamental methods (as done for α Cen B here) and found a systematic offset in T eff of −40 ± 20 K. We have included this offset to get the final value T eff = 5250 ± 60 K. We used several pressure sensitive spectral features to constrain log g and the mean value we adopt is log g = 4.47 ±0.05. For T eff and log g we have added systematic errors on 50 K and 0.05 dex, based on the discussion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruntt et al. (2010)</ref>. The mean metallicity is found to be [M/H] = +0.12 ± 0.06 where we have increased the uncertainty due to the inclusion of systematic errors on T eff and log g. These are our final estimates for the parameters of CoRoT-7 and they are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>Our new results for the fundamental parameters are in good agreement with Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. They found T eff = 5275 ± 75 K as a mean value of different groups using different spectroscopic analyses of the UVES spectrum. They also used a calibration using 2MASS infrared photometry, taking into account interstellar reddening, yielding 5300 ± 70 K. They find log g = 4.50 ± 0.10 using the Fe i-ii equilibrium criterion and the Mg i b and Na i D lines, which is also in good agreement with our value. Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> found a slightly lower metallicity, [M/H] = +0.03 ± 0.06 (our revised value for the same spectrum is [M/H] = +0.11 ± 0.06). In that analysis several strong lines were included, while in this study we only used Fe i lines with EW &lt; 90 mÅ. For other elements (and Fe ii) we included lines with EW &lt; 140 mÅ. This choice was made because the strong lines start to be saturated and are therefore less sensitive to changes in the atmospheric parameters.   Dashed lines are used for ages higher than the adopted limits on the age, i.e. 4.6 Gyr for the Sun, 2.3 Gyr for CoRoT-7 and 6.5 Gyr for α Cen B, while the maximum possible age is 14 Gyr.</p><p>the blue region (4515-6865 Å). We note that the current version of VWA does not take into account molecular lines, which start to become a problem for such a cool star, especially at short wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Stellar mass, luminosity and radius</head><p>In some cases the modelling of the transit light curve can be used to obtain the mean density of the star. However, as pointed out by Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>, the shallow eclipse combined with stellar activity modulating the light curve seriously hampers such analyses. From the spectroscopic value of log g we have an estimate of g = GM/R 2 . Multiplying this with the relation L ∝ R 2 T 4 eff we can eliminate the radius, i.e. L/M ∝ T 4 eff /g. Thus, we determine the luminosity-mass ratio: (L/L ⊙ )/(M/M ⊙ ) = 0.62 ± 0.08. The uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on the surface gravity.</p><p>In Figs. 8 and 9 we compare this estimate with isochrones from BASTI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pietrinferni et al. 2004</ref>) and evolution tracks from ASTEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008)</ref>. These models do not include overshoot but this has no impact on low-mass stars such as CoRoT-7. The mixing-length parameter for the ASTEC grid was α ML = 1.8. The models express metallicity in terms of the heavy element mass fraction, Z. To convert each Z to spectroscopic values, we adopted the solar value Z ⊙ = 0.0156 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Caffau et al. 2009</ref>) with an assumed uncertainty of 0.002. This corresponds to an increase in the uncertainty of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> by 0.05 dex.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> we show two sets of isochrones with metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.10 and +0.28 for ages of 2 and 7 Gyr, with several mass points indicated in the range 0.8 to 1.1 M ⊙ . The lower metallicity is close to that of CoRoT-7 and the higher metallicity represents α Cen B. The uncertainty on L/M for CoRoT-7 is relatively large, so we cannot constrain the mass without further constraints. Fortunately, Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> estimated the age of CoRoT-7 from the rotation period and the activity index of the Ca H &amp; K lines: 1.2-2.3 Gyr. Adopting this age limit, we can estimate the mass and radius from the isochrones: M/M ⊙ = 0.89 ± 0.03 and R/R ⊙ = 0.80 ± 0.04.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref> we show four selected ASTEC evolution tracks which represent the Sun, CoRoT-7 (two tracks), and α Cen B. The dashed part of each track is for ages above these adopted limits: 4.6 Gyr for the Sun (1.00 M ⊙ track), 2.3 Gyr for CoRoT-7 (0.92 and 0.86 M ⊙ ), and 6.5 Gyr for α Cen B (0.94 M ⊙ ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miglio &amp; Montalbán 2005</ref> for discussion of the age of α Cen A+B). Furthermore, the tracks all end at 14 Gyr. It is seen that the Sun is quite well represented, although the L/M ratio is quite high at 4.6 Gyr, but this is explained by the available track having slightly too low metallicity. The 0.94 M ⊙ track for α Cen B agrees with the L/M ratio within the 1-σ limit. For CoRoT-7 the 0.86 M ⊙ track does not reach the determined T eff and L/M ratio in 2.3 Gyr. However, for the 0.92 M ⊙ track there is agreement with the T eff and L/M ratio. From similar tracks we determine these limits on the mass and radius of CoRoT-7: M/M ⊙ = 0.92 ± 0.03 and R/R ⊙ = 0.83 ± 0.04. This is in good agreement with the result from the BASTI tracks. As our final result, we adopt the mean radius and mass determined from the two sets of models: M/M ⊙ = 0.91±0.03 and R/R ⊙ = 0.82±0.04.</p><p>Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> determined slightly different values for the mass and radius. They used the STAREVOL evolution tracks (Palacios, private comm.) with slightly different stellar atmospheric values. Their values are M/M ⊙ = 0.93 ± 0.03 and R/R ⊙ = 0.87 ± 0.04 (i.e. log g = 4.53±0.04), which agree quite well with our revised results given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>From comparison with the BASTI and ASTEC models the determined L/M ratio of CoRoT-7 seems to be too large, although the uncertainty is large. In order to determine the luminosity we therefore adjust the ratio by −1 σ, (L/L ⊙ )/(M/M ⊙ ) = 0.54 ± 0.08, and multiply by the inferred mass to get L/L ⊙ = 0.49±0.07. The determined mass and radius from the isochrones correspond to a surface gravity log g = 4.57 ± 0.04, which is slightly higher (1.6 σ) than the spectroscopic value of 4.47 ± 0.05.</p><p>To validate that the BASTI and ASTEC models can be used for CoRoT-7 we also plot the Sun and α Cen B in Figs. 8 and 9. For α Cen B the uncertainty is much smaller than for CoRoT-7: (L/L ⊙ )/(M/M ⊙ ) = 0.50 ± 0.02. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miglio &amp; Montalbán (2005)</ref> determined an age of about 6.5 Gyr for the α Cen A+B system and with our metallicity of +0.3 dex, there is good agreement with both sets of models. From comparison with the BASTI and ASTEC models we get the mass 0.90 ± 0.03 M ⊙ , which agrees well with the dynamical mass of 0.934 ± 0.006 M ⊙ . The radius is 0.84 ± 0.04 R ⊙ , where the interferometric result is R = 0.864 ± 0.005 R ⊙ . Combining the mass and radius from the comparison with the isochrones we get log g = 4.54 ± 0.04, which is in good agreement with the spectroscopic value of 4.50 ± 0.03.</p><p>The new stellar mass and the updated inclination were used, together with the published values of the ephemeris <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Léger, Rouan, Schneider et al. 2009</ref>) and radial velocity semiamplitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Queloz et al. 2009</ref>) to estimate the mass of the planet CoRoT-7b as 5.2 ± 0.8 M ⊕ . Combined with the radius of the planet this results in a density of 7.2±1.8 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> . which is consistent, but slightly more dense than the reported value of 5.6 ± 1.3 g cm −3 in the previous work.</p><p>We also analysed spectra of the Sun and α Cen B, also observed with the HARPS spectrograph. For these stars the fundamental parameters are known with very good accuracy and they can therefore be used to validate the methods we use for the much fainter star CoRoT-7. We compared the spectroscopically determined T eff and log g with the values from fundamental methods for α Cen B, i.e. using the binary dynamical mass and the interferometric determination of the radius. There is excellent agreement within 1-σ, indicating that the adopted uncertainties are realistic. This gives us some confidence that we can use theoretical evolution models to constrain the radii and masses of stars, but requires that limits can be put on the stellar age.</p><p>The exoplanet host star CoRoT-7 is a slowly rotating, metal rich, type G9V star. The star is relatively faint and its fundamental parameters can only be determined through indirect methods. The expected future discoveries of similar planet systems with CoRoT and Kepler will also be limited by our ability to characterise the host stars. In the case of Kepler we have the additional advantage that for the brightest stars the solar-like pulsations can be used to constrain the stellar radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 2010)</ref>. This analysis also relies on evolution models but will be able to constrain the stellar radius to about 2% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stello et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basu et al. 2010</ref>). For most of the Kepler targets astrometric parallaxes will be available, while for CoRoT-7 we must wait for the GAIA mission.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>We have presented a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planet-hosting star CoRoT-7. The analysis is based on HARPS spectra which have higher signal-to-noise and better resolution than be UVES spectrum used to get a preliminary result <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Léger, Rouan, Schneider et al. 2009</ref>). We analysed both individual spectra from different nights and co-added spectra and found excellent agreement. Only for one of the single HARPS spectra did we find a systematic error in T eff and log g, which is explained by the low S/N.</p><p>We described in detail the VWA tool which is used for determination of the atmospheric parameters T eff and log g using Fe i-ii lines and the pressure sensitive Mg i b and Ca lines. We used the SME tool to analyse in addition the Balmer and Na i lines. We find excellent agreement between the different methods.</p><p>To evaluate the evolutionary status (age) and fundamental stellar parameters (mass, radius) we compared the observed properties of CoRoT-7 with theoretical isochrones. From the spectroscopic T eff and log g we can estimate the L/M ratio. We compared this with isochrones but find that the uncertainty is too large to constrain the evolutionary status. However, by imposing constraints on the stellar age (1.2-2.3 Gyr from Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. 2009</ref>) we can constrain the mass and radius to 0.91 ± 0.03 M ⊙ and 0.82 ± 0.04 R ⊙ . This is a only slight revision of the original value from Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> who used a lower metallicity. The relatively large uncertainty of 7% on the stellar radius directly impacts the accuracy of the determine radius and density of the transiting planet, CoRoT-7b.</p><p>We have used the new stellar parameters to fit the transit light curve reported by Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref>. We used the formalism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Giménez (2006)</ref> with fixed limbdarkening coefficients, and we explored the parameter space which is consistent with the stellar parameters and their associated uncertainty. The constraints to the fit include the orbital inclination (81.45±1.10 • ), the phase of transit ingress θ 1 (0.02785± 0.00005), and the ratio of planet-to-star radius (0.0176±0.0003). We refer to Sect. 9 in Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al. (2009)</ref> for a description of the methodology of the fitting procedure. With the new stellar parameters we determine the radius of the planet to be slightly smaller with radius 1.58 ± 0.10 R ⊕ (Léger, Rouan, Schneider et al. 2009 found 1.68 ± 0.09 R ⊕ ). The slightly smaller radius is mainly due to our revision of the stellar radius.</p><p>Acknowledgements.

We are grateful for the availability of the VALD database for the atomic parameters used in this work.
