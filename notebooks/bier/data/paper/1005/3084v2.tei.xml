				<p>Correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet formation process. We analyze a sample of 1266 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity. Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 M ⊙ to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1.9 M ⊙. In agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f ∝ 10 1.2[Fe/H]. We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98% confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets is not likely due to convective envelope &quot;pollution.&quot; Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H] &lt; 0, indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities. We also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass (f ∝ M ⋆), characterized by a rise from 3% around M dwarfs (0.5 M ⊙) to 14% around A stars (2 M ⊙), at Solar metallicity. We argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretion model of planet formation.</p>

Even the first handful of exoplanet discoveries revealed that the likelihood of a star harboring a planet was closely tied to stellar iron content, or metallicity [Fe/H] ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gonzalez 1997)</ref>. Subsequent studies of larger samples of stars using uniform spectroscopic modeling techniques found that giant planet occurrence increases sharply for stellar metallicity in excess of the Solar value, rising from 3% for <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> 0 to 25% for [Fe/H] &gt; +0.4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005, hereafter FV05)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to informing models of planet formation <ref type="bibr">(Ida &amp; Lin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Johansen et al. 2009</ref>), the planet-metallicity correlation (PMC) has provided a guide for the target selection of subsequent planet searches. The Next 2000 Stars (N2K) and MetallicityBiased CORALIE surveys leveraged the higher metallicities of their samples to detect large numbers of closein planets, many of which transit their host stars and thereby yield key insights into the interior structures of Jovian exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fischer et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouchy et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Johnson et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Moutou et al. 2006</ref>). Indeed, studies of known transiting planets have revealed evidence of a correlation between planetary core mass and the metallicity of their host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sato et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Torres et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Guillot et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>While the first planet detections yielded a definitive correlation between giant planet occurrence and stellar metallicity, until recently very little was known about the effects of stellar mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Laws et al. 2003</ref>). The first Doppler-based planet surveys concentrated primarily on stars with masses similar to the Sun, both because it was desirable to find Solar System analogs and because Sun-like stars make excellent planet-search targets. Compared to more massive stars, dwarfs with masses within 1.0 ± 0.2 M ⊙ are relatively numerous, have cool atmospheres and slow rotational velocities (V rot sin i 5 km s −1 ). The latter two features result in a high density of narrow absorption lines in the spectra of Sun-like stars, which is ideal measuring for stellar Doppler shifts to high precision.</p><p>Stars at the lower end of the mass scale (the K and M stars) are even more numerous than the Sun and they also display large number of narrow absorption features in their spectra. However, most low-mass stars are optically faint (V mag 10) and are thus not included in large numbers in most Doppler surveys. The faintness of late-K and M-type dwarfs can be overcome by using larger telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Butler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonfils et al. 2005b</ref>), and more recently by observing at infrared wavelengths ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bean et al. 2009</ref>). Despite the small numbers of M dwarfs thus far monitored by Doppler surveys, one result has become apparent: M dwarfs harbor Jovian planets very infrequently. Only eight systems containing one or more giant planets have been found among the ≈ 300 M dwarfs on various Doppler programs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Johnson et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Haghighipour et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>It was originally thought that the paucity of Jupitermass planets around M dwarfs was due to a metallicity bias among nearby, low-mass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bonfils et al. 2005a</ref>). However, a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Johnson &amp; Apps (2009)</ref> revealed that M dwarfs likely have the same metallicity distribution as Sun-like stars, and stars with masses M ⋆ &lt; 0.5 M ⊙ are 2-4 times less likely than Sun-like stars to have a Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Johnson et al. 2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Johnson et al. , 2010b</ref>.</p><p>At the other end of the mass scale, the problems inherent to massive, early-type stars can be overcome by observing targets at a later stage of their evolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hatzes et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Setiawan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sato et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Reffert et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Johnson et al. 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Niedzielski et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Liu et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Döllinger et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>Once stars exhaust their core hydrogen fuel sources they move off of the main sequence, become cooler, and shed a large fraction of their primordial angular momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gray &amp; Nagar 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">do Nascimento et al. 2000)</ref>.

Furthermore, based in part on a study of planets around K giants in nearby open clusters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lovis &amp; Mayor (2007)</ref> found that the average planet mass increases as a function of stellar mass, indicating that gas giant planets become either more massive on average, or more numerous (or both) with increasing stellar mass (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bowler et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The observed correlation between stellar mass and the occurrence of detectable planets, like the PMC before it, has added an important new variable to models of planet formation. While the Sun and Solar-mass stars serve as important benchmarks for understanding the formation of our own planetary system, successful, generalized planet formation theories must now account for the effects of stellar mass, and presumably by extension, disk mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Laughlin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ida &amp; Lin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Currie 2009)</ref>.</p><p>While previous studies have uncovered the existence of a positive correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence, it is important to understand the underlying functional form of the relationship. For example, it would be advantageous to know whether the correlation is purely linear, or if it can instead be better described as some other functional form. Besides informing theories of planet formation, an improved understanding of the relationship between planet occurrence and stellar mass will also help guide the target selection of future surveys, and aid in the interpretation of results of current and future planet-search efforts. Just as some previous Doppler surveys biased their target selection toward high-metallicity stars to increase their yield, future direct-imaging, astrometric and Doppler surveys may benefit from concentrating on more massive stars. This strategy has paid off for one high-contrast imaging survey, resulting in the detection of three giant planets around the A5 dwarf HR 8799 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Marois et al. 2008)</ref>. Another example of an imaged planet is Fomalhaut b, which is a giant planet ( 3.3 M Jup ) orbiting just inside of a debris disk of an A3V star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kalas et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chiang et al. 2009</ref>). Even in the cases when surveys do not yield detections, proper interpretation of null results requires knowledge of the expected number of detections (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nielsen &amp; Close 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Ascertaining the underlying form of the dependence of giant planet occurrence on stellar mass requires a larger sample than used in previous studies. ). Improvements in our ability to estimate the metallicities of M dwarfs and massive evolved stars have provided vital information about how to properly isolate the effects of stellar mass from the known effects of stellar metallicity. With these tools at hand, we are now poised to make an updated evaluation of the relationship between stellar mass and planet occurrence.</p><p>Our paper is organized as follows. In § 2 we present the characteristics of our three primary samples, including low-mass M dwarfs from Keck observatory; "Sun-like" late-F, G and K (FGK) dwarfs from the main CPS sample; and massive, evolved stars from the Lick and Keck subgiant surveys. In § 3 we examine the separate effects of mass and metallicity on planet occurrence. In § 4 we present our Bayesian inference technique of measuring correlations between planet occurrence and stellar characteristics and we provide the best-fitting parameters for the measured relationship in § 5. We compare our results with previous work in § 6. Finally, we summarize our key results and discuss our findings in the context of the current theoretical understanding of planet formation in § 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SELECTION OF STARS AND PLANETS</head><p>Our goal is to measure planet occurrence as a function of stellar properties. Care must be exercised in selecting the sample of target stars such that planets of a given mass and orbital semimajor axis could be uniformly detected over the entire sample. The criteria for planet mass and semimajor axis translate into limits on velocity amplitudes, K, and orbital periods that can be tallied among the sample of planet detections. These criteria must be selected to ensure reasonably uniform detection characteristics across several Doppler surveys, which have different detection sensitivities and time baselines.</p><p>In what follows, we describe our selection of stars and planets from among the various CPS planet search programs. The CPS is a collection of Doppler surveys carried out primarily at the Lick and Keck Observatories. The CPS target lists provide a large stellar sample with a wide range of masses and metallicities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Planet Detections</head><p>Following FV05, we restrict our analysis to systems with at least one "uniformly detectable planet," which we define as those with velocity semiamplitudes K &gt; 20 m s −1 and semimajor axes a &lt; 2.5 AU. We decreased threshold in K from the value used by FV05 (K &gt; 30 m s −1 ) because of the increased Doppler precision of HIRES since the 2005 detector upgrade (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Howard et al. 2010a</ref>). For reference, at 1 AU and for circular orbits, semiamplitudes K = 20 m s −1 corresponds to minimum planet masses</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M P sin i/ M Jup = {0.44, 0.82, 1.12} for M ⋆ /M ⊙ = {0.4, 1.0, 1.6}.</formula><p>Due to the limited time baselines of the Doppler surveys from which our targets are drawn, we also restrict our analysis to planets with a &lt; 2.5 AU. This criterion is set primarily by our sample of intermediatemass subgiants, which are on surveys with time baselines ranging from 3-6 years. These criteria will, for most stellar masses, represent conservative cuts on the total number of giant planet detections. We defer the analysis of the frequency of less massive planets with M P sin i &lt; 1.0 M Jup or orbits wider than 2.5 AU to other studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sousa et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Howard et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gould et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To further ensure uniform detectability within our stellar sample we restrict our analysis to stars with a minimum number of observations. For the low-mass and Solar-mass samples we require &gt; 10 observations. For the high-mass subgiants we require &gt; 6 observations; a smaller number owing primarily to the shorter time baseline of our Keck survey. We also require minimum observational time baselines corresponding to our semimajor axis limit of a &lt; 2.5 AU. Thus, for the M dwarfs we require a baseline &gt; 6.3 years, using an average stellar mass M ⋆ = 0.4 M ⊙ ; &gt; 4 years for the Solar-mass stars; and &gt; 3 years for the subgiants with an average stellar mass of 1.6 M ⊙ .</p><p>We compiled our sample of planet detections by crosscorrelating our stellar samples with the Exoplanets Data Explorer, and recent planet announcements from the CPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Howard et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. 2010a,b)</ref>.

The thick (black) lines each stellar mass group represent the best-fitting linear relationships between mass and metallicity (for the M dwarfs the lines represent the metallicity). The dashed (red) line is the best-fitting linear relationship between mass and metallicity for the stars with planets. For the M dwarfs we simply report the average metallicity for each population. The (blue) 2-dimensional error bars represent the typical measurement uncertainties. In each mass group, there is a systematic metallicity offset between the stars with and without planets. Discontinuities between the samples are not entirely physical, and are in large part due to the different target-selection criteria for the three surveys. straints on the orbital parameters for publication. However, since the present study is concerned with planet occurrence we feel confident in including these secure, yet unpublished detections in our sample. All of the unpublished candidates have radial velocity variations consistent with Doppler amplitudes and periods that meet our criteria for uniform detectability.</p><p>Our sample of planet detections comprises 5 planets around M dwarfs, 74 planets around the SPOCS sample of FGK dwarfs, and 36 planets around subgiants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DISENTANGLING MASS AND METALLICITY</head><p>In our analysis we treat stellar mass and metallicity as separate independent variables affecting the likelihood that a star harbors a planet. The validity of this premise rests in part on the analysis of FV05, who noted an artificial correlation between mass and metallicity in the SPOCS sample that is due to the color and magnitude cuts used in the target selection: the more massive stars in the SPOCS sample have higher metallicities than the lower-mass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marcy et al. 2005, ;</ref><ref type="bibr">FV05)</ref>. This selection effect is clearly seen in our updated data set shown in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>However, as can be seen in that figure and as noted by FV05, there is a metallicity offset between stars with and without planets at all masses between 0.7 M ⊙ and 1.4 M ⊙ (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Santos et al. (2004)</ref>). Thus, despite the artificial mass-metallicity correlation in our sample of FGK dwarfs, there still exists a clear PMC. At a given mass, stars with planets have higher metallicities than the stars without planets.</p><p>The PMC is also apparent in the M dwarf sample. The low-mass stars with planets are extremely metalrich compared to the full stellar sample 7 . Also apparent from the M dwarf sample is that there are far fewer planet detections, both in an absolute and fractional sense, compared to the higher-mass stellar samples.</p><p>The far right-hand panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows that the metallicity offset between stars with and without planets is also present among the more massive subgiants, albeit at lower statistical significance. Like the FGK dwarfs, <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The metallicities of the full sample of M dwarfs were estimated using the photometric calibration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Johnson &amp; Apps (2009)</ref>. This required an extrapolation of their relationship for the stars below the main sequence. However, since the relationship between ∆M K and [Fe/H] is expected to be monotonic, our extrapolation will not affect our conclusions in this case. the subgiants have a artificial mass-metallicity correlation, owing to the red cutoff of (B − V &lt; 1.1) used in the selection of the subgiants from the Hipparcos catalog. A much higher fraction of massive stars have detected planets than do the M or FGK dwarfs.</p><p>The metallicity offsets among the stars with and without planets in the three mass-bins in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> are suggestive of a PMC that spans an order of magnitude in mass, from 0.2 M ⊙ to 2.0 M ⊙ . Also seen among the three mass bins is a steadily increasing planet occurrence rate: while only 3.3% of the M dwarfs have a planet, 20% of the retired A stars harbor one or more giant planets. This is strong evidence that planet occurrence correlates with stellar mass, separately from the effects of stellar metallicity. In the following sections we examine these trends in further detail.</p></div>

The parameters can be inferred from the measured number of planet hosts H drawn from a larger sample of T targets using Bayes' theorem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (X | d) ∝ P (d | X)P (X)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>8 Since [Fe/H] ∝ logN F e , the exponential term in Equation 1 is a power law relationship of the number of iron atoms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (F ) ∝ 10 βF ∝ N β F e .</formula><p>where P (X | d) denotes the probability of X conditioned on the data d. In our analysis, the data represent a binary result: a star does or does not have a detectable planet. The terms on the right of the proportionality are the probability of the data conditioned on the distribution of possible X, multiplied by the prior knowledge and assumptions we have for the parameters. Each of the T target stars represents a Bernoulli trial, so the probability of finding a planet at a given mass and metallicity is given the binomial distribution. The probability of a detection around star i (of H total detections) is given by f (M i , F i ). The probability of the jth nondetection is 1 − f (M j , F j ). Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (X | d) ∝ P (X) H i f (M i , F i ) × T −H j [1 − f (M j , F j )]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For each detection or nondetection, our measurements of the stellar properties of each system, M i and F i , are themselves probability distributions given by p obs (M i , F i ). We approximate these pdfs as the product of Gaussians 9 with means {M i , F i } and standard deviations {σ M,i , σ F,i }. The predicted planet fraction for the ith star can then be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f (M i , F i ) = p obs (M i , F i )f (M, F )dM dF<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For ease of calculation the products in Equation 3 can be rewritten as the sum of log-probabilities, or the marginal log-likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L ≡ log P (d | X) ∝ H i log f (M i , F i ) + + T −H j log [1 − f (M j , F j )] + log P (X)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The parameters X = {C, α, β} are then optimized by maximizing L conditioned on the data. We perform our maximum-likelihood analysis by numerically evaluating L on a 3-dimensional grid over intervals bounded by uniform priors on the parameters {C, α, β}. In our case, the priors simply define the integration limits on the marginal probability density functions (pdf) of the parameters, e.g. a We used uniform priors on our parameters between the two limits listed in this column.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (α | d) = βmax βmin Cmax Cmin P (X | d)dβdC<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The ranges of the uniform priors used in the analysis are listed in the second column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. It might at first seem more appropriate to use a prior for β from the analysis of FV05, e.g. a Gaussian centered on β = 2, rather than a uniform function. However, we decided against this choice of prior because no confidence interval for β was reported by FV05, and we could not be certain that their value was truly representative of our data due to fundamental differences in our methodology, as we discuss in § 5. Similarly, no functional form for f (M ) was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Johnson et al. (2007a)</ref>.</p><p>However, our choice of a uniform prior is not entirely uninformed. Based on previous studies, we felt it was safe to consider only monotonically increasing functions (α &gt; 0, β &gt; 0), and for β we chose a range that encompasses the value measured by FV05.</p></div>

We estimated the confidence intervals by measuring the 15.9 and 84.1 percentile levels in the cumulative distributions (CDF) calculated from the marginal pdf of each parameter (e.g. Equation 6).</p><p>The marginal joint parameter pdfs are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig- ure 3</ref>. The comparisons between the best-fitting relationship (Equation 1) and the data are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> and 5. In both figures, the histograms show the "bulk" planet frequency, with bin widths of 0.15 M ⊙ and 0.1 dex, respectively. The filled circles denote the median planet fraction predicted by Equation 1 based on the masses and metallicities of the stars in each bin. The diamonds show the best-fitting metallicity and mass relationships, given by f (M, F = 0) and f (M = 1, F ).</p><p>Our Bayesian inference analysis provides two additional assurances that stellar mass and metallicity correlate separately with planet fraction. The first is the lack of covariance between α and β in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. This also demonstrates that our stellar sample adequately spans the mass-metallicity plane despite the artificial correlation between stellar parameters in part of our sample. The second check on our initial assumptions is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. While some of the increase in planet fraction as a function of stellar mass is due to a rise in average stellar metallicity in our sample of high-mass stars (circles), there still exists a nearly linear increase owing to stellar mass alone (diamonds). Thus, there is an approximately order-of-magnitude increase in planet occurrence over the mass range spanning M dwarfs to A-type stars. Similarly, some of the metallicity relationship is due to the higher stellar masses among the metal-rich stars. However, there still exists a strong metallicity correlation spanning more than an order of magnitude in iron abundance.</p><p>In the following section we compare our results to those of related studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">COMPARISONS WITH PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>6.1. Previous metallicity studies FV05 studied planet occurrence as a function of metallicity among the Sun-like portion of our stellar sample and found β = 2. By restricting our analysis to the SPOCS subset of our sample that overlaps with FV05, and by fitting a function of metallicity alone we find β = 1.7±0.3, which agrees with the FV05 value to within our 68.2% confidence interval. The significance of the difference is reduced further if we assume the uncertainty in their measurement is comparable to ours.</p><p>By fitting for both mass and metallicity we find β = 1.4 ± 0.3 and α = 0.7 ± 0.4, which agree with the values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> measured for the full stellar sample. This provides assurance that our analysis is not overly sensitive to our high-mass stellar sample, among which our detection sensitivity is lower due to the shorter time baseline and fewer Doppler measurements per star.</p><p>It is likely that this smaller β from our analysis of the Sun-like stars compared to that of FV05 is in part due to the different methods of fitting the planet-fraction relationship, i.e. their least-squares fit to histogram bins versus our Bayesian approach <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . The other key difference is that we simultaneously fit to both mass and metallicity. Since mass and metallicity are correlated in our samples some of the metallicity relationship observed by FV05 was due to stellar mass. This effect can also be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. The joint mass-metallicity relationship sits above the metallicity power-law at high values of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> since the metal-rich stars in our sample tend to be slightly more massive on average than the metal-poor stars.</p><p>Udry &amp; Santos (2007) analyzed the FV05 sample, together with a sample of stars drawn from the CORALIE survey, and found β = 2.04 for [Fe/H] &gt; 0. For lower metallicities they suggest a flat occurrence rate provides a better fit than the continuation of the exponential relationship to sub-Solar metallicities. We compared the two functional forms (exponential versus exponentialplus-constant) using the method of Bayesian model comparison. By integrating the right-hand side of Equation 2 over all parameters X, one obtains the evidence, or total probability of the model conditioned on the data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (d) = P (α, β, C | d) dα dβ dC<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The ratio of evidences provides a means of quantifying preference in one model over another. If a model has evidence more than a factor of 10 greater than the alternative, it is "strongly preferred" <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kass &amp; Raftery 1995)</ref>.</p><p>When fitting planet-fraction as a function of metallicity alone, the evidence for the exponential-only model is a factor of 1800 higher than the exponential-plus-constant. Thus, our data strongly prefer a model in which the fraction of stars with planets continues to decrease for [Fe/H] &lt; 0. We can take the Bayesian evidence analysis a step further and compare our joint fit to the planet fraction as a function of mass and metallicity to previous fits to metallicity or mass alone. We find that the evidence for the joint fit is a factor of 2400 larger than that of the metallicity-only fit, and a factor of 10 7 higher than a mass-only fit. The planet fraction among our sample is therefore best described as a function of metallicity and stellar mass. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Johnson et al. (2007a)</ref> used roughly the same sample presented herein to measure the occurrence rate of planets in three coarse mass bins with widths of 0.6 M ⊙ centered on M ⋆ = {0.4, 1.0, 1.6} M ⊙ . In these three intervals they measured occurrence rates of 1.8 ± 1.0%, 4.2 ± 0.7% and 8.9 ± 2.9%. After correcting for the average stellar metallicity in each bin, the fractions change slightly to 2.5 ± 1.2%, 3.5 ± 0.7, and a lower limit of 6.3% for the high-mass bin. Integrating our relationship over the same mass intervals yields 2.5 ± 0.9%, 6.5 ± 0.7%, and 11 ± 2%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Previous mass studies</head><p>The agreement for the low-mass bin is not too surprising since we are using the same sample of M dwarfs as used by Johnson et al. The disagreement for the FGK dwarfs is in part due to the different selection criteria for planet detections: we use a velocity amplitude cutoff of K &gt; 20 m s −1 , compared to the M P sin i &gt; 0.8 M Jup used by Johnson et al. Because of this, our sample of planet detections includes a larger number of low-mass planets at short orbital periods, particularly for the Sunlike stellar sample. At higher stellar masses, our measured planet fraction represents a significant refinement over the result of Johnson et al., which stems primarily from our larger sample size and higher Doppler precision with Keck/HIRES compared to Lick/Hamilton. Our revised planet fraction for the high-mass stars appears much smaller than the recent results presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bowler et al. (2010)</ref>, who measured f = 26 +9 −8 % for 1.5 ≤ M ⋆ /M ⊙ &lt; 1.9, based on the Lick subgiants sample. However, Bowler et al. reported the bulk occurrence rate, and did not attempt to correct or fit for metallicity. Our analysis shows that metallicity plays an important role in shaping the bulk occurrence rate among our subgiants, which are metal-rich by +0.14 dex compared to the less massive stars. This can be seen in the highest mass bin in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, in which the measured planet fraction is consistent with the value measured by Bowler et al. Similarly, in their analysis of the planet fraction for M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Johnson et al. 2010b</ref>) noted the higher occurrence for metal-rich M dwarfs, but only reported a bulk occurrence rate for the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Is there a planet-metallicity correlation among our</head><p>evolved stars? In their analysis of the metallicity distribution of K giants with planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pasquini et al. (2007)</ref> concluded there was no evidence of a PMC among their evolved stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Takeda et al. (2008)</ref> found a similar result based on their sample of massive K giants, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hekker &amp; Meléndez (2007)</ref> did find evidence supporting a PMC among their stellar sample. This somewhat contentious point has important implications for the interpretation of the PMC seen among Sun-like stars. <ref type="bibr">Pasquini et al. argued</ref> that this lack of a metallicity correlation was evidence for the "pollution" scenario, in which only the outer layers of stars with planets were metal-enriched by the infall of gas-depleted planetesimals during the planet-formation epoch <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gonzalez 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Murray &amp; Chaboyer 2002)</ref>. In this scenario, as stars evolve off of the main sequence their convective envelopes deepen and their polluted outer layers are diluted, erasing any "skin-deep" metallicity enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Laughlin 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In our analysis, we implicitly assume that the PMC holds among the evolved stars in our sample. We can test this assumption by restricting our analysis to M ⋆ &gt; 1.4 M ⊙ and comparing the Bayesian evidence between two models: planet fraction as a function of stellar mass alone, f (M ) = CM α (corresponding to a flat metallicity distribution) versus planet fraction as a function of stellar mass and metallicity, f (M, F ), given by Equation 1. We fitted both models to the subsample of massive subgiants, which have deep convective envelopes according to the Padova stellar model grids ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Girardi et al. 2002)</ref>. We find that the planet fraction among these evolved stars is best described as a function of mass and metallicity, with an evidence ratio of order 10 12 .</p><p>The extreme magnitude of the Bayes factor is driven primarily by the 7 subgiants with M ⋆ &gt; 1.4 M ⊙ and [Fe/H] &gt; +0.35 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 2</ref>). It is highly improbable that a flat metallicity distribution would result in 5 out of 7 of these metal-rich subgiants harboring a planet. The best fitting parameters are α = 1.5 ± 0.4 and β = 0.73 ± 0.35, which are lower than, yet consistent with the values we measure for the full stellar sample. However, the size and metallicity range of our sample of subgiants only allows us to rule out a flat metallicity relationship with 98% confidence. At present we can say that our data are consistent with a PMC among our massive subgiants. We are not certain about the source of disagreement between our result and those of Pasquini et al. and Takeda et al. One possibility is the difference in our statistical methodologies. Both of those previous studies compared the histograms of stars with and without planets, and as a result did not quantify their confidence in a PMC or lack thereof. It will be informative to apply the techniques outlined in § 4 to the stellar and planet samples of the various K-giant surveys in order to make a meaningful comparison with our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We have used a large sample of planet-search target stars and planet detections from the CPS to study the correlation between stellar properties and the occurrence of giant planets (K &gt; 20 m s −1 ) with a 2.5 AU. We have derived an empirical relationship describing giant planet occurrence as a function of stellar mass and metallicity, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f (M ⋆ , [Fe/H]) = 0.07 ± 0.01 × (M ⋆ /M ⊙ ) 1.0±0.3 × 10 1.2±0.2[Fe/H] .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Our understanding of planet formation is presently dominated by two theories: core accretion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>) and disk instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boss 1997)</ref>. The core accretion model is a bottom-up process, by which protoplanetary cores are built up by the collisions of smaller planetesimals. Once the core reaches a critical mass of roughly 10 M ⊕ , it rapidly accretes gas from the surrounding disk material. The disk instability mechanism is a top-down process whereby giant planets form from the gravitational collapse of an unstable portion of the protoplanetary disk.</p><p>Both models depend on the existence of a massive gas disk, a portion of which forms the bulk of the final mass of the Jupiter-like planet. However, since the inner gas disks of protoplanetary disks disperse on timescales of 3-5 Myr, the process of planet formation is a race against time (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pickett &amp; Lim 2004</ref>). In this race the disk instability model holds a major advantage over the core accretion model because, under the right conditions, planets can form from disk collapse in a mere thousands of years, compared to of order Myr timescales required for core accretion.</p><p>The disk instability model predicts that there should be no dependence on planet formation and physical stellar properties. The simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boss (2006)</ref> showed that giant planets should readily form in even low-mass protoplanetary disks, and that in general giant planets should form efficiently via disk instability independent of stellar mass. The disk instability model also predicts that planet formation should also be independent of disk metallicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boss 2002</ref>). Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cai et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Meru &amp; Bate (2010)</ref> show that the efficiency of disk instability to form giant planets decreases with increasing metallicity.</p><p>In contrast to these predictions of the disk instability model, we observe a strong dependence between planet occurrence and the physical properties of the star. Assuming that the present-day mass and metallicity of a star reflects the conditions in its protoplanetary disk, then our results suggest that disk instability is not the primary formation mechanism for the giant planets detected by Doppler surveys. Indeed, it has long been recognized in that there are theoretical complications in forming close-in planets via disk instability ?, e.g.. However, the mechanism may be responsible for planets in wide orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009</ref>), however see ? for complications with this scenario.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the observed planetmetallicity correlation is the so-called "pollution" model. In this scenario, planet formation actually occurs around stars of all metallicities, and the accretion of gas-depleted protoplanets onto the thin convective layers of stars gives rise to an enhanced stellar metallicity that is actually only "skin deep" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Murray &amp; Chaboyer 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pasquini et al. (2007)</ref> interpreted the flat metallicity distribution of K giants with planets as evidence for such an effect, since the deepening convective envelopes of evolved stars should dilute any metallicity enhancement of its outer layers. However, we find that the planet fraction among our massive subgiants is described well by a model with a monotonic rise as a function of both mass and metallicity (Section 6).</p><p>While much attention has been given to evolved, intermediate-mass stars in the investigation of the pollution paradigm <ref type="bibr">(Laughlin &amp; Adams 1997, FV05</ref>), stars at the other end of the stellar mass scale provide another proving ground. M dwarfs have deep convective envelopes over their entire lifetimes, and stars with masses below 0.4 M ⊙ are expected to be completely convective, at least in the absence of strong magnetic activity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mullan &amp; MacDonald 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The evidence for a PMC among the subgiants, together with a strong PMC seen among the M dwarfs, are highly suggestive that the present-day metallicities of stars are representative of the compositions of their disks during the planet-formation era. One compelling explanation for both the observed PMC and stellar-mass correlation is that the surface density of solids is a key factor in the planet formation process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Laughlin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ida &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Robinson et al. 2006</ref>). If so, both higher stellar (disk) metallicity and higher stellar (disk) mass can generate the requisite surface density for planet formation.</p><p>The relationship between planet formation efficiency and stellar mass/metallicity has been previously studied in the context the core accretion paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ikoma et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kornet et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kornet et al. , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thommes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kretke et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Johansen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon (2008)</ref> modeled the evolution of the temperature profile at the disk midplanes of stars of various masses, and studied the width of the radial region of disks in which protoplanetary cores form most efficiently. They found that the disks around Atype stars on their descent to the main sequence have very broad formation regions, and their models predicted a positive correlation between stellar mass and giant planet formation efficiency. Their prediction for the planet fraction is shown as a dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, which we have approximated using the polynomial relationship f (M ) = −0.03633 + 0.0138M ⋆ − 0.0060M 2 ⋆ . The agreement between theory and observation is striking.</p><p>The interplay between the mass and metallicity of protoplanetary disks is also apparent in the core accretion simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thommes et al. (2008)</ref>. In their analysis, they simulated disks with a wide variety of masses, viscosities and metallicities. Their models produce gas giants most effectively in disks with a combination of high masses (M disk 0.04 M ⊙ ) and low viscosities. In their simulations of the effects of metallicity, they found that gas giants can form in Solar-composition disks only if the disk masses exceed ≈ 0.06 M ⊙ , or twice the minimummass Solar nebula. This mass threshold decreases to ≈ 0.03 M ⊙ for disks with [Fe/H] = 0.25. Thus, Thommes et al. showed that there can be a trade-off between the mass and metallicity of a protoplanetary disk in forming giant planets. In the core accretion paradigm, M dwarfs can form giant planets, but only if they have high metallicities. Similarly, even low-metallicity A stars can form massive planets, owing to their more massive disks (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>Theories of planet formation have progressed in large leaps thanks largely to the rapidly growing sample of exoplanets discovered around other stars.</p><p>Successful, generalized theories of the origins of planetary systems must account for the observed correlations between planet occurrence and stellar properties. The findings presented herein are the result of more than 15 years of high-precision Doppler monitoring of nearby stars. Additional information will soon pour in from other surveys using techniques such as microlensing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dong et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gould et al. 2010</ref>), astrometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boss et al. 2009</ref>), transits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barge et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Irwin et al. 2009</ref>) and direct imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Claudi et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artigau et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>Our results have important implications for the target selection of these future planet surveys. We find that A-type stars harbor planets at an elevated rate compared to less massive stars. However, it is not obvious whether A type stars make the most promising targets for other types of surveys. Where massive stars perhaps hold the most promise is for direct imaging surveys. The first two planetary systems imaged around normal stars were both young A-type dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kalas et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marois et al. 2008</ref>). Are A dwarfs the ideal direct imaging targets? The answer to this question will rely on the results presented herein, along with a careful consideration of the mass, metallicity, luminosity and age distributions of nearby stars; and the orbital and physical properties of planets as a function of stellar mass.

			<note place="foot" n="5"> In that study, &quot;detectable planets&quot; were defined as having M P sin i &gt; 0.8 M Jup and a &lt; 2.5 AU.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> http://exoplanets.org/</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> Because stellar metallicities are used to select the appropriate stellar model grids (&quot;isochrones&quot;) for the estimate of the stellar mass, these two measurements are actually covariant. However, we find that our result is not affected by assuming independent Gaussians.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> For example, FV05 performed a χ 2 minimization, which assumes symmetric ( (N )) error bars on their histogram bins. However, the errors should have been binomial and asymmetric, which would have admitted smaller values of β.</note>
