			<abstract>
				<p>We present empirical phase curves of Jupiter from ∼ 0 − 140 degrees as measured in multiple optical bandpasses by Cassini/ISS during the Millennium flyby of Jupiter in late 2000 to early 2001. Phase curves are of interest for studying the energy balance of Jupiter and understanding the scattering behavior of Jupiter as an exoplanet analog. We find that Jupiter is significantly darker at partial phases than an idealized Lamber-tian planet by roughly 25% and is not well fit by Jupiter-like exoplanet atmospheric models across all wavelengths. We provide analytic fits to Jupiter&apos;s phase function in several Cassini/ISS imaging filter bandpasses. In addition, these observations show that Jupiter&apos;s color is more variable with phase angle than predicted by models. Therefore , the color of even a near Jupiter-twin planet observed at a partial phase cannot be assumed to be comparable to that of Jupiter at full phase. We discuss how WFIRST and other future direct-imaging missions can enhance the study of cool giants.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The ratio of the total energy scattered by a planet to that incident upon the planet, or the Bond albedo, defines its external energy budget. Along with internal heat flow, this influences. a planet's atmospheric temperature, controls its evolution through time, and defines its detectability as a function of wavelength. A more reflective atmosphere allows a planet to cool more quickly than a darker, Jupiter's Empirical Phase Curve 3 more absorptive atmosphere. Complete measurements of the reflectivity of the planet require observations of the light from the planet relative to the light from the star at all wavelengths at all phase angles, α, the angle formed between the star, planet, and Earth. The variation of reflectivity at a given wavelength as a function of phase angle is known as the phase curve and is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F p (λ, α) F ⊙ (λ) = A g (λ) R p d 2 Φ(λ, α),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A g (λ) is the monochromatic geometric albedo defined at α = 0 • , F p (λ, α) is the monochromatic planet flux observed at phase angle, α, F ⊙ (λ) is the monochromatic incident solar flux, R p is the planet's radius, d is the planet-star separation, and Φ(λ, α) is the planet's phase function at angle α, not to be confused with particle scattering phase functions.</p><p>The simplest model planetary phase function treats planets as Lambertian reflectors where the </p><p>Other phase functions are possible, including those which arise from isotropic or Rayleigh scattering (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dlugach &amp; Yanovitskij (1974)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Greco &amp; Burrows (2015)</ref>) or a combination of these and nonisotropic Mie scatterers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. 2010)</ref>. From the phase function, we can calculate the phase integral,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q(λ) = 2 π 0 Φ(λ, α) sin(α)dα,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which leads to the fraction of light reflected at all angles known as the spherical albedo, A s (λ) = q(λ)A g (λ). From this the full Bond albedo, a measure of the amount of light reflected at all angles and all wavelengths, can be computed as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A B = ∞ 0 A s (λ)F ⊙ (λ)dλ ∞ 0 F ⊙ (λ)dλ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For a given internal heat flow and under the assumption of thermal equilibrium, the effective tem-Mayorga, L. C. et al.</p><p>perature of a planet can be estimated, allowing major cloud constituents and atmospheric structure to be modeled. Evolution models can then constrain the cooling history.</p><p>While these concepts are familiar in planetary sciences, they have been fruitfully applied to exoplanet science as well. As reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Parmentier et al. (2016)</ref>, measurements of the phase curves of transiting planets have been used to create atmospheric brightness maps (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cowan &amp; Agol (2008)</ref>  Fortunately, Solar System giant planets are generally well characterized and offer a point of comparison to future exoplanet observations. However, studies of the outer Solar System planets are complicated by observational limitations. Since the Earth is interior to the giant planets in the Solar System, only phase angles 12 • are visible to us from the ground for Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Güssow 1929;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guthnick 1920</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guthnick , 1918</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Muller 1893;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Irvine et al. 1968)</ref>, and even more restricted phase angles are available for the more distant ice giants. Observations of full phase curves for the outer planets requires space-craft observations, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pollack et al. (1986)</ref>. The most notable ground-based work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Karkoschka 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Karkoschka , 1998</ref>) was able to obtain albedo spectra for all the giant planets at low phase angles. These studies have become the basis for many exoplanet analyses. In particular, studies of Jupiter are valuable as both a planet in our Solar System and an exoplanet analog.</p><p>In addition to their role in the interpretation of future observations, phase curves also play a role in mission modeling and observation planning. The brightness of planets as a function of phase is an important input parameter to simulations of exoplanet searches by direct imaging and observation planning for known planets detected by other means. While it has been known since the early 20th century that Jupiter is not Lambertian, only recently have non-Lambertian phase curves been considered in the exoplanet arena. To aid in such efforts here we seek to provide a testbed specifically for giant-planet characterization and searches with direct-imaging techniques. Beyond these empirical phase curves, the literature of the characterization of giant planets, including such works as <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tomasko et al. (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Smith &amp; Tomasko (1984)</ref>, will undoubtedly be helpful for exoplanet direct imaging science.</p><p>The need to classify the type of object being observed has led astronomers to often turn to color.</p><p>Color-color diagrams have been discussed as a method of determining surface properties of terrestrialtype planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hegde &amp; Kaltenegger 2013)</ref>. Also, the color differences between objects have opened a possibility for detecting exomoons through spectroastrometric observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2015</ref>) and can be used to mitigate the contamination from background objects (Exo-S Final Report). In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> discuss the use of color-color diagrams to help distinguish between Neptune-like and Jupiter-like exoplanets. In stellar astronomy, the (U −B), (B −V ) colors have a long history. The (U − B) index roughly measures the height of the Balmer jump and has been shown to be sensitive to both surface gravity and effective temperature, with further complications in interpretation arising from a sensitivity to metallicity. The (B −V ) index is sensitive to the slope of the Paschen continuum and is correlated with the effective temperature of the star. The choice of photometric system has since somewhat evolved to more precisely measure stellar features.</p><p>From the combination of spectra compiled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Karkoschka (1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Karkoschka ( , 1998</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sing et al. (2016)</ref>, and modelling (e.g., ? <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>), we can see that there are several notable features that would help differentiate between various classes of gas giant exoplanets. In general the blue end slope is a product of Rayleigh scattering by gas and hazes. Into the red and near-infrared are spectral features of methane, ammonia, water, and alkali metals. Differences among solar system giants are primarily attributable to variations in gravity, cloud properties, and methane abundance.</p><p>The appropriate selection of color indices for best identifying giant planets is relevant to instrument filter selection and mission planning for direct imaging campaigns. For example among all the combinations of Johnson-Morgan/Cousins (JC) filters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> found that the (B − V ),</p><p>(R − I) and (B − V ), (V − I) filter pairs showed the greatest spread between planet types when considering how color evolves with phase angle. To test the veracity of these exoplanet models for the Jupiter-like planet case we require space-based observations across many phase angles and multiple bandpasses.</p><p>Prior to the recent arrival of the Juno Spacecraft to Jupiter, the latest full-disk imaging of Jupiter came in 2000, in a flyby of the planet by Cassini dubbed the "Millennium" flyby. Cassini was en route to orbit around Saturn and carried a suite of instruments designed to study the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, the particles in the rings, and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Porco 2003</ref>). The flyby provided thousands of full-disk images of Jupiter in a variety of filters. An in depth explanation of the cameras and filters on the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Porco et al. (2004)</ref> and is briefly discussed in SECTION 2.</p><p>Previous attempts to measure Jupiter's phase curves used data from Voyager ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hanel et al. 1981)</ref> and Pioneer 10 and 11 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tomasko et al. 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Smith &amp; Tomasko 1984)</ref>, but they had either limited phase coverage, wavelength coverage, or were lacking in full-disk measurements at all phases, which are most relevant to direct-imaging studies of exoplanets. Cassini/ISS data has already provided information about the atmospheric properties of Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhang et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sato et al. 2013</ref>), but previous studies have been limited to the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), one of the two components of the ISS, in concert with older space-based or ground-based observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dyudina et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dyudina et al. , 2016</ref>. Preliminary target lists, sourced from planets detected through the radial-velocity measurements, demonstrate that WFIRST's most promising targets will be Jupiter-mass planets with semi-major axes of only a couple AU (Table 2-7 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spergel et al. 2015</ref>). These planets maintain high contrast ratios due to their size and proximity to their host stars without being within the inner working angle. In preparation for the analysis of these systems, it is critical that we gain an understanding of how Jupiter-like planets scatter light as function of phase angle because they cannot be directly imaged at 0 • phase. The Cassini/ISS instrument shares the same wavelength regime and has provided nearly full phase angle coverage of Jupiter and is therefore perfectly poised to provide observations of Jupiter of the type WFIRST will conduct on giant exoplanets.</p><p>We present here an analysis of the images from both ISS cameras, the Narrow Angle and Wide Angle Camera (NAC and WAC), in six filters ranging from roughly 400-1000 nm and spanning phase angles from about 0-140 degrees. In SECTION 2 we present our data, the selection process (Section 2.1), the reduction software (Section 2.2), and photometric analysis process (Section 2.3, Section 2.4  ). The two cameras each have two filter wheels that are designed to move independently. The WAC has 9 filters on each wheel for a total of 18 filters. The NAC has 12 filters on each wheel for a total of 24 filters. Roughly half of the NAC filters are duplicated on the WAC, however the bandpasses are shifted a few nm because of the differing spectral transmissions of the camera optics (the optical train of the WAC is a Voyager flight spare), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Porco et al. 2004</ref>). These 15 common filters span from 400-1000 nm in wavelength and six of the WAC filters' transmission curves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data Selection</head><p>The images vary in resolution and orientation during the course of the flyby. The requirement for this study is that Jupiter be contained entirely within an image. This requirement resulted in the poor sampling of phase angles in the 20-50 degree range (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>), where not only was</p><p>Jupiter too large, but the spacecraft also made other observations. During the photometry process, we ensure that Jupiter's disk does not fall off the edge of the field-of-view due to Jupiter being too close or from specific pointings.</p><p>Given the need for short exposures to prevent smearing during flybys, the most common configuration is a clear filter in combination with a filter from the other wheel. For the WAC specifically, the CL1 filter was designed to improve focus when combined with the filters of the second wheel. Sharp focus is difficult to achieve on the WAC with any other combination and renders most two-filter combinations useless ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Porco et al. 2004</ref>). Maximizing the phase coverage of the data results in the bulk of the images being a combination of a clear filter and a common filter that is present on the WAC's second wheel.</p><p>Of the 15 similar filters on the WAC and NAC, only data observed with six of them in combination with a clear filter are considered in this study (the six shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>). We discarded the two methane-band filters (MT), the four IR filters, an IR polarization filter, and a Hydrogen alpha filter.</p><p>These 8 filters do not have sufficient phase coverage for our purposes. We opted to include the VIO filter, despite it not being a common filter, because it does have sufficient phase coverage. Due to the methods by which the data were transmitted to Earth, those images that were compressed in a lossy fashion were also discarded as they are not of photometric quality.</p><p>This selection process results in nearly 10,000 images being selected and downloaded from the  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>. The total number of images and effective wavelengths of the filters use in this study, computed from using the full system transmission function convolved with a solar spectrum, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cassini ISS CALibration (CISSCAL) image reduction</head><p>CISSCAL is the Cassini/ISS image reduction pipeline. CISSCALv3.6 was the latest version at the onset of our study and we followed the steps outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">West et al. (2010)</ref> and the ISS Data User ). The latter case will be denoted as the reflectivity.</p><p>Reduced images still vary in resolution, orientation, and presence or absence of moons and their shadows on Jupiter's disk. A sample of four fully reduced green (GRN) WAC images from crescent to full phase that have been properly derotated, aligned, and cropped is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>. This study only concerns Jupiter's reflected and scattered light and the fully reduced images still require removal of some wayward light sources. These sources can be cosmic rays, background stars, and moonlight. We discuss lost light which has not made it to the detector due to PSF broadening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Additional data processing</head><p>It is also necessary to adjust for the non-equatorial viewing angle increasing Jupiter's disk area.</p><p>The corrections for lost light and cosmic rays are described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">West et al. (2010)</ref>. We chose to forgo the lost light correction partially due to analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">West et al. (2010)</ref>, who note it made less than a 1% difference in the majority of filters. In addition, the PSFs were derived from observations of stars in early flight stages. Due to the method that the PSFs were created, it is suspected that the wings of the extended PSFs are overestimated and require attenuation from their current values.</p><p>Our analysis of the Jupiter images, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">West et al. (2010)</ref> show for Enceladus, gives us confidence that indeed the lost light fraction can be ignored at the 1% level. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F p (λ, α) F ⊙ (λ, α) = N i I F i A J ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where I F is the solar-flux normalized brightness of Jupiter in a given bandpass at a given phase angle, A J is the apparent area of Jupiter in pixels, and the sum runs over all N pixels in an image.</p><p>Note that the phase curve formulation already accounts for Cassini's distance from Jupiter due to how A J is computed. We chose to properly compute A J , instead of removing a distance factor The reflectivity values for the NAC and the WAC are offset from each other in each filter. This is likely due to a contamination event and subsequent de-contamination cycle that occurred between the Jupiter and Saturn encounters that changed the calibration. To derive the normalized phase functions, which make use of both datasets, the NAC reflectivity values are first scaled to the WAC reflectivity values. Then, the combined phase curve is fit by a low order polynomial to approximate a 0 • phase value and normalized to unity. This is easily done for all but the RED filter where there   The phase coverage of NAC images is significantly less than that covered by WAC images, but it does extend coverage into high phase angles. The gap in data in the 20-45 degree phase range, when Cassini was quite close to Jupiter, is caused by the limitations we imposed on Jupiter's apparent size.</p><p>The GRN and RED images from the WAC are quite noisy due to the probable shutter instabilities.</p><p>The other WAC filters and all the NAC filters do not exhibit the same behavior and as a result are much cleaner. However, the VIO images from the WAC show a small bump around 18 • phase, evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref>, which is not corroborated by any other filters. CB2 images appear to be the cleanest and have the best phase coverage.</p><p>We fit the phase functions with a 5th-order polynomial letting all coefficients be free parameters and restricting the function to reach 0 at 180 • phase. We also tried a fit by setting the coefficient of the linear term to zero, which fixes the first-derivative to zero at 0 • phase. The former function yields a better overall fit as the data fall off steeply at low phase angles. Given the phase coverage of the data, the fits break down and are untrustworthy beyond ∼ 130 • due to the lack of data to constrain that region. The table of coefficients of the best fit 5th order polynomial for each filter is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, where x = α/180. We show the coefficients to the third decimal place to ensure that in the range of 0-135 degrees (x =0-0.75), where the fits are trustworthy, the computed curve is within 1% of the machine precision result.</p><p>We opted to use a 5th order polynomial because it minimized the standard deviation of the residuals in each filter (the average standard deviation is 0.003). With increasing order, the average standard deviation is reduced, but individual standard deviations begin to fluctuate. In particular, the lack of constraints in the data for the CB3 filter lead to poorly behaved fits for polynomials greater than 5th</p><p>order. Limitations in the available dataset translate into some poorer quality polynomial fits. The VIO filter has no data past 120 • leading to a poor fit in that region. In addition, the CB3 filter has insufficient mid and high phase angle coverage leading to poor constraints on the fit. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref>, the observed phase curves depart from a purely Lambertian phase function and qualitatively more closely resemble the combined Rayleigh and particle scattering phase functions predicted by models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Greco &amp; Burrows 2015)</ref>. In general the planet is darker at all wavelengths at phase angles below about 90 degrees and brighter than Lambertian at higher phase angles. At phase angles above 45 degrees, the Cassini data generally have a shallower slope than a</p><p>Lambertian phase function. In addition at very low phase angles there is an uncharacteristic steep slope to the phase curve, known as the cusp effect, that has been readily apparent since the first ground-based observations were conducted at the turn of the 20th Century <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Güssow 1929;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guthnick 1920</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guthnick , 1918</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Muller 1893;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Irvine et al. 1968</ref>) and most recently was discussed in Dyudina et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref> as being caused by large cloud particles sharpening the backscattering peak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dyudina et al. (2016)</ref> employ models incorporating Henyey-Greenstein functions to study this effect in detail. The phase function resulting from their modeling is shown in the CB3 panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref> in dark gray.</p><p>We also compared our phase functions with model representations. The first comparison is with the phase function of the 3x solar metallicity Jupiter-like planet at a separation of 5 AU from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref>. This model 2 is computed to provide an approximate "Jupiter-like" albedo spectrum although it is missing the atmospheric photochemistry that would more accurately reproduce the hazes and chromophores that would lower the measured albedo in the blue and UV to match that of Jupiter (see again <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The second comparison is with several phase functions produced through a vector Rayleighscattering treatment by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref>. Rayleigh scattering is the dominant contribution to scattered light in a cloud-free atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Madhusudhan &amp; Burrows 2012</ref>). The models have a range of scattering albedos, ω, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ω = σ scat σ scat + σ abs ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where σ scat and σ abs denotes the single-scattering and absorption cross sections, respectively. For a perfectly Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere, ω = 1. A more absorptive atmosphere can be modeled with smaller values of ω. The scattering albedo is highly dependent on wavelength and atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, and composition. Thus we have selected a sub-sample of the full range of potential ω values for comparison.</p><p>WFIRST will be observing planets which are well separated from their host stars. For edgeon systems, the planet will be observed at phase angles somewhere between 40 and 130 degrees depending on the orientation of the orbit and the limitations of the coronographs inner working angle.

This is not unexpected since these models all assume idealized uniform, scattering atmospheres. In reality, we know Jupiter is more    Given the complexity of Jupiter's true phase curve, we briefly consider another Solar System planet, Venus, which has a well studied atmosphere. Venus is interior to the orbit of the Earth and its orbit has allowed for extensive ground-and space-based monitoring of its brightness through time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mallama et al.

Although WFIRST will not be able to observe Venus-like planets, the next generation of space-based telescopes may well be able to. We note that like Jupiter, Venus' phase curve differs from that of a simple Lambertian and the interpretation of observations of such worlds will likewise require sophisticated modeling such as that CISSCAL during the reduction process.

The Cahoy et al.</p><p>(2010) models show less variation in the Cassini/ISS photometric system than in the JC system and the differences in color between the planets is also smaller. It is possible that the Cassini observations in the JC system would result in Jupiter's color variations being proportionately larger.</p><p>The Cassini/ISS filters were specifically selected to target known features while the JC system was an earlier evolution of a filter set intended for stellar classification. For future direct-imaging missions, the filter set must also evolve to better allow classification of planets. In particular, observations will most often be done at phase angles between 60 and 120 degrees (olive and lighter in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 9</ref>). The variation in this regime ranges from ∼ 0.01 mag to ∼ 0.3 mag. The WFIRST/CGI filters will not be in the JC system, but the filters listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spergel et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a study of Jupiter's reflected light as seen by Cassini/ISS during the millennium flyby in late 2000 to early 2001. We have analyzed the full-disk images of Jupiter from both cameras in six filters spanning the range of wavelengths 400-1000 nm and phases from 0-140 degrees.</p><p>We find that Jupiter's phase function as observed in <ref type="bibr">2000 and 2001</ref> is well reproduced by a 5th-order polynomial whose coefficients are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> for each Cassini/ISS filter. In general, the brightness of Jupiter falls off more steeply near full illumination than previously predicted and is significantly darker than Lambertian near quadrature and somewhat brighter than both a purely</p><p>Rayleigh scattering model and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> prediction at high phase angles.</p><p>We find that Jupiter's color varies substantially with phase angle by as much as ∼ 0.8 mag across all phase angles and as much as ∼ 0.3 mag in the 60-120 degree regime, well beyond that previously predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cahoy et al. 2010)</ref>. Although not demonstrated here, we expect, given the complexity of planetary atmospheres, that such color changes are typical of many types of planets.</p><p>The variability that we observe in Jupiter's color as a function of phase, demonstrates that multibandpass measurements would be required to fully characterize a given planet. The phase dependence likely arises from the relative contributions to the scattered light from clouds and hazes at various altitudes in the atmosphere and carries information about the vertical structure and composition of the atmosphere that could not easily be extracted from a single observation.</p><p>We analyzed only six of the filters on Cassini/ISS and lack of phase coverage prevented the rest from being included in this study. In particular, the methane filters, which lacked the requisite phase coverage to be included in our study, but has been included in others ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dyudina et al. 2016)</ref>, and the</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and Demory et al. (2013)). Recent phase curve observations have indicated that plan- ets have variations in cloud coverage (Webber et al. 2015; Majeau et al. 2012; Demory et al. 2013; Parmentier et al. 2016; Sing et al. 2016) and deviate from the simple Lambertian assumption. In the future, planned space telescopes, such as WFIRST, aim to directly image extrasolar planets in reflected light. The interpretation of such observations will require an understanding of their phase curves (e.g. Cahoy et al. 2010; Greco &amp; Burrows 2015) in order to interpret cloud properties and the abundance of various absorbers (e.g., Nayak et al., submitted).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Future</head><label></label><figDesc>exoplanet missions have prioritized atmospheric characterization via direct-imaging. The Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was identified as the top priority space mission in the 2010 "New Worlds, New Horizons" decadal survey. Its current design (Spergel et al. 2015) features a coronagraph instrument (CGI) with an inner working angle of ∼ 0.1 arcseconds. The CGI will enable WFIRST to directly image the light from exoplanets at moderate phase angles near quadrature. The design features imaging capabilities in visible wavelengths (430-970 nm) with detec- tion limitations reaching unprecedented planet/star contrast ratios (see Figure 2-44 in Spergel et al. 2015).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Jupiter</head><label></label><figDesc>'s apparent size and the position of its moons vary on an image-to-image basis. We required navigation and targeting information for each image. We used SPICE (Spacecraft Planet Instrument Camera matrix Events), a program provided and maintained by JPL and acquired from the PDS Navigation Node. The purpose of SPICE is to track observation geometry and events leading to determining the following: (1) spacecraft location and orientation; (2) target location, shape, and size; (3) events on the spacecraft or the ground that might affect the interpretation of science observations (SPICE overview tutorial 3). SPICE can quickly determine the 3-dimensional position of Jupiter and its moons, and compute the location of moon shadows on Jupiter's disk from any perspective. Visual inspection of the images reveals that we often see Io or its shadow crossing Jupiter's disk. The targeting information shows that one of the Galilean satellites and several smaller moons like Adrastea and Metis are often present (see Io's shadow in Figure 3 in the 90 • phase angle image). SPICE, in combination with the image labels, is able to provide us with the necessary position information to identify moons and their shadows that impact the light the cameras receive from Jupiter. At most their presence could cause a 0.15% difference in the measured flux, (assuming Jupiter is 100% reflective and the moons are 0% reflective). In the spirit of what will be done with WFIRST, we have chosen to make analogous observations by not removing or correcting for the moons and their shadows in the image, since direct-imaging missions will not be able to resolve such details. 2.4. Photometry We briefly discuss how the brightness of Jupiter (relative to the incoming solar flux) in each filter is obtained from the fully-reduced images. To remove leftover background features, such as stellar and lunar sources outside of Jupiter's disk, we first set pixel values that are below a threshold, that is image and filter dependent, to zero. We then determine the location of Jupiter in the image and remove any sources of light that remain outside of Jupiter's disk. What remains is Jupiter's light, some moonlight from moons in front of Jupiter, and the surrounding glow from scattered light. The images are then summed over and normalized by the apparent area of Jupiter to create a phase curve according to</figDesc></figure>

Its apparent shape and area changes from image to image. SPICE is able to compute the location of the apparent limb of Jupiter given Cassini's and Jupiter's 3-dimensional location in space. From this we determine the pixel location of the limb and compute the apparent area A J in each of our images. Each image has a known phase angle and the photometry of all images produces a phase curve. Normalizing the phase curve to unity at zero phase produces a phase function.</figDesc></figure>

noise source found in all ISS data. It applies flatfielding, nonlinearity, and antiblooming corrections 

and accounts for exposure times, quantum efficiency, and uneven bit weighting. The images resulting 

from this process are provided in photon flux units alone or normalized by the solar flux ( I
