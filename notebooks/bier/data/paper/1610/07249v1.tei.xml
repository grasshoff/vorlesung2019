			<abstract>
				<p>The recent detections of two transit events attributed to the super-Earth candidate K2-18b have provided the unprecedented prospect of spectroscopically studying a habitable-zone planet outside the Solar System. Orbiting a nearby M2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b would be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization of a habitable-zone exoplanet using HST and JWST. Here, we report the detection of a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the two transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by a super-Earth in a 33-day orbit and ruling out the alternative scenario of two similarly-sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75-day K2 observation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer occurred 1.85 hours (7 σ) before the predicted transit time. Our joint analysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of the transit is not caused by transit timing variations (TTVs), but the result of an inaccurate K2 ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in the K2 photometry likely caused by a cosmic ray hit. We refit the ephemeris and find that K2-18b would have been lost for future atmospheric characterizations with HST and JWST if we had not secured its ephemeris shortly after the discovery. We caution that immediate follow-up observations as presented here will also be critical in confirming and securing future planets discovered by TESS, in particular if only two transit events are covered by the relatively short 27-day TESS campaigns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Ever since the discovery of the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star, we have made steady progress towards finding habitable zone exoplanets with the eventual goal to characterize their atmospheres and climates in great detail. Results from the Kepler mission, which was the first telescope with the sensitivity to detect small planets in the habitable zones of sun-like stars, indicate that the occurrence rate for habitable Earths ("η ⊕ ") may be as high as 5-20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Silburt et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Farr et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burke et al. 2015</ref>). The majority of these planets found from the Kepler mission, however, are orbiting distant and faint stars, preventing us from measuring their bulk masses or atmospheric compositions through spectroscopy.</p><p>The recent announcement of the super-Earth candidate K2-18b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Montet et al. 2015</ref>) orbiting in the habitable zone of a nearby bright M2.8-dwarf provides the unprecedented opportunity to characterize the first atmosphere of a habitable zone planet outside our solar system. Atmospheric studies of K2-18b are within the reach of currently available instrumentation because the radius of the host star K2-18 is only 0.39 R and the planet's bbenneke@caltech.edu radius of 2.2 R ⊕ allows for the presence of a hydrogenrich, low mean molecular weight gas envelope. Water and methane absorption in such a hydrogen-rich atmosphere could result in transit depth variations that can be revealed through HST, Spitzer, and/or JWST transit observations.</p><p>The two transit events of the planet candidate K2-18b were originally discovered by analyzing the Campaign 1 data from the extended Kepler ("K2 ") mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015</ref>). Modern seeing-limited images and adaptive optics imaging subsequently ruled out background eclipsing binaries as a possible source for the detected transit events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Montet et al. 2015</ref>). Radial velocity measurements further eliminated the possibility that the apparent transit events were caused by non-planetary companions co-moving with K2-18b.</p><p>The K2 photometry, however, could not demonstrate the periodic nature of the transit signal. Instead, the 80-day K2 photometry identified only two transit events of similar depth with a separation of 33-days. Meanwhile, radial velocity confirmation of the 33-day period is currently not available because the host star is faint at visible wavelengths (V = 13.5) and the expected semi-amplitude of a 33-day-period planet would only be K S = 1 − 2 m/s. As a result, the available observations leave open the alternative scenario that the two de-   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.-Plausible scenarios in agreement with the available K2 data of K2-18. The white region indicates the time span observed by K2. The two detected transit events at BJD = 2, 456, 836 and BJD = 2, 456, 869 can be fit equally well by a single planet in a 33-day orbit at low impact parameter (top panel) or two long-period planets at slightly higher impact parameter (bottom panel).</p><p>tected transit events on 2014-June-27 and 2014-July-30 were caused by two similarly-sized, long-period planets ( 50 days) that happen to transit only once within the 80 days observation in K2 Campaign 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). In this two-planet scenario, a planet with a 33-day orbital period and Earth-like incident stellar irradiance (S inc ≈ S ⊕ ) would not exist around the star K2-18. We find that two-planet scenarios can lead to equally good fits to the long-cadence K2 data because the increase in transit duration with orbital period can effectively be compensated by a high impact parameter and/or an eccentric orbit.</p><p>To distinguish between the one and two planet scenario, we obtained Spitzer high precision photometry at 4.5 µm to probe for a third transit event that would only occur if a habitable-zone super-Earth indeed existed in a 33-day orbit around K2-18. A detection of a third transit at the predicted time would prove the periodic nature of the signal. It would simultaneously also rule out potential scenarios in which one or both of the identified transit-like events were the result of residual systematic effects in the corrected K2 photometry. Such scenarios are conceivable because the detected signals are well below the noise floor of the uncorrected K2 photometry and outliers well above the median light curve scatter are common in the corrected K2 photometry despite stateof-the-art detrending (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe the Spitzer and K2 observations used in this work as well as our photometric extraction routines. Section 3 presents the light curves analyses. Finally, we discuss the results and conclusions in Section 4.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-Photometric scatter versus the width of the binning interval for Spitzer data of K2-18b. The root-mean-square error of the systematics-corrected Spitzer data (blue points) follows closely the theoretical square-root scaling for uncorrelated white noise (black line). The left-most data point corresponds to the unbinned 2-second exposures.</p><p>tion began three hours before the start of the predicted transit of K2-18b and ended two hours after the end of the predicted transit to account for transit ephemeris uncertainties and to provide adequate baselines on either side of the transit. An additional 30-minute of preobservation (not used in the analysis) preceded the science observation to mitigate the initial instrument drift in the science observations resulting from telescope temperature changes after slewing from the preceding target ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grillmair et al. 2012</ref>). Both pre-observation and science observations were taken using Spitzer/IRAC Channel 2 in stare mode. To enhance the accuracy in positioning the target star K2-18 on the IRAC detector, the pre-observations were taken in peak-up mode using the Pointing Calibration and Reference Sensor (PCRS) as a positional reference.</p><p>We chose Spitzer/IRAC Channel 2 (4.5 µm) because the instrumental systematic due to intra-pixel sensitivity variations are smaller for Channel 2 than for Channel 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ingalls et al. 2012</ref>). Our exposure times were set to 2 seconds to optimize the integration efficiency while comfortably remaining in the linear regime of the IRAC detector. Subarray mode was used to reduce the readout overhead and lower the data volume for the downlink. In total, our science data are composed of 13,632 individual frames forming a 7.6-hour broadband photometric time series of K2-18 at 4.5 µm.</p><p>We extract multiple photometric light curves from the science data using a wide range of fixed and variable aperture sizes. The purpose of extracting and comparing multiple photometric light curves is to choose the aperture that provides the lowest residual scatter and red-noise component. For each aperture, our extraction includes estimating and subtracting the sky background, calculating the flux-weighted centroid position of the star on the array, and then calculating the total flux within circular apertures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Knutson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lewis et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Todorov et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kammer et al. 2015</ref>). For the fixed apertures we consider radii between 2.0 and 5.0 pixels. For the time varying apertures, we first calculate the scaling of the noise pixel parameter β = ( n I n ) 2 /( n I 2 n ), where I n is the measured intensity in the n-th pixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mighell 2005)</ref>, and then iteratively rescale the noise pixel aperture radius as r = a √ β + c, where we explore values between 0.6 and 1.2 for the scaling factors a and values between 0.6 and 1.2 for the constant c. We choose this range for a and c because we noted in previous Spitzer work that the photometric scatter increases outside this range ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kammer et al. 2015</ref>). Finally, we pick the version of the Spitzer photometry with the lowest red-noise component. Our rednoise measure is the summed square difference between the noise scaling obtained by successively doubling the bin size and the theoretical square-root noise scaling for a Poisson process <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). In our case, the version of the photometry with the lowest red-noise also results in the lowest RMS.</p><p>Our analysis is performed on the entire 7.6-hour science data since there is no evidence for a residual ramp effect at the beginning of the science data. We normalize the light curve by the median value and bin the data to 60-second cadence. We find that moderate binning to 60 seconds does not affect the information content of the photometry, but provides more signal per data point allowing an improved correction of the systematics (Section 3). We calculate BJD UTC mid-exposure times using the information in the header of the BCD files provided by the Spitzer pipeline. We show the resulting uncorrected light curve for the fixed aperture with a radius of 3.0 pixels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> (bottom panel).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">K2 Photometry</head><p>The star K2-18 was observed by the Kepler Space Telescope as part of K2 Campaign 1 covering an 80-day time span between November 14, 2014 and February 3, 2015. We extract the K2 photometry directly from the Kepler pixel data downloaded from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). The star is listed as EPIC-201912552. The full data set is a time series composed of 3737 individual 16x16 pixel images centered on the star K2-18. The individual images have a cadence of 29.4 minutes and were obtained by co-adding 270 exposures (each 6.02 seconds plus 0.52 seconds readout) onboard the Kepler spacecraft ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gilliland et al. 2010</ref>). We do not do any additional time binning during the photometric extraction and light curve analysis of the K2 data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Photometric Extraction</head><p>Our photometric extraction routine is outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Crossfield et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Petigura et al. (2015)</ref>, following the approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref>. In brief, during the continuous 80-day K2 observations, the stars drift across the CCD by approximately 1 pixel every 6 hours due to the spacecraft's pointing jitter. As the stars drift through pixel-phase, intra-pixel sensitivity variations and errors in the flatfield cause the apparent brightness of the target star to change. We detrend the apparent brightness variations of our target using the telescope roll angle between the target frame and an arbitrary reference observation. For each of the two transits, we then extract transit light curves ranging from three hours before the transit ingress to three hours after ingress, providing sufficient baseline for the transit light curve analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">A Cosmic Ray Detection Algorithm for K2 Photometry</head><p>As shown in this work, cosmic ray hits can substantially affect the astrophysical results derived from K2 photometry. This is particular troubling because the effects of cosmic ray hits are generally too small to result in obvious outliers in the long-cadence, 30-minute K2 photometry. As a result, cosmic ray hits have stayed unnoticed to date, and at least for K2-18b have resulted in inaccurate estimates of the transit parameters. To address this issue and detect cosmic ray hits in the K2 photometry, we introduce a generally applicable algorithm to efficiently identify cosmic ray hits in the presence of substantial telescope jitter as we see for K2.</p><p>We apply the algorithm to the K2-18 data as follows. First, we remove the sky background from each individual frame by subtracting the median pixel value outside the PSF of the target star. For each backgroundsubtracted frame in the K2 image series, we then find <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.-Cosmic ray detection for K2 photometry. Panel (a) shows the background subtracted image of K2-18b for the observation affected by a cosmic-ray hit (red data point in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). Panel (c) shows the same frame after subtracting the "most similar frame" in the K2 time series of K2-18b (Panel (b)). The cosmic hit is clearly identified in the difference image near x=4.5 and y=5.5. For comparison, Panel (d) shows an equivalent difference image for an observation not affected by a cosmic ray hit. Small residuals remain near the center of the PSF, but are not mistaken as cosmic ray hits by our new cosmic ray detection algorithm (Section 2.2.2) a "most similar frame" by identifying the frame in the K2 image series that minimizes the weighted sum of the square differences in x and y centroid location and telescope roll angle. This most similar frame will generally appear virtually identical to the original frame because the PSF falls virtually identical on the detector pixels. The most similar frame can, therefore, be used to subtract the target star from the image and isolate potential cosmic ray hits. Finally. we automatically identify cosmic ray hits by searching for &gt; 10σ outliers in the time series of each pixel in the difference images.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(a) (b) (d) (c)</formula><p>As an example, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the detection of the cosmic ray hit near the ingress of the second K2 transit observation of K2-18b. Panel (a) shows the background subtracted image of K2-18b for the cosmic-ray affected observation near the ingress of the second transit. For comparison, panel (b) shows the frame in the K2-18 data with the most similar centroid position (BJD=2456875.66). Panels (a) and (b) appear virtually identical despite the strong color stretching. The cosmic ray hit near x=4.5 and y=5.5 becomes apparent, however, in the difference image (Panel (c)). The five pixels near the cosmic ray hit are identified as outliers with a significance of &gt; 20σ in the difference image light curves for these pixels. For comparison, Panel (d) shows the difference image for a regular frame without cosmic ray hit. Small residuals (∼ 1%) in the difference image remain due to slight differences in the centroid position and shape of the PSF. However, the residuals are not mistaken as cosmic ray hits because the pixel values are within the variances of the difference image light curves for those pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Stellar Spectroscopy</head><p>We observed K2-18 using the near-infrared crossdispersed spectrograph (SpeX) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to independently verify its metallicity ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>), effective temperature (T eff, * ), radius (R * ), mass (M * ), and luminosity (L * ). Following the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Crossfield et al. (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Petigura et al. (2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schlieder et al.

In short, we observed K2-18 using the short cross-dispersed mode and 0.3x15" slit providing simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.68 to 2.5 µm at a resolution of R = 2000 (Fig- The spectra are normalize to the continuum in each band.

The difference between a multiplicative factor and a additive term is generally small because S (t i ) is near unity and the multiplication can be approximated by 1 + . However, the inaccuracy due to the negligence of the cross-term δf · δS can be as high as 0.01 · 0.005 = 50 parts-per-million for 1% transit depth and typical sensitivity variations.

Using our newly developed cosmic ray detection algorithm we find that the outlier is caused by a cosmic ray hit near the edge of the target star's PSF on the detector <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>. After removal of the outlier point, we find that a Keplerian orbit with periodic transit events provide a good joint fit to the K2 and Spitzer transit light curves <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The Spitzer Space Telescope observations presented in this work confirm the presence of the habitable zone super-Earth K2-18b by detecting a third transit event with a consistent transit depth near the predicted transit time. The revealed periodicity of the transit signal demonstrates that the two transit-like events observed by K2 are indeed caused by one planet in a 33-day orbit and are not two independent events caused by two similarly-sized planets in &gt;50-day orbits. The periodic-ity also rules out any scenarios in which one or both of the identified transit-like events were the result of residual systematic effects in the corrected K2 photometry. The photometric confirmation of K2-18b is critical for future atmospheric studies because K2-18b is an extremely favorable habitable-zone exoplanet for transmission spectroscopy with HST and JWST.</p><p>We also find, however, that the third transit event occurred 1.85 hours (7−σ) before the predicted transit time based on the K2 -derived ephemeris by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Montet et al. (2015)</ref>. Our global analysis of the K2 and Spitzer data reveals that this 1.85-hour deviation is, however, not caused by TTVs from another planets in the system, but is well-explained by a single, previously undetected cosmic ray hit in the K2 photometry near the ingress of the second transit.</p><p>Our analysis of K2-18b critically reveals that transit ephemerides of long-period planets based on only two detected transit events can strongly be affected by individual outlier data points in the K2 photometry. A single outlier due to a cosmic ray hit near the ingress of the second transit biased the ephemeris of K2-18b to a level that future transit observations could have missed the transit of K2-18b completely. The deviation in the transit ephemeris would have grown to 8 hours by the time JWST launches <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 10)</ref>. As a result, the first transiting habitable-zone planet amenable to efficient atmospheric characterization would have been lost for future spectroscopic transit observations with HST or JWST due to the increasing error in its ephemeris estimate. We conclude that immediate follow-up of prime exoplanet candidates are critical for long-period planets found by planet search missions such as K2 and TESS.</p><p>Similarly, the previously undetected outlier in the K2 photometry introduced substantial uncertainty in the inference of the planet-to-star radius ratio. After identifying the cosmic ray hit and removing the outlier we estimate the planet-to-star radius ratio to R P /R * = 5.295% +0.061% −0.059% . If we ignore our knowledge about the cosmic ray hit and include the outlier data point in our analysis of the K2 light curve, we find the radius ratio uncertainty to be 9 times larger consistent with 5.13% +0.56%</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>−0.35%</head><p>as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015)</ref>. In this latter case, the wide and asymmetric uncertainties arise because the outlier data point adversely affects the overall fit to the low-cadence K2 photometry. We present an efficient search algorithm to identify cosmic ray hits in photometry data sets with substantial telescope pointing jitter to avoid similar problems in future K2 or TESS light curve analyses.</p><p>In the coming years, mass measurement of K2-18b will be critical to provide an understanding of the nature and bulk composition of K2-18b. Radial velocity measurements are challenging, however, because the host stars is faint at visible wavelengths (V = 13.5) and the expected radial velocity semi-amplitude is small (K P = 1 − 2 m/s). Still, thanks to the star's brightness in the near-IR (K = 8.9), K2-18b may present an ideal target for intensive follow-up with a number of upcoming NIR radial velocity instrument such as CARMENES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Quirrenbach et al. 2012</ref>), SPIRou ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artigau et al. 2014</ref>), <ref type="bibr">IRD (Tamura et al. 2012</ref>), and CRIRES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kaeufl et al. 2004</ref>). In addition, upcoming visible-light radial velocity instruments on large telescopes like VLT/ESPRESSO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pepe et al. 2014</ref>), Keck/SHREK, and GMT/G-CLEF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szentgyorgyi et al. 2012</ref>) should also be able to measure planetary mass of K2-18b in the coming years.</p><p>The infrared brightness and small stellar radius of the host star make K2-18b an extremely favorable candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization of a habitable-zone super-Earth. Given its radius of 2.27R ⊕ , the planet is likely surrounded by a thick gaseous envelope (e.g., Rogers 2015) that could be amenable to characterization through transit spectroscopy. Eventually the detectability of the K2-18b's atmosphere will depend on the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere and presence of high-altitude clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Miller-Ricci et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benneke &amp; Seager 2013)</ref>. In addition, the range of plausible atmospheric scenarios for K2-18b also depends on the yet unknown planetary mass and surface gravity. Little is known about the nature of planets in the habitable zone around M stars, making K2-18b a unique opportunity to probe chemical composition and formation history with future follow-up observations. The K2 and Spitzer analyses presented in this work were performed using ExoFit, a newly-developed, Python-based light curve analysis framework. The new framework is highly modular in that it can jointly fit any number of Kepler, Spitzer, HST WFC3, and/or HST STIS transit observations in a global MCMC analysis with minimum user input. In this work, the joint analysis of Spitzer and K2 data provides substantial advantage over individual transit fits because the high cadence Spitzer observations provide exquisite constraints on thetransit duration that helps fitting the low-cadence K2 data. For the analysis of the Spitzer observations, we introduce two modifications to the pixel-leveldecorrelation (PLD) approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deming et al. (2015)</ref>. We find that these changes can provide substantial advantages in the convergence and uncertainty estimation. With the modifications, the posterior distribution of all PLD weights in our analyses converge to Gaussian-shaped posteriors that are uncorrelated with the astrophysical parameters, providing confidence that the derived transit light curve parameters are independent of the instrument parameters. Critically, our corrected Spitzer light curve is virtually free of residual red noise or systematics. The photometric precision of our final Spitzer light curve is near the Poisson limit.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
