			<abstract>
				<p>Recognizing whether a planet can support life is a primary goal of future exoplanet spectral characterization missions, but past research on habitability assessment has largely ignored the vastly different conditions that have existed in our planet&apos;s long habitable history. This study presents simulations of a habitable yet dramatically different phase of Earth&apos;s history, when the atmosphere contained a Titan-like, organic-rich haze. Prior work has claimed a haze-rich Archean Earth (3.8-2.5 billion years ago) would be frozen due to the haze&apos;s cooling effects. However, no previous studies have self-consistently taken into account climate, photochemistry, and fractal hazes. Here, we demonstrate using coupled climate-photochemical-microphysical simulations that hazes can cool the planet&apos;s surface by about 20 K, but habitable conditions with liquid surface water could be maintained with a relatively thick haze layer (τ~5 at 200 nm) even with the fainter young sun. We find that optically thicker hazes are self-limiting due to their self-shielding properties, preventing catastrophic cooling of the planet. Hazes may even enhance planetary habitability through UV shielding, reducing surface UV flux by about 97% compared to a haze-free planet, and potentially allowing survival of land-based organisms 2.6-2.7 billion years ago. The broad UV absorption signature produced by this haze may be visible across interstellar distances, allowing characterization of similar hazy exoplanets. The haze in Archean Earth&apos;s atmosphere was strongly dependent on biologically-produced ! 3! methane, and we propose that hydrocarbon haze may be a novel type of spectral biosignature on planets with substantial levels of CO 2. Hazy Archean Earth is the most alien world for which we have geochemical constraints on environmental conditions, providing a useful analog for similar habitable, anoxic exoplanets.</p>

This hydrocarbon haze, generated by methane (CH 4 ) photolysis, would have formed when the ratio of CH 4 to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere exceeded about 0.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Trainer et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Unlike the hazes that may exist around exoplanets with thick hydrogendominated atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>), the Archean (3.8-2.5 billion years ago) haze was likely biologicallymediated via CH 4 produced from methanogenesis, one of the earliest metabolisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Woese &amp; Fox 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ueno et al. 2006</ref>). In addition, several abiotic processes including serpentinization (the hydration of ultramafic rocks, mainly olivine and pyroxenes) can form methane ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kelley et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Guzmán-Marmolejo et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Etiope &amp; Sherwood Lollar 2013)</ref>, but the biotic flux of methane to the Archean atmosphere was likely much higher than the abiotic flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kharecha et al. 2005</ref>), as it is on Earth today. While the climatic effects of this haze have been studied (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Pavlov et al. 2001b</ref>), impacts of haze on Archean Earth's habitability</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">! 5!</formula><p>have not been previously investigated using tightly coupled climatephotochemical models. This coupling is critical to consider because of potential feedbacks between the impact of temperature on haze formation and the effects of haze on the atmosphere's temperature structure. Additionally, although we anticipate planetary diversity in the exoplanet population, existing spectral studies are largely focused on the observables of modern day Earth (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Sagan et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Woolf et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Robinson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Robinson et al. 2014a</ref>).

The geochemical evidence, described below, implies Neoarchean hazy intervals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zerkle et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Izon et al. 2015</ref>) ! 6! lasting for less than 1 million years. The constraint on the duration of these intervals based on the lower limit of shale sedimentation rates. In addition, the modeling work of  suggests a longer Meosarchean to Neoarchean hazy period between 3.2 and 2.7 Ga.</p><p>Here, we present an overview of the evidence for the Archean haze. The line of evidence most often invoked comes from analyses and modeling of sulfur isotope fractionation data from Earth's rock record. Several studies have proposed links between haze and the mass independent sulfur isotope fractionation signal (S-MIF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Farquhar et al. 2000</ref>) preserved in the geologic record before the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) at about 2.5 billion years ago (Ga) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zerkle et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kurzweil et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Claire et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Izon et al. 2015</ref>). We present a brief review of this evidence here, beginning with an overview of sulfur mass-independent fractionation, on which much of the evidence for an Archean haze is based.</p><p>Sulfur has four stable isotopes: 32 S, 33 S, 34 S and 36 S. Isotope fractionations are reported in part per thousand (‰) using delta notation (δ) such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">! ! ! = ! ! !"#$%&amp; ! ! !"#$%#&amp;% − 1 ×10 ! ‰ !(1)</formula><p>Here, x R sample represents isotope ratios of the given minor to major isotope (for sulfur, x R means x S/ 32 S with x = 33, 34, 36) of sampled material. x R standard ! 7! represents isotope ratios of a standard reference material.</p><p>Reactions following classical equilibrium or kinetic behaviors produce isotope fractionation that depend only on the mass differences of the isotopes such that the δ 33 S composition of a material is approximately half the δ 34 S amount, and the δ 36 S composition is roughly twice the δ 34 S amount. For elements with more than two stable isotopes, mass dependent fractionation (MDF) quantifies this expected three-isotope relationship, and samples following MDF will have δ 33 S ~ 0.515×δ 34 S and δ 36 S ~ 1.89×δ 36 S.</p><p>Mass-independent fractionation (MIF) occurs when samples deviate from this expected three isotope behavior and is quantified with 'capital delta' notation where Δ 33 S = δ 33 S -0.515×δ 34 S and Δ 36 S = δ 36 S -1.89×δ 36 S. MIF in naturally occurring samples is very unusual and is generally diagnostic of quantum chemistry such as can occur in certain atmospheric reactions. While the precise mechanism(s) that produce S-MIF are unknown, photolysis of sulfur gases in an anoxic atmosphere is the only known mechanism that produces large magnitude Δ 33 S and Δ 36 S seen in the rock record <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Farquhar et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Farquhar et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The S-MIF signal is variable throughout the Archean and it vanishes completely once O 2 builds up to nonnegligible levels in the atmosphere after the great oxygenation event (GOE) at 2.5 Ga. Its recurrence at both ends of the ! 8! Archean Eon implies that, within 0.8 billion years of Earth's formation, a common mechanism for S-MIF production was already established in the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Thomassot et al. 2015</ref>). After the GOE, O 2 and the ozone (O 3 ) derived from O 2 photochemical reactions block the UV photons necessary to photolyze sulfur gases and produce S-MIF. Also, S 8 is the most important species to rain out S-MIF from the atmosphere; because a more reducing atmosphere enhances the ability of S 8 to polymerize, S-MIF is more easily preserved under reducing conditions ( <ref type="bibr">Zahnle et al. 2006</ref>). After the GOE, all the sulfur in the atmosphere would have been oxidized into a single exit channel, eliminating any fractionation created in the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Pavlov &amp; Kasting 2002</ref>). Thus, S-MIF is generally regarded as robust evidence for an anoxic Archean atmosphere.</p><p>Δ 33 S typically correlates with enrichments in δ 34 S and with depletions in δ 36 S, and variations in magnitude and sign of these isotopic signals in Earth's geologic record hint that strong constraints on Archean atmospheric chemistry will be possible when the precise MIF formation mechanisms are identified ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Claire et al. 2014</ref>). Δ 36 S/Δ 33 S in Archean sedimentary rocks is generally around -1, but stratigraphic variations in this slope have been observed in the geological record and interpreted as evidence of changes to the S-MIF production mechanism resulting from changes in atmospheric composition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zerkle et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kurzweil et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Izon et al. 2015</ref>), suggesting the influence of haze. potential links between S-MIF, hazes, and Archean glaciation. At ~2.9 Ga, there is geological evidence suggesting a glaciation event ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Young et al. 1998</ref>) may have occurred during the same period when the S-MIF Δ 33 S signal dips to lower</p><p>values. An upper atmosphere haze that decreased tropospheric SO 2 photolysis by blocking UV photons and cooled the planet could explain both the glaciation and the decrease in S-MIF. In this conceptual model, the end of the cold period typified by low Δ 33 S may be due to a decrease in the atmospheric CH 4 /CO 2 ratio, which would have cleared any haze present in the atmosphere. If true, this change in atmospheric composition and radiative scattering would have enabled UV photons to penetrate deeper into the atmosphere, interacting with sulfurous gases and affecting their isotopic signatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Claire et al. 2014</ref>). Earth's record of sedimentary sulfates do show a significant change in their minor sulfate isotope behavior between 2.73 and 2.71 Ga ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kurzweil et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Izon et al. 2015</ref>) that may in fact reflect this change, although predictive models of sulfur isotope fractionation are not yet able to reproduce these trends seen in the rock record ). Ga collected from the Ghaap Group in South Africa and showed that variations of ! 10! Δ 36 S/Δ 33 S associated with changes in atmospheric chemistry were contemporaneous with highly negative excursions of δ 13 C org values. Negative values of δ 13 C org below -37 ‰ are typically interpreted as evidence for methanogenesis (biological methane production) followed by subsequent incorporation into sediments by methanotrophy (methane consumption) which imparts a strongly negative δ 13 C org because organisms preferentially uptake the 12 C <ref type="bibr">(Urey &amp; Greiff 1935;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schopf 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schidlowski 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eigenbrode &amp; Freeman 2006</ref>). The contemporaneous excursions of the sulfur and C org isotopes suggests a close linkage between S-MIF signals and biogenic methane. The links between S-MIF signals and biogenic methane production have been recently expanded over multiple cores and locations, suggesting multiple changes in atmospheric chemistry during the Neoarchean ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Izon et al. 2015</ref>). Changes observed in the slope of Δ 36 S/Δ 33 S vary between -1.5 and -0.9 and are interpreted to reflect changes in the S-MIF source reactions driven by varying atmospheric haze thicknesses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kurzweil et al. (2013)</ref> note that an increase in magnitude of S-MIF signals after 2.73 Ga ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Thomazo et al. 2009</ref>) occurred during a prolonged negative shift in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Coupled Photochemical-Climate Model</head><p>Our coupled photochemical-climate model, Atmos, is used to simulate Archean Earth's photochemistry and climate. To use Atmos, the photochemical model (which includes particle microphysics) is run first to generate an initial atmospheric state based on user-specified boundary conditions (gas mixing ratios or fluxes, the solar constant at 2.7 Ga ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Claire et al. 2012</ref>), the stellar spectral type, total atmospheric pressure, the initial temperature-pressure profile). Then, the output files from the photochemical model for altitude, pressure, gas mixing ratios, haze particle sizes and haze number densities are passed into the climate model. The climate model uses the photochemical model's solution as its initial conditions and runs until it reaches a converged state. It then feeds updated temperature and water vapor profiles back into the photochemical model. The models iterate back and forth in this manner until convergence is reached. An example of Atmos finding convergence can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>

Our model atmosphere is divided into 200 plane-parallel layers from the surface to 100 km, with a layer spacing of 0.5 km. We show a list of chemical reactions in our Supplementary <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref>. Our Archean scheme includes 76 chemical species, 11 of which are short-lived <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Supplementary table 2</ref>). Short-lived species are considered in ! 14! photochemical equilibrium (i.e. their atmospheric transport is neglected) and are not part of the Jacobian solved self-consistently at each timestep. The mixing ratio of each species is found by solving flux and mass continuity equations in each layer simultaneously using a reverse-Euler method, providing exact solutions at steady-state. Vertical transport by molecular and eddy diffusion are included, and boundary conditions which drive the model can be set for each species at the surface and the top of the atmosphere. A δ 2-stream method is used for radiative transfer ( <ref type="bibr">Toon et al. 1989</ref>). Fixed isoprofiles are assumed for CO 2 and N 2 in the atmospheres considered here.</p><p>Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zerkle et al. (2012)</ref>, we set a fixed mixing ratio of CH 4 at the surface; the model then calculates the surface flux necessary to maintain this mixing ratio. Since haze formation scales with the CH 4 /CO 2 ratio, we find this is the most straightforward way to explore haze thicknesses in our atmospheres.</p><p>Note that when we discuss CH 4 /CO 2 values in this study, these refer to the ratio at the planetary surface because CH 4 does not follow an isoprofile.</p><p>Aerosol formation follows the method used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kasting et al.

Particles larger than this size are treated as fractal agglomerates of n mon spherical monomers of radius R mon that clump into a larger aggregate with an effective geometric radius R f given by the relation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">! !"# = !! ! ! ! !"# ! ! (2) ! 16!</formula><p>Here, α represents a dimensionless constant of order unity, and D f is the "fractal dimension," which can take on values between 1 and 3. D f = 3 represents a spherical (non-fractal or classical Mie) particle, while D f = 1 represents a string of linearly chained monomers. Titan's fractal aggregates are thought to have a fractal dimension of about 2 on average for the aerosol population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Rannou et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Larson et al. 2015</ref>). Note that the "effective geometric radius" we refer to above is used only to conceptualize the size of a fractal particle and does not indicate that we use Mie scattering for our fractal particles; with the exception of sub-monomer sized particles (R &lt; 0.05 μm) which remain spherical and thus Mie, we use the mean field approximation for fractal scattering physics for all particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Botet et al. 1997</ref>). The model's fractal production methods are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zerkle et al. (2012)</ref> (including its supplementary online information) where they were first implemented. Additional information about fractal particles and their geometry can be found in, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Köylü et al. (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Brasil et al. (1999)</ref>. The mean field approximation we use for fractal scattering has been validated against scattering by silica fractal aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Botet et al. 1997</ref>) and Titan's hazes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Rannou et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Larson et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>As in <ref type="bibr">Wolf and Toon (2010)</ref>, the fractal dimension of our particles varies from 1.5 to 2.4 for aggregate particles, and larger aggregates have a larger fractal dimension to account for folding as the particles coagulate. In general, compared to spherical particles, fractal particles produce more extinction in the ultraviolet ! 17! (UV) but less in the visible and near infrared (NIR). In addition, fractals tend to be more forward scattering in the visible and NIR and more isotropically scattering in the UV compared to equal mass spherical particles. Their weakened visible extinction and enhanced forward scattering compared to spherical particles means they produce less cooling since they scatter less incident sunlight back to space (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> in Wolf and Toon 2010). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 2</ref> shows the extinction efficiency (Q ext ) and single-scattering albedo of different fractal particle sizes together with the haze optical constants we adopt in this study ( <ref type="bibr">Khare et al. 1984a</ref>). A discussion of our choice of optical constants and comparison to others in the literature can be found in section 4.5.</p><p>In the version of the photochemical model used here, we corrected an error relating to the calculation of the number of C 5 H 4 molecules composing HCAER2</p><p>haze particles. Previously, the model calculated the number of molecules per HCAER2 particle inappropriately using the mass of C 4 H 2 instead of C 5 H 4 . In addition, we added more particle sizes to the model's scattering grid, increasing the number from 34 particle sizes to 51, and we added options to use different monomer sizes and optical constants than the ones used here for our nominal haze study; how variation of these parameters impact haze formation is a subject of future work. Gas mixing ratios at the surface can be more finely tuned than in previous versions of the model from the addition of a significant figure to the species boundary conditions input file.</p></div>

The net absorbed solar radiation in each layer of the atmosphere is computed using a δ2-stream multiple scattering algorithm ( <ref type="bibr">Toon et al. 1989)</ref> spanning from λ = 0.2 to 4.5 μm in 38 spectral intervals. For net outgoing IR radiation, we use a separate set of correlated-k coefficients for each gas in 55 spectral intervals spanning wavenumbers of 0 -15,000 cm -1 .</p><p>We have made several modifications to the climate model used here. The model previously incorporated the spectral effects of spherical hydrocarbon particles, and it has been updated in our study to include fractal hydrocarbon scattering efficiencies using the mean field approximation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Botet et al. (1997)</ref> discussed previously. We have also updated the model so that haze profiles can be passed to it from an input file or by the photochemical code; in previous versions of the climate model, haze distributions were hardcoded and had to be edited manually. We corrected a discrepancy in the spacing between atmospheric layers in the routine that outputs coupling files for the photochemical model: our photochemical model layer spacing is 0.5 km, but a layer spacing of 1 km had been hardcoded. Coupling subroutines have been improved to be able to accept information about atmospheric pressure, stellar parameters, and haze parameters as input from the photochemical model. We also added options to turn ethane opacity and 1D ice-albedo feedbacks (described in section 4.1.1) on or off.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20!</head><p>We have been unable to run the climate model to convergence using the same top-of-atmosphere pressure used for the photochemical model: the photochemical model extends to 100 km, but we have only been able to successfully run the climate model up to about 80 km for our 1 bar atmospheres. Thus, when temperature and water profiles are passed from the climate model to the photochemical model, they become isoprofiles above the top of the climate grid based on the highest altitude temperature from the climate grid calculations. At these altitudes the atmosphere is thin, and the particles are very small; both of these effects lead to this portion of the atmosphere having little impact on radiative transfer and climate. We performed a sensitivity test of how the temperature at these altitudes affects the resultant haze distribution in the photochemical model, and the sizes of the largest haze particles produced by an atmosphere that becomes an 80 K isotherm above 80 km versus a 150 K isotherm differ by less than 5%. In the climate model, shifting the particles in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> above 80 km down to lower altitudes alters the surface temperature by &lt; 0.5 K.</p><p>The climate model is considered converged when the change in temperature between timesteps and change in flux out the top of the atmosphere are sufficiently small (typically on the order of 1×10 -5 ).</p></div>

The particle mode sizes we use span from 0.001 μm -2 μm; larger particles do not exist in our atmospheres due to rainout. Spherical modes are R= 0.001 μm, 0.005 μm, 0.01 μm, and 0.05 μm. Fractal modes are R = 0.06 -2 μm with 4 modes between 0.06 and 0.1, 10 equally spaced modes between 0.1 μm and 1 μm, and 2 μm. In total, this represents 19 particle modes.</p><p>In each layer of the SMART cloud files, we include a mixture of two particle modes; the mass density contributed by the two modes is selected based on the distance in log space of the Atmos particle radius to each neighboring SMART size bin. For example, if Atmos produces a particle of radius 0.33 μm in a layer, the corresponding layer in SMART will include 0.3 μm and 0.4 μm particles each comprising 50% of the layer's mass. This binning is necessary because the photochemical model generates many dozens of finely differentiated haze particle radii, but SMART model runtime with this many particle sizes is infeasible.</p><p>Once we have binned the Atmos particle radii to our SMART size grid, we must compute the total optical depth from each particle mode at a reference wavelength in each atmospheric layer.

On the other hand, hazes can also act as cloud condensation nuclei, enhancing cloud formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hasenkopf et al. 2011</ref>).

To test the impact of clouds in addition to haze on the spectra of Earth-like planets, we added water clouds to the Case B atmospheres shown in  <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>. In contrast to hydrocarbon haze particles, which are more transparent in the near infrared compared to shorter wavelengths, water vapor clouds have an approximately gray opacity from the visible into the near infrared. Thus, at longer wavelengths, cloudy worlds are brighter than their haze-only counterparts. <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 4</ref> shows the total integrated brightness of the reflectance spectra for the worlds with clouds divided by their cloud-free counterparts between 0.4-1 μm and between 1-2 μm to quantify the spectral impact of clouds.</p><p>The disproportionate increase in brightness from clouds at longer wavelength compared to shorter wavelengths means that the peak of the reflectance spectrum also shifts towards longer wavelengths for the worlds with clouds: for CH 4 /CO 2 = 0.17, the reflectance spectrum peak shifts from 0.31 μm to 0.38 μm, and for CH 4 /CO 2 = 0.21, it shifts from 0.56 μm to 0.68 μm. Adding clouds also raises the spectral continuum level, making absorption features appear deeper. This enhanced reflectivity also potentially increases the detectability of water vapor in reflected light spectra, as more reflected flux from the planet reduces noise on the continuum, enhancing the detectability of absorption features that deviate from that continuum.

As water vapor is at very low abundance in the Earth's stratosphere, it would be difficult, in general, to see it in transmission observations that can only probe down to stratospheric altitudes.

Although the fractal hazes simulated here cool the planet by up to ~20 K, these fractal particles produce significantly less cooling than a haze of equivalent mass spherical particles. The      The top panels present the extinction efficiency (Qext) and singlescattering albedo (= Qscat/Qext) of four sizes of fractal hydrocarbon particles used in this study and in <ref type="bibr">Wolf &amp; Toon (2010)</ref>. The spherical monomers comprising these particles are 0.05 μm in radius. The radii on the plot correspond to the radii of equivalent mass spherical particles, and the fractal dimensions of these particles, from smallest to largest, are 3 (spherical), 1.51, 2.28, and 2.40.</p><p>The number of monomers in these particles are one, eight, 1000, and 8000. These particles tend to scatter and absorb light more efficiently at shorter wavelengths, Also shown are the profiles for the haze particle number density (in pale orange).</p><p>The CH 4 /CO 2 = 0.1 haze profile is divided by 1000 and the CH 4 /CO 2 = 0.2 haze profile is divided by 1×10 5 in order to plot it on the same axis as the gases. The profiles in the right panel show larger amounts of CH 4 , H 2 O and C 2 H 6 above 60 km in altitude, and illustrate how haze-induced shielding can prevent photolysis of these gases. The sharp decrease in haze particle number density between 60 and 70 km in the right panel shows where fractal coagulation occurs. The Note that the temperature profiles become isothermal at the top of the climate model grid when transferred to the larger photochemical model grid.      1. <ref type="bibr">Zabarnick et al., 1989)</ref> 2.

SMART has been validated against observations of multiple solar system planets (Robinson et al. 2011; Arney et al. 2014). The Line-by-Line Absorption Coefficients (LBLABC) code, a companion to SMART, creates line- by-line absorption files for input gas mixing ratios and temperature-pressure profiles using HITRAN 2012 line lists (Rothman et al. 2013). SMART can also incorporate aerosols: as input, it requires "cloud files" with altitude-dependent opacities as well as the particle asymmetry parameter and the extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies (Q ext , Q scat , and Q abs ). For spherical particles (our small monomers), we use the code "Miescat," to calculate these efficiencies using the indices of refraction measured by Khare et al. (1984a). For fractal hydrocarbon particles, we use scattering inputs from the Wolf and Toon (2010) photochemical study generated with the fractal mean field approximation (Botet et al. 1997). Spherical particles use a full Mie phase function, while fractal particles employ a Henyey-Greenstein phase function (Henyey &amp; Greenstein 1941). To generate transit transmission spectra, we use the SMART-T model (Misra et al. 2014a; Misra et al. 2014b). This version of SMART uses the same inputs as the standard code but simulates the longer path lengths and refraction effects associated with transit transmission observations. ! 22!</figDesc></figure>

Tolbert hazes were Titan-analog simulants lacking the CO 2 present in the Trainer et al. experiments. We apply a Manabe/Wetherald relative humidity model for the troposphere (Manabe &amp; Wetherald 1967) with a surface relative humidity of 0.8 in both the climate and photochemistry models. This humidity parameterization is further described in Pavlov et al. (2000). Our Archean simulations use the solar constant at 2.7 Ga (0.81 = S/S 0 , where S 0 is the modern solar constant and S is the solar constant at 2.7 Ga) modified by a wavelength-dependent solar evolution correction (Claire et al. 2012). We chose this time because it corresponds to the age of the constraints on CO 2 used by our study (Driese et al. 2011). We set the mixing ratio of O 2 at the surface to 1.0x10 -8 , consistent with the Zerkle et al. (2012) study. These conditions reflect the time period after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis but prior to Earth's GOE in which substantial biogenic fluxes of both oxygen and methane would have vented into a predominantly reducing atmosphere (Claire et al. 2014). Unless otherwise specified, the surface albedo used by the climate model is 0.32. This includes the effect of clouds, which is standard in this 1D treatment (Kopparapu et al. 2013) and is the albedo that reproduces the average temperature of present day Earth (288 K) with modern atmospheric conditions. Of course, the true cloud distribution on Archean Earth is unknown, and clouds may have had important climatic effects on our early planet (Goldblatt &amp; Zahnle 2011). The solar zenith angles (SZA) used in the climate and photochemical models were chosen to best represent globally ! 25! averaged behavior of the physics in each specific model, which Segura et al. (2003) finds as SZA = 45° in the photochemical model and SZA = 60° in the climate model. These zenith angles are both tuned to reproduce modern day Earth's average chemical profiles and climate, respectively. For our SMART spectral simulations, our nominal spectra assume an ocean surface albedo (McLinden et al. 1997). In cases where an icy surface is used, we use an albedo from the USGS Digital Spectral Library (Clark et al. 2007). Our solar spectrum was modeled by Chance &amp; Kurucz (2010), and was scaled by the solar evolution model (Claire et al. 2012) mentioned previously. The solar zenith</figDesc></figure>

Previous 1D climate modeling efforts assumed that planets with globally averaged surface temperatures (T GAT , which is equivalent to our 1D surface temperature, T surf ) below 273 K will experience runaway glaciation (e.g. Haqq-Misra et al. 2008; Domagal-Goldman et al. 2008). However, more recent 3D studies have shown that Archean Earth can maintain an open ocean fraction of &gt; 50% for T GAT &gt;= 260 K and an equatorial open ocean belt for T GAT &gt;= 248 K (Wolf &amp; Toon 2013; Charnay et al. 2013). Furthermore, Abbot et al. (2011) argue that ocean open belts can remain climatologically stable, even if the ice latitude is reduced to 5-15°. Since a planet with any non-zero fraction of open ocean is habitable, we regard these updated globally-averaged temperatures -all of which are significantly below freezing -to be more realistic habitability thresholds than 273 K. We adopt T GAT &gt;= 248 K as our habitability threshold here.</figDesc></figure>

Our predicted spectra of hazy Archean Earth show diagnostic absorption features from H 2 O, CO 2 , CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , CO, and from the haze itself. These features are labeled in figure 8, and another way to show where these gases and the haze absorb is presented in Figures 9 and 10 for reflectance and transit transmission spectra, respectively. Figures 9 and 10 were produced by systematically removing each gas or the haze; in places where a given species absorbs, the original spectrum differs from those with the absorbers removed. To consider the spectral effect of haze without contamination from other atmospheric aerosols, the spectra in this section do not include water clouds, even though cloud albedo is implicit in the parameterization of the Atmos model's surface albedo. This makes the albedos of the planets whose spectra are shown in this section darker than those in the Atmos parameterization. However, since clouds have a major impact on the planet's spectral appearance and albedo (e.g. Kitzmann et al. 2011b), we show spectra with water clouds included in section 3.3.1. The best way to treat the climatic and spectral impact of both clouds and haze would be in a fully-coupled 3D climate-photochemical model that fully considers radiative and photochemical effects of cloud and haze particles, but this is outside the scope of this work. To our knowledge, such a 3D model does not yet exist, but its development would be useful for the comprehensive treatment of this problem. ! 35! In reflected light (Figure 8, panel a), the broad UV absorption feature reddens the color of the planet by masking the short-wavelength reflectivity due to Rayleigh scattering. See the bottom section of Figure 8 for the estimated color of the planet to the eye. The planet colors were calculated using the "Spectral Color Spreadsheet" from brucelindbloom.com with the same method used in Charnay et al. (2015) for GJ 1214b. A spectrum can be input to the calculator, which then outputs RGB values. While these colors should be understood as approximations, we tested the colors produced for the modern Earth sky and Titan as a check, and the results appeared reasonable. Colors and photometric bands have been considered as indicators of Earth-like worlds (Traub 2003; Crow et al. 2011; Krissansen-Totton et al. 2016), but hazy Archean Earth suggests that not all Earth-like planets will be pale blue dots. Because methane-producing metabolisms evolved early and Earth's atmosphere was anoxic for about a billion years after the origin of life, pale orange dots may proliferate in the galaxy if other habitable worlds evolve on similar paths to Earth. Several spectral features are apparent in Figure 8. The haze-mediated stratospheric thermal inversion is clearly seen in thermal emission near 8 μm and 16 μm (Figure 8, panel b). Similar to the Titan transmission spectrum derived from Cassini solar occultation measurements (Robinson et al. 2014b), our simulated hazy transit transmission spectra (Figure 8, panel c) are sloped in the visible and NIR.

On the other hand, if organisms remained protected by some other UV shield such as minerals, layers of overlying microbial mat, or water (Cockell 1998), changes in UV radiation levels should not affect them as strongly, so the colder conditions created by the haze might have been the larger source of stress on organisms. These stressors might have driven evolutionary adaptations as life responded to its changing environment. Note that photosynthetic organisms would not likely have been photon limited by the lower light levels under the haze: the lower light limit for red algae is 6x10 15 photons/m 2 /s (Littler et al. 1986). Under our Case B CH 4 /CO 2 = 0.21 haze, total PAR at the surface is 7.1x10 20 photons/m 2 /s, orders of magnitude above this extreme. Laboratory experiments on organic haze formation have shown that haze- formation chemistry can involve the formation of important prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and nucleotide bases (Khare et al. 1986; McDonald et al. ! 41! 1994; DeWitt et al. 2009; Hörst et al. 2012; Trainer 2013) -see also our discussion of haze formation pathways in section 4.4. Although the hazy periods we invoke here occurred hundreds of millions of years after the origin of life on Earth, there may be earlier hazy epochs not yet discovered in the geological record (see Kasting (2005) for a discussion of earlier atmospheric methane), and hazy Titan has been regarded as a type of prebiotic chemical laboratory (Khare et al. 1984b; Clarke &amp; Ferris 1997).</figDesc></figure>

Based on their calculations, Guzmán-Marmolejo et al. (2013) suggest that an atmospheric CH 4 concentration greater than 10 ppmv is suggestive of life. At the range of pCO 2 allowed by Driese et al. (2011), we find that the CH 4 flux needed to initiate haze formation ranges between about 1-3x10 11 molecules/cm 2 /s, broadly consistent with estimates ! 42! for the biological Archean methane flux after the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis (Kharecha et al. 2005; Claire et al. 2014). The higher of the plausible rocky planet abiotic CH 4 fluxes from Guzmán-Marmolejo et al., 1.3x10 9 molecules/cm 2 /s, will not form a haze in our model even at a pCO 2 level four orders of magnitude smaller than the lower limit allowed by Driese et al. (2011), and such a world would be completely frozen given the Archean solar constant. Remote identification of a hydrocarbon haze with a concurrent measurement of CO 2 around a planet that absorbs an Earth-like amount of radiation could therefore imply a surface methane flux consistent with biological production.

From the chemical analysis of primary condensed-phase products of photochemistry, it is clear that the composition of the aerosol analogs formed in early Earth-like atmospheres with C/O &lt; 1 differs greatly from the aerosol analogs formed in Titan-like atmospheres where C/O &gt;&gt; 1. Instead of limiting the formation of organic molecules as initially predicted, the O-atoms released from CO 2 photolysis are incorporated into the molecular structure of the organic aerosols. Mass spectrometry of aerosol analogs formed with C/O = 0.1 indicates the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups rather than aromatic cycles and long-</figDesc></figure>

These compositional differences should change the properties of the aerosol material sufficiently to be able to distinguish a hazy early Earth from a ! 49! modern-day Titan (Hasenkopf et al. 2010). For instance, organic molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, carbonyls) tend to have stronger absorbances at longer UV wavelengths as compared to similar hydrocarbon molecules (Workman 2000). The NIR absorption bands of the Archean aerosol analogs would also shift in response to the inclusion of the types of oxygen and nitrogen heteroatom functionalities that have been indicated in the compositional studies.</figDesc></figure>

Haze can cut down the surface-incident UVC radiation on Archean Earth from ~0.9 W/m 2 to ~0.03 W/m 2 for a solar zenith angle of 60°, and may have allowed survival of otherwise unshielded life at the surface of our Archean planet. The presence of similar hydrocarbon haze on an exoplanet could be observed, as demonstrated by strong features present in synthetic spectra of these worlds. For habitable exoplanets similar to Archean Earth, hydrocarbon haze may be strongly biologically mediated, and serve as a novel non-gaseous biosignature with a strong spectral signature. Discovering habitable exoplanets dissimilar to modern Earth will increase the diversity of known habitable environments. Leveraging ! 54! our understanding of Earth's history provides us with a variety of analogs with which we can expand our expectations for the "Earth-like" planets beyond our Solar System; future observations of such worlds can provide us with a window into the evolution of terrestrial worlds like our home. ! 55!

inconsistent with the results of Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011), which showed 

much greater C 2 H 6 accumulation on planets orbiting low-mass stars compared to 

worlds orbiting the sun. However, the CH 4 levels in the Domagal-Goldman et al. 

solar simulations were an order of magnitude lower than the ones shown here. 

C 2 H 6 is a greenhouse gas, and its ability to warm in a CH 4 -and haze-rich

Finally, haze formation chemistry gets considerably more complex when 

one considers the coexistence not only of O-heteroatoms but also of N-

heteroatoms in aerosol organics. Nitrogen incorporation was recently observed in 

the aerosols generated by far-UV photolysis of CH 4 /CO 2 /N 2 gas mixtures (Trainer 

2013) and in CH 4 /N 2 mixtures (Sebree et al. 2015). These results bring to light a 

significant but still unknown mechanism regarding the activation of nitrogen and 

its inclusion in oxygenated organics, thus providing a new and quantifiable source 

for these two elements into the early Earth aerosols. Studies have shown the 

formation of HCN, CH 3 CN and other nitrile gas species are formed using the 

same type of UV source in a CH 4 /N 2 gas mixture, thus corroborating the indirect 

nitrogen photochemistry (Trainer et al. 2012; Yoon et al. 2014). These results 

suggest that N 2 chemical activation could be due to its reaction with the 

methylidyne (CH) radical formed from CH 4 photolysis, to form two radical 

intermediates, diazomethyl HCNN and its isomer HNCN, which might then react 

to form HCN and other products.
