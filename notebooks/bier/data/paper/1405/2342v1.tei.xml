			<abstract>
				<p>We describe the long-term evolution of compact systems of terrestrial planets, using a set of simulations that match the statistical properties of the observed exoplanet distribution. The evolution is driven by tidal dissipation in the planetary interiors, but the systems evolve as a whole due to secular gravitational interactions. We find that, for Earth-like dissipation levels, planetary orbits can be circularised out to periods ∼ 100 days, an order of magnitude larger than is possible for single planets. The resulting distribution of eccentricities is a qualitative match to that inferred from transit timing variations, with a minority of non-zero eccentricities maintained by particular secular configurations. The coupling of the tidal and secular processes enhance the inward migration of the innermost planets in these systems, and can drive them to short orbital periods. Resonant interactions of both the mean motion and secular variety are observed, although the interactions are not strong enough to drive systemic instability in most cases. However, we demonstrate that these systems can easily be driven unstable if coupled to giant planets on longer period orbits.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The evolution of planetary systems takes place over a wide range of timescales. Current theories regarding how planets form suggest that the first hundred million years of a star's life is a time of great activity. Giant planets form within a few million years and can then potentially migrate large distances, or interact gravitationally and scatter onto highly eccentric orbits, leading to possibly tidal capture by the parent star or, in the opposite extreme, ejection from the system entirely (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wu &amp; Murray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ida &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Naoz et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bromley &amp; Kenyon 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miguel, Guilera &amp; Brunini 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nagasawa &amp; Ida 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kley &amp; Nelson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mordasini et al. 2012</ref> for a representative but incomplete sampling of opinions on this wide ranging subject). The formation of planets of lower mass is generally held to be more sedate, whether it be by a form of communal migration or in situ assembly <ref type="bibr">(Raymond, Barnes &amp; Mandell 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ida &amp; Lin 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ogihara, Duncan &amp; Ida 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hansen &amp; Murray 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Raymond et al. 2013</ref>). Nevertheless, studies in our own solar system indicate that even these nominally sedate planetary orbits ⋆ E-mail:hansen@astro.ucla.edu comprise a chaotic dynamical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Laskar 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sussman &amp; Wisdom 1992;</ref>, and that some of the terrestrial planets may ultimately prove to be dynamically unstable (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Batygin &amp; Laughlin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laskar &amp; Gastineau 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The theme of dynamical stability in planetary systems is therefore of broad interest, and has already attracted significant attention. The discovery of compact, densely packed planetary systems in recent years has only heightened the interest and presents several issues regarding the nature of the planets themselves, and whether the currently observed configurations are sculpted by the original formation or by dynamical processes on longer timescales. Furthermore, many planets have been discovered close to their parent stars, so that tidal dissipation is expected to rapidly damp eccentricities.</p><p>Our goal in this work is to study the long-term evolution of low-mass, compact, multiple planet systems, under the influence of tidal dissipation, while also accounting for the secular gravitational coupling between the planets. This has been a subject of some interest for gas giant planets, which are often found in strongly hierarchical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wu &amp; Goldreich 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams &amp; Laughlin 2006a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mardling 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Batygin, Bodenheimer &amp; Laughlin 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Correia et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg &amp; van Laerhoven 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang, Hamilton &amp; Mat- sumura 2013)</ref>. We wish to extend it to the realm of lower mass planetary systems recently discovered by both radial velocity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howard et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>) and transiting methods ( <ref type="bibr">Borucki et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). In order to do this, we need to address the issue of large multiplicity and the stronger tidal dissipation anticipated for terrestrial class planets. In § 2 we will describe the initial configurations of the planets under study and our model for tidal dissipation is given in § 3. § 4 then examines the effects of this combination for the long-term structure of these planetary systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SECULAR ARCHITECTURES</head><p>The methods used to uncover low mass planetary systems are subject to systematic errors and selection effects that limit the completeness with which we can characterise the multiplicity of these planetary systems. This is especially true for modelling transiting systems, in which only a fraction of the planets may be on transiting orbits at any given time. As a result, many authors have adopted statistical comparisons with the data to evaluate issues such as compactness, inclination dispersion, and multiplicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lissauer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fang &amp; Margot 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tremaine &amp; Dong 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The secular behaviour of a planetary system is determined by the distribution of mass amongst all of its constituent planets, making an accounting for unobserved components particular important and therefore requiring the adoption of a specific planetary model. In a previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hansen &amp; Murray 2013)</ref>, we have performed simulations of the in situ assembly of rocky planetary systems and demonstrated that the resulting period and inclination distributions provide a reasonable comparison to the statistical properties of the transiting systems observed by Kepler. Thus, we will use these systems as the initial conditions for our calculations. The end point of each assembly simulation provides a full description of the masses and semi-major axes of the planets, which will determine the architectures, as well as snapshots of the eccentricities, inclinations and associated nodal and periastron longitudes, which will determine the initial conditions. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides an example of such a system -seven planets within 1 AU, with masses of a few Earth masses each, orbiting a central star of 1M⊙.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the secular configurations that result from these simulations are not specific to an in situ assembly scenario, as any origins model that produces similar masses and spacings will have a similar secular behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Secular Modes</head><p>The recent interest in secular evolution of planetary systems has seen the development of a variety of reformulations of the secular planetary problem (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Veras &amp; Armitage 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Laskar, Boue' &amp; Correia 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Mardling 2013</ref>). These have been largely driven by the observed giant planet systems and have thus been tailored to treatments of higher eccentricities or the hierarchical nature of the observed giant planet systems. The configurations of interest in this paper are closely packed systems of low mass planets, with mostly low-tomoderate eccentricities and inclinations. As such, their secular interactions are mostly well described within the context of the classical Laplace-Lagrange secular perturbation theory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Murray &amp; Dermott 1999</ref>), although the compact nature of the systems does require the addition of a term to treat the relativistic precession of close planetary orbits (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams &amp; Laughlin 2006b</ref>). The high multiplicity of the systems under discussion also leads to a non-negligible frequency of near-commensurabilities amongst the orbital periods of the modelled systems, which does require the addition of another element to the classical theory. To that end, we have incorporated the secular effects of perturbations due to proximity of neighbouring pairs to the first order 3:2 and 2:1 resonances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Malhotra et al. 1989)</ref>, as this can be smoothly incorporated into the traditional secular eigenvalue problem. The same cannot be done for higher order resonances, but these are also of higher order in the (low) eccentricities and mass ratios considered here and are thus assumed to be negligible.</p><p>Thus, our analysis of the secular interactions of a particular planetary system is based on the solution to the eigenvalue problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Aijxj = g xi (1)</formula><p>where the matrix elements Aij are a combination of the classical secular perturbations and the secular averages of the near resonant perturbations, given in appendix A, and g is the resulting eigenvalue. The planetary systems we consider can have as many as 10 planets within 1 AU of the host star, which renders analytic treatments of the eigenvalue problem prohibitive. As such, we determine the eigenvalues numerically. We use standard numerical methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Press et al. 1992</ref>) to reduce each matrix to Hessenberg form and then solve for the eigenvalues. We also determine the eigenfunctions by solving the resulting linear system for each eigenvalue. Convergence was aided by starting with an initial guess of small amplitude and solving iteratively. This procedure yields numerical solutions of the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the systems under consideration. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the resulting eigenvalues for an ensemble of 20 model planetary systems orbiting a 1M⊙ star, as a function of the orbital period of the dominant planet in each corresponding eigenfunction. We see that the characteristic periods of oscillation for the secular modes span the range 10 3 -10 5 years, with a general trend that longer periods are found for modes dominated by more distant planets. Interestingly, the secular modes of various observed giant planet systems studied in Adams &amp; Laughlin (2006b) also span a similar period range. This commonality of timescales is dictated by the wider spacing of the more massive systems, to be expected from general considerations of long-term dynamical stability.</p><p>The resulting eigenfunctions also demonstrate the degree to which these multiple planet systems are strongly coupled. If we define two planets as coupled if they both contribute more than 10% of the amplitude of a given eigenvector, then we can characterise which planets of a given system are coupled together by the secular modes of oscillation. Only 44% of the multiple planet systems here are fully coupled, in the sense that one can construct a chain of di- <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Initial Conditions for a Sample System.

The points show the eigenfrequencies of the model systems before tidal evolution, plotted against the orbital period of the dominant planet in the corresponding eigenfunction.

In the other cases, the secular modes break down into two (on rare occasions, three) groups which are only marginally coupled in the sense that none of the inner planets contribute more than 10% of the amplitude to any eigenvector dominated by the outer planets, and vice versa. The division usually occurs between 0.25-0.45 AU, corresponding to orbital periods from 45-110 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EVOLUTION UNDER THE ACTION OF TIDES</head><p>The consequence of tidal dissipation in extrasolar planets is to remove energy from the orbit, but not angular momentum. For a single planet, this means circularisation of the orbit, accompanied by the amount of orbital decay necessary to conserve angular momentum. When the planet with tides is in a multiplanet system, the secular modes of the system can exchange angular momentum and so the tidal evolution of the planet is now coupled to the secular oscillations of the system as a whole. The long term effect of this coupling is to damp the amplitudes of particular eigenmodes at different rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wu &amp; Goldreich 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mardling 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Batygin, Bodenheimer &amp; Laughlin 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg &amp; van Laerhoven 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhang, Hamilton &amp; Matsumura 2013)</ref>. For systems of small multiplicity, this can often result in a late-time configuration which is dominated by a single mode, characterised by apsidal alignment of the planetary orbits, and characteristic ratios of orbital eccentricities -the socalled 'fixed point' evolution. The planetary systems under discussion here are richer than the two or three planet systems usually discussed in this context to date. One question of interest then is how many of the modes of these high multiplicity systems are damped, and how is this reflected in the planetary orbits?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tidal Dissipation Calibration</head><p>To answer such questions, we also require a physical model for the tidal dissipation if we want to examine the evolution of a model system. We have previously calibrated the strength of tidal interactions in giant extrasolar planets (Hansen 2010) but cannot realistically apply the same normalisation to the possibly very different interior structure of the rocky planets assumed to be produced in these simulations. Nevertheless, we can adopt the same formalism as long as we use a different astrophysical normalisation. The traditional normalisation of Earth-like planets is using the secular acceleration of the Moon, and expressed in terms of the "modified tidal quality factor" Q ′ . This reflects the number of forcing periods required to dissipate the tidal potential energy, and is estimated for the Earth to be Q ′ ⊕ ∼ 10 ( <ref type="bibr">Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966)</ref>. If we express the tidal Q ′ factor in terms of the bulk dissipation σ⊕ using the same formalism as in Hansen (2010), we derive that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ⊕ ∼ 3.2 × 10 10 Q ′ ⊕ 10 −1 σJ</formula><p>where σJ is the bulk dissipation constant we previously derived for giant planets. Thus, the dissipation per unit mass in rocky bodies is considerably larger than in gaseous planets. Renormalising the tidal evolution equations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eggleton et al. (1998)</ref>  This latter expression serves as the effective eccentricity damping rate 1/τ for each planet in our discussion of § 3.2, below. Furthermore, we shall assume rocky planets, and therefore adopt a mass-radius relation for Perovskite, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Seager et al. (2007)</ref>. The planetary eccentricities oscillate due to the secular interactions, so the tidal evolution is calculated by averaging the quantity e 2 over the secular eccentricity oscillation for each planet. Given the unknown nature of the dissipation in extrasolar terrestrial planets, the Earths estimated Q ′ ⊕ = 10 is a convenient, but very uncertain, benchmark. The physical origin of Earths tides is held to be some combination of dissipation in the boundary layers of marginal seas (e.g. Jeffreys 1921) and dissipation due to pelagic turbulence (generated by topographic features) from ocean floors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bell 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Egbert &amp; Ray 2000)</ref>. Dry planets are likely to have Q ′ an order of magnitude larger, as has been estimated for Mars, based on the orbit of Phobos ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lainey et al. 2007</ref>). On the other hand, the presence of substantial Hydrogen envelopes on many observed extrasolar rocky planets may enable the propagation of gravity waves and so enhance the dissipation that results from the conversion of barotropic flows into baroclinic waves by topographic features (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bell 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balmforth, Ierley &amp; Young 2002)</ref>, especially if hotter planets exhibit greater mantle plasticity (see discussion in Henning, O <ref type="bibr">'Connell &amp; Sasselov 2009)</ref>.</p><p>As such, we will use the above dissipation as our benchmark and consider variations by an order of magnitude in either direction in § 4.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Numerical Implementation</head><p>To incorporate tidal effects into the secular evolution, we adopt an approach similar to that of <ref type="bibr">Greenberg &amp; van Laer- hoven (2011)</ref>, with the generalisation that we include an arbitrary number of planets and allow for tidal dissipation in all planets simultaneously. The inclusion of the eccentricity damping for each planet means that each diagonal term Ajj in the secular matrix acquires an additional imaginary contribution i/τj , where τj is the eccentricity damping timescale for planet j, calculated from equations (3). The inclusion of such a term in the secular equations introduces an imaginary contribution to the eigenvalues (1). We therefore solve the complex N×N matrix as a real 2N×2N matrix, which yields the oscillation frequencies in the real part of the solution and the mode damping rates in the imaginary part. We evaluate the resulting eigenvectors using the real part of the eigenvalues only, because the resulting matrices are close to singular (by virtue of the small values of the imaginary part). In effect, the real part of our solution yields the instantaneous secular eigenmodes at each timestep and the imaginary parts drive a slow evolution.</p><p>The secular solution is then stepped forward by a timestep ∆t. The default value is ∆t = 1 Myr, subject to the condition that this be larger than the largest period of oscillation of the eigenmode spectrum (which is always the case here, see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) and substantially smaller than the characteristic tidal dissipation time (also ubiquitously satisfied). The evolution of the secular solution is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">hi(t + ∆t) = hi(t) + N j=1 Eij e −γ j ∆t sin (gj∆t + βj )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and similarly for the ki. In the above, Eij represent the amplitudes of the individual eigenmode contributions to hi, γj is the damping rate of mode j calculated from the eigenvalue solution, and βj are the phase offsets for mode j. Damping of the eccentricity must also be accompanied by evolution in the semi-major axis (by angular momentum conservation), and the resulting change of the semi-major axis is calculated using the tidal evolution equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>. The evaluation of the expressions in equations <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> require an integration over the secular oscillations in eccentricity, which we take as &lt; e 2 i &gt;=&lt; h 2 i + k 2 i &gt;, and which is evaluated using the equation (4).</p><p>As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg &amp; van Laerhoven (2011)</ref>, the evolution in semi-major axis results in a small shift in the properties of the secular solution on top of the eccentricity damping. Thus, after each timestep, the new orbital configuration and eccentricities are used as initial conditions to solve the eigenvalue problem again for the (slightly) changed eigenvalue and eigenmodes, thereby updating the Eij and βj in response to the change in semi-major axis, and for calculating a new set of damping rates gj.</p><p>As a demonstration of the method, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> compares our evolution with the analytic solution (equations 22) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg &amp; van Laerhoven (2011)</ref> for the two planet system CoRoT-7b. For this case, we adopt a simpler tidal dissipation (no scaling with semi-major axis or mass) than that used above, because we wish to approximate the analytic solution more accurately. Similarly, we neglect the nearresonant terms (which are negligible in this case anyway). In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the solid line shows our numerical evaluation, while the dotted line shows the analytic solution. The character of the evolution is well matched, although there are small deviations at late times due to the fact that the analytic solution does not account for changes in the secular architecture beyond the first derivative in the initial conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Resonant Crossings</head><p>Tidal evolution can result in the decrease of the semi-major axis for one or more of the planets, with a consequent evolution in period ratios between neighbouring planets. This can result in the tidally-induced crossing of resonances, which will lead to divergences in the near-resonant contributions to the secular perturbations given in appendix A.</p><p>Resonant interaction can be an exceedingly complex phenomenon, but our particular application is simplified in part by the fact that the tidal evolution leads to the divergence of orbits, which means that pairs of planets are not captured into resonance. Furthermore, in the limit of low eccentricities, the tidal evolution through such resonances is rapid <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Batygin &amp; Morbidelli 2013</ref>, hereafter LW12 and BM13). Thus, we shall adopt the fol- <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The solid lines are the tidal evolution for our simple model of the CoRoT-7b system as modelled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg &amp; van Laerhoven (2011)</ref>. The dotted lines are the solutions derived from numerically evolving their equations <ref type="formula">(22)</ref>. The actual value of τ is arbitrary, and the two solutions have been scaled so that they match at the upper left. Deviations at late times are likely the result of the fact that our model accounts for the evolution in semi-major axis beyond accounting for the Taylor expansion at early times.</p><p>lowing approximation, applicable for the diverging orbits we encounter here.</p><p>When the period ratio of a pair of orbits comes within ǫ of a 2:1 or 3:2 commensurability from below, we assume that the semi-major axes instantaneously shift so as to move the pair to a period ratio that is ǫ above the commensurability, while assuming that total angular momentum is conserved and individual eccentricities are conserved. This transformation results in a relationship between a1 (the semi-major axis of the inner planet before encounter) and a ′ 1 (the value after encounter), that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a ′ 1 a1 =   m1 1 − e 2 1 + m2 (2 − ǫ)(1 − e 2 2 ) m1 1 − e 2 1 + m2 (2 + ǫ)(1 − e 2 2 )   2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>for the case of the 2:1 commensurability, and correspondingly for others. The proximity to resonance ǫ where this occurs is chosen to be the larger of the two libration amplitudes calculated for the circular restricted problem with a test particle and either an inner or outer massive perturber (see Murray &amp; Dermott 1999 for a detailed discussion of the latter case). These are also given in the appendix A for the cases of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances.</p><p>We have compared our results to direct numerical integrations of sample systems, using the Mercury integrator (Chambers 1999). The tidal force is implemented using the radial force expression of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hut (1981)</ref>. The slow rate of tidal evolution makes numerical integration with realistic dissipation impractical so we integrate with a tidal dissipation rate that is artificially high by a factor of 150, i.e. an effective Q ′ = 0.07 and compare to our secular model with a similarly high dissipation rate. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the evolution of two planet pairs (the inner pairs of 6 and 7 planet systems respectively) that pass through the 2:1 resonance. The black points show the full numerical integration and the red curves represent the model evolution. The evolution prior to resonance crossing is well captured by our model. In the left hand panel, we see that the system crosses the resonance very rapidly, displaying the form of evolution termed 'resonant repulsion' by LW12 and the model reproduces the rapid transition. However, we note that not all systems follow this evolution, and this is shown in the right hand panel. Although diverging orbits are not subject to long term resonant capture, some can get delayed in resonance for a finite period of time. This occurs when the splitting between the different resonant terms in a given commensurability is larger than their individual widths. This violates the assumption of zero free eccentricity adopted by LW12/BM13. We have opted to not complicate our simple model further to capture this dynamics because the capture is transient and does not significantly influence the long term evolution. This can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, which shows the corresponding evolution of the eccentricities in these two cases. Once again, we see that the long term character of the evolution is well represented, although there are deviations during the resonance passage. These results give us confidence that our evolutionary model captures the long-term secular behaviour of the systems, although they suggest timescales could be uncertain at the level ∼ 10 8 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>We have used the results (after 10 Myr of evolution) of 50 model realisations of the 20M⊕ rocky planet systems from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray (2013)</ref> to define the initial state of our systems. We assume all the planets are of terrestrial class, in the sense that they obey the tidal dissipation outlined in § 3, and evolve them for 10 Gyr according to our model for tidal+secular evolution.</p><p>The generic consequence of our model is that the inner planet of the system experiences, by far, the largest inward migration. Furthermore, the continuous excitation of eccentricity due to secular perturbations sustains the tidal dissipation for longer than it would for a single planet, and consequently drives them in further than would otherwise be the case. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5</ref> shows the evolution for the system in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, which demonstrates this. Such behaviour was anticipated by previous studies, although we do not find sufficient migration to threaten the survival of any of our model planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mardling &amp; Lin 2004</ref>), because the masses involved are too low to excite eccentricities to the required level.</p><p>Another way to view this evolution is to consider the evolution of the amplitudes of the various eigenmodes of the system. By virtue of the interaction between the planets in the system, the tidal damping systematically reduces the amplitude of the eigenmodes, as determined by the relative contribution each receives from those planets being affected most strongly by the tides <ref type="bibr">(Wu &amp; Goldreich 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Green- berg &amp; van Laerhoven 2011</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 6</ref> shows the evolution <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The two panels show the passage of planet pairs from two different simulations through the 2:1 resonance. In each case the black points represent a direct numerical integration and the red points represent our secular evolution model.

The secular architecture of this system is such that it is best characterised as containing subgroups of eigenmodes, which damp on similar timescales. The fastest damping mode is dominated by planet 2, with significant contributions from 1 and 3, and decays with 1 Gyr. The two next fastest decay on a timescale ∼ 2 Gyr, while all but one are substantially damped on timescales ∼ 10Gyr. The equivalent evolution in the planetary rms eccentricity is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 7</ref>, with the closest planets having the lowest final eccentricities. Note also that the various curves cross during the first several Gyr when individual planets are affected by multiple modes, but settle into scaled versions of each other at late times. This is what is expected for a system which has been tidally damped to the point where only a single mode of oscillation remains excited. The lower panel also demonstrates this evolution by showing the apsidal alignment of the neighbouring planet pairs. After 10 10 years, all the apsidal angles are aligned.</p><p>When we review the evolution of the full ensemble of 50 systems, we see a variety of behaviours. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8</ref> shows the evolution of the eigenfrequencies and eigenvector amplitudes for an evolution of the most common type. It shows the generic behaviour in which the eigenfrequencies, most notably the highest values, drift to slightly lower values due to the inward shift of the inner planet semi-major axis. The evolution of the eigenmodes once again demonstrates the tendency for our multiple planet systems to partially decouple -the two eigenmodes with significant contributions <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. In each panel, the black and green points represents the eccentricities of the inner and outer planet respectively, as determined by direct numerical integration. The plotted results represent a running boxcar average over 10 5 years, to remove the fluctuations from higher frequency terms. The red and blue curves indicate the corresponding eccentricities as determined by our secular evolution model. We see that the general character of the evolution is well captured as the period ratio evolves. The fact that the deviations are larger for the outer planet in each case suggests that additional unmodelled perturbations from other planets in the system are not entirely negligible.</p><p>from the innermost planet damp down to almost zero on Gyr timescales, while the two eigenmodes dominated by the outer planets in this four-planet system evolve much more slowly. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the evolution of a system that is a minority, but not uncommon, occurrence (∼ 30% of the time). This shows two eigenvalues starting to approach each other but then abruptly flattening out, which reflects a situation in which the inner planet is initially coupled to multiple modes of oscillation but effectively decouples entirely from all but one of the modes as it shifts inwards due to tidal evolution. When this occurs, the secular pumping of the eccentricity becomes negligible, the orbit circularizes and the system is now driven by the weaker tidal evolution of the second closest planet (hence the flattening of the curves). The reason for the increase in the second largest eigenfrequency is that this is the mode dominated by the inner planet, and which is increasingly dominated by the relativistic precession as it moves inwards.</p><p>The effects of the decoupling is also shown to dramatic effect in the mode amplitudes. The loss of secular eccentricity pumping leads to a rapid decrease in the amplitude of the mode that has become dominated by the inner planet. The decoupling also leads to a change in slope of the evolution of the remaining modes of non-zero amplitude. These modes do not completely stop evolving because the action of tides on the innermost coupled planet (which is now the second closest to the star) continues to operate.   The curves can be identified with individual planets by noting that, at late times, the eccentricities increase monotonically with distance from the star, so only the inner (1) and outer (7) planets are explicitly identified. The lower panel indicates the evolution of the orbital alignment between neighbouring planets. The coloured points correspond to the average offsets in longitude of periastron for each planet, relative to the planet exterior to it. The average is taken in steps of 0.01 Gyr, which leads to some coarseness for those planets affected by multiple modes. Colours are black (1-2), red (2-3), magenta (3-4), cyan (4-5), green (5-6) and blue (6-7). Somewhat surprisingly, it is the innermost pair that takes the longest to come into alignment. This is a consequence of the fact that the innermost planet, although the most affected by tides, is also strongly coupled to three other planets. In particular, the coupling to planet 4 takes several Gyr to damp away. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows that even more dramatic behaviour occurs occasionally in which this evolution actually leads to a secular resonance crossing. This system shows the same characteristic behaviour as in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, in which two eigenfrequencies approach each other. However, in this instance, the approach is not resolved by the decoupling of one planet from the others, and the system undergoes an avoided crossing. This leads to a rearrangement of the eigenfunctions and a consequent change in the slope of the evolution. Similar phenomena have been discussed before in the context of our solar system, where evolution of the protosolar nebula and the giant planet system can sweep eigenfrequencies through the inner solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ward 1981)</ref>. In our case, the phenomenon appears to be associated with systems in which a given mode strongly couples two planets that are widely seperated. In the example shown here, the eigenmode in question couples the inner planet (at 0.0594 AU initially) with the fifth planet (at 0.4595 AU). The resonance crossing effectively destroys this coupling, so that the mode becomes dominated by the inner planet, which explains the more rapid evolution at late times. It is also worth noting that, in this case, the entire system of planets represents a  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The upper panel shows the evolution of the eigenvalues in a six planet system where the inner planet becomes largely decoupled from the rest of the system at about 2 Gyr. The decoupling of the inner planet leads to the dramatic drop in amplitude for the corresponding mode, shown in the lower panel, because the eccentricity is no longer excited by secular interactions. There is also a corresponding change in slope for the evolution of the remaining modes, which are no longer coupled to that planet. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. The upper panel shows the evolution of four of the eigenvalues for a six planet system in which the planets are strongly coupled across the entire system (the largest and smallest frequencies are largely unaffected and off the top and bottom of this plot respectively). We see the effect of a secular resonance at ∼ 8 Gyr, which causes a rearrangement of the eigenfunctions and changes the rate of evolution of the eigenmode amplitudes in the bottom panel. In particular, the observed 'knee' is the result of the decoupling of the inner planet from an outer planet, which causes that mode to decay more rapidly. strongly coupled system, since all six eigenmodes lose substantial amplitude during the course of the evolution. Indeed, at late times, this entire system exhibits the anticipated fixed point behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mean Motion Resonances</head><p>A superficially even more dramatic behaviour is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, in which the inner two planets cross the 2:1 resonance as a result of the tidal evolution of the inner planet. As the pair approaches the commensurability, the resonanceaveraged corrections to the secular modes become substantial, leading to big changes in the eigenfrequencies. However, this behaviour does not result in a substantial change in the long-term qualitative behaviour of the system, as can be seen from the lower panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. This is a consequence of the narrow width of the resonant region at these low masses, so that the shuffling of the eigenfunctions is a relatively brief interlude, after which most of the original mode amplitude is returned as the system continues to evolve past the resonance.</p><p>The innermost planets in each system move the most, so the period ratio between the first and second planets in each system is going to increase. <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> shows the change in the period ratio for the inner pairs in the 50 systems we investigated.

In particular, there does not appear to be sufficient evolution to markedly change the transit observability of planets in these systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Inclination Evolution</head><p>In the limit of the classical secular perturbation analysis, the gravitational interactions between the planets also generate a set of normal modes in inclination, which are not directly coupled to the modes of eccentricity oscillation. That remains the case in our model as the secular contribution near first order resonances is linear in eccentricity and all inclination contributions to the disturbing function are second order, and thus assumed to be negligible.</p><p>Furthermore, tidal damping in the planets occurs in the orbital plane and thus does not cause any evolution in the planetary inclination. Tidal dissipation in the star can potentially affect the orbital plane, but we assume this to be negligible due to the fact that the planetary masses considered here are too small to raise a significant tide on the star.</p><p>However, there is a small amount of evolution in the inclination oscillations due to the fact that the semi-major axis of the innermost planet evolves, effectively providing a weak coupling between the eccentricity and inclination <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>. The filled circles indicate the relationship between the original period ratio of the inner pair in each system to the final period ratio, after 10 Gyr of evolution under the influence of tides and secular interactions.

The lines indicate commensurabilities corresponding to prominent first order (dotted), second order (short dashed) and third order (long dashed) resonances.

In general, the evolution in the eigenmodes and eigenvalues is small, but in about 10% of cases this evolution is sufficient to generate secular resonances in the inclination modes and a certain amount of transfer of amplitude from one mode to another.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Secular Chaos</head><p>The strong gravitational interactions that result from resonances, either from mean motion or secular eigenvalue commensurabilities, can potentially influence the architecture and stability of a system. Although the secular interactions are linear in the approximation used here, higher order nonlinear effects can potentially result in the transfer of amplitudes from one mode to another, a phenonemon termed 'secular chaos' by  and one that may contribute to the long-term instability of planetary systems, including our own (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laskar 1996)</ref>. Although a detailed examination of such questions is beyond the scope of this calculation, we are in a position to provide an initial estimate of the susceptibility of these model systems to such evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Laskar (1997)</ref> introduced the concept of the quasi-conserved angular momentum deficit, which we will term Λ, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Λ = N k=1,n λ k = N k=1,n m k √ a k 1 − 1 − e 2 k cos i k<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and m k ,a k ,e k and i k are the planetary mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination. If the secular modes are allowed to transfer angular momentum between one another by higher order interactions, then the individual contributions Λ k may vary, and potentially allow the eccentricity of a given planet to evolve to higher values. As an initial estimate of the susceptibility of a system to instability, we can, for each neighbouring pair, ask what value of eccentricity is required for the two orbits to cross, assuming co-planar orbits. This places a certain critical requirement on individual Λ k , which can be realised if the value for the entire system Λ &gt; Λ k,crit . In effect, if there is a sufficient deficit in the the system as a whole, the transfer of a substantial portion to a single planet can give that planet an eccentricity that will cause orbits to cross and potentially engender an epoch of planetary scattering and orbital instability.</p><p>However, this is rarely the case in the systems we study here. Examination of both the collective Λ and the required critical values of Λ k for all pairs shows that only ∼ 10% of the systems here have any pairs that are close enough to be potentially unstable in this manner. Furthermore, the tidal damping reduces the global Λ value, so that most of the potentially unstable systems are rendered stable within 1 Gyr. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> illustrates this for the most unstable system in our sample, in which there are initially two neighbouring pairs that could potentially be destabilised by secular chaos. However, the tidal evolution of the system reduces the global Λ below the critical values on timescales of 1.2 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr respectively. Unless the nonlinear interactions are strong enough to destabilise the system on this timescale, we do not anticipate orbital instability. While these arguments are not conclusive they do suggest that the systems studied here are secularly stable unless they are substantially perturbed by an external influence that raises eccentricities above those obtained from the assembly calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray (2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Tidal Strength</head><p>The strength of the actual tidal dissipation in rocky planets is still somewhat uncertain. Our default normalisation is based on traditional estimates of dissipation on Earth, but the precise physics that determines this can potentially be different on extrasolar terrestrial planets. As such, we have recalculated the evolution above using two alternative tidal strengths, one that is ten times larger than our nominal calibration (Q ′ = 1), and one which is ten times weaker (Q ′ = 100). We find little qualitative change in the overall system behaviour. As expected, less circularisation is found in cases of high Q ′ and more circularisation is found in the case of low Q ′ . Furthermore, in systems such as that shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the nature of the eigenvalue evolution doesn't change -the decoupling of the inner planet simply occurs earlier or later, depending on the strength of dissipation. Similarly, resonant interactions like that in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> follow the same pattern except that they occur earlier or later. The level of eccentricity damping increases as Q decreases, but the amount of inward movement is not significantly larger in the Q=1 case than the Q=10 case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">The reach of Tidal Circularisation</head><p>The propagation of tidal damping through a planetary system by the secular interactions has the effect of dramatically extending the reach of tidal circularisation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 16</ref> shows the period-eccentricity relation for our full ensemble of 50 model systems, at three levels of approximation. The upper panel shows the initial conditions for this calculation (the end result of the assembly simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray 2013)</ref>. The middle panel shows the consequence of 10 Gyr of tidal evolution using the equations (3) but applied to each planet individually without any secular interactions. We see that the circularisation period for a single planet system is ∼ 8 days using Q ′ ∼ 10. In the lower panel, we show the outcome of 10 Gyr of evolution within the context of the same model. We see substantial damping of eccentricities out to orbital periods ∼ 100 days.</p><p>This extended tidal reach may help to explain some of the inferences made on the basis of Kepler data. The observed asymmetry of the period ratios of neighbouring pairs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lissauer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>) can potentially be explained by the resonant repulsion of near-commensurable pairs evolving under the influence of tidal dissipation (LW12, BM13). However, many of these systems are observed with orbital periods in the range 10-50 days, where traditional estimates of tidal damping suggest this is not possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lee, Fabrycky &amp; Lin 2013</ref>). The estimate presented here suggests that the effects of tidal damping can indeed extend out to these distances, and that the effects of resonant divergence may still play a role on these scales. Although the original derivations mostly assumed the traditional relationship between the damping of eccentricity and semi-major axis to conserve angular momentum, the qualitative behaviour is unchanged if we allow for eccentricity damping in the absence of any semi-major axis change.</p><p>Indeed, eccentricity constraints based on transit timing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>. The solid curves indicate the critical Λ required for a specific planet to have a large enough eccentricity to cross a circular orbit with the semi-major axis of its exterior neighbour. The dotted curves indicate the value required to cross the orbit of an interior neighbour. The thick curve indicates the evolution of the Λ for the system as a whole, under the action of tidal dissipation. The critical value associated with pairs involving the inner planet also evolves, as the planet moves inwards. As an example, the critical values show a small discontinuity at 0.7 Gyr, associated with a 2:1 resonance crossing. As noted in the text, the tidal evolution of the system reduces the global Λ below the critical values on timescales of 1.2 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr respectively.</p><p>variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lithwick, Xie &amp; Wu 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref> suggest that many of the observed systems have eccentricities &lt; 0.01, which may again be explained on the basis of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 16</ref>. They also observe that a minority appear to exhibit anomalously large eccentricities. Given that 'large', in this context, is more than a few ×0.01, we can see that such a tail is also potentially explained by the final distribution of our simulations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 17</ref> shows the final model distribution of eccentricities for all planets with orbital periods &lt; 100 days, compared to the original distribution. We see that the final median eccentricity is indeed ∼ 0.01, but with a small tail of values extending up to ∼ 0.1. This tail of remnant eccentricities has several potential sources. The simplest is that a fraction of the systems have the inner planet particularly poorly coupled to the other planets, so that the damping is weaker. In the opposite limit, secular resonance can transfer substantial amplitudes from one mode to another, potentially re-exciting the eccentricities of some of the close-in planets. An example of this is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 18</ref>. In this case the resonant crossing transfers substantial amplitude from a mode dominated by the outermost planet to several of the interior planets. The newly excited mode is also poorly coupled to the innermost planet, resulting in a slow subsequent damping and finite eccentricities for several Gyr. The inverse is also possible, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.</p><p>In that case, the coupling to a distant planet maintained an inner eccentricity for several Gyr, until secular resonance drained the amplitude from that mode and circularised the inner planet. The eccentricity distribution is also a function of the strength of tidal dissipation, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 19</ref>. For weaker dissipation, the eccentricities are only moderately damped, and are probably too large to match the observations. If the dissipation is much stronger than our nominal calibration then the eccentricites are even more strongly damped and we see essentially no eccentricities &gt; 0.05 for periods &lt; 100 days. Taken together, these results suggest that the observations of Lithwick and collaborators can be explained by tidal dissipation rates of order those in the Earth, damping an initial eccentricity distribution similar to that seen in assembly simulations.</p><p>The large scale eccentricity damping also helps to explain the distribution of observed transit duration ratios. <ref type="bibr">Fabrycky et al. (2011)</ref> introduced this measure to quantify the ratio of impact parameters for neighbouring pairs of transitting planets. This quantity is a measure of both the dispersion in inclinations within a planetary system as well as the distribution of eccentricities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray (2013)</ref> found that their simulations matched the observed distribution well if they used the inclination dispersion from the simulations, but assumed that the orbits were circularised out to semi-major axes ∼ 0.25AU or larger. The tidal damping here provides a rationale for that assumption, because the eccentricities are damped by the tidal dissipation but the inclinations are not (since planetary dissipation occurs within the orbital plane, it does not affect the inclination). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Migration to short orbital periods</head><p>The radial migration of the inner planets can also potentially explain the presence of planets on orbits inside the nominal sublimation radius for small bodies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 20</ref> shows the distribution of period and mass for the ensemble model planets both before and after tidal evolution. The inner edge of the original distribution is located at orbital periods ∼ 4 days, but this shifts in as far as 2 days, depending on the particular configuration. The migration is not strong enough to drive planets into the star as has been hypothesized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mardling &amp; Lin (2004)</ref>, because the planetary masses are not big enough to excite eccentricities to the required levels. However, it is enough to move planets interior to locations where the nominal building blocks might not survive during the early stages of the assembly process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Swift et al.

The upper panel shows the evolution of three of the eigenvalues of a six planet system. The width of the curves is scaled relative to the mode amplitude and they are labelled by the planets which contribute at least 10% to the eigenvector amplitude. Thus, we see that the crossing of two eigenvalues at ∼ 0.8Gyr transfers substantial amplitude from an outer mode to an inner mode. The lower panel shows the evolution of the corresponding individual planet eccentricities. Here the resonant crossing is manifested by a rapid drop in the eccentricity of the outermost planet (6) and the corresponding excitation of planets 2,3,4 and 5.</p><p>The presence of only a single planet can produce substantial effects. As an experiment, we added a single giant planet at 3 AU to the example system shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, with a Jupiter-like eccentricity of 0.05. The addition produces shifts in the eigenvalues, but nothing dramatic unless the planet mass is ∼ 2MJ . For this mass, the presence of the giant planet shifts the fifth eigenvalue into position to cross the third eigenvalue at ∼ 2 × 10 9 years, which pumps eccentricity into the interior system. The consequence of this is to accelerate the tidal evolution because the periastron of the inner planet is reduced and the tidal dissipation increased. Repeating this experiment with other systems produces similar results. Thus, even the presence of a single giant planet of the appropriate mass can drive the evolution of the inner planets further than they would have evolved otherwise.</p><p>A better comparison with our own Solar system can be achieved by comparing the eigenfrequencies of the compact systems with those of known systems of multiple giant planets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> lists three pairs of giant planets from the compilation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wright et al.

As before, the net effect of this is often to accelerate the tidal evolution.</p><p>interactions can ensue, including resonances between different secular modes and the crossing of mean motion resonances. The secular couplings can also extend the reach of tidal circularisation by an order of magnitude, circularising the orbits out to periods ∼ 100 days in most cases. However, eccentricities &gt; 0.03 remain in a minority of cases, resulting either from the decoupling of the secular interactions into multiple weakly-connected subsystems or from the latetime crossing of a secular resonance which can redistribute angular momentum amongst the planets and re-excite the eccentricity of short period planets. The secular pumping of eccentricity also helps to drive the inward migration of the inner planets, resulting in shorter final orbital periods than would result from individual planet migration. In particular, this can result in planets with final orbital periods that lie inside the so-called 'dust sublimation radius', because they assembled from smaller bodies farther out and then were driven in by tidal dissipation enhanced by secular eccentricity pumping. The closest orbital periods found in these simulations were ∼ 2 days, but planets could be driven in further if they interact with more massive planets than considered here. The secular interactions drive migration of the innermost planet primarily, with the result that the period ratio between the closest and second closest planets diverge substantially, while the period ratios of planets farther out do not. This may help to explain the observation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Steffen &amp; Farr (2013)</ref>, that the period ratios of the innermost pairs in Kepler systems are larger, on average, than those of more distant pairs.</p><p>We evolve models composed solely of rocky planets with masses &lt; 10M⊕, within the context of classical secular perturbation theory. As such, our calculations represent the linear superposition of individual modes and cannot probe the possibilities of chaotic evolution due to nonlinear couplings. However, the level of the angular momentum deficit in these systems is low enough that significant dynamical instability may not occur because, in most cases, orbit crossing cannot be achieved even if all of the system's angular momentum deficit were concentrated in a single mode. It is worth noting, however, that this is the result of the low planetary masses considered. If the assembling planets capture significant gas mass from the surrounding nebula (e.g. Hansen &amp; Murray 2012), or are accompanied by a giant planet system at larger radii, the injection of significant additional amplitude could substantially modify the system evolution. This is an attractive possibility for explaining the excess of low multiplicity systems seen in the Kepler sample ( <ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Dong &amp; Tremaine 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Fang &amp; Margot 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray 2013)</ref> and will be examined in detail in a forthcoming paper.</p><p>Finally, we note that these simulations are chosen because they resemble the statistical properties of the observed planetary systems. As such, even though the systems are the result of in situ assembly calculations, they can qualitatively represent the outcomes of any formation scenario that produces a similar range of masses and separations. However, the degree of evolution does depend on the initial level of eccentricity in the system. Although not large, the initial eccentricities from the assembly simulations are definitely non-zero. A system born with zero eccentricity (perhaps due to dissipation from the gaseous nebula) would evolve less. Of course, if the eccentricities are excited due to dynamical instabilities that result from the dissipation of the nebula, then the level of subsequent tidal evolution is likely to be similar to that found here.</p></div>

The points show the instantaneous semi-major axis and eccentricity of the innermost planet, planet 1. We see that the eccentricity decreases as the planet moves inwards, but more slowly than expected by the constant angular momentum curve expected for single planet evolution, which is shown by the dotted line. The pumping of the eccentricity by secular interactions enables an inward shift approximately four times as large as that experienced by a single planet.</figDesc></figure>

The numerical labels indicate which planets (counting from inside out) contribute 10% or more of the amplitude to a given eigenvector. Thus, we see that the models dominated by the innermost planets (1,2,3) damp the fastest, while the modes of the outer planets (4,5,6,7) damp on longer timescales. After 10 Gyr, only one mode of oscillation retains any significant amplitude.</figDesc></figure>

The curves in the upper panel indicate the eccentricities of the individual planets. The curves can be identified with individual planets by noting that, at late times, the eccentricities increase monotonically with distance from the star, so only the inner (1) and outer (7) planets are explicitly identified. The lower panel indicates the evolution of the orbital alignment between neighbouring planets. The coloured points correspond to the average offsets in longitude of periastron for each planet, relative to the planet exterior to it. The average is taken in steps of 0.01 Gyr, which leads to some coarseness for those planets affected by multiple modes. Colours are black (1-2), red (2-3), magenta (3-4), cyan (4-5), green (5-6) and blue (6-7). Somewhat surprisingly, it is the innermost pair that takes the longest to come into alignment. This is a consequence of the fact that the innermost planet, although the most affected by tides, is also strongly coupled to three other planets. In particular, the coupling to planet 4 takes several Gyr to damp away.</figDesc></figure>
