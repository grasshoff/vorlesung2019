			<abstract>
				<p>We develop an analytic model for transit timing variations produced by orbital conjunctions between gravitationally interacting planets. If the planetary orbits have tight orbital spacing, which is a common case among the Kepler planets, the effect of a single conjunction can be best described as: (1) a step-like change of the transit timing ephemeris with subsequent transits of the inner planet being delayed and those of the outer planet being sped up, and (2) a discrete change in sampling of the underlying oscillations from eccentricity-related interaction terms. In the limit of small orbital eccentricities, our analytic model gives explicit equations for these effects as a function of the mass and orbital separation of planets. We point out that a detection of the conjunction effect in real data is of crucial importance for the physical characterization of planetary systems from transit timing variations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Planetary orbits are less than ideal clocks. This is because various processes, including, for example, the gravitational interaction between planets, collaborate to produce fluctuations from perfect periodicity. The Transit Timing Variations (TTVs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>), a method that has become increasingly important in the exoplanet research, exploits the effect of these fluctuations on the timing of planetary transits. It can be used to make useful inferences about the nature of planets in a system where at least one planet is transiting.</p><p>The TTVs caused by interacting planets come in several flavors. The long-periodic TTVs result from orbital variability on timescales much longer than the orbital period. Their detection therefore requires a long observation baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Heyl &amp; Gladman 2007)</ref>. The resonant and near-resonant TTVs occur when orbital periods, when divided by each other, are equal or nearly equal to a ratio of small integers. The planetary perturbations tend to build up in this situation, leading to TTVs with a large amplitude.</p><p>The detection of (near-)resonant TTVs is expected if a large set of transit observations is available, because some planetary systems are bound to have (near-)resonant orbits (either due to statistics or because they are driven to these orbits by formation processes). The description of planetary properties from (near-)resonant TTVs, however, is plagued with degeneracies, which may be resolved only under certain assumptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lithwick et al. 2012</ref>). This happens, in essence, because the (near-)resonant TTVs are limited in the information content. This is where the short-periodic TTVs become useful. The short-periodic TTVs are produced by variations of orbits on a timescale comparable to the orbital period. In general, it can be shown that − n i δt i = δλ i − 2δh i + 3 2 (k i δh i + h i δk i ) + O(e 2 i ) ,</p><p>where δt i is the short-periodic deviation of timing of planet i from a linear ephemeris, k i = e i cos ̟ i , h i = e i sin ̟ i , and n i = 2π/P i , where P i is the orbital period <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2009)</ref>. Quantities δλ i , δh i and δk i are the short-periodic variations of the mean longitude, h i and k i , respectively. 1</p><p>The short-periodic variations δλ i , δh i and δk i can be computed from perturbation theory. With m i , a i , e i , i i , ̟ i , Ω i , λ i denoting the mass and orbital elements of planet i, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δλ i = 1 L i 2a i ∂χ ∂a i + β D i x i ∂χ ∂h i − y i ∂χ ∂k i , δh i = − β L i ∂χ ∂k i + x i D i ∂χ ∂λ i , δk i = β L i ∂χ ∂h i + y i D i ∂χ ∂λ i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L i = m i √ GM * a i , G is the gravitational constant, M * is the mass of the host star,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x i = − √ 2P i sin ̟ i , y i = √ 2P i cos ̟ i , P i = L i (1 − β i ), D i = 2L i</formula><p>(1 + β i ) and β i = 1 − e 2 i . Function χ can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ = Gm 1 m 2 a 2 |k 1 |+|k 2 || =0 ı C l,j k (α) k 1 n 1 + k 2 n 2 e l 1 1 e l 2 2 (sin i 1 2 ) j 1 (sin i 2 2 ) j 2 × exp ı(k 3 ̟ 1 + k 4 ̟ 2 + k 5 Ω 1 + k 6 Ω 2 ) exp ı(k 1 λ 1 + k 2 λ 2 )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with ı = √ −1, C l,j k (α) = C l,j −k (α), α = a 1 /a 2 &lt; 1, and multi-indexes l = (l 1 , l 2 ), j = (j 1 , j 2 ) and k = (k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 , k 5 , k 6 ). See Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nesvorn´y &amp; Morbidelli (2008)</ref> for the assumptions that led to the derivation of Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. In brief, Eq. (2) does not include terms from the inclination of the transiting planet (assumed to be small), and Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref> is given to the first-order in m 1 /M * and m 2 /M * .</p><p>According to these equations, δt i contains Fourier terms with the k 1 λ 1 +k 2 λ 2 harmonics. The amplitude of these terms is a complex function of α, eccentricities and inclinations, but the ones with small |k 1 | and |k 2 | values are generally the most important (except if k 1 n 1 + k 2 n 2 = 0 for arbitrary k 1 and k 2 , indicating the presence of a resonance). It is also obvious, in the approximation of Eqs. (1)-(3), that δt i is proportional to P i , independent of m i , and scales linearly with the companion mass. The short-periodic TTVs are more difficult to detect observationally then the (near-)resonant TTVs, because they generally have a small amplitude. If they are detected, however, they can be used to uniquely characterize the orbital properties of planets. This has been theoretically demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y &amp; Beaugé (2010)</ref> under the assumption that there is no a priori information about the (non-transiting) companion, and done in practice in <ref type="bibr">Holman et al. (2010)</ref>, and elsewhere. Intuitively, this can be understood because each Fourier term in Eq. (3) provides specific information about orbital elements. Thus, if at least a few of these terms are detected in real data, the information contained in the detection is high enough to make the inversion to orbital elements possible (e.g., Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nesvorn´y et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>An important component of the short-periodic TTVs, which is the main focus here, is produced by conjunctions between planets. The conjunction effect can be conveniently illustrated using <ref type="bibr">Kepler-36c (Carter et al. 2012</ref>) and KOI-884.02 ) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref>). Kepler-36 is a doubly-transiting system, consisting of two planets on very tightly spaced orbits, with the two planets having significantly different masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carter et al. 2012</ref>). The KOI-884 system contains three known transiting planetary candidates, with the inner two displaying little or no sign of TTVs, while the outer one (KOI-884.02) exhibits significant TTVs. Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nesvorn´y et al. (2014)</ref> used the TTVs of KOI-884.02 to detect an additional, unseen (i.e. non-transiting) planet just narrow of the outer 3:1 resonance with KOI-884.02 (orbital period ratio 2.93).</p><p>In the case of KOI-884.02, the effect of conjunctions is best seen for transit cycles 32 to 45 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1a</ref>, where three transits on a nearly linear ephemeris are offset from the next three transits. These discontinuities are produced at conjunctions with the outer massive planet (M p ≃ 2.4 M J , where M J is the mass of Jupiter; Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nesvorn´y et al. 2014</ref>). The TTVs of Kepler-36c, on the other hand, are a series of approximately linear segments that are tilted relative to each other at different angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carter et al. 2012</ref>). These discontinuities correspond to the orbital conjunctions between Kepler-36c and the inner transiting planet <ref type="bibr">Kepler-36b.</ref> In this case, the very tight spacing of two orbits at (or very near to) the 7:6 resonance implies the physical distance between planets to be small near conjunctions, and large variations are therefore expected. In general, for a (j + 1):j resonance, we expect the conjunctions to occur in every j periods of the outer planet (and j + 1 periods of the inner one). This is why, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1b</ref>, groups of j = 6 transits share the same linear ephemeris (note that some transits are missing due to instrumental and other issues).</p><p>It is not straightforward to theoretically understand the effect of conjunctions from Eqs. (1)-(3), mainly because the TTV discontinuities occurring at conjunctions are difficult to approximate by the Fourier series, and because these equations include many different terms such that it is not clear which ones are responsible for the conjunction effect. The goal of this paper is to present a simple model for the conjunction effect that can be used as an intuitive guideline for more realistic modeling of cases such as the ones shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>In Section 2, we derive an analytic model of conjunctions in the limit of small orbital eccentricities. In Section 3, we test our model by comparing it with numerical integrations of the full equations of motion, and determine the domain of parameters where the analytic model is valid. In Section 4, we show how the magnitude of the conjunction effect scales with different parameters. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss how the detection of the conjunction effect can be used to confirm and characterize transiting planetary systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Equations of Motion</head><p>We consider a system of two planets with masses m 1 and m 2 orbiting about a central star with mass M * . The planetary orbits are assumed to be nearly coplanar and nearly circular, with planet 1 on the interior and planet 2 on the exterior. The analytic model is developed in variables a i , λ i , and z i = e i exp(ı̟ i ), where index i = 1, 2 stands for the two planets. These variables are non-singular for e i → 0, and non-canonical, with the later being appropriate because we do not aim at developing the theory beyond the lowest order in eccentricity and beyond the linear terms in m 1 /M * and m 2 /M * . The inclination terms are ignored because they appear in the second and higher powers, and are therefore not overly important for the TTVs (as we show in Section 4).

Below we compute this quadrature in the time interval from ψ = −π to ψ = π, i.e. over one conjunction cycle.

This can be most easily verified by assuming that n 1 /n 2 = j/(j − 1) + ε or n 1 /n 2 = (j + 1)/j + ε, where ε is a small quantity, and showing that λ eff 1 and λ eff 2 are non-divergent when ε → 0.

The effects of δλ eff i are initially small, but when small orbital eccentricities are excited during the conjunction (i.e., when ψ ≃ 0), δt i becomes a composite of two terms with comparable magnitudes: (i) a step-like change produced by the direct variation δλ i (Section 2.2.1), and (ii) oscillations from δλ eff i .

Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(30)</ref> express the general dependence of δλ eff i on ψ in that they can be used to compute the conjunction effect over the successive rotations of ψ.

The expressions for (iii) are non-divergent, because if ν 1 = j (or ν 2 = j) the variable part of the corresponding sinusoidal terms vanishes from Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Validity Domain of the Analytic Model</head><p>The analytic model developed in the previous sections can be used as a guideline to understand the basic effects of conjunctions on the TTVs. We will discuss these effects, and their scaling with different parameters, in Section 4. Before we do so, however, we first establish the domain of validity of the analytic model by comparing the results to those obtained from an exact N-body integration. This comparison was done with the N-body code described in Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nesvorn´y et al. (2013)</ref>, where the TTVs are computed with an efficient and precise algorithm (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Deck et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the results for the test case previously shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2 and 3</ref>. Here the results of the analytic model are in an excellent agreement with those obtained from the N-body integration. This was expected because the parameters of the test case were set to be in the domain where the analytic model should be valid (e.g., small planetary masses, α not too large, and e (0) i = 0). In general, however, the analytic model is obviously only an approximation of the conjunction effect. First, the two orbits were assumed to be strictly coplanar. Second, we assumed that m i ≪ M * , such that H per can be treated as a perturbation of H Kep . Terms of the second and higher orders in m i /M * were not included. Third, we assumed that e i ≪ 1, expanded the Hamiltonian in powers of e i , and retained only the lowest power of e i . We therefore expect the analytic model to be valid only for very nearly circular orbits of both planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the approximate nature of the analytic model. To make this figure, we surveyed a range of orbital separations and eccentricities (0.5 &lt; α &lt; 0.9, 0 &lt; e (0) 1 &lt; 0.1 and 0 &lt; e (0) 2 &lt; 0.1). Other parameters were held fixed (m i = 10 −5 M * , M * = M ⊙ ). In each case, we followed dynamics over one conjunction cycle and determined the (i) amplitude of δt i variation produced as a result of conjunction, and (ii) the difference between analytically and numerically computed δt i when ψ approaches π (i.e., at the end of the conjunction cycle). From this, by dividing (ii) by (i), we computed the relative error of the analytic model as a function of α, e <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">(0)</ref> 1 and e <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">(0)</ref> 2 . From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> we see that the analytic model is valid only for small eccentricities, and the eccentricity threshold (e crit ) beyond which the relative error is excessive (say &gt;10%) is a strong function of the radial separation between orbits. For example, e crit ≃ 0.1 for α = 0.5 while e crit ≃ 0.01 for α = 0.8, This is expected because the second and higher order effects in m i /M * , neglected in our analytic model, should become important with increasing α. Also, we would need to include eccentricity terms beyond the lowest power to make the analytic model more generally valid for larger eccentricities.</p><p>We used m i /M * = 10 −5 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref>, but it turns out that the general appearance of this figure is independent of the considered planetary masses. This is because both the magnitude of the conjunction effect and the error of the analytic model increase (nearly) linearly with m i /M * . The relative error therefore remains approximately the same.</p><p>The mass ratio m i /M * sets the limit in α beyond which the analytic model does not apply. Beyond this limit, the co-orbital dynamics appears and the two planets can switch positions radially (i.e., following the horseshoe or tadpole trajectory the inner planet becomes an outer one, and vice versa). In this situation, α, as defined here, evolves from α &lt; 1 to α &gt; 1, and the Fourier expansion of H per in Section 2.1 becomes divergent. The TTVs occurring for two planets in the co-orbital regime were recently investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Vokrouhlick´yVokrouhlick´y &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, as we already mentioned at the beginning of Section 2.2, our analytic model is valid but not really useful if α is small. In such a case, the conjunctions between planets cannot be described as a discrete effect, because the gravitational interaction of planets is similarly strong for any phase of ψ. For small α, we therefore find it more intuitive to use the representation in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref>, where the TTVs are fully expanded in the Fourier series. The transition between the two regimes is gradual such that it is difficult to establish a single value of α where this transition happens. We roughly find that our analytic model of conjunctions is useful for α &gt; 0.5, while the Fourier series representation becomes more adequate for α &lt; 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Scaling of the Conjunction Effect with Planetary Properties</head><p>According to Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(34)</ref>, the expected variation of transit timing, δt i , is proportional to P i , where P i is the orbital period of the transiting planet. Thus, assuming that the observation baseline is long enough to cover several conjunction cycles, the detection of the conjunction effect would be easier for planets with longer orbital periods, for which the effect is larger. In reality, however, the current observational baselines are typically only a few years such that we do not expect that the TTVs to be generally detectable for longperiod planets. The conjunction effect could potentially be detected for long-period planets only if at least a few transits were observed before the conjunction and a few transits after the conjunction, which would require a fortuitous configuration of the planetary system at the current epoch (a good example of this can be KOI-351g; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cabrera et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The scaling of δt i with the planetary and stellar masses is obvious from Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(34)</ref>, at least in the approximation m i ≪ M * that we adopted in the analytic model. While δt 1 scales linearly with m 2 /M * , δt 2 scales linearly with m 1 /M * . This means that a detection of the conjunction effect in transits of the inner planet can help to determine the mass of the outer planet, and vice versa. Also, the detection of transit variations is obviously easier in a system with more massive planets and, for a fixed orbital period, with lower stellar mass. 2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the dependence of δt i on α = a 1 /a 2 . The dashed lines in the figure show the amplitude of the δλ i /n i change from a single conjunction between planets. From Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>, the amplitude is 2A 1 (α)m 2 /M * for the inner planet and 2B 1 (α)m 1 /M * for the outer planet, where A 1 (α) and B 1 (α) are given in terms of the complete elliptic integrals in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. The total conjunction effect from δλ i + δλ eff i is shown by solid lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>. The basic tendency is that the magnitude of the conjunction effect strongly increases with α, such that it is ≃ 100-200 times stronger for planets with α ≃ 0.9 than for planets with α ≃ 0.5. This is reasonable because the closely packed planetary systems are expected to have stronger gravitational interactions.</p><p>In the example given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> with m 1 = m 2 = 10 −5 M * , M * = M ⊙ and a 2 = 1 AU, the magnitude of δt i ranges from 3 minutes (inner planet, α = 0.5) to over 10 hours (outer planet, α = 0.9). Assuming instead that the outer planet with a 2 = 1 AU has one Earth mass, the TTVs of the inner planet should range between ≃ 1 minute and ≃ 3 hours. They should therefore be generally detectable with adequate photometric precision. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> shows how the amplitude of the conjunction effect changes with eccentricity. Given that our analytic model loses precision with increasing eccentricity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref>), here we used our N-body code to compute δt i over one conjunction cycle. In addition to changing α as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>, we also varied the initial eccentricities of the two planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> shows that the amplitude of the conjunction effect can increase by a factor of ≃ 2-10 by increasing the eccentricity from 0 to 0.1. This is significant, because it shows that the likelihood of detection of the conjunction effect can be boosted for orbits with modest eccentricities, a case that should presumably be common among planetary systems.</p><p>The magnitude of the conjunction effect for eccentric orbits, however, also depends on the relative orientation of orbits, as given by ̟ 1 and ̟ 2 , and on where exactly the conjunction happens along the orbits. The magnitude can increase or decrease, roughly reflecting the physical distance between planets during the conjunction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> was produced by surveying all orbital configurations, 0 ≤ ̟ 1 &lt; 2π and 0 ≤ ̟ 2 &lt; 2π, and plotting the one for which the magnitude was maximal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref> shows how the amplitude of the conjunction effect changes with the mutual inclination between orbits, i mutual . As in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> we used the N-body code to compute δt i over one conjunction cycle. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> illustrates that the amplitude of the conjunction effect is not very sensitive to i mutual . The magnitude varies only up to ≃20% for i mutual &lt; 50 • , relative to to the case with i mutual = 0. See Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nesvorn´y et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(34)</ref> express our expectation for the TTVs produced by two planets on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. The first two terms in these equations result from the direct perturbation of the mean longitude. If α is sufficiently close to 1, these terms are essentially equivalent to a succession of transit timing discontinuities occurring at orbital conjunctions between planets. The amplitude of these discontinuities is 2A 1 (α)m 2 /M * for the inner planet and 2B 1 (α)m 1 /M * for the outer planet, where A 1 (α) and B 1 (α) were defined in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> and were illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> (dashed lines). The transit times of the inner planet are expected to be delayed relative to a fixed Keplerian ephemeris, while those of the outer planet are expected to be sped up.</p><p>The long-term effects of conjunctions, with δt i steadily accumulating over many periods of the synodic angle, can be absorbed by a small change of the orbital period. The shortperiod effects of conjunctions, frequently described as 'chopping' of the TTV signal (e.g, <ref type="bibr">Holman et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Carter et al. 2012</ref>), should not be mistaken with anything else. When the long-term conjunction effects are removed from the transit ephemeris, the TTV signal from direct perturbation of the mean longitude should have a saw-like profile with each tooth being marked by a few rising and a few declining transits. If such a saw-tooth profile is identified in the data, the mass of planetary companion can be extracted from these measurements, assuming that α is known, by using Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1a</ref>), are ∼1-2 hours. The difference is probably caused by small but significant orbital eccentricities ).</p><p>The oscillatory part of Eqs. (33) or (34) offers a different method to constrain planetary masses and/or α. Here it can be useful to perform the Fourier analysis of δt i . The expectation is that this will reveal frequencies that are integer multiples of (n 1 − n 2 ). Some of these frequencies will be faster than the Nyquist frequency, f N i = π/P i , and will be aliased to the part of the Fourier spectrum with f &lt; f N i . For example, in the test case shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  4</ref>, f N 1 = 0.01117 d −1 . Therefore, frequencies (n 1 − n 2 ) = 0.00514 d −1 and 2(n 1 − n 2 ) = 0.01028 d −1 appear unaliased, while all j(n 1 − n 2 ) frequencies with j ≥ 3 are aliased to 2f N 1 − j(n 1 − n 2 ). For example, 3(n 1 − n 2 ) = 0.01542 d −1 appears at 0.006933 d −1 . As for KOI-884, (n 1 − n 2 ) = 0.201 d −1 and f N 1 = 0.153 d −1 . As (n 1 − n 2 ) &gt; f N 1 in this case, the synodic frequency and all its multiples will be aliased. For example, (n 1 − n 2 ) should appear at 0.105 d −1 , and 2(n 1 − n 2 ) should appear at 0.096 d −1 . The Fourier analysis of the best fit TTV model from Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nesvorn´y et al. (2014)</ref> confirms this. It shows that the peak power density of the 2(n 1 − n 2 ) term is about five times larger than that of the (n 1 − n 2 ) term, as expected from Eqs. <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>. Unfortunately, these terms are much harder to identify in the existing TTV data of KOI-884.02, because of the short coverage, gaps, measurement errors, and other issues. We have done a similar analysis for Kepler-36, but do not discuss it here, except for pointing out that the aliasing is not a problem for this system, because the synodic frequency (n 1 − n 2 ) is relatively slow (as α ≃ 0.9).</p><p>Identifying the structure of unaliased and aliased frequencies in the frequency domain can be useful for the interpretation of the TTV observations. As the amplitudes of these terms are proportional to D j i , as shown in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref> or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(34)</ref>, the TTV measurements can be potentially inverted to obtain a unique determination of the planetary mass and orbital separation (e.g., Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nesvorn´y et al. 2013</ref>). This highlights the importance of the conjunction effect.</p><p>As a final word of caution, note that Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(33)</ref> or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(34)</ref> were derived under several assumptions. Most importantly, these equations are valid only for small orbital eccentricities. While many planetary systems will presumably fall into this category, perhaps the majority of them will not. The TTVs for planetary systems with orbital eccentricities exceeding the threshold shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> will contain many additional terms from the first and higher eccentricity powers. These terms will add frequencies k 1 n 1 + k 2 n 2 , with arbitrary k 1 and k 2 , potentially generating resonant or near-resonant TTVs, and will modify the amplitude dependence of the j(n 1 −n 2 ) frequencies on orbital parameters. The analytic model described here therefore cannot be used in general to characterize the planetary systems from TTVs.</p><p>The main scientific value of the analytic model is to give us an intuitive framework for how the TTV method works in the limit of the nearly circular orbits.</p><p>The work of DV was supported by Czech Grant Agency (grant P209-13-01308S).

As for Kepler-36, P 2 ≃ 16.2 day, α ≃ 0.9, M 1 /M * ≃ 1.3 × 10 −5 from Carter et al. (2012). The size of the conjunction step computed from Eq. (34) for these parameters is δt 2 ∼ 0.3 hour. For a comparison, Figure 1b shows that the actual steps during conjunctions are smaller, but not much smaller, than one hour. As for KOI-884.02, P 1 ≃ 20.5 day, α ≃ 0.34, M 2 /M * ≃ 3 × 10 −3 from Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. (2012). We compute that δt 1 ∼ 0.9 hour from Eq. (33).

The TTV data for KOI-884.02 and Kepler-36c were obtained from Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. (2014) and Carter et al. (2012), respectively. The red line in panel (a) shows the best dynamical fit from Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. (2014) corresponding to a (non-transiting) companion with the mass of ≃ 2.4 M J and outer orbit just wide the 3:1 orbital resonance with KOI-884.02. The TTVs of Kepler-36c, on the other hand, are caused by a transiting super-Earth (Kepler-36b) with an orbit in the 7:6 resonance with Kepler-36c. The line segments in panel (b) highlight the discontinuous nature of Kepler-36c's TTVs.</figDesc></figure>

Here, the two planets have masses m 1 = m 2 = 10 −5 M * , with M * = M ⊙ , and semimajor axes a 1 = 0.84 AU and a 2 = 1 AU. The evolution is shown as a function of the synodic angle ψ = λ 1 − λ 2 , where λ 1 and λ 2 are unperturbed mean longitudes of the two planets. The conjunction occurs when ψ ≃ 0. Notably, the semimajor axis of the inner (outer) planet increases (decreases) during the conjunction, while the mean longitudes of the two planets suffer a step-like discontinuity.</figDesc></figure>

These values have to be multiplied by a factor of 60 to appear on the same scale with the upper plots (the dashed horizontal line shows zero for a reference). The two planets have masses m 1 = m 2 = 10 −5 M * (M * = M ⊙ ), semimajor axes a 1 = 0.84 AU and a 2 = 1 AU (thus P 2 /P 1 ≃ 1.3), and e (0) i = 0.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> The negative sign in front of Eq. (1) arises from the convention that a positive (negative) change of the mean longitude leads to negative (positive) δt i . Also, it is assumed in Eq. (1) that the observer&apos;s line of sight lies along the X axis from which the orbital angles are measured.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Note that if more than two planets are present in a given system, the TTVs from conjunctions of different pairs should add linearly, at least in the approximation of our analytic model.</note>
