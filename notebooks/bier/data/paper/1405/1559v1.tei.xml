				<p>Context. Young, nearby stars are ideal targets to search for planets using the direct imaging technique. The determination of stellar parameters is crucial for the interpretation of imaging survey results, particularly since the luminosity of substellar objects has a strong dependence on system age. Aims. We have conducted a large program with NaCo at the VLT in order to search for planets and brown dwarfs in wide orbits around 86 stars. A large fraction of the targets observed with NaCo were poorly investigated in the literature. We performed a study to characterize the fundamental properties (age, distance, mass) of the stars in our sample. To improve target age determinations, we compiled and analyzed a complete set of age diagnostics. Methods. We measured spectroscopic parameters and age diagnostics using dedicated observations acquired with FEROS and CORALIE spectrographs at La Silla Observatory. We also made extensive use of archival spectroscopic data and results available in the literature. Additionally, we exploited photometric time-series, available in ASAS and Super-WASP archives, to derive rotation period for a large fraction of our program stars. Results. We provided updated characterization of all the targets observed in the VLT NaCo Large program, a survey designed to probe the occurrence of exoplanets and brown dwarfs in wide orbits. The median distance and age of our program stars are 64 pc and 100 Myr, respectively. Nearly all the stars have masses between 0.70 and 1.50 M⊙, with a median value of 1.01 M⊙. The typical metallicity is close to solar, with a dispersion that is smaller than that of samples usually observed in radial velocity surveys. Several stars are confirmed or proposed here to be members of nearby young moving groups. Eight spectroscopic binaries are identified. ⋆ Based on observations collected at La Silla and Paranal Observatory, ESO (Chile) using FEROS, HARPS, and NaCo Based on observations collected with the CORALIE echelle spec-trograph mounted on the 1.2 m Swiss telescope at La Silla Observatory. Based on the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) photometric data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High-angular resolution deep imaging in the near-infrared maximizes the capability to detect faint circumstellar bodies amidst the large brightness of the central star (?). The first detections of comoving companions with planetary mass were obtained using deep VLT/NaCo infrared imaging, with contrast up to 6-8 mag at &gt; 0.5 arcsec separation, around very young objects such as <ref type="bibr">2MASSWJ 1207334−393254 (?)</ref> and AB Pic (?).</p><p>After these earliest discoveries, improvements in data acquisition and data analysis techniques (e.g. the introduction of angular differential imaging, ?) allowed the detection of the first objects likely formed in protoplanetary disks, such as the 4-planet system orbiting HR 8799 (??) and the giant planet orbiting at 8 AU from the well known stardisk system β Pic (?). In the last year, several additional discoveries of directly-imaged planets have been reported <ref type="bibr">(???)</ref>.</p><p>Several surveys were also carried out, with published detection limits for hundreds of objects (e.g. ???). These observations allowed a first estimate of the frequency of giant planets in wide orbits (?). There are exciting prospects for the detection of planets of lower masses (below 1M J ), and of smaller semimajor axes, thanks to the availability of new instrumentation, such as SPHERE at VLT (?); GPI at Gemini-South (?); SCExAO at Subaru (?) and LBTI (??).</p><p>As the luminosity of substellar objects is strongly dependent on age (??), the determination of the mass of a detected planet, or the derivation of detection limits in terms of planetary mass, requires a careful evaluation of the stellar age. Other parameters, such as stellar mass, metallicity, distance to the system, multiplicity and membership to associations are also required for a proper interpretation of the results, in terms of both positive detections and statistics of the whole survey. Such comprehensive knowledge allows for meaningful comparisons with the outcomes of other planet-search projects using different techniques (e.g. ??) as well as outcomes from planet formation models <ref type="bibr">(????)</ref>.</p><p>The determination of stellar age is a challenging task, especially for isolated field objects (?). A variety of indicators can be used such as isochrone fitting, lithium content, chromospheric and coronal emission, stellar rotation, and kinematics. The various indicators have complementary sensitivities for stars of different spectral types and different ages. Furthermore, some diagnostics like those related to rotation and magnetic activity might give spuriously young ages as e.g., in the case of tidally-locked binaries. Therefore, the best results are obtained from a complete examination of all possible indicators and by a careful and suitable combination of their results.</p><p>The NaCo Large Programme (NaCo-LP, PI.

Beuzit) is a coordinated European effort, aimed at conducting an homogeneous and systematic study of the occurrence of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) in wide orbit (5-500 AU) around young, nearby stars. First epoch observations were performed in 2009-2010 and the follow-ups for confirmation of physical association of the candidates to their central stars were completed in March 2013. First results include the characterization of the debris disk around HD 61005 (?) and the study of the astrophysical false alarm represented by the white dwarf around HIP 6177, which mimics a substellar object at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (?).</p><p>The goal of this paper is to provide detailed stellar characterization of the targets of the NaCo-LP, based on highresolution spectroscopic data acquired for this purpose, as well as spectroscopic and photometric data available from public archives, complemented by information from the literature. The companion paper ( <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2013</ref>, submitted) presents the deep imaging observations and their results. Results from the NaCo-LP sample will be merged with those of other surveys of comparable depth to produce a comprehensive statistical analysis of the occurrence of giant planets in wide orbits around FGK stars ( <ref type="bibr">Vigan et al. 2014, in preparation)</ref> as well as a complementary study of the brown dwarf population ( <ref type="bibr">Reggiani et al. 2014, in preparation)</ref>.</p><p>The layout of this paper is the following. In Sect. 2 we introduce the target sample while in Sect. 3 we present the spectroscopic data-set and describe the data reduction procedures; in Sect. 4 we present the spectroscopic analysis performed to determine radial and projected rotational velocities, to measure lithium line 6707.8 ˚ A strength, and to derive effective temperature; in Sect. 5 we present the analysis of photometric time series to derive the rotation period; in Sect. 6 we examine magnetic activity diagnostics Ca II H&amp;K and X-ray emission; in Sect. 7 we report the presence of possible stellar companions; in Sect. 8 we analyze the kinematic parameters supporting the membership to known nearby associations; in Sect. 9 we evaluate distances and metallicities of the targets and infer stellar masses and ages; in Sect. 10 we summarize our results. In Appendix A we report the compilation of data available in the literature for our targets; in Appendix B we describe individual targets; in Appendix C we provide our calibration of choromospheric emission for FEROS spectra; while in Appendix D the details of our search for rotation period on photometric time series are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Sample selection</head><p>The target selection was based on an initial compilation of about one thousand young nearby stars, based on various literature sources and dedicated observations, assembled in preparation for the SPHERE GTO survey (?). The youth diagnostics include high lithium content, Ca II H&amp;K line chromospheric emission, Hα emission, X-ray activity, rotation rate and kinematics. From that list, objects within a distance horizon of 100 pc, younger that 200 Myr 1 , and a magnitude limit of approximately R &lt; 9.5 were selected 2 . Furthermore, known spectroscopic and close visual (separation &lt; 6 arcsec) binaries were rejected, to have a sample as free as possible from dynamical perturbations to planets in wide orbits and to avoid potential problems with the quality of adaptive optics (AO) wavefront sensing, posed by the presence of a close stellar companion. For spectroscopic binaries, there are no technical difficulties for AO observations, as the components are not spatially resolved, but we decided nevertheless to focus our attention on single stars and on individual components of wide binaries. This allows us to get more statistically significant inferences and to have a sample more suited for comparison with the frequency of giant planets in wide orbits as derived from radial velocity (RV) surveys. The study of the frequency of circumbinary planets is deferred for a separate study ( <ref type="bibr">Bonavita et al. 2014</ref>, in preparation).</p><p>The resulting list was cross-correlated with that of recent direct imaging surveys achieving similar sensitivities to our project. The 90 objects that were already observed with adequate depth were excluded and the final sample of the NaCo-LP is formed by about 110 targets never observed with deep imaging instruments. Eighty-six of these originally selected 110 stars were observed at the telescope and will form the sample studied in this paper <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">(Table 9)</ref>. The remaining 25 were not observed due to weather or technical losses. The previously published wide companions of the targets were also considered in our study even when they were not observed as part of NaCo-LP, because of the constraints they can provide on the parameters of the system (e.g. age, distance). The pending statistical analysis on the frequency of planetary-mass objects in wide orbits will be based on the whole sample of about 200 objects, which combines targets observed by NaCo-LP as well as observational results from the literature. ( <ref type="bibr">Vigan et al. 2014, in preparation)</ref>.</p><p>Final values for the stellar parameters derived in this paper might lie outside of the original selection criteria due to the availability of new observational determinations, improvements in adopted calibrations or a better understanding of the physical nature of the systems being investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Spectroscopic Data</head><p>For the spectroscopic characterization of our targets, we used data acquired with several instruments. Some of the spectra were specifically acquired by us to characterize the targets. Other spectra were accessed through the NaCo-LP collaboration as well as from public archives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">FEROS Spectra</head><p>High-resolution spectra were collected using FEROS as part of preparatory observations for the SPHERE GTO survey. Observations were performed during several runs from November 2008 to March 2010 as part of Max Planck Institut für Astronomie (MPIA) observing time. The OBJ+SKY mode of FEROS was preferred to avoid contamination by Th-Ar lines, as we are more interested in having clean spectra for stellar characterization purposes rather than attaining the highest RV precision. Integration times were selected to obtain a S/N ratio of about 100 for stars brighter than V∼9. In addition, we exploited FEROS spectra available from the ESO public data archive 3 . These latter data were taken with various FEROS instrument setups and have a variety of S/N ratios. Altogether, we considered in this paper 77 spectra for 64 stars.</p><p>The FEROS spectra extend between 3600Å3600Å and 9200Å9200Å with a resolving power R = 48000 (?). All the data were reduced using a modified version of the FEROS-DRS pipeline (running under the ESO-MIDAS context FEROS), which yields the wavelength-calibrated, merged, normalized spectrum. The reduction steps were the following: bias subtraction and bad-column masking; definition of the echelle orders on flat-field frames; subtraction of the background diffuse light; order extraction; order-by-order flat-fielding; determination of wavelength-dispersion solution by means of ThAr calibration-lamp exposures; order-by-order nor-3 archive.eso.org malization; rebinning to a linear wavelength-scale with barycentric correction; and merging of the echelle orders.</p><p>We also considered FEROS spectra of our targets obtained by ?, reduced with the instrument pipeline and kindly provided to us by the SACY team. We refrained from systematically repeating the measurement of the spectroscopic parameters, but we considered the SACY spectra for in-depth evaluation of individual cases (e.g. suspected spectroscopic binaries), as reported in App. B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">HARPS Spectra</head><p>For our investigation, we also considered the spectra obtained with HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope in La Silla (?) as part of planet search surveys by the Geneva team (?) and the ? RV survey of early type stars. We also retrieved additional HARPS spectra available in the ESO archive. Most of these come from the RV survey for planets around young stars by ?, with a few individual spectra from other projects. Overall, we have considered HARPS spectra for 13 objects, with the number of spectra per object ranging from 1 to 77.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">CORALIE Spectra</head><p>Observations of 11 targets were performed with the CORALIE spectrograph at the Euler 1.2m telescope in La Silla from January 2012 to August 2013 with the main goal of checking the binarity of the objects in our sample through RV determination and line profile evaluation. The spectra were reduced with the instrument on-line pipeline. Spectra of six additional stars observed as part of the CORALIE exoplanet search survey (?) were also considered in our analysis.</p></div>

We also analyzed the CES spectra of the components of HD 16699 A and B obtained by ? (kindly provided by L. Pastori) to understand the origin of discrepancies between results from the literature and results from our own analysis, which turned out to be due to an exchange of binary system components (see App. B for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Determination of spectroscopic parameters</head><p>We exploited the FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE spectra to measure several spectroscopic parameters useful for stellar characterization and age determination. Our determinations (i.e., heliocentric RV, v sin i, effective temperature, lithium equivalent width, S-index and log R HK ) are listed in Tables ??, 10, 11, and 12 for the different datasets and the procedure to measure them are described below.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">FEROS</head><p>The heliocentric RV and the projected rotational velocity (v sin i) were determined by cross-correlating the object spectra with low-v sin i template spectra (HD 80170, K5 III-IV, RV ∼ 0 km/s) obtained with the same instrument and reduced in the same way. The normalized target spectra were preliminarily rebinned to a logarithmic wavelength scale and split into six wavelength-ranges that were free of emission lines and of telluric absorptions (cf. ?). A Gaussian profile was fitted to the peak of the crosscorrelation function (CCF), computed in each of the six distinct spectral ranges. The resulting RV values were averaged with appropriate weights (?). The projected rotational velocity v sin i was derived from the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the cross-correlation peak in each of the six ranges above. The relation FWHM-v sin i was obtained by convolving the template spectra with rotational profiles of v sin i from 1 to 100 km/s. Our measurements of heliocentric RV and v sin i are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table ?</ref>?.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">HARPS and CORALIE</head><p>RV and FWHM of CCF are directly delivered by the instrument pipelines, which are based on the Weighted CCF technique (?). For moderately fast rotators, the correlation was performed by increasing the width of the region used in the CCF fit according to the line width. For some very fast rotators (v sin i ∼ 50 km/s) observed with CORALIE, we simply measured the positions of a few very strong lines in the spectra to derive the RVs. For fast-rotating A and F type stars observed with HARPS, we also obtained differential RV using the SAFIR code (?), which is optimized for this kind of analysis. The transformation between FWHM and v sin i was performed as described in ?. Spectroscopic parameters derived from CORALIE and HARPS spectra are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 10, 11</ref>, and 12.</p></div>

The listed EW does not include corrections for blends with close lines, which occur for stars with significant rotation. Typical measurement errors are of the order of ≤ 5 m ˚ A while for fast rotators they are up to ∼ 50 m ˚ A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">T eff determinations</head><p>The determinations of the spectroscopic effective temperature in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Tables ?? and 12</ref> for FEROS and HARPS spectra respectively were obtained through the method based on EW ratios of spectral absorption lines. These were acquired by means of the ARES 4 automatic code (?), using the calibration for FGK dwarf stars by ?. The quoted errors are the internal ones and do not include calibration uncertainties. When multiple spectra are available, we list the mean values and the error of the mean, which are below 10 K, well <ref type="bibr">4</ref> http://www.astro.up.pt/∼sousasag/ares/ below systematics. For rotational velocity above ≈ 20 km/s, the number of measured line-ratios drops drastically with correspondingly larger errors, due to increased line blending. The temperature determinations become less reliable for v sin i larger than 30 km/s (?). For five stars with both FEROS and HARPS spectra available, the spectroscopic temperatures resulting from the two instruments are fully consistent (mean difference ∆T eff(FEROS−HARPS) = −4 K with an r.m.s. dispersion of 34 K). Four stars have more than 10 spectra with HARPS, enabling an estimate of the intrinsic variability of effective temperature, which results in 20-50 K r.m.s. In some cases, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for HIP 32235, temperature variations show significant correlations with chromospheric activity. This is due to large spots covering the stellar photosphere when the star is active. This issue will be further examined in a forthcoming study ( <ref type="bibr">Messina et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">in preparation)</ref>. Larger temperature variations (≥ 100 K) are expected to be present for the stars in our sample with very high levels of magnetic activity and photometric variability (see e.g. ?). Photometric temperatures were obtained from B-V, V-I and V-K colors using the calibrations by ? (adopting metallicity from the literature when available [see Sect. 9.2] and assuming solar metallicity otherwise). The comparison between photometric and spectroscopic temperatures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref> shows that stars with faster rotation show larger dispersion, as expected for an increasing role of line blending. Large scatter is also observed for F-type stars. This is likely due to the moderately fast rotation of most of these stars in our sample and also due to an effective temperature which is close to the limit of the ? calibration or even beyond it in some cases. The available spectral types further support the photometric temperatures in these discrepant cases.</p><p>When considering only stars with v sin i &lt; 15 km/s and FEROS spectra (24 stars), the mean difference (photometric minus spectroscopic temperatures) is −52 K, with an rms dispersion of 111 K. A systematic trend, with spectroscopic temperature being warmer, appears to be present below 5300 K, while results for solar-type stars agree very well (mean difference −2 K with r.m.s. dispersion of 79 K for 16 stars with v sin i &lt; 15 km/s and T eff &gt; 5400 K).</p><p>Small amounts of interstellar or circumstellar absorption might be present in some individual cases, therefore biasing the photometric temperature, but this is not a general explanation for the systematic offset observed for the coolest stars. A similar discrepancy in effective temperature for cool stars was observed by ?, when comparing their spectroscopic temperatures with those based on the Infrared Flux Method as implemented by ?. This was interpreted by ? as being due to the increasing errors in the spectroscopic analysis at cooler temperatures, as the analysis is differential with respect to the Sun.</p><p>Considering the additional uncertainties that are specific to active young stars, such as photometric and spectroscopic variability, the effects of magnetic activity on the stellar atmosphere structure, and a slightly lower gravity for the youngest stars, we consider the agreement between photometric and spectroscopic temperature satisfactory. A full understanding of the contribution of these source of errors on spectroscopic and photometric temperatures is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The temperature calibration by ? is mostly based on old stars. Its application to our sample should then be checked. ? have recently developed an effective temperature scale which is optimized for 5-30 Myr old stars, then applicable to a significant fraction of our targets. We considered the stars in their <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 9</ref> with effective temperature between 4000 to 7000 K and compared to the effective temperatures derived from ? calibration using B-V, V-I and V-K colors. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. It results that there is no significant offset between the two temperature scales (mean difference of +3 K and median -3 K for single stars), with a scatter of 34 K, with a possible trend vs temperature. We also compared the effective temperatures for Sco-Cen members from ? finding comparable results.</p><p>Therefore, the differences of effective temperatures from colors (at least for the combination of colors we used) are quite small. This is consistent with the difference of 40 K with respect to ? for six stars in common quoted in ?. The difference is instead much larger for temperatures derived from spectral types.</p><p>There is another concern in the application of ? relations to our sample stars: if the origin of the differences of temperature scale of main sequence and pre-main sequence stars is linked to the lower stellar gravity at the youngest age, its use should be limited to stars younger than about 30 Myr (and possibly even younger for F-G stars). If instead is due to the effects of phenomena related to the magnetic activity, as plages and star spots (cfr. their sect. 5), then the calibration should be applied also to stars up to 100-120 Myr old, which have similar activity levels of β Pic and Tuc-Hor MGs members, and to old tidally-locked binaries.</p><p>Henceforth, we will adopt the photometric temperatures using the ? scale, as these are homogeneously available for all targets and are likely more accurate than the spectroscopic temperature for cool stars and objects with high v sin i, as discussed above.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">The ASAS photometry</head><p>The ASAS project monitors all stars brighter than V=14 mag at declinations δ &lt; +28 • , with a typical sampling of 2 days. Since the ASAS archive contains data from 1997 to date, the time-series it provides are particularly suitable for investigating variability over different time scales, specifically for probing the activity-induced rotational modulation. ASAS provides aperture photometry through five apertures. For each star in our sample, we adopted the aperture that gave the highest photometric precision (i.e., the minimum average magnitude uncertainty), which is the range 0.02-0.03 mag for target stars under analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">The SuperWASP photometry</head><p>The public SuperWASP light curves are available for a time interval from 2004 to 2008 for both the northern and southern observatories. Although temporal and spatial coverage are irregular, SuperWASP stars at the most favourable sky declinations have observation sequences up to nine hours long with a sampling of about ten minutes, making the data more sensitive than that of ASAS for revealing periods &lt; 1 d. Our analysis is based on the processed flux measurements obtained through application of the SYSREM algorithm (?). The typical photometric accuracy for the targets under study is of the order of 0.01-0.02 mag. Owing to differences with respect to the standard Johnson V-band ASAS photometry, we decided to analyse the SuperWASP data-set independently, without merging it with ASAS data. SuperWASP observations from 2004 to 2005 were collected without a filter, with the spectral transmission being defined by the optics, detector, and atmosphere. In the subsequent years, observations were collected through a wide-band filter (400-700 nm).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3.">The Hipparcos photometry</head><p>For a limited number of targets, Hipparcos photometry was also available. However, owing to very irregular sampling and low photometric precision, we were able to derive rotation periods for only a handful of these stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4.">Data from the literature</head><p>For all of our targets, we searched the literature for published period determinations. We focused on published measurements that used the same time-series as our own measurements, i.e. the ASAS Catalogue of Variable Stars (ACVS), and the search for variable stars from SuperWASP (?). We also retrieved 17 rotation periods from <ref type="bibr">Messina et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Messina et al. ( , 2011</ref>, and 22 rotation periods from other sources (see Appendix B). For most of the published periods, we were able to confirm the values with our own analyses. We relied solely on literature values only for HIP 46637 and HIP 71908.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Photometry rotation period search</head><p>We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method (???) and the Clean algorithm (?) to search for the rotation periods. As demonstrated in ??, the most accurate approach to infer the rotation period of late-type stars from the light rotational modulation is to perform the period search on the whole time-series and also on associated time segments when a sufficiently long time-series is available (generally longer than one observing season). This approach not only speeds up the period detection process, but also prevents other phenomena, e.g. the growth and decay of active regions, whose typical timescales are longer than the period of the rotational modulation, from distorting period determinations.</p><p>For the present investigation, we had at our disposal ASAS time-series up to 10 yr long and SuperWASP timeseries up to 4 yr long. We therefore segmented both datasets into sub-time-series, each corresponding typically to one yearly observation season. This approach was unsuitable for Hipparcos data, owing to low and uneven sampling; in that case the analysis was only performed on the whole time-series.</p><p>A detailed description of the period search method is given in ?. Here we briefly recall that the false alarm probability (FAP) associated with the period determination is computed by using Monte Carlo bootstrap methods on 1000 simulated light curves; the FAP is the probability that a peak of a given height in the periodogram is caused simply by statistical variations, i.e., due to Gaussian noise. For each complete time-series and for each time segment, a corresponding FAP was computed. Only periods with FAP ≤ 1% were retained for subsequent analysis. The uncertainty associated with each period was computed from the FWHM of the main power peak in the window function, following the methods of ?.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Period results</head><p>The results of our period search are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table  11</ref>, where we list for each target the rotation period, its uncertainty, and a flag on the confidence level of the determination. On a sample of 99 targets, we were able to determine the rotation period for 70 objects. Specifically, 27 periods are determined in this study for the first time, while the remaining 43 are retrieved from the literature (17 out of 43 from ??). For 25 out of these 43 targets, we were able to retrieve either ASAS or SuperWASP photometry, carry out our independent analysis, and confirm the literature values. As described in ?, periods derived in at least five segments, or in less than five but with an independent confirmation from the literature, and that are consistent with the v sin i, will be referred to as confirmed periods (C). Periods derived from less than five time segments, but are consistent with v sin i, and that produce mean sinusoidal fit residuals smaller than the light-curve amplitude in at least five segments, will be referred to as likely periods (L). Periods derived from less than five segments that produce mean sinusoidal fit residuals smaller than the light-curve amplitude in less than five segments, or with only 1-2 determinations in the literature, or that are inconsistent with vsin i, will be referred to as uncertain periods (U). We have 40 confirmed periods, 14 likely periods, 14 uncertain, periods and 2 taken from the literature alone.</p><p>We could not determine the rotation periods for 29 out of 99 stars in our sample. Sixteen of the 29 stars with unknown periods have spectral types earlier than F8. These stars are expected to have very shallow external convection zones and, consequently, very low activity levels. Therefore, any eventual rotational modulation is unlikely to be detected by analysis of ground-based data 8 . In the case of HIP 71908 (F1Vp), a low-amplitude (∼ 5 mmag) modulation was detected by space-based observations (?). The remaining 13 stars, although of late spectral type, exhibited non-periodic variability. In several cases, they are members of binary systems which are not spatially resolved in ASAS and Super-WASP images; ASAS and Super-WASP have pixel scales of 15.5 and 13.7 arcsec respectively (?). Individual cases are discussed in Appendix B. A summary of the results of our period search for the individual seasons and additional details are provided in Appendix D.</p></div>

Most of the measurements obtained with FEROS are single-epoch while those from the CORALIE planet search and some of those from HARPS archive are multi-epoch over months or years, then partially averaging the variability of the chromospheric emission on timescales of the rotation period and the activity cycle of the star. The activity measurement of HIP 46634 was obtained by the SOPHIE Consortium following the procedures described in ?. When available, we also considered additional data from the literature (Appendix A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">X-ray emission</head><p>The target list was cross-correlated with the ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) catalog (??), adopting a matching radius of 30 arcsec. X-ray fluxes were derived using the calibration by ?. For wide multiple systems that were unresolved by ROSAT (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref>), a suitable correction to the flux was included on the basis on the bolometric flux ratio of the components. In a couple of cases (HD 16699 A and B; HIP 72399/72400), the availability of XMM observations at higher spatial resolution enabled us to identify the main source of the X-ray emission in a binary system. For the <ref type="bibr">8</ref> An exception is represented by HD 32981 (F8V). F-type stars occasionally exhibit spots sufficiently large enough to induce light modulation with amplitude of a few hundredths of a magnitude (see e.g. ?), thus enabling detection from groundbased observatories systems HIP 35564 and HIP 25434/6, whose primaries are early-F stars, we assumed that the whole X-ray emission comes from the secondary. However, this assumption is uncertain, as both primaries are spectroscopic binaries and then the additional late-type star might contribute significantly to the integrated X-ray flux.</p><p>The hardness-ratios HR1=(B-A)/(B+A) and HR2=(D-C)/(D+C), where A, B, C and D are the integrated counts in the energy range 0.11-0.41 keV, 0.52-2.01 keV, 0.52-0.90 keV, and 0.91-2.01 keV, respectively, are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. The two stars TYC 7743-1091-1 and TYC 6781-0415-1 are found to be hard X-ray sources with HR1 close to 1. Three stars, HIP 71933, TYC 6818-1336-1 and TYC 5736-0649-1, are moderately hard sources (HR1 ∼ 0.4 -0.6). The hardness-ratios can be used to derive clues on stellar age, as the members of young moving groups 10-30 Myr old typically have soft X-ray emission while hard emission is observed for classical T Tauri stars (??). Hard X-ray emission might in principle be due to interstellar or circumstellar absorption (?), but the aforementioned hard X-ray sources likely exhibit emission due to flare activity (see ?, and references therein).</p><p>For stars which are not detected by ROSAT, upper limits on X-ray luminosity were derived considering the integration time of the nearest X-ray source in the ROSAT Faint Source Catalog.</p><p>To estimate the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity R X = log(L X /L bol ), we derived the luminosities of the targets using the apparent V magnitude, the bolometric correction from ? and the distances derived in Sect. 9.1. We converted the bolometric magnitude, defined as M bol = V + BC V + 5 log π + 5, to L/L ⊙ using M bol⊙ = 4.73, as recommended by ?. The interstellar extinction was assumed to be negligible since all targets are relatively nearby, except for a few individual cases where there existed evidence of modest reddening (see Sect. 9.1 and App. B).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Correlations of activity indicators and rotation</head><p>Coronal and chromospheric emissions are in general expected to show correlation with the rotation period, as their origin is tied to the rotation itself (see, e.g., ?). On the other hand, at very fast rotational velocities and activity levels, correlations are no longer observed, as the star enters the so-called "saturated regime". To evaluate the status of our targets and also to check for peculiar discrepant cases that might distort the observed quantities (e.g. aliases of the true rotation period), we evaluate here the correlation between activity and rotation. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows the correlation between log R HK vs log L X /L bol for the stars in our sample. A similar slope is observed for the whole range of emission levels. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. log R HK vs log L X /L bol for the stars in our sample <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> shows the Rossby number (used here to take the dependence of the rotation period on color into account, ?) vs log R HK and log L X /L bol . The change in slope due to the saturation effects is clearly seen in the log L X /L bol plot.</p><p>We also compared the measured rotation period with the expected one based on the Ca II H&amp;K and X-ray coronal emission and calibrations by ?. In the first case ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>; upper panel), the correlation between predicted and observed rotation period is low for stars with fast rotation. This effect was also noted by ?, who propose that this may be explained by 1) a larger intrinsic variability compared to stars with slower rotation rates, 2) a sparseness of activity measurements, and 3) a spread in convective turnover times due to a mixing of main sequence and pre-main sequence stars. One should also consider that a proper calibration of the S index into the standard Mt. Wilson scale is challenging at high activity levels, due to the paucity of suitable calibrators and the presence of intrinsic variability of the chromospheric emission. Therefore, mixing results from independent sources (as done here) might result in an increased scatter. Furthermore, for projected rotational velocities larger than about 40 km/s, the emission of the Ca II H&amp;K cores is spread out beyond the ∼ 1 ˚ A window typically used for the measurement of the S-Index (?).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Multiplicity, close companions and discs</head><p>We summarize here the evidence for additional stellar companions either at wide or close separations. A complete census of stellar multiplicity is important for several reasons. For instance, the presence of a close companion can bias the derivation of stellar parameters, as is the case for photometric distance. A wide companion may also be used to provide additional diagnostics to constrain the properties of the target. More generally, knowledge of target environment is important for the proper interpretation of the astrophysical results of our NaCo imaging program, and for comparisons with other surveys. Beside stellar multiplicity, the presence of disks is also relevant in this context. There are four stars with resolved debris disks in our sample: HIP 11360, HD 61005, HIP 76829, and HIP 99273. They are discussed in App. B. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Observed rotation period vs the expected rotation period from the value of log R HK (upper panel) and R X (lower panel), derived using the <ref type="bibr">Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand (2008)</ref> calibrations. Filled circles represent stars with confirmed or lilely rotation period. Empty circles represent stars with uncertain rotation period. The outlier in the upper panel is represented by HIP 79958. As the measured rotation period appears to be robust, the discrepancy may be due to poor sampling of H&amp;K variability or due to calibration issues resulting from the low temperature of the star. See App. B for further details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Visual binaries</head><p>Several new close binaries were discovered as part of the NaCo-LP. The details of their discovery are reported in the companion paper presenting the direct imaging results ( <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2013</ref>). We summarize here their properties, as the binarity has to be taken into account to correct photometric distances and temperatures; binarity is also relevant for a proper interpretation of the age indicators. Three close binaries were previously known: HIP 108422 (?, physical association confirmed by our NaCo observations), TYC 7835-2569-1 (?), and TYC 6786-0811-1 (?). Three of the newly discovered companions are proposed members of the AB Dor moving group (MG) and one belongs to the ǫ Cha group. These discoveries contribute to the census of stellar multiplicity at young ages in loose associations (?).</p><p>Several targets have wide companions (defined here as those with projected separation larger than 6 arcsec) whose presence and association were either already established in the literature or are proposed here. They are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref>. These wide companions are outside NaCo's field of view so they did not impact target selection. To estimate the reliability of these wide pairs as true bound <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 5</ref>. Close visual binaries discovered or confirmed by NaCo-LP AO observations. We list the name of the star, the projected separation measured with NaCo (from the companion paper <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2013</ref>), in mas and in AU, the magnitude difference in H band. systems, we followed the methods of ? to calculate the separation, projected separation (assuming identical distance as the brighter companion), and proper motion difference for all candidate wide binaries. We used relations in ? and ? to place statistical constraints on the likelihood that binary pairs are real and physically bound. From the fractional proper motion difference of the components, f r µ = ∆ µ /avg µ , where ∆ µ is the proper motion difference and avg µ is the average proper motion of the components, ? show that a f r µ ≤ 0.2 is indication that the pair is likely physically bound. We also used the statistic ∆ X , from ?, which uses a power law to describe the relationship between separation, ∆ µ , and avg µ . If ∆ X &lt; 1.0, the pair is likely bound. This statistic is calibrated only for stars with 150 mas/yr &lt; µ &lt; 450 mas/yr. Thus, it could be less useful for stars with smaller proper motion where the relationship may not follow a power law. The analysis shows that most of the wide pairs in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref> are likely bound. Measured parameters such as age, distance, and moving group membership can therefore be shared between the components. All stars for which ∆ X &gt; 1.0 are stars that have avg µ &lt; 150 mas/yr, implying that this statistic is less useful. For these stars, the f r µ is probably a better indication of a physically bound nature, although it is not as strong a constraint as ∆ X . Finally, we note that several of the proposed binaries are actually hierarchical multiples, as revealed by imaging of tight visual companions and observed RV variations (see App. B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Spectroscopic and astrometric binaries</head><p>We summarize in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 7</ref> the presence of spectroscopic binarity among our targets, considering both RV variability and the presence of multiple components in the spectra (SB2). Two critical issues prevent firm conclusions in some specific cases. 1) For single-epoch spectra, line-profile analysis of young, active stars often reveals deformation due to star spots crossing the stellar disk. It is difficult to distin-guish between such effects and the presence of a companion.</p><p>2) The evaluation of the significance of the proposed RV variations depends on the adopted error bars, which are often not available in the literature data. Furthermore, there are cases where significant RV variations, of amplitudes up to a few km/s, can be caused by stellar or circumstellar phenomena, such as variable obscuration from a circumstellar disk (see e.g. ?, for the case of T Cha) or stellar oscillations in the case of early type stars. A couple of suspected astrometric binaries is also included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 7</ref>. Proper motions were taken from Tycho2 (?) and ? when available. For HIP 46634/7 and HIP 58240/1, we instead adopted the original Hipparcos values (?) (see Sect. 9.1).</p><p>For HIP 25434/6, we adopted the long term proper motion from Tycho2 as there are indications that the Hipparcos astrometry is biased by the presence of an additional component (see App. B). Absolute RVs were derived from our own spectra and extensive literature compilation (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table ?</ref>?).</p><p>A minimum error bar of 0.5 km/s was adopted to take into account the uncertainties in the absolute RV and the uncertainties in the zero-point systematics between different instruments. The determination of distances is discussed in Sect. 9.1. The space positions and space velocities and their uncertainties were derived using relations from ?. In these calculations, we have used the J2000 transformation matrix, taken from the introduction to the Hipparcos catalog, to convert to Galactic coordinates. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 8</ref> presents the list of moving groups, associations, and solar-neighborhood open clusters considered in our kinematic analysis. Adopted parameters are described for each group. If the uncertainties in the U, V, and W space velocities of the associations were quoted in the literature, we included those in the analysis. If no uncertainties were quoted, we used a conservative uncertainty estimate of ±1 km/s for moving groups and ±2 km/s for open clusters. We considered the Young, Nearby Population to be represented by stars within the U,V, and W boundaries defined by ?, as also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. ? noted that the majority of solarneighborhood stars within ∼60 pc that are younger than 50 Myr have kinematic parameters within these boundaries. However, it should be considered that old stars in the same kinematic space outnumber true young stars. Therefore, independent indicators of youth are required for a firm inference on stellar age. HIP 71908 is an example of a moderately old star with kinematics similar to those of young stars (see App. B). The adopted ages are presented in Sect. 8.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Membership to nearby associations</head><p>We then calculated the significance in the difference (SigD) between U, V, and W galactic velocities, calculated for each NaCo-LP target and each association in the above list. As an example, the SigD for the U velocity is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SigD U = (U star − U group ) (dU star ) 2 + (dU group ) 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The SigD value represents how many sigma separate the space velocity of the target from that of the group being considered. In our analyses of NaCo-LP targets, we considered U, V, and W space velocities to be consistent with membership if it had a SigD ≤ 2.0 in each of the U, V and W velocities. This is only one indication that a star may belong to a given association, but it serves as a first step in the process to define bona fide membership. We further checked moving group membership by calculating Bayesian membership probabilities using the on-line tools BANYAN I and II (??). The on-line versions of these tools use only the available kinematics for this star as input and do not consider the star's age (e.g. CMD position) We used all available kinematic information for each star as input (coordinates and our adopted proper motions, radial velocities, and distances). In several cases, the two versions of BANYAN yield highly discrepant results. This is likely caused by changes to prior, UVWXYX distributions, and the definition of the Galactic field between the first and second iterations of BANYAN (?). A detailed comparison of the differences between the two tools is beyond the scope of this paper. We indicate the targets where discrepancies arise along with further details regarding target ages and group membership in Appendix B. In most cases we confirm the membership assignments by ? and ? and we identify some possible additional members. Discrepancies for individual cases are mostly due to differences in the kinematic data (e.g. RV in the case of HIP 11360). Different membership criteria adopted in the various studies also play a role. A large number of the NaCo-LP targets are found to be kinematically consistent with the Young, Nearby Population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Absolute ages of nearby Moving Groups</head><p>Our age determination is mostly based on comparison of indirect indicators as measured for individual NACO-LP targets to those of members of groups and clusters, such as β Pic, Tucana, Columba, Carina, AB Dor, Pleiades, and Hyades. While the age ranking of these groups is mostly defined, the absolute values of their ages is widely debated in the literature. A full assesment of the issue of the absolute ages is beyond the scope of this paper but we present the motivation of our adopted ages for the youngest groups for which members are found within the NACO-LP sample. We anticipate that for some of the groups considered below (β Pic, IC 2391, Pleiades) there is a systematic discrepancy between ages obtained using the lithium depletion boundary of low mass stars with respect to isochrone fitting, with the first method yielding older ages. This trend is common to several other open clusters (e.g. ?).</p></div>

The study by Mamajek and collaborators (in preparation, preliminary results presented in ?) claims that the group was not smaller in the past, ruling out a 12 Myr age at &gt; 3 sigma.</p><p>An older age for β Pic would allow to reconcile the result by ? that stars in LCC and UCL are slightly younger than those of β Pic MG (from the comparison of Lithium EW as a function of color) to the absolute ages of UCL and LCC of 16 and 17 Myr respectively, derived using isochrone fitting, including the recent work by ?.</p><p>Performing isochrone fitting to β Pic MG members with trigonometric parallax, adopting the photometric temperatures as in Sect. 4.3 and using ? models as described in Sect. 9.3, yields an age of 16±2 Myr (internal error only) midway between the original 12 Myr estimate and the recent one based on lithium depletion boundary. To check the reliability of our result, we considered the F-type stars in Sco-Cen region recently studied by ? and we got very similar results, our ages being older by about 1 Myr.</p><p>Considering the uncertianties related to the various techniques we adopt 16 ± 6 Myr as our age for the β Pic MG. This estimate has the additional advantage of being homogeneous with the age determination from isochone fitting performed for our program stars in Sect. 9.3. For the Sco-Cen subgroups the ages by ? were adopted, with lower limits to the ages proposed by ? for UCL and LCC and by ? and ? for US.</p><p>In our sample, there are also two members of the ǫ Cha group. ? adopt an age of 6 Myr.

Reference sequences at various ages were built using members of moving groups with available trigonometric parallaxes. Target distance was then derived based on the multi-band photometry, adopted age, and the reference calibration. Typical scatter in these standard relations implies errors of about 15-20% in the photometric distances <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8</ref>). The presence of known companions was taken into account including correction to the unresolved photometry when applicable. Interstellar reddening was checked by comparing photometric temperature, spectroscopic temperatures when available, and spectral types from the literature. In a few cases of stars with distance close or slightly above 100 pc, the presence of small amounts of reddening (E(B − V ) ≤ 0.1 mag) was suggested. Photometric distances have larger errors for very young stars (age 5-20 Myr). In these instances the absolute magnitude and derived distances depend sensitively on the adopted ages; the derived values would be systematically underestimated for unidentifed cases of evolved RS CVn variables. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.

We used the tool param (?) 11 adapted to use the ? stellar evolutionary models. Param performs a Bayesian determination of the most likely stellar intrinsic properties, weighting all the isochrone sections compatible with the measured parameters (metallicity, effective temperature, parallax, apparent magnitude) and their errors. It adopts a flat distribution of ages, within a given interval, as a prior. We found that ? models are very similar to those by ? and ?, at least for effective temperatures warmer than 4500 -4000 K. Differences at T eff &lt; 4000 K are not of concern for the analysis of the stars in our sample.</p><p>In most cases, isochrone fitting yields very poor constraints on stellar ages (e.g. errors of a few Gyrs), which is expected for stars close to the main sequence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref>). Tighter constraints are derived from indirect indicators such as lithium and rotation-activity phenomena (see Sect. 9.4). The stellar masses and ages resulting from isochrone fitting, within the whole range of input stellar parameters, are correlated, with older ages yielding lower stellar masses. To infer the stellar masses corresponding to the plausible ages of our targets, we run the param interface a second time for these targets, adopting the minimum and maximum ages from <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table ?</ref>?, and keeping fixed the other input parameters. Differences in stellar masses with respect to the unconstrained run are typically of about 0.02 − 0.04 M ⊙ , with larger masses occurring when adopting the age limits from the indirect indicators. The param tool also provides the stellar radii, which were coupled with the measured v sin i to estimate the reliability of detected rotation periods (see App. B for discussion on individual objects). The isochrone ages of the few targets for which this method contributes significantly to determination of stellar ages are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table ?</ref>?.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.4.">Stellar Ages</head><p>Our approach to age determination is to consider all the indicators available to us to better understand the properties of each object and derive stellar age. The lesson we got from the case of HIP 6177 (?) is that significant discrepancies between age indicators may hide an astrophysical situation different from a normal young star (the expected typical target in our survey) and therefore require an indepth investigation.</p><p>In the previous sections we provided several parameters (Lithium EW, Ca II H&amp;K emission, X-ray emission, rotation period) which are known to depend on stellar age. The stellar age from Lithium was estimated for each target from a comparison of measured Lithium EW with that of confirmed members of young moving groups and clusters of similar color <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10</ref>). For Ca II H&amp;K emission, X-ray emission, and rotation period, we adopted the age calibration by ? 12 . Our target stars have colors extending outside some of the validity limits of these calibrations (B-V between 0.5 to 0.9 for log R HK and X-ray emission). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>, the results from known group members support the use of these relations for most of our target stars, even when they are slightly outside the formal boundaries, leaning toward the red side (from B-V=0.9 up to B-V=1.2 -1.3). On the blue side the situation is different, as both log R HK and R X becomes smaller when increasing temperature at fixed age, due the vanishing of the stellar magnetic activity when the external convective zone of the star become too thin. Therefore, the extrapolation of the ? calibrations would provide a significant overestimate of the stellar age 13 . The <ref type="bibr">12</ref> There are some differences between our adopted ages for groups and clusters and those on which the ? calibration is based, but they are mostly confined to the youngest groups (β Pic and Upper Scorpius), then in an age range for which our age estimate is primarity based on other indicators. 13 Actually; from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> it results that RX is smaller for stars with B-V ∼ 0.5 with respect coeval stars with redder colors, indicating that the color dependence starts to become important already in the range of ? calibration  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 12</ref> as upper limits.</p><p>The measurement of stellar age from rotation period (gyrochronology) is becoming increasingly popular, as it is not vulnerable to the time variability that characterizes the choromospheric and coronal emissions. However, it should be noted that a group of coeval young stars usually distributes along two sequences: that of very fast rotators ('C' sequence following the nomenclature by ?) and that of slower rotators, with rotation period increasing with color ('I' sequence; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>). The gyrochronology calibration applies only to stars on the 'I' sequence; for stars on the 'C' its use is not appropriate and only supports a young age for the star.</p><p>Age from isochrone fitting has been derived in Sect. 9.3. As discussed above, in most cases isochrone fitting does not add tighter constraints on stellar age when compared to other methods, since the star position on the CMD is very close to the main sequence. For stars that are off of the main sequence, the use of other age indicators (e.g. lithium) allows us to conclusively discriminate between case of young pre-main sequence stars and evolved post-main sequence stars, and to assign corresponding ages. Position on the CMD is also affected by the presence of companions. Having sensitivity with NaCo imaging down to a few-AU separation for stellar companions, and having checked for the presence of blended components in high resolution spectra for most of our target stars, we think we have identified most cases of binary companions contributing significantly to the integrated flux of the system. However, the possibility of a few remaining cases can not be excluded.</p><p>Finally, as discussed in Sect. 8.2, kinematic parameters alone can not be considered as conclusive proof of a given stellar age value, as numerous old stars occupy the same kinematic space of young stars. Final assignment of membership to groups is based on both the kinematic analysis and the consistency of the age indicators with the age of the group. Ambiguous cases arise for stars where the other age indicators yield poor constraints, such as early F stars. The existence of space velocities firmly outside the kinematic space on which confirmed young stars are found (see for example the ? boundaries, also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>) is considered a strong indication for an age older than about 500 Myr.</p><p>The spread in rotation rates for coeval young stars (see e.g. ?) and the saturation of X-ray emission at fast rotation periods (?) make the dependence of these indicators shallow for young ages (ages smaller than the Pleiades), as discussed in e.g. ?. As an example, β Pic, Tucana-ColumbaCarina and AB Dor members overlap on the logL X /L bol vs B-V diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. Therefore, the exact numerical values resulting from age calibrations can not be taken at face value, but the consistency of activity and rotation is a strong indication of youth, unless fast rotation is due to alternative causes (see below). For such candidate young stars, lithium EW, kinematics and in a few cases isochrone fitting are more robust indicators of the stellar age.</p><p>Special care is required for close spectroscopic binaries. Tidal locking represents a viable alternative to young age for explaining the fast rotational velocity and high levels of chromospheric and coronal activity 14 . In these cases, indicators such as rotation period and coronal and chromospehric emission are not considered for age determination, and we rely only on indicators not directly linked to rotation, such as lithium, kinematics and isochrone fitting. For the spectroscopic binaries in our sample, the orbital period is typically not available, as the binarity was identified with just a handful of RV measurements, or even one single spectrum in the case of SB2. Therefore, we can not conclusively infer the tidal locking nature of active binary stars like TYC 7188-575-1 and TYC 5206-0915-1. Furthermore, the lack of an RV orbital solution prevents the determination of a system RV, adding uncertainties on the space velocities and effectively making them useless in some cases. Lithium EW is available in most cases, and age estimates for candidate tidally-locked binaries are primarily based on this diagnostic. However, it is possible that lithium abundance is also affected in close binaries, as it is often observed in RS CVn systems (?).</p><p>By applying these techniques, we derived ages for our target stars. The ages from individual indicators and the final adopted values are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table ?</ref>?. Most of them are confirmed to be young. Besides the tidally-locked systems and the star rejuvenated by the progenitor of its WD companion (HIP 6177, ?), other cases of old stars spuriously included in our sample are represented by the Li-rich giant HD 99409, by stars for which our determinations of age indicators are in contrast with the literature value (HIP 13008; HIP 114046), and by old interlopers in the kinematic space of young stars (HIP 71908, formerly classified as an Her-Lyr member).</p><p>Most of our target stars have not been previously observed in deep imaging and in several cases their ages have not been studied in detail. However, some of them were included independently in NICI imaging surveys (??). For the seven stars in common, we obtained identical ages for one member of AB Dor MG (HIP 14684) and one of HerLyr (HD 139664). HIP 99273 and TYC 8728-2262-1 were assigned to the β Pic MG in both cases, but there is a slight difference in the adopted group age. For HIP 11360, the star is classified as a β Pic member in NICI papers, while we adopt membership in the Tucana association, based on our revised system RV. For HD 61005, we adopt membership in Argus (40 Myr) while ? adopt an age of 100 Myr without assigning membership to any known group. Finally, HIP 71908 is included in the Her-Lyr membership in ?, while we claim it is a significantly older star with similar kinematics. While we are convinced of our adopted choices, this comparison is a further indication of the challenges represented by the age determination of young stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>We have performed a characterization of the targets of the NaCo-LP to probe the occurrence of exoplanets and brown dwarfs in wide orbits. To this aim we acquired spectroscopic data using FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE and retrieved additional spectroscopic data from public archives. From these spectra, we determined radial and projected rotational velocities, lithium equivalent widths, effective temperatures, and chromospheric emission of the targets. We also analyzed photometric time series available from ASAS and Super-WASP archives to derive rotation periods and investigate the stellar variability phenomena. These data were used to investigate basic properties of the targets of our deep-imaging planet search program. These basic properties included ages, distances, masses, and multiplicity. Such information is needed for a proper interpretation of the direct imaging results, which are presented in the companion paper by <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Histograms showing the distribution of age, distance, mass and metallicity are in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. The irregular behavior of the age distribution is due to members of MGs, which cluster at the same age in the histogram. The median age of the targets is 100 Myr. Few targets have estimated ages below 20 Myr and even fewer have ages older than 500 Myr, representing old interlopers for which our original selection criteria failed to remove. The presence of older interlopers is due to a variety of causes related to age estimation, as discussed in Sect. 9.4. The median distance of the stars in our sample is 63.7 pc. Considering that the region closest to the star is saturated or hidden by the coronagraph in our imaging observations ( <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2013)</ref>, our survey is then typically sensitive to projected separation down to about 20 AU. Stellar age and distance from the Sun are correlated, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>. This correlation is the result of the low space density of very young stars in the solar neighborhood, and of several nearby young stars being previously observed in other direct imaging surveys. The average metallicity of stars in the NaCo-LP sample is close to solar (median value [Fe/H]=-0.03), with a dispersion that is significantly smaller than that of old nearby stars studied in RV surveys, which include both moderately metal-poor stars and metal-rich stars (??). Furthermore, the stars with the lowest and highest metallicity in our sample are typically among the oldest ones, thus carrying limited weight in terms of detection limits of planetary companions. Therefore, the exploration of any correlation between the frequency of giant planets in wide orbits and metallicity appears to be challenging for the direct imaging technique.</p><p>The median stellar mass is 1.01 M ⊙ , with 94% of the stars having masses between 0.70 and 1.50 M ⊙ . Therefore, our sample is tuned to the study of the occurrence of planets in wide orbit around solar-type stars and complements the results of RV surveys, which are mostly focused in the same range of stellar masses. Young, low mass stars are virtually excluded by our adopted magnitude limits, while few early type stars with confirmed young ages were known at the time of our sample selection. However, dedicated imaging surveys devoted to the search for planets around early type stars were performed in recent years (??) while other authors focused their attention on low mass stars (?). Appropriate merging of these samples and of those of other surveys which are mostly focused on solar-type stars (e.g. ?) will allow a preliminary evaluation of the frequency of planets in wide orbits. We will address this issue in the forthcoming paper by <ref type="bibr">Vigan et al. (2014)</ref>. The soon-to-come new generation instruments such as SPHERE and GPI will allow an extension of these results to lower planetary masses and closer separations to the star, thus providing, when coupled with RV results, a complete view of the occurrence of giant planets over a wide range of separations.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Notes on individual objects</head><p>TYC 5839-0596-1: (ASAS 001208−1550.5) The star is flagged as SB2 in SACY and we confirm this classification. ? reports a photometric rotation period P=2.532d based on the ASAS photometry. We find two significant photometric periods, P=1.644d and P=2.53d, of comparable powers in almost all the seasonal Lomb-Scargle and Clean periodograms. The longer period is more consistent with v sin i = 18 kms −1 and with the radius of a K0IV PMS subgiant. P=1.644d is an alias, specifically a beat period between the star's rotation period and the ∼ 1d data sampling. This is a result of the rotation of the Earth and the fixed longitude of the observation site. The star has also a very large X-ray luminosity (log L X /L bol = −3.0). While we do not have the orbital period of the SB2, the similar v sin i of the two components suggests that this is a tidally locked system. The star also shows a moderately large lithium abundance, compatible with an age similar to the Pleiades. We are unable to conclude whether this is a true young binary or if the system is a RS CVn variable with a relatively large lithium abundance (see e.g. ?). The photometric distance was obtained assuming equal magnitudes for the components. TYC 0603-0461-1 = BD +07 85: (ASAS 003858+0829.0) New close visual binary from the NaCo-LP; ∆H = 0.10 mag at a projected separation of 74 mas, corresponding to 4.3 AU at the photometric distance, after correction for binarity. It is kinematically consistent with the Nearby, Young population. We find three photometric periods: P=3.60d, P=0.566d, and P=1.381d. Although they are all significant, their relative power changes from season to season. We have no v sin i measurements that together with the R = 1.026 R ⊙ stellar radius could allow us to fix an upper value to the rotation period. P=1.381d is the most significant period also revealed by the Clean analysis, and may be the stellar rotation period. However, the other periods cannot be ruled out. Considering the binarity and the small magnitude difference between the components, the multiple periodicities reported in the photometric analysis might be due to the different components. HIP 3924 = HD 4944: (ASAS 005024−6404.1;</p><p>1SWASP+J005024.31-640404.0) Our FEROS spectra indicate the presence of an additional component, which is more evident in the red part of the spectrum. Binarity is further supported by the RV difference of about 9 km/s between our RV and that measured by ?. Therefore the star is classified as SB2. We measured an RV difference of about 18 km/s between the components, with a line depth for the secondary that is about 30% that of the primary, at 6450Å6450Å. Our projected rotational velocity and Li EW are significantly different from those reported in the literature by ? and ?. The first discrepancy might be due to a different RV separation between the components at the time of observation.</p><p>For Li EW, our FEROS spectrum indicates that the two components have a similar lithium line depth. We find various significant photometric periodicities. Only one, P=9.3d, is consistent with vsin i = 8 kms −1 and the stellar radius. It is found in the complete ASAS series as well as in one segment. As the primary is classified as F7, it is possible that the photometric period belongs to the secondary. No period is derived from the Hipparcos photometric data. Lithium and log R HK indicators are consistent with an age comparable to the Hyades, while X-ray emission yields younger ages than the other indicators. These discrepancies may be linked to the blending of the components. The target's kinematics are only consistent with IC2391 and with the Nearby, Young population. We adopt an age of 500 Myr, with a lower limit at the age of the IC2391 MG. HIP 6177 = HD 8049: Moderately old star rejuvenated by stellar wind from the progenitor of its WD companion. The properties of the K dwarf and the WD companion and a description of the most probable evolution of the system are presented in ?. HIP 8038: New close binary from the NaCo-LP (∆H = 2.5 mag at 0.44 arcsec). There is also a wide companion, HIP 8039, which is 1.9 mag brighter and at a projected separation of 14.97 arcsec (this star was not observed as part of the NaCo-LP). All the components are included in the aperture photometry of ASAS and SuperWASP (referred to as ASAS 014314−2136.7 and 1SWASP+J014314.17-213656.5, respectively). Each season exhibits its own most significant period which differs from season to season in both ASAS and SuperWASP data. The most likely period in SuperWASP seems to be P=1.668d, but with a scattered phase light curve. No clear periodicity comes out from the Clean analysis or from the Hipparcos photometry. As the wide companion HIP 8039 is 1.9 mag brighter, the tentative rotation period most likely belongs to the brighter component. The target's kinematics and age are only consistent with the Young, Nearby population. HIP 10602 = HD 14228 = φ Eri (ASAS 021631−5130.7) Proposed in ? and ? as a high probability member of Tuc/Hor. Our analysis confirms that it has kinematics consistent, at the ≤ 1.0 sigma level, with the Tuc/Hor association ? tools also yield a very high membership probability. Torres et al. investigated colormagnitude diagram placement and found it to be consistent with Tuc/Hor membership. The star is quoted as binary in ? but the identification and properties of the companion are not provided. The candidate at about 90 arcsec (φ Eri B = CPD-52 284) is not physically associated, as reported in the Washington Double Star (WDS) catalog (?). This early-type star exhibits nonperiodic photometric variability. HIP 11360 = HD 15115 (ASAS 022616+0617.6). This F-type star's membership to the β Pic MG was first proposed by ?. ? concluded a possible membership (prob. 60%). ? instead propose that the star is a bona fide member of the Columba association. These estimates are based on the only RV measurement available in the literature previous to our work (8.8±3.0 km/s; ?). Our RV determination (1.7±1.0 km/s), which includes 8 HARPS and 2 FEROS spectra, has better accuracy and concludes a value quite different from the previ- Verifying the true membership will require further investigation, including confirmation of the adopted RV value with longer baseline observations. The star exhibits non-periodic photometric variability. HIP 11360 hosts a debris disk that is unique for its large asymmetry, being detected out to 315 AU on the east side and more than 550 AU on the west side (?). ? showed that the geometry is wavelength-dependent, and found indications of a gap in the disk at about 1 arcsec. TYC 8484-1507-1 = HD 16699B This star is a new close visual binary from the NaCo-LP observations (sep. 0.06 arcsec = 3.6 AU, ∆H=0.23 mag). SACY lists it as a possible SB. There is an additional component (HIP 12326 = HD 16699) at 8.7 arcsec, corresponding to a projected separation of 530 AU. According to ?, HD 16699 shows a composite spectrum, with one system of sharp lines and another system of broad lines superimposed. Since the RV is constant, this was interpreted as being due to a companion at moderately large separation. This would indicate a quadruple system. However, we note that the v sin i values of the two components in ? are roughly exchanged with respect to other studies in the literature <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">(Table A.1</ref>). An analysis of the CES spectra used in ? indicates that the components were indeed exchanged in the original study. In light of this fact, the new companion seen in the NaCo-LP is likely the same one appearing in the composite spectra by ?. The separation of a few AU is compatible with the lack of a measurable RV variation, given the short time baseline of the observations. Indeed, our FEROS spectrum of the primary does shows no indication of additional components, while a check of the spectra in the ? database confirms the composite nature of the secondary's spectrum. The two components of TYC 8484-1507-1 have similar magnitudes but very different v sin i values, pointing to an intrinsically large difference between their rotational velocities, or to a strong misalignment of their rotation axes, which would be unusual for such a close binary (?). The two stars are indistinguishable by the ASAS photometry (ASAS 023844−5257.0). The blended light curve shows variability, but exhibits no significant periodicity. The target's kinematics match only the IC2391 open cluster, with a correspondence of &lt;2.0 sigma. The target's sky position is inconsistent with confirmed IC2391 members, which all lie around RA=8h. However, the system could be an outlier of the kinematic association of young stars that ? proposes to comprise IC2391 and Argus. The age indicators are somewhat puzzling. The secondary has a lithium line above that of Pleiades stars with similar colors (which would be consistent with the possible association with Argus) while that of the primary is below. Ca II H&amp;K emission is also much stronger in the secondary (as was seen in SACY spectra). The system is not resolved in the ROSAT All Sky catalog, but XMM observations clearly indicate that the X-ray emission is concentrated on TYC 8484-1507-1 (the close visual pair seen with NaCo). These differences are not easy to reconcile. propose this star to be a bona fide member of the AB Dor MG. The target's kinematics match the AB Dor group within the 2.0 sigma threshold, the BANYAN II on-line tool yields high membership probability, and age indicators support this assignment. The rotation period P=5.46d was discovered by ? and subsequently confirmed by ?. There is no X-ray counterpart in the ROSAT all sky catalog. The closest source in the ROSAT Faint Source Catalog has an integration time significantly lower than the typical ones. This may be an indication of some instrumental issues that caused the non-validation of a source, as found for HD 61005 in ?. Therefore, we do not list in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 11</ref> any upper limit on X-ray luminosity. The effective temperature resulting from the spectral type quoted in Simabd and Hipparcos catalog (G0) is more than 500 K warmer than our photometric and spectroscopic ones. This is likely due to a wrong spectral classification. We adopt the revised classification (G8/K0V) by ?. TYC 8060-1673-1 = CD-46 <ref type="bibr">1064</ref>  the star is also broadly consistent with the ages of these groups, as all age indicators are within the distribution of known members. ? Bayesian analysis predicts an 85% probability of being a member of Columba at a distance of 93.5 pc. This is close to the photometric distance estimate of 98.7 pc. Membership to Columba association was also recently proposed by ?. On the other hand, ? BANYAN II web tool does not confirm this assignemnt, suggesting a possible membership to Carina (15%) or the field. The star is projected in front of the LMC. ? finds a photometric rotation period P=2.613. We also find the same period P=2.61d either from Lomb-Scargle or Clean analysis. TYC 5346-0132-1 = BD-8 1195: (ASAS 053835−0856.7) Proposed as a member of Columba by ?. At the &lt; 2.0 sigma level, its kinematics match TWA, Columba, and η Cha. However, the target's distance and position in the sky are inconsistent with TWA or η Cha membership. Also, the age indicators are more consistent with Columba than the other groups. Thus, the analysis reinforces the Columba membership assignment. ? tools predict 100% probability of Columba membership at a distance of 80.5 pc. This predicted distance for membership is nearly equal to our photometric distance of 81.2 pc. ? on-line tool yields a probability of 53.6%. ROSAT shows no X-ray counterparts within the adopted matching radius of 30 arcsec, but the bright X-ray source 1RXS J053835.1-085639 lies just above the threshold (angular distance of 32.5 arcsec from the optical source). The position of the X-ray source XMMSL1 J053834.6-085645 is 6 arscec apart from TYC 5346-0132-1, suggesting that 1RXS J053835.1-085639 is associated to TYC 5346-0132-1. The photometric period P=1.983d is found by both the Lomb-Scargle and the Clean analysis at high confidence level and in good agreement with the earlier determination by ?. ? Bayesian analysis tools, with our adopted parameters as input, predict 100% probability of Argus membership at a distance of 76.5 pc. On the other hand, membership is rejected by ? on-line tool. The FEROS RV by SACY and our measurement made with CORALIE differ from one another by 3.1 km/s. Considering the large v sin i of the star, we consider it a possible SB. Additional measurements are needed for confirmation of binarity. ? report a rotation period P=1.038d, subsequently confirmed by ?. HIP 36312 = HD 59659 is an F7 star at 81 arcsec from TYC 8128-1946-1. According to ?, the proper motions and distances are compatible with a physical association, but no spectroscopy was available to them to confirm this. The RV measured by us on two epochs is consistent with that of TYC 8128-1946-1; the trigonometric distance of HIP 36312 is compatible with the photometric and kinematic ones for TYC 8128-1946-1. The star was not detected in X-ray but it is moderately active and lithium-rich. Taking into account these indicators' reduced age sensitivity for F stars, we consider the age to be compatible with that of TYC 8128-1946-1. Therefore, we classified the two objects as physically associated, adopting the trigonometric distance of HIP 36312 for TYC 8128-1946-1. We also added HIP 36312 to the list of probable members of the Argus association. HIP 36414 = HD 59704 (ASAS 072931−3807.4) Proposed as a member of Carina-Near moving group by ?. However, the target's kinematics do not match the Carina-Near group at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. On the other hand, the age of the star is consistent with 200 Myr or greater. According to ? and ?, the star is an SB without an orbital solution (σ RV = 1.2 km/s). Our somewhat discrepant FEROS RV (∆ RV=2.6 km/s with respect to ?) further supports the presence of RV variability. We therefore classify this star as a likely SB, though additional measurements would be required for orbit determination. The system RV is also needed for a better assesment of MG membership. We also found non-periodic photometric variability. The star CCDM J07295-3807B, at about 12 arcsec separation, is not physically associated (?). HIP 36948 = HD 61005 Proposed as a member of Argus by ?. At the &lt; 1.0 sigma level its kinematics match only the Argus association. The ages derived for this star are all ∼ 100 Myr, slightly older than the ∼ 40 yr age of the group, but compatible with the Argus membership assignment. ? also propose this star as a bona fide member of Argus and this is further supported by ? on-line tool. In the Spitzer FEPS sample, this star exhibited the largest 24µm excess with respect to the photosphere (?). The star's disk was first resolved with HST (?), indicating the presence of two components: an external one shaped by interaction with the interstellar medium, and an internal ring or disk. Observations in the H-band performed as part of our NaCo-LP (?) enabled the characterization of the inner ring, showing a significant offset of its center with respect to the star and also showing a rather sharp inner rim. These properties might be due to the perturbation by a planetary companion, undetected in the available observations. HIP 37563 = HD 62850 Proposed as a member of Carina-Near moving group by ?. The target's kinematics match the Carina-Near group at the &lt; 1.0 sigma level and show no indication of matching any other group. Thus, the Zuckerman et al. membership assignment is confirmed. Our Lomb-Scargle and Clean analyses of the ASAS (ASAS 074236-5917.8) timeseries revealed two periods, P = 3.65d and P = 1.37d, in 7 out of 8 seasons as well as in the complete series. Considering the v sin i = 14 kms −1 and the stellar radius R = 1.055 R ⊙ , we infer rotation axis inclination values of i=75 • and i=21 • , respectively. An observed maximum light curve amplitude never exceeding ∆V=0.02 mag is observed. The photometric amplitude and longer period are fully compatible with the activity level and age of the star. The shorter period would make the star an outlier in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6-7</ref>. We therefore adopt P = 3.65d as the rotation period. HIP 37923 = HD 63608 Together with its wide (23.1 arcsec projected separation) companion HIP 37918 = HD 63581, HIP 37923 was proposed as a member of the Carina-Near moving group by ? and as a member of the IC2391 cluster by ?. The target's kinematics match the Carina-Near group at the &lt;1.0 sigma level in V and W velocities, but match at 3.2 sigma in the U velocity; HIP 37918 matches at 2.1 sigma in the U velocity. However, the age of the components is consistent with that of the Carina-Near group. The kinematics do not match well with IC2391. Thus, the membership assignment to Carina-Near is still likely, although not as robust as other proposed members. The difference in Li EW between the components is striking, considering the small difference in temperature. The same period is also found by ? and ? from ASAS data. HIP 46634 = HD 82159B (ASAS 093035+1036.0) Member of a wide pair whose components have similar brightness (∆V = 0.01 mag). We could not identify the rotation period, as the most significant frequency changed from season to season. No significant period comes out from the Hipparcos data analysis. ? classified it as a single star based on extensive RV monitoring. ? instead flagged it as being RV variable (rms RV 36 km/s, N=2). Taking also the measured v sin i into account, we speculate that the spectroscopic measurements of the two components were exchanged in ?. The companion, HIP 46637 = GS Leo = HD 82159A, is in fact a close SB (period=3.86 days ?). ? report a HIP 46637 rotation period of 3.05 days. Its age indicators, along with the integrated X-ray luminosity, are altered by the fast rotation induced by the close com-panion. These indicators are therefore not considered for age dating of the system. We note the large difference in lithium EWs in spite of the very similar temperatures of the stars. The Lithium EW of HIP 46634 and log R HK (the latter kindly provided by the SOPHIE Consortium) indicate an age intermediate between that of the Pleiades and Hyades. At the &lt; 2.0 sigma level, the kinematics do not match any of the investigated groups and associations. Its kinematics are similar to that of the Hyades. However, the solar metallicity derived by ? argues against a physical link with this cluster. The G5 spectral type of HIP 46634 corresponds to an effective temperature warmer than 400 K than the photometric one. As the spectroscopic temperature by ? is slightly cooler than the photometric one we argue that the spectral classification needs to be revised. HIP 47646 = HD 84199 (ASAS 094251−2257.9; 1SWASP+J094250.81-225755.7) is an F5V star that exhibits non-periodic photometric variability. A low level of chromospheric activity and low lithium content are derived from our FEROS spectra (log R HK = −4.83). The kinematic parameters are distant from the loci of investigated groups and associations. This is consistent with a moderately old age. Taking into account isochrone fitting and ? metallicity yields an age of 1.156±0.950 Gyr. However, the star exhibits common proper motion and astrometric agreement with the K2.5 star HIP 47645 (projected separation of about 1200 AU), which appears to be much younger, based on high chromospheric activity (?). The system's integrated X-ray emission (log L X = 29.25) also supports the younger age. One way to reconcile all these observations would be to conclude that HIP 47645 is a tidallylocked SB, but no existing spectroscopic data confirms this hypothesis. TWA 21 = HD 298936 Formerly listed by ? as a candidate member of TWA, and classified by ? and ? as a member, it was later rejected as a TWA member by ?, based on the separation in the Z direction, with respect to confirmed members. ? included it as a possible member of the Carina association (age 30 Myr). Our kinematic analysis, which includes the trigonometric parallax recently measured by ?, shows that this star is consistent with both the TWA and Columba groups at the &lt;2.0 sigma level. over year timeframes and do not allow an estimate of orbital period, which might conclude the possibility of a tidally-locked system. Our FEROS spectrum reveals a complex CCF profile, suggesting a possible SB2 system. However, the comparison with CORALIE spectra shows that the spectral lines have comparable width, while moving tens of km/s with respect to the FEROS spectrum. Therefore, the system may be triple or, more likely, the spectral lines are deformed by the presence of starspots, given the exceptionally high activity level (Balmer lines down to Hǫ were seen in emission). The star has the largest photometric variability (0.28 mag) in our sample. The X-ray emission is also very strong. The Lomb-Scargle and Clean analysis of ASAS and SuperWASP data reveal three major periodicities: P=4.27d, P=1.297d, and P=0.81d, in order of decreasing power. The longest period is listed in ACVS. However, it is not consistent with the vsin i = 25 kms −1 and the stellar radius of a K0V star. Therefore, we adopt P=1.297d as the rotation period. The extremely high activity level might be due to the interaction between the two stellar components, especially if they have already left the main sequence (RS CVn-type variability). The presence of lithium (comparable to that of Pleiades stars of similar spectral type) would also be consistent with an RS CVn system, as these stars often show a moderate lithium content (?), although of still debated origin. Adopting the mean RV from the available measurement and using the photometric distance, assuming a main sequence star, yield kinematic parameters that are compatible with the Nearby, Young Population. However, center of mass RV is needed for a better assessment. 1SWASP+J112558.28-401549.9) This is a late type star with a moderately strong lithium line, as measured by ??. Luminosity class II-III is quoted in the Michigan Spectral Survey Catalog (?). DDO photometry by ? also supports luminosity class III and excludes a dwarf star. Our analysis of a FEROS archive spectrum confirms the giant status of the star. We derived T eff = 4931 ± 59 using ARES. From this we concluded log n(Li) ∼ 1.9 dex. The most important photometric period is P=39±7 d, based on both our methods of period search. The star is found to be a hard X-ray source (HR1=0.86±0.08). The RVs from ? and the FEROS spectrum differ by 4.3 km/s, making it a suspected SB. HD 99409 is therefore not a bona fide young star, but rather should be added to the census of lithium-rich giants. The moderately large v sin i (17 km/s), fast rotation (39 days), and strong X-ray emission are remarkable for a giant star. Similar features have been reported for other lithium-rich giants, and indeed the frequency of lithium-rich stars is much larger for fast-rotating giants than for normal giants (?). These features might be linked to planet engulfment phenomena (???), but alternative mechanisms have also been proposed (?). The kinematic parameters are inconsistent with all of the groups investigated. as an 80% probability member of the ǫ Cha association, with a kinematic distance of 115 pc, and by ? as a high probability member of LCC, with a kinematic distance of 98.5 pc. ? estimated A V = 0.48 ± 0.08, while ? derived a significantly lower value (E(B-V)=0.03, A V = 0.1). This discrepancy originates from the two different spectral classifications in ? and ? (G3IV vs G8V respectively). Our spectroscopic effective temperature (5530 ± 40 K) supports an intermediate value, E(B-V)=0.08. Adopting this latter value, we infer a photometric distance of 98 pc for an age of 10 Myr. The age indicators clearly point to a very young age, consistent with those of ǫ Cha and LCC. An age younger than β Pic MG is likely, thus favouring the ǫ Cha membership. However, considering the uncertainty in the distance and reddening, and the influence of the newly discovered binary companion, we consider 20 Myr to be an upper limit for the stellar age. ? report a rotation period of P=5.05d, which they classified as 'confirmed'. This was subsequently also confirmed by ?. The star has no significant RV variations. TYC 8979-1683-1 = CD-62 657 (ASAS 122825−6321.0): Classified as an LCC member by ? with a photometric distance of 73 pc. We derived a similar photometric distance of 75.6 pc, assuming no reddening. However, the discrepancy between the photometric (5306 K) and the spectroscopic (5650±145 K) effective temperature, along with the spectral type (G7V), may indicate the presence of some amount of interstellar or circumstellar absorption (E(B − V ) ≤ 0.10 mag). This may increase the distance estimate up to about 80 pc, and would imply an even younger age from Li EW. Our analysis indicates that the target's kinematics match TWA, US and Corana Australis at &lt; 2.0 sigma. The star's age from multiple youth indicators is also consistent with these young ages. The target's declination is further south than any known member of TWA, implying that a membership is unlikely. The star may belong to the outskirts of UCL or LCC, in the direction of the Sun, having a photometric distance which is closer to the mean distances of the ScoCen subgroups. The most important period in the photometric time series is P=3.35d, which is the same as the one found by ?. However, it is inconsistent with v sin i = 31.9 kms −1 and the stellar radius. Using both period search methods, we also find, in all the seasons and in the complete series, two other important periods of comparable power: P=1.42d and P=0.76d. Considering the stellar radius R = 1.035 R ⊙ , we infer rotation axis inclination values of i=60 • and i=37 • , respectively. An observed maximum light curve amplitude up to ∆V=0.11 mag is observed, suggesting that the star's rotation period is likely P = 1.42d. TYC 8989-0583-1 = HD 112245 (ASAS 125609−6127.4) New close visual binary discovered in our program (∆H = 2.6 mag). Classified as an LCC member in ?, with a photometric distance of 68 pc (close to our adopted value of 65 pc). The target's kinematics match Tuc/Hor, TWA, and UCL at &lt; 2.0 sigma. The star's age from multiple youth indicators is consistent with it being very young, compatible with the ages of Tuc/Hor, but likely younger. The target's declination is further south than any known member of TWA, implying that it is likely not a member of this association. The target's photometric distance is also only half of the distance expected for membership in one of the ScoCen subgroups. However, it could be part of the population of closer stars linked to these groups, as studied by ?. We do not have spectra for the derivation of spectroscopic temperature. From spectral type (K0Ve) and photometric temperature (4929 K), a small amount of absorption can not be excluded. The Lomb-Scargle analysis of the photometric timeseries indicated P=4.89d, P=1.25d, and P=0.83d as the most important periods. However, the two longer ones are inconsistent with v sin i = 47 kms −1 and the stellar radius R = 1.095 R ⊙ . The Clean analysis shows P=1.25d and P=0.556d to be the most important. We adopt P=0.556d as the rotation period, which is also reported by ?. TYC 9245-0617-1 = CD-69 1055 (ASAS 125826−7028.8) The star is a WTTS, as indicated by its strong lithium, filled-in Hα line, strong X-ray emission and near-IR excess. ? proposed it as an 80% probability member of the ǫ Cha association, while ? and ? proposed it to be a member of LCC. Kinematic distances of 101 pc and 85 pc were derived by ? and ?, respectively, while ? obtained a photometric distance of 75 pc. ? estimated A V = 0.46 ± 0.12 while ? derived a slightly lower value (E(B-V)=0.11, A V = 0.34). Our spectroscopic and photometric temperatures are equal for E(B-V)=0.09. Adopting this latter value, we infer a photometric distance of 93 pc for an age of 10 Myr, which is supported by the Li EW of 410 m ˚ A. This is consistent with the ? kinematic estimate and, together with our kinematic analysis for this distance, supports the association with ǫ Cha. ? and ? report a rotation period of P=2.007 and P=1.989d, respectively. From the RV data, there is an indication of RV variability on timescales of a few years and amplitude of a few km/s. Considering the young age and the probable presence of circumstellar material, this might be due to variable obscuration from the circumstellar disk (see e.g. ?, for the case of T Cha) as well as the presence of a companion. We therefore consider the star as a possible SB, but we keep it in the sample for the statistical analysis. HIP 63862 = HD 113553: (ASAS 130517−5051.4) This target's kinematics do not match any of the groups and associations investigated at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. Its kinematics are also not consistent with the Nearby, Young population. The star is estimated to be slightly older than 100 Myr. The most important period is P=4.5d, found in almost all seasons, which confirms the period P=4.456d found by ?. TYC 7796-2110-1 = CD-41 7947 (ASAS 133432−4209.5; 1SWASP+J133431.89-420930.7) was reported as a suspected SB2 in the SACY survey. The photospheric lines appear very broad in our FEROS spectrum; the target might be indeed an unresolved SB2 with fast rotating (and very active) components. The CORALIE spectrum also shows a complex profile, but we can not confirm the SB2 status from these data (similar line width). 3-epoch RVs show large scatter, but considering the large measurement errors, this is not conclusive for a binary classification. The star was classified as an LCC member in ?, with a photometric distance of 93 pc, very similar to our adopted value of 92 pc. The rotation period P=1.022d is found in both ASAS and SuperWASP data by both period search methods. The target's kinematics and age are consistent with the Young, Nearby population at the &lt; 2 sigma level, and with UCL and LCC at the &lt; 3 sigma level. We noted a large difference in Li EW between SACY and ? (400 vs 315 m ˚ A, respectively). Age indicators are consistent with LCC, but the very fast rotation and possible binarity make the parameters uncertain. The star is also listed as a possible SB2 in SACY.</p><note type="other">S.

Significant RV variations are reported in the literature. Considering the RV difference between the components, ∼ 20 km/s in our FEROS spectrum, and the line depth ratio of about 0.7, it is plausible that the newly discovered visual companion is not the main object responsible for the RV variations and spectral contamination. The system might therefore be triple. The period P=1.477d is the most important period found by either Lomb-Scargle or Clean analysis. This confirms the earlier determination by ? and is consistent with v sin i= 38 kms −1 and the stellar radius. The target kinematics match several groups subgroups at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. Considering the star age, membership to Tuc/Hor or COL, seems plausible, but improved understanding of the multiplicity and of the system RV are needed. HIP 70351 = HD 125485: (ASAS 142339−7248.5)</p><p>Young star with an age of about 100 Myr, consistently derived from various indicators. The most important period in the photometric time series is P=3.58d, but also the period P=1.385d is present in both LombScargle and Clean periodograms. No period is found from Hipparcos data. The target's kinematics do not match any of the groups and associations investigated at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. Its kinematics are also not consistent with the Nearby, Young population. HIP 71908 = GJ 560A = α Cir. (ASAS 144230−6458.5) roAp star. Isochrone fitting, carried out using the effective temperature by ?, yields an age of 1.10 ± 0.17 Gyr. ? report a rotation period P=4.479d for the primary. No period is derived from ASAS nor from Hipparcos data. The wide companion GJ 560B = SAO 252852 is included by ? in the list of Her-Lyr members. HIP 71908 is also proposed by ? as a member of β Pic MG. The kinematics of the star are consistent with the ǫ Cha moving group and Her-Lyr association at the &lt;1.0 sigma level. BANYAN II web tool yields a very high membership probability to β Pic MG. However, the age measured by comparing isochrones in the HR diagram indicates that the primary has an age around 1 Gyr, making it much older than either of these groups. There are also no indications of young age for the secondary, as the system is not detected with ROSAT, the level of chromospheric activity is low and lithium is not detected in the spectrum. These age estimates rule out kinematic membership in either of these young associations, and the star is therefore likely an older field dwarf interloping in the kinematic space where young stars are concentrated. We adopt the isochrone age of the primary. HIP 71933 = HD 129181 (ASAS 144244−4848.0) RV measurements from SACY, ?, ? and our FEROS spectrum show a rather large scatter (4 km/s), suggesting binarity. Indication of binarity comes also from the astrometric acceleration detected by Hipparcos. The small v sin i quoted by ? (2 km/s) is highly discrepant with the fast rotation reported by ? and with our own spectrum (70 km/s). The ? RV measurement should therefore be taken with caution. The broad photospheric lines make the RV measurement rather uncertain, and an SB2 nature cannot be ruled out. However, the deformation of the line profile might also be due to spots. This issue was also discussed by ?, who favour the star spot interpretation. We therefore consider this star as only a possible binary. Our analysis of photometric data reveals marginal evidence of a period P=0.67d in two ASAS seasons and in the Hipparcos data. This star is very active and is also found to be a relatively hard Xray source (HR1=0.58±0.07). The strong lithium EW is consistent with an age between about 30 and 150 Myr. The star is clearly above the main sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, with an isochrone age of 16 ± 6 Myr. This is marginally inconsistent with the Li estimate, but the fast rotation makes the Li EW measurement uncertain. The kinematics are fully consistent with UCL when Tycho2 proper motion is adopted (1.9 sigma discrepancy with respect to VL07) and ? RV is excluded. Isochrone age is also fully compatible with UCL but the distance is closer then that of most of its known members. We therefore conclude that this is a truly young star located in front of UCL. It is uncertain whether it is physically related to UCL and/or LCC. It may be a binary with a period of a few years, but this needs confirmation. HIP 72399 = HD 130260 (ASAS 144810−3647.0;</p><p>1SWASP+J144809.66-364702.2) This is a very active K dwarf, but without detectable lithium. Four RV determinations (one by SACY and the others ours from HARPS and CORALIE data) show that the star is an SB1. The two CORALIE spectra were taken with a time separation of about one hour and have an RV difference of about 3 km/s, indicating a short period for the binary orbit. Our analysis of ASAS data confirms the P=3.897d period reported by ?. We find the same period in the SuperWASP data as well. The K5V star HIP 72400 = HD130260B at 10 arcsec is a probable wide companion. It has similar proper motion and parallax, and slightly different RV (which can be understood as being due to our poor sampling of the HIP 72399 binary orbit). Both components have rather large parallax errors. The X-ray emission of the two components is not spatially resolved by ROSAT, but the XMM source reported in ? is much closer to the SB component, suggesting that it is the main X-ray emitter. The lack of lithium in the primary yields an age lower limit of about 300 Myr, which is not consistent with the estimates based on coronal and chromospheric emission and rotation period. The kinematics of HIP 72400 are slightly outside the box of very young stars, but fully compatible with a moderately young age. Its slow rotation, as derived from the CORALIE spectrum, argues against a star as active as the primary. All these facts support the hypothesis that the high activity and fast rotation of HIP 72399 is due to tidal locking and not to a young age. However, we can not conclusively demonstrate this without a measurement of the binary's orbital period. by NaCo-LP data. The star was found to be SB2 from CORAVEL spectra. ? classified it as a member of the Lupus association (age 5-27 Myr), with a kinematic distance of 89 pc, but the star is not included in the recent study of the Lupus star-forming region by ?. Kinematic parameters are consistent with β Pic, Cha-Near, CrA and Upper Sco. However, the unresolved binary may imply that the RV measurements used in these analyses are very uncertain, making the kinematic analysis difficult to interpret. Furthermore, lithium EW and X-ray flux are below those of most members of the youngest associations, such as β Pic and Tuc-Hor. Rather, the fluxes are more compatible with an age older than those quoted in ? for Lupus and the ages of other groups mentioned above. The star is therefore most likely a moderately young star without associations to known groups. Our kinematic distance, using the AB Dor MG sequence as a reference, and including binary correction, is 70.2 pc. The SuperWASP data analysis gives a period P=3.69d. In contrast, the ASAS data analysis gives two periods, P=2.32d and P=1.75d. Considering the stellar radius R = 1.009 R ⊙ and v sin i = 17 km s −1 , we infer rotation axis inclination values of i=50 • and i=36 • , respectively. The observed maximum light curve amplitude never exceeds ∆V=0.04 mag, suggesting that both rotation periods are possible. The present data do not allow us to be sure about the correct rotation period. The multiple photometric periods might belong to the different components, considering their similar brightnesses. HIP 76829 = HD139664: (ASAS 154111−4439.7)</p><p>Proposed as a member of the Her-Lyra association by ?.</p><p>The kinematics of the star are consistent with Her-Lyr at at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. Beside kinematics, additional indications of youth are provided by coronal and chromospheric emission and fast rotation but the sensitivity of these diagnostics for mid-F stars is not so strong. No lithium was detected in our analysis of the HARPS spectra. The age of the star resulting from Xray and Ca H&amp;K is compatible with Her-Lyr membership. We find marginal evidence of a period P=0.719d, which is consistent with v sin i = 71.6 km s −1 and the stellar radius. However, the measured period is very uncertain. HIP 76829 hosts a debris disk, which was spatially resolved by ? using HST. The disk is oriented nearly edge-on. The emitting material is concentrated on a belt at a separation of about 83 AU. TYC 6781-0415-1 = CD-24 12231: (ASAS 154131−2520.6; 1SWASP+J154131.21-252036.4) Very young star with a lithium age younger than 10 Myr (from B-V color). Classified by ? as a probable member of US with a kinematic distance of 109±11 pc. This star is found to be a hard X-ray (HR1=0.94±0.03; see Sect. 6.2) and radio (?) source. This is consistent with the very young age of US and the age derived from the lithium EW of the star. ? quotes the star as RV constant over 4 consecutive nights, but does not provide RV values. Individual RVs from SACY and ? are also consistent with a single star. We note a highly discrepant effective temperature from B-V and V-K colors (5373 K vs 4569 K); reddening can not account for this. The temperature from B-V is consistent with the G9IVe and G8e spectral classifications from SACY and ? respectively. The high level of activity implies high levels of photometric variability. This would result in significant errors when combining magnitudes taken several years apart. However, from ASAS data, the variability in V band over 10 years is within 0.18 mag, and thus unable to explain the discrepancy.</p><p>Alternatively, significant K band excess could be due to a circumstellar disk. Using only the B-V color, since it is consistent with the spectral classification, we derive a photometric distance of 89 pc using the β Pic sequence (upper limit). We derive 106 pc for a 11 Myr age. Within the uncertainties, these distances are compatible with the kinematic distance by ?. The kinematic analysis made with the longer distance supports the association with US. The ASAS data analysis gives two likely periods, P=1.05d and P=20d, whereas the SuperWASP data analysis gives a period P=1.05d as the most significant, although periods of 20d and longer are also present. The rotation period P=1.05d is compatible with the stellar radius and v sin i. The rotation period P=1.05d is 'uncertain'. 3) The star was first resolved into a close visual binary (0.11 arcsec separation) by ?. The companion was also detected in our NaCo observations. This star is classified as a US-B (which corresponds to UCL) member (??). No significant period is found either in ASAS or in SuperWASP photometric data. The tight triple system HIP 77235 = HD 140722 = HR 5856 at 50 arcsec has similar proper motion and radial velocity. The discrepancy, slightly exceeding the quoted errors, may be due to the multiplicity of both the wide components. HIP 77235 is a close triple. AB components have a separation of 0.58 arscec with A further resolved into a closer pair with 0.20 arcsec projected separation. The integrated spectral type of the triple is F2IV. The trigonometric distance of HIP 77235 is 71.1 ± 5.5 pc, compatible with the photometric distance of TYC 6786-811-1 (which is 78.6 pc including the correction for binarity), and further supporting the physical association. However, the literature contains no indications of youth for the tight triple, and it was not detected in X ray by ROSAT. This may be due to the early spectral type of the components, which should all be F stars based on the magnitude differences with respect to the primary. In the end, we consider this target to be inconclusive. Age indicators (Li and X-ray emission) for HD 140722C support a young age (nominal ages of 60 Myr for Li and 120 Myr for X-ray), but not as young as the UCL age <ref type="bibr">(16 Myr)</ref>. The derived distance also seems to argue against a membership with the UCL group. Using the Hipparcos distance of the wide companion, the UVW velocities of the star is not consistent with any group, within 2.0 sigma. Thus, our kinematic and age analysis make UCL membership unlikely. The star might be an outlier in the kinematic distribution of most nearby young stars. However, an unresolved binarity could make the adopted RV measurements uncertain. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>) This</head><p>is a moderately young star with an age similar to the Pleiades. The period P=2.325d that we find with both Lomb-Scargle and Clean was also reported by ? from Hipparcos data and by ? from ASAS data. The rotation period derived from log R HK is much longer than the observed one <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>. As there are no additional plausible longer period periodicities in the photometric time-series, the discrepancy is likely due to one of the following: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>  with a kinematic distance of 130±12 pc. There is a severe discrepancy on the star's spectral type: G0IV according to SACY and F5 according to the Michigan spectral atlas. The latter is adopted by ?. This has a significant impact on the presence of reddening, and therefore on the distance to the star. Considering the better agreement of photometric temperatures from B-V and V-K, and the higher spectral resolution of SACY spectra, we adopt the un-reddened case. The age of the system is also quite uncertain. The star is found to be a relatively hard X-ray source (HR1=0.46±0.20), which supports a very young age. But Lithium EWs from SACY and ? differ by 30 m ˚ A . Taking into account these uncertainties, ages from 10 to 100 Myr are possible. The most important photometric period is P=1.13d, which is found in only three seasons. The rotation period P=1.13d is 'uncertain' and does not contribute meaningful age constraints. Adopting an age of 30 Myr, we derive a photometric distance of 89.5 pc. But if the star is younger than 15 Myr, then the distance would be farther than 100 pc (105 pc using β Pic sequence). The star's kinematics are only consistent with the Young, nearby population and Corona-Australis association at the &lt;2.0 sigma level. arcsec apart from that of the optical source, but with a very large position error (41 arcsec). We also noted that the integration time in the ROSAT catalog is significantly smaller than the usual ones. Furthermore, the X-ray source is hard (HR1=1.00±0.32), which is unusual for the kind of stars we are investigating. Without additional X-ray observations, we are unable to conclude on the association of the ROSAT source with our target star. TYC 6815-0084-1 = CD-25 11942 (ASAS 170601−2520.5) is also a fast-rotating suspected SB2 in SACY (no clear signature of binarity in our spectrum). TYC 6815-0084-1 is a possible member of Upper Scorpius association according to ?, with a kinematic distance of 127 pc. Assuming a reddening E(B-V)=0.08 from the comparison of spectral type and photometric temperatures and adopting as reference the sequence of β Pic MG, we obtain a photometric distance of 79 pc, which increases to 92 pc for a 11 Myr age. The lithium EW is compatible with a very young age (10-20 Myr) and then wth US membership. The space velocities are also compatible with US, and matching improves increasing distance to 110-130 pc. The sky position is only 0.7 deg outside the formal boundaries of US adopted in ?. We find more photometric periods that persist in different seasons and are all close or shorter than 1 day, which is expected from the high vsin i = 57 kms −1 . However, it is difficult to say which is the correct one. One likely period is P=1.243d, but also P=1.03d and P=0.507d may be the rotation periods. A very similar period (1.246d) is also listed in ?. The star has similar kinematic parameters to TYC 6815-0874-1, also in our sample. The projected separation of the two stars is about 21 arcmin, too large for a bound system (≥ 100000 AU) but considering the similar ages a common origin for the two stars can not be excluded. The photometric distances are roughly consistent taking the uncertainties due to reddening, age and possible binarity of both objects into account. There is a discrepancy in the photometric distances of the two stars (55.0 pc for HD 199058, including binary correction, and 77.2 pc for TYC-1090-0543-1). It should be noted that ? Bayesian analysis tools predict only a 6% probability of AB Dor membership at a distance of 55.0 pc. This probability changes to &gt;98% at 74 pc, a distance nearly identical to the photometric distance of TYC-1090-0543-1. On the other hand, ? on-line tool yields a very low membership probability. We adopt the mean of the photometric distances of the two objects. Applying both Lomb-Scargle and Clean analyses in two seasons, we find an uncertain period P=3.47d for HD 199058. TYC 5206-0915-1 = BD -07 5533 (ASAS 211834−0631.7) In ACVS, the star is listed with a period P=3.4447d and classified as a detached/semidetached eclipsing binary. However, from our analysis of the photometric time-series we did not found convincing evidences for eclipses using this proposed period or their harmonics. ? reports a period P=2.37d, which our analysis retrieves in all the seasons. From CCF in our FEROS spectrum, there are no indications of additional components. But the large RV scatter (about 40 km/s peak-to-valley), from our FEROS and CORALIE spectra and SACY, makes the star a short period spectroscopic binary (SB1). The fast rotational period and large activity levels may be due to youth or due to a tidally locked binary. Close visual binary discovered by ?; the physical association of the components was confirmed with our NaCo observations ( <ref type="bibr">Chauvin et al. 2013</ref>). The star was included as a member of the Tuc association by ?, but rejected by ?. ? also propose this star as a bona fide member of Tuc/Hor and the analysis based on ? confirms membership. The star is characterized by a very fast rotation, identified both spectroscopically and photometrically. We find the period P=0.4352d, that is also reported by ? from Hipparcos data analysis and by ? from ASAS data analysis. In our analysis, the kinematics match only Tuc/Hor but at the &gt; 2.0 sigma level. However, the kinematics might somewhat altered by binarity.  <ref type="bibr">90 Myr)</ref>. However, the kinematics do not match any of the groups and associations investigated at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. The kinematics are also not consistent with the Nearby, Young population. We find the period P=3.22d in all the ASAS and SuperWASP seasons. This period is also reported by ?. (ASAS 230552−3551.2) is the only M dwarf in our sample. It was included because of the tentative lithium detection in the SACY database (EW=50 m ˚ A), which originally comes from ?. However, our higher quality FEROS spectrum shows no lithium. The star is above the main sequence in the M V vs B-V color-mag diagram, which would imply a pre-MS star. But the 2MASS magnitudes are most compatible with a main sequence star. ? estimated an isochrone age of 100 Myr -10 Gyr from VJHK photometry. The stellar radius, as derived by ? using VLTI, is not anomalous in their mass-radius and luminosity-radius relationships. The star has rather low coronal and chromospheric activity. No rotation period is found in either ASAS (sparse data) or Hipparcos data. Using the kinematic population diagnostic by ?, we conclude a probable membership of the thick disk. We therefore adopt a very old age for the star, 8 Gyr. We adopt the stellar mass and metallicity from ?. ? on-line tool yields a 74% membership probability. ? report a rotation period P=2.31d, which they note to be inconsistent with vsin i = 73.9 kms −1 . A new analysis, also made with the Clean method, reveals a period P=0.7025d, which confirms the rotation period P=0.6975d found by ? and P=0.7024d found in ACVS. 2) The star shares common proper motion, position and radial velocity with HIP 116063= HD 221231. Parallax of the companion is adopted for the system. No rotation period is found (likely due to the blending of the components). The age of the components from several diagnostics is estimated to be 300 Myr. TYC 6406-0180-1 = HD 221545: Lithium EW and Xray luminosity of this K0 star indicate an age of about 200 Myr. Kinematics derived assuming an MS status are consistent with a moderately young star. Non-typical of a star of this type, a period P=36.271d is reported by ACVS, and confirmed by ?, who reports P=36.34d. Our analysis of ASAS data reveals two major power peaks in the seasonal periodograms, one at P=36d and another at P=1.026d. The first is in agreement with the mentioned literature values, whereas the latter, together with a K-type MS stellar radius and the small v sin i value, would imply a very inclined (almost pole-on) star.</p><p>In that latter case, we would not expect any light rotational modulation, whereas we find a light curve amplitude up to ∆V = 0.07 mag. We therefore consider the period P=36d as 'confirmed'. Such a rotation period being consistent with the measured v sin i=5.5 km s −1 requires a stellar radius R&gt;3 R ⊙ . Large radii like this are found among subgiant K stars, but not in the current V class assignation. The long rotation period is also unusual among active main sequence stars, but typical of evolved stars. There is only one RV measurement in the literature. Therefore, limited inferences on binarity can be made. We adopt the main sequence age, but allow for an age of 4 Gyr, which is obtained for an evolved star matching the stellar radius that is most consistent with the rotation period and v sin i. Proposed by ? and ? as a high-probability member of AB Dor. ? on-line tool yields a membership probability of 36%. At the &lt; 1.0 sigma level, the kinematics match only AB Dor. The ages derived from various methods are slightly younger than the proposed age of the AB Dor group, but since the kinematics only match this group, and the star is surely young, the analysis reinforces the AB Dor membership assignment. ? report a rotation period P=1.787d, which was subsequently confirmed by ?.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table D</ref>.1 the following: (1) the time interval spanned by each segment; (2) the number of V magnitude measurements; (3) the brightest V magnitude; (4) the light curve amplitude, which is measured as the amplitude of the sinusoid fit to the phased light curve; (5) the photometric accuracy; (6) the ratio of the average residuals from the fit on the light curve amplitude; (7) the rotation period; (8) the rotation uncertainty; (9) the normalized power of the periodogram peak, corresponding to the rotation period, and the power level corresponding to a 1% false alarm probability; and (10) the sequential number of the timeseries segment (the number 1 indicates the complete un-segmented timeseries). <ref type="figure">Figure D</ref>.1 shows, as example, the results of our period search for HIP 79958. In the left column we plot the V magnitude time series (complete in the top left panel, and segmented in the other lower panels). In the middle column, we plot the Lomb-Scargle periodograms with indication of the power level corresponding to the 1% FAP, and the peak corresponding to the rotation period. In the right column, we plot the phased light curve with the rotation period. The initial epoch is the same for all the light curves, whereas the rotation period is the one found in the corresponding season. In the seasons where no period is detected, we used the rotation period found from the whole time series analysis. In the bottom panels we have multiplied all the periodograms and extracted the most significant periodicities. This represents a different approach to reveal peaks that are low power, but persistent in each season. For all the targets that we newly determined, or confirmed, the rotation period, similar plots are available as online material.

The star was resolved as a very close visual binary (sep 0.1 arcsec) in NaCo-LP (∆H = 0.50 mag), with an ad- ditional bright star at 4.9 arcsec. The latter (2MASS 08584794-6115161 = WDS 08588-6115B) is also included in 2MASS and WDS catalogs, being only 0.5 mag fainter that the central star. There is also an additional object (2MASS 08584777-6115335 = WDS 08588-6115C) listed in WDS at 19 arcsec. It has a different proper motion from TYC 8927-3620-1 in the UCAC4 catalog and therefore is not physically associated. A subgiant luminosity class is reported in SACY. The target's kinematics are only consistent with the Young, Nearby population. Using both period search methods, we find P=0.874d in all ASAS seasons.</figDesc></figure>

The most important photometric period is P=3.91d (P=4.14d in SuperWASP data). There exists also a second period, P=1.34d, in both ASAS and SuperWASP data, as reported by ?. However, the absence of known v sin i prevents us from distinguishing between the correct one and the alias. At &lt; 2.0 sigma, the target's kinematics match only the Carina association. The star's age from multiple youth indicators is intermediate between that of Carina association and of AB Dor MG, making the Carina membership unlikely.

The Lomb-Scargle and Clean analysis of the photometric time series reveal two periods, P=2.01d and P=1.975d, of comparable power in almost all seasons. Both may be real, arising from Surface Differential Rotation. These periods are also consistent with the vsin i = 27.2 kms −1 . A period P=4.29d is listed in ACVS and reported by ?. Such a value is not consistent with vsin i and the stellar radius. TYC 7743-1091-1 = HD 99409: (ASAS 112558−4015.8;</figDesc></figure>

The kinematics of HIP 52840 match the TWA, Argus, and Carina-Near moving group at the &lt;2.0 sigma level. The age diagnostics measured for this target are inconsistent with the expected ages for the TWA and Argus associations. The kinematics of HIP 58241 match Argus,the Carina-Near moving group, the Hercules-Lyra association, and IC2391 at the &lt;2.0 sigma level. Considering both components and the age diagnostics, the membership to Carina-Near is likely. For both stars, we could derive the rotation period neither in ASAS nor in SuperWASP data, each sea- son showing its own significant periodicity. This may be linked to the blending of the components in ASAS and SuperWASP images. HIP 58241 is a nearly per- fect Solar analog (except for multiplicity) at an age of 200 Myr (?). This component was not observed in the NaCo-LP. ? and ? identified an additional source at about 4 arcsec from HIP 52841. Its physical association to HIP 52841 requires confirmation.

The isochrone age is 2.357 ± 0.627 Gyr, taking the subsolar metallicity by ? into account. No period is found either in ASAS or Hipparcos data.

There are two spectra from SACY; the line profile changed between the two epochs, but the line width is similar. We thus cannot claim conclusive inference that it is an SB2. From the ASAS photometric data, we find a period P=1.373d using both Lomb-Scargle and Clean analyses. In a comparison of spectral type vs photometric effective temperature, there are indications of some amounts of reddening (E(B − V ) ∼ 0.1 mag). Taking as reference the β Pic sequence, we derive a distance of 109 pc. The possibility that the star is an SB2 adds uncertainty to the derivation of stellar properties from photometry.

The estimated age of the star is quite young (about 20 Myr) and it could be consistent with CrA membership. The position on the sky is slightly outside the nominal edges of US and UCL; membership in the US or UCL groups can not be excluded. TYC 8728-2262-1 = CD -54 7336: (ASAS 172955−5415.8) Proposed by ? as a 90% probability member of β Pic.

The star's kinematics match Corona-Australis at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level. The estimated age of the star is young (30 Myr), but marginally inconsistent with the CrA's younger proposed age. HIP 89829 = HD 168210 (ASAS 181952−2916.5) Ultrafast rotating star (v sin i 114 km/s), proposed by ? and ? as a high-probability member of β Pic MG while membership is rejected by BANYAN II. At the &lt;2.0 sigma level, its kinematics match β Pic. The large lithium EW and high levels of activity and photometric variability are consistent with the β Pic MG member- ship assignment. Isochrone fitting further supports the pre-MS status (age of 15 ± 3 Myr). The star resides in a field that is very crowded with fainter stars. We derive the early spectral type and the rotational velocity of the star. The star hosts a debris disk, with T dust = 95 K, R dust = 15 AU and M dust = 3.4 × 10 −2 M ⊕ (?).

At the &lt;2.0 sigma level, the kinematics of HD 199058 match also Tuc/Hor, Carina, and ǫ Cha. However, membership to Tuc/Hor or Carina is unlikely because of the star's northern declination.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_11" validated="false"><head>1) The star's kinematics match Tuc/Hor, Columba and Carina at &lt;2.0 sigma. The estimated age of</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table>(ASAS 
033049−4555.9) Proposed as a 100% probability 
member of Tuc/Hor by ?. Our kinematic analysis 
shows that it matches both the Tuc/Hor and TW 
Hydrae associations at the 1.0 sigma level in U,V, and 
W. The star's sky position and XYZ galactic distances 
are inconsistent with other known members of TWA. 
All the age indicators are consistent with an age 
younger than 100 Myr. ? and ? Bayesian analysis tools 
predict a very high probability of Tuc/Hor membership 
at a distance of 43.5 pc. This predicted distance for 
membership is consistent with the photometric distance 
of 40.4 pc. The rotation period P=3.74d was discovered 
by ? from ASAS data, and subsequently confirmed by 
SuperWASP data (?) and by ?. 
HIP 19775 = HD 26980 (ASAS 041423−3819.0) 
Proposed as a bona fide member of Columba by ? and 
?. The kinematic analysis shows that its UVW mo-
tion matches Columba at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level and 
the BANYAN II on-line tool yields high membership 
probability. Also, the ages from various youth indica-
tors are consistent with the age of Columba. ? reported 
a rotation period P=2.53d based on ASAS data. From 
the analysis of SuperWASP data, ? found P=1.684d 
to be the most significant periodicity. Considering the 
v sin i = 13.9 kms −1 and the stellar radius R = 
1.015 R ⊙ , we infer rotation axis inclination values of 
i=43 • and i=27 • , respectively. The observed maximum 
light curve amplitude up to ∆V=0.07 mag is compati-
ble with both inclinations, although it is most consistent 
witih the larger i=43 • value. This suggests P = 2.53d 
as the more likely rotation period. 
HIP 23316 = HD 32372 (ASAS 050052−4101.1; 
1SWASP+J050051.86-410106.7) Proposed as a high-
probability member of Columba by ? and ?. Our kine-
matic analysis shows that its UVW motion matches 
Columba at the &lt; 2.0 sigma level, reinforcing the mem-
bership assignment, which is also confirmed by the ? 
on-line tool. Also, the ages from various youth indica-
tors are consistent with the age of Columba. The most 
significant period we find in the SuperWASP data is 
P=2.183d. Another significant period is P=1.8d, which 
is the 1-d beat period of the P=2.183d rotation period. 
The ASAS data analysis does not provide any conclu-
sion on the rotation period. The highest peak of the 
Hipparcos data periodogram is at P=17.8d, which co-
incides with the maximum of the window function. 
HD 32981 = BD -16 1042 = TYC 5901-1109-1 
Proposed as a 100% probability member of AB Dor 
by ?. The kinematic analysis shows that its UVW mo-
tion matches AB Dor at the &lt; 1.0 sigma level. The 

age of the star from various youth indicators is also 
broadly consistent with the age of the AB Dor group. ? 
Bayesian analysis tools predict a 97% probability of AB 
Dor membership at a distance of 79 pc ? return a very 
low membership probability, as most of the proposed 
AB Dor members. The predicted distance for member-
ship is roughly consistent with the photometric distance 
of 86.7 pc. ? found a rotation period P=0.985d. 
BD−09 1108 : (ASAS 051537−0930.8) Proposed as an 
85% probability member of Tuc/Hor by ?. The kine-
matic analysis shows that its UVW motion matches 
Tuc/Hor at the &lt;2.0 sigma level, reinforcing the mem-
bership assignment. The age of the star from various 
youth indicators is also consistent with the age of the 
Tuc/Hor association. ? Bayesian analysis tools predict 
a 17% probability of Tuc/Hor membership and a 78% 
probability of Columba membership at distances of 80.5 
pc and 74.0 pc respectively. These predicted distances 
for membership are both smaller than the photomet-
ric distance of 93.6 pc. ? on-line tool return instead a 
very low membership probability on both associations 
when including our photometric distance while a 54% 
membership probability for Columba at a distance of 
67 pc. ? found a rotation period P=2.72d, which was 
subsequently confirmed by ?. 
HIP 25434 = HD 274197 This is the secondary of a 
wide binary system, with the star HIP 25436 = HD 
35996 being the primary. HIP 25436 is brighter by 0.8 
mag in V band. The two components have a separation 
of about 12 arcsec. Using three epoch RV measurements 
(??, and our CORALIE observations), we found that 
the primary is an SB. There is also additional evidence 
that one of the components is itself a binary. The slope 
of -0.070 deg/year for the position angle measured by 
Hipparcos is not compatible with the much smaller long 
term trend seen in the visual measurements (as derived 
by us from the individual measurements in WDS, kindly 
provided by Dr. B. Mason). Furthermore, there are 
significant differences between the short term (3.25 yr 
baseline) proper motion measured by Hipparcos (?) and 
the long term proper motion which includes old photo-
graphic plates (e.g. Tycho2, ?). This supports an orbital 
period of a few years for the SB. In the ASAS photome-
try, the two components are indistinguishable from HIP 
25434 (ASAS 052623−4322.6;.1SWASP+J052622.97-
432236.2) We find a significant period P=5.34d in only 
one ASAS season and P=6.6d in the SuperWASP data 
(only 59 measurements available). These periods are 
'uncertain' and the component to which they belong 
is ambiguous. Considering the early spectral type of 
the primary, they are more likely due to photomet-
ric variations of the secondary, HIP 25434. However, 
they are both inconsistent with secondary's stellar ra-
dius and v sin i, and would imply an age much older 
than that derived from other methods. ? propose mem-
bership to the Columba association. The space veloci-
ties and association to groups depend sensitively on the 
adopted proper motion. Using the Hipparcos proper mo-
tion, the kinematics are only consistent with the Nearby 
Young Population. Adopting the Tycho2 proper mo-
tion results in a high membership probability to the 
Columba association using ? and ? Bayesian analy-
sis tools. Considering that the Hipparcos astrometry is 
likely biased by the astrometric motion of the additional component orbiting HIP 25436, the Tycho2 proper mo-
tion should be preferred. The age indicators are consis-
tent with Columba membership.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Three objects slightly older than 200 Myr were observed in the July 2010 run, because of the lack of suitable targets in the original target list. 2 More precisely, the sample selection is based on the expected sensitivity limits for the SPHERE adaptive optics sensor, which also depends on the color of the star.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> ? noted a trend of metallicity with effective temperatures, possibly due to the effects of stellar activity. Removing it by assuming that no correction is needed for a solar type star would increase the metallicities by about 0.1 dex. Since the origin of this trend is uncertain and the assumption of its null value for solar temperature is questionable, we do not apply such shifts. 11 http://stev.oapd.inaf.it</note>

			<note place="foot" n="14"> It should be noted that the two explanations are not mutually exclusive. There are cases of close tidally locked binaries that are found to be young based on lithium EW, membership to groups, or presence of disks (e.g. V4046 Sgr).</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: S index calibration for FEROS</head><p>Instrumental S index was measured on FEROS spectra by integrating the flux over rectangular bandpasses 1 ˚ A wide, as in ?. For calibration onto the standard Mount Wilson scale, we used 73 spectra of 42 stars from the lists of ? and ?. The relevant calibration stars were observed in the same nights as were our program stars, and reduced in the same way. We determined that the inclusion of additional calibration stars from other sources, which are typically characterized by single-epoch measurements (e.g. ?), increases the scatter of the calibration. A linear fit between FEROS instrumental S index and the literature calibrated S index was found to be fully adequate <ref type="figure">(Fig. C.1</ref>). The rms of residuals from the calibration is about 5%. To better understand the measurement errors, we plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. C.2</ref> the absolute value of the difference between our calibrated S index and the literature ones. The stars with larger differences are those that are more active and have a small number of measurements in the calibration papers. This indicates that the intrinsic variability of chromospheric activity has a significant impact on our calibration. For the low-activity, low-variability star τ Ceti, the observed rms of the S index for 15 spectra is 0.0034 (2%). It should be further noted that for stars with v sin i &gt; 40 km/s, the measured S index is underestimated, as part of the H and K emission lies outside the defined integration windows (?). The calibrated S index was transformed into the chromospheric flux log R HK following the prescriptions by ?.</p></div>
