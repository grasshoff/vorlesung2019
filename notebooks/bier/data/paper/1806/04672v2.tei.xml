			<abstract>
				<p>Context. Transit photometry of the Jupiter-sized exoplanet candidate Kepler-1625 b has recently been interpreted to show hints of a moon. This exomoon, the first of its kind, would be as large as Neptune and unlike any moon we know from the solar system. Aims. We aim to clarify whether the exomoon-like signal is indeed caused by a large object in orbit around Kepler-1625 b, or whether it is caused by stellar or instrumental noise or by the data detrending procedure. Methods. To prepare the transit data for model fitting, we explore several detrending procedures using second-, third-, and fourth-order polynomials and an implementation of the Cosine Filtering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light curve simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the resulting planet-moon transit light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a planet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve variations. We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise realizations by injecting simulated transits into different out-of-transit parts of the original Kepler-1625 light curve: (1) 100 sequences with three synthetic transits of a Kepler-1625 b-like Jupiter-size planet and (2) 100 sequences with three synthetic transits of a Kepler-1625 b-like planet with a Neptune-sized moon. Results. The statistical significance and characteristics of the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending method (poly-nomials versus cosines), the data chosen for detrending, and on the treatment of gaps in the light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiment shows evidence of moons in about 10 % of those light curves that do not contain an injected moon. Strikingly, many of these false-positive moons resemble the exomoon candidate, i.e. a Neptune-sized moon at about 20 Jupiter radii from the planet. We recover between about a third and half of the injected moons, depending on the detrending method, with radii and orbital distances broadly corresponding to the injected values. Conclusions. A ∆BIC of −4.9 for the CoFiAM-based detrending is indicative of an exomoon in the three transits of Kepler-1625 b. This solution, however, is only one out of many and we find very different solutions depending on the details of the detrending method. We find it concerning that the detrending is so clearly key to the exomoon interpretation of the available data of Kepler-1625 b. Further high-accuracy transit observations may overcome the effects of red noise but the required amount of additional data might be large.</p>

Its Kepler magnitude of 15.756 makes it a relatively dim Kepler target. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The challenge of this tentative detection is in the noise properties of the data, which are affected by the systematic noise of the Kepler space telescope and by the astrophysical variability of the star. Although the exomoon signal did show up both around the ingress/egress regions of the phase-folded transits (known as the orbital sampling effect; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heller 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller et al. 2016a</ref>) generated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al.

The three observed transits lower this threshold by a factor of √ 3, suggesting a minimum moon radius of ≈ 3 R ⊕ . In fact, the proposed moon candidate is as large as Neptune, making this system distinct from any planet-moon system known in the solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heller 2018</ref>).</p><p>Here we present a detailed study of the three publicly available transits of Kepler-1625 b.

In brief, we</p><p>1. develop a model to simulate photometric transits of a planet with a moon (see Sect. 2.2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>The main challenge in fitting a parameterized, noise-less model to observed data is in removing noise on time scales similar or larger than the time scales of the effect to be searched; at the same time, the structure of the effect shall be untouched, an approach sometimes referred to as "pre-whitening" of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aigrain &amp; Irwin 2004</ref>). The aim of this approach is to remove unwanted variations in the data, e.g. from stellar activity, systematics, or instrumental effects. This approach bears the risk of both removing actual signal from the data and of introducing new systematic variability. The discovery and refutal of the exoplanet interpretation of variability in the stellar radial velocities of α Centauri B serves as a warning example ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dumusque et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rajpaul et al. 2016)</ref>. Recently developed Gaussian process frameworks, in which the systematics are modeled simultaneously with stellar variability, would be an alternative method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gibson et al. 2012</ref>). This has become particularly important for the extended Kepler mission (K2) that is now working with degraded pointing accuracy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aigrain et al. 2015</ref>). That being said, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> applied a prewhitening technique to both the Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) flux and the Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDCSAP) flux of Kepler-1625 to determine whether a planet-only or a planet-moon model is more likely to have caused the observed Kepler data. In the following, we develop a detrending and model fitting procedure that is based on the method applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>, and then we test alternative detrending methods.</p><p>During Kepler's primary mission, the star Kepler-1625 has been monitored for 3.5 years in total, and five transits could have been observed. This sequence of transits can be labeled as transits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Due to gaps in the data, however, only three transits have been covered, which correspond to transits 2, 4, and 5 in this sequence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the actual data set that we discuss. The entire SAP (left) and PDCSAP (right) light curves are shown in the top panels, and close-up inspections of the observed transit 2, 4, and 5 are shown in the remaining panels. The time system used throughout the article is the Barycentric Kepler Julian Date (BKJD), unless marked as relative to a transit midpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Detrending</head><p>A key pitfall of any pre-whitening or detrending method is the unwanted removal of signal or injection of systematic noise, the latter of which could mimic signal. In our case of an exomoon search, we know that the putative signal would be restricted to a time-window around the planetary mid-transit, which is compatible with the orbital Hill stability of the moon. This criterion defines a possible window length that we should exclude from our detrending procedures. For a nominal 10 Jupiter-mass planet in a 287 d orbit around a 1.1 M star (as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. 2018)</ref>, this window is about 3.25 days to both sides of the transit midpoint (see Appendix A).</p><p>Although this window length is astrophysically plausible to protect possible exomoon signals, many other choices are similarly plausible but they result in significantly different detrendings. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the effect on the detrended light curve if two different windows around the midpoint of the planetary transit (here transit 5) are excluded from the fitting. We chose a fourth-order polynomial detrending function and a 7.5 d (blue symbols) or a 4 d (orange symbols) region around the midpoint to be excluded from the detrending, mainly for illustrative pur- The lines show a 4th-order polynomial fit for which we exclude 7.5 d (blue) or 4 d (orange) of data around the mid-point (dashed parts), respectively. Center: Dots show the detrended light curve derived from the blue polynomial fit in the top panel. The blue line illustrates a planet-only transit model. Bottom: Dots visualize the detrended light curve using the orange polynomial fit from the top panel. Note the additional moon-like transit feature caused by the overshooting of the orange polynomial in the top panel. The orange line shows a planetmoon transit model with moon parameters as in Table 1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> for transit dynamics). As an alternative interpretation, the blue detrending function filters out an actually existing moon signature while the orange detrending fit preserves the moon signal.</p><p>poses. In particular, with the latter choice we produce a moonlike signal around the planetary transit similar to the moon signal that appears in transit 5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>. For the former choice, however, this signal does not appear in the detrended light curve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> use the Cosine Filtering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM) detrending algorithm to detrend both the SAP and PDCSAP flux around the three transits of Kepler-1625 b. CoFiAM fits a series of cosines to the light curve, excluding a specific region around the transit. CoFiAM preserves the signal of interest by using only cosines with a period longer than a given threshold and therefore avoids the injection of artificial signals with periods shorter than this threshold. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> also test polynomial detrending functions but report that this removes the possible exomoon signal. We choose to reimplement the CoFiAM algorithm as our primary detrending algorithm to remain as close as possible in our analysis to the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>. In our injection-retrieval test we also use polynomials of second, third, and fourth order for detrending. While low-order polynomials cannot generally fit the light curve as well as the series of cosines, the risk of injecting artificial signals may be reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Trigonometric detrending</head><p>We implement the CoFiAM detrending algorithm as per the descriptions given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kipping et al. (2013b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>. In the following, we refer to this reimplementation as trigonometric detrending as opposed to polynomial functions that we test as well (see Sect. 2.4.4).</p><p>The light curves around each transit are detrended independently. For each transit, we start by using the entire SAP flux of the corresponding quarter. We use the SAP flux instead of the PDCSAP flux to reproduce the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> as closely as possible. The authors argue that the use of SAP flux avoids the injection of additional signals into the light curve that might have the shape of a moon signal. First, we remove outliers using a running median with a window length of 20 h and a threshold of 3 times the local standard deviation with the same window length. In order to achieve a fast convergence of our detrending and transit fitting procedures, we initially estimate the transit midpoints and durations by eye and identify data anomalies, e.g. gaps and jumps (e.g. the jump 2 d prior to transit 2 and the gap 4 d after transit 4, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Jumps in the light curve can have multiple reasons. The jumps highlighted around transit 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> are caused by a reaction wheel zero crossing event; the jump 5 d after transit 4 is caused by a change in temperature after a break in the data collection. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>, who ignore data points beyond gaps and other anomalous events for detrending, we cut the light curve around any of the transits as soon as it encounters the first anomaly, leaving us with a light curve of a total duration D around each transit (see top left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). In Sect. 2.4.4, we investigate the effect of including data beyond gaps. The detrending is then applied in two passes, using the first pass to get accurate transit parameters. In particular, we determine the duration (t T ) between the start of the planetary transit ingress and the end of the transit egress <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003)</ref> and the second pass to generate the detrended light curve.</p><p>First pass: Using the estimated transit midpoints and durations, we calculate the time window (t c , see top left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>) around a given transit midpoint to be cut from the detrending fit as t c = f t c t T , where the factor f t c , relating the time cut around the transit to the transit duration, is an input parameter for the detrending algorithm. Specifically, t c denotes the total length of time around the transit excluded from the detrending. We fit the detrending function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G k (t, a, b) = a 0 + k l=1 a l cos l 2π 2D t + b l sin l 2π 2D t (1)</formula><p>to the light curve (excluding the region t c around the transit) by minimizing the χ 2 between the light curve and G k (t, a, b), where a = (a 0 , a 1 , ..., a k ) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">b = (b 1 , b 2 , .</formula><p>.., b k ) are the free model parameters to be fitted. The parameter k is a number between 1 and k max = round(2D/t p ), where t p = f t p t T is the time scale below which we want to preserve possible signals. f t p is an input parameter to the detrending algorithm. For each k we divide the light curve by G k , giving us the detrended light curves F k . We calculate the first-order autocorrelation according to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Durbin &amp; Watson (1950)</ref> test statistic for each F k (excluding again the region around the transit). For each transit we select the F k with the lowest autocorrelation F k min and combine these F k min around each transit into our detrended light curve F. We fit the planetonly transit model to the detrended light curve F and compute the updated transit midpoints and duration t T .</p><p>Second pass: The second pass repeats the steps of the first pass, but using the updated transit midpoints and durations as input. The resulting detrended light curve F is then used for our model fits with the ultimate goal of assessing whether an exomoon is a likely interpretation of the light curve signatures or not. We estimate the noise around each transit by taking the variance of F, excluding the transit region. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the detrending function as well as the detrended light curve for f t c = 2.2 and f t p = 4.4, corresponding to t c = 1.6 d and t p = 3.1 d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transit model</head><p>We construct two transit models, one of which contains a planet only and one of which contains a planet with one moon. We denote the planet-only model as M 0 (the index referring to the number of moons) and the planet-moon model as M 1 . We do not consider models with more than one moon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Planet-only model</head><p>M 0 assumes a circular orbit of the planet around its star. Given the period of that orbit (P) and the ratio between stellar radius and the orbital semimajor axis (R /a), the sky-projected apparent distance to the star center relative to the stellar radius can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z = a R sin 2π(t − t 0 ) P 2 + b cos 2π(t − t 0 ) P 2 , (2)</formula><p>where b is the transit impact parameter and t 0 is the time of the transit midpoint. We use the python implementation of the Mandel &amp; Agol (2002) analytic transit model by Ian Crossfield 3 to calculate the transit light curve based on the planet-to-star radius ratio (r p = R p /R ) and based on a quadratic limb-darkening law paramterized by the limb-darkening parameters q 1 and q 2 as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kipping (2013)</ref>. We call this model light curve with zero moons F 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Planet-moon model</head><p>In our planet-moon model, we assume a circular orbit of the local planet-moon barycenter around the star with an orbital period P B , a semimajor axis a B , and a barycentric transit midpoint time t 0,B . The projected distance of the barycenter to the star center relative to the stellar radius is calculated the same way as in eq. 2. The planet and moon are assumed to be on circular orbits around their common center of mass with their relative distances to the barycenter determined the ratio of their masses M p and M s to the total mass M p + M s . The individual orbits of both the planet and the moon are defined by the total distance between the two objects a ps , the planet mass M p , the moon mass M s and by the time of the planet-moon conjunction t 0,s , that is, the time at which the moon is directly in front of the planet as seen from an observer on Earth. This model is degenerate in terms of the sense of orbital motion of the moon. In other words, a given planet-moon transit light curve can be produced by both a prograde and a retrograde  moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lewis &amp; Fujii 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heller &amp; Albrecht 2014</ref>). We restrict ourselves to prograde moons. The planet mass is set to a nominal 10 Jupiter masses, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> and in agreement with the estimates of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heller (2018)</ref>. This constraint simplifies the interpretation of the results substantially since the moon parameters are then unaffected by the planetary parameters. The moon mass is assumed to be much smaller than that of the planet. In fact, for a roughly Neptune-mass moon around a 10 Jupiter-mass planet, we expect a TTV amplitude of 3 to 4 minutes and a TDV amplitude of 6 to 7 minutes, roughly speaking. Hence, we simplify our model and set M s = 0, which means that a ps is equal to the distance between the moon and the planetmoon barycenter, a s . The moon is assumed to have a coplanar orbit around the planet and, thus, to have the same transit impact parameter as the planet. With these assumptions the projected distance of the planet center to the star center relative to the stellar radius z p is equal to that of the barycenter z B . The projected distance of the moon center to the star center relative to the stellar radius z s is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">z 2 s = a B R sin 2π(t − t 0,B ) P B + a ps R sin 2π(t − t 0,s ) P s 2 + b cos 2π(t − t 0,B ) P B 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where P s is the orbital period of the moon calculated from the fixed masses and a ps .</p><p>We calculate the transit light curves of both bodies and combine them into the total model light curve, which we call F 1 . We use the limb-darkening parameter transformation from <ref type="bibr">Kip- ping (2013)</ref>. For computational efficiency, we do not consider planet-moon occultations. For the planet-moon system of interest, occultations would only occur only about half of the transits (assuming a random moon phase) even if the moon orbital plane would be perfectly parallel to the line of sight.

One of us (MH) injected two cases of transits into the out-of-transit parts of the original PDCSAP Kepler flux. In one case, a sequence of three planetonly transits (similar to the sequence of real transits 2, 4, and 5) was injected, where the planet was chosen to have a radius of 11 Earth radii. In another case, a sequence of three transits of a planet with moon with properties similar to the proposed Jupiter-Neptune system was injected. Author KR then applied the Baysian framework described above in order to evaluate the planet-only vs. the planet-with-moon hypotheses and in order to characterize the planet and (if present) its moon.</p><p>As an important trait of our experiment, KR did not know which of the light curves contained only a planet and which contained also a moon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Transit injections into light curves</head><p>For the injection part, we use PyOSE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller et al. 2016a</ref>,b) to create synthetic planet and moon ensemble transits. This code numerically integrates the non-occulted areas of the stellar disk to calculate the instantaneous flux of the star, which makes it a computationally slow procedure. Hence we use the analytical model described Sect. 2.2 for the retrieval part. In our model, the moon's orbit is defined by its eccentricity (e s , fixed at 0), a s , its orbital inclination with respect to the circumstellar orbit (i s , fixed at 90 • ), the longitude of the ascending node, the argument of the periapsis, and the planetary impact parameter (b, fixed at zero). Due to the small TTV and TDV amplitudes compared to the 29.4 min exposure of the Kepler long cadence data, we neglect the planet's motion around the planet/moon barycenter, although PyOSE can model this dynamical effect as well, and assume that the moon orbits the center of the planet.</p><p>Our numerical code creates a spherical limb-darkened star on a 2-dimensional grid of floating-point values. The sky-projected shapes of both the planet and the moon are modeled as black circles. The spatial resolution of the simulation is chosen to be a few million pixels so that the resulting light curve has a numerical error &lt; 1 ppm that is negligible compared to the ≈ 700 ppm noise level of the Kepler light curve. The initial temporal resolution of our model is equivalent to 1 000 steps per planetary transit duration, which we then downsample to the observed 29.4 min cadence. The creation of one such light curve of a planet with a moon takes about one minute on a modern desktop computer.</p><p>We create a set of 100 such transit simulations of the planetmoon ensemble, where the two bodies move consistently during and between transits. All orbits are modeled to be co-planar and mutual planet-moon occultations are also included. For each transit sequence, the initial orbital phase of the planet-moon system is chosen randomly.</p><p>With P B = 287.378949 d and P s = 2.20833 d, the moon advances by ≈ 0.13 in phase between each subsequent planetary transit (P B /P s ≈ 130.13). During a planetary transit, the moon advances by ≈ 0.36 rad in phase (the planetary transit duration is 0.7869 ± 0.0084 d).</p><p>We also create a set of 100 such transits that only have a transiting planet without a moon.

Any effects that we would see in our experiments with the real Kepler-1625 light curve but not in the synthetic light curves with noise only could then be attributed to the imperfect detrending of the timecorrelated (red) noise. MH generated 200 synthetic light curves with ten different levels of white noise, respectively, ranging from root mean squares of 250 ppm to 700 ppm in steps of 50 ppm. This results in a total of 2 000 synthetic light curves. MH used the method described in Sect. 2.4.1 to inject three transits of a planet only into 100 light curves per noise level and three transits of a planet with a moon into the remaining 100 light curves per noise level.

MH delivered these light curves to KR without revealing their specific contents. KR then ran our model selection algorithm to find the ∆BIC for each of the 2 000 systems. After the ∆BICs were found, MH revealed the planet-only or the planet-moon nature of each light curve. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows the resulting ∆BICs for each of the 2 000 light curves, separated into the planet-only (left panel) and planetmoon injected systems (right panel) and sorted by the respective white noise level (along the abscissa). Each vertical column contains 100 light curves, respectively. For a noise level of 250 ppm, as an example, our algorithm finds no false positive moons in the planet-only data, that is, no system with a ∆BIC &lt; −6, while 1 case remains ambiguous (−6 &lt; ∆BIC &lt; 6) and the other 99 cases are correctly identified as containing no moons. In the case of an injected planet-moon system instead, the algorithm correctly retrieves the moon in 100 % of the synthetic light curves, that is, ∆BIC &lt; −6 for all systems.</p><p>More generally, for the simulated planet-only systems, the false positive rate is 0 % throughout all noise levels. Occasionally a system is flagged as ambiguous, but overall the algorithm consistently classifies planet-only systems correctly as having no moon. Referring to the injected planet-moon system (right panel), our false negative rate rises steadily with increasing noise level. In fact, it reaches parity with the true positive rate between about 650 ppm and 700 ppm.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> we present a s and R s for each of the maximumlikelihood fits shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.

In the case of an injected planet only (upper panels), the most likely values of a s are distributed almost randomly over the range of values that we explored. On the other hand, R s is constrained to a small range from about 1.5 R ⊕ at 250 ppm to roughly 3 R ⊕ at 700 ppm with the standard variation naturally increasing with the noise level.</p><p>The lower part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> shows the outcome of our planetmoon injection-retrievals from the synthetic light curves with white noise only. The correct parameters are generally recovered at all noise levels. In fact, we either recover the moon with a similar radius and orbital separation as the injection values (symbolized by blue points) or we find the moon to have very different radius and orbit while also rejection the hypothesis of its presence in the first place (symbolized by red points). The distribution of these false negatives in the a s -R s plane resembles the distribution of the true negatives in the corresponding no-moon cases. The ambiguous runs with a ∆BIC around 0 still mostly recover the injected moon parameters. This is especially clear for the 700 ppm level, with 50 % more ambiguous runs than true positives, where most of the runs still recover the injected parameters.</p></div>

We use the PDC-SAP flux instead of SAP flux because (1) it was easier for us to automate the anomaly detection and (2) PDCSAP flux has been cleaned from common systematics. Since the PDC pipeline removes many of the jumps in the data, we can focus on a single type of anomaly, that is gaps. Gaps are relatively easy to detect in an automated way, removing the requirement of visual inspection of each light curve. For the injection, we select out-of-transit parts of the Kepler-1625 light curve that have at least 50 d of mostly uninterrupted data (25 d to both sides of the designated time of transit injection), but accept the presence of occasional gaps with durations of up to several days during the injection process.</p><p>The set of 200 synthetic light curves was provided by MH to KR for blind retrieval without any disclosure as to which of the sequences have a moon. The time of mid-transit was communi- cated with a precision of 0.1 days to avoid the requirement of a pre-stage transit search. This is justified because (i.) the original transits of Kepler-1625 b have already been detected and (ii.) the transit are visible by-eye and do not necessarily need computerbased searches.

In addition to the trigonometric function, we detrend the light curve by polynomials of second, third and fourth order.</p><p>In addition, we test if the inclusion or neglect of data beyond any gaps in the light curve affects the detrending. In one variation of our detrending procedure, we use the entire ± 25 d of data (excluding any data within t c ) around a transit midpoint. In another variation, we restrict the detrending to the data up to the nearest gap (if present) on both sides of the transit. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Available on Zenodo, <ref type="bibr">[10.5281/zenodo.1202034]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hippke (2018)</ref> To avoid the requirement of time-consuming visual inspections of each light curve, we construct an automatic rule to determine the presence of gaps, which are the most disruptive kind of artifact to our detrending procedure. We define a gap as an interruption of the data of more than half a day. Whenever we do detect a gap, we cut another 12 h at both the beginning and the end of the gap, since our visual inspection of the data showed that many gaps are preceded or followed by anomalous trends (see e.g. the gap 4 d after transit 4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>We ignore any data points within t c around the transit midpoint (see Sect. 2.1.1). If a gap starts within an interval [t c /2, t c /2 + 12 h] around the transit midpoint, then we lift our constraint of dismissing a 12 h interval around gaps and use all the data within [t c /2, t c /2 + 12 h] plus any data up to 12 h around the next gap.</p><p>If all these cuts result in no data points for the detrending procedure to one side of one of the three transits in a sequence, then we ignore the entire sequence for our injection-retrieval experiment.

Whenever the light curve is cut at a gap, the detection rates for a moon increase -both for the false positives and for the true positives. Among all the detrending methods, this effect is especially strong for the trigonometric detrending. The false positive rate increases by almost a factor of two from 8.75 % (T/N) to 16.25 % (T/G) and the true positive rate increases by 15 % to 46.25 %. The effect on the true negative rate is strongest for the trigonometric detrending, decreasing from 87.5 % when the light curve is not cut at gaps (T/N) to 72.5 % if the light curve is cut (T/G).

In particular, we find that the moon turns out to be more likely (deeper-blue dots) when it is fitted to have a larger radius. The parameters of the false positives (blue dots in the upper set of panels) are more widely spread out, with moon radii ranging between 2 and 5 R ⊕ and the moon semimajor axes spread out through essentially the entire parameter range that we explored. The clustering of median a s at around 100 R J is an artifact of taking the median over a very unlocalized distribution along a s .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this article we compare several detrending methods of the light curve of Kepler-1625, some of which were used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> in their characterization of the exomoon candidate around Kepler-1625 b. However, we do not perform an exhaustive survey of all available detrending methods, such as Gaussian processes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aigrain et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>We show that the sequential detrending and fitting procedure of transit light curves is prone to introducing features that can be misinterpreted as signal, in our case as an exomoon. This "prewhitening" method of the data has thus to be used with caution. Our investigations of a polynomial-based fitting and of a trigonometric detrending procedure show that the resulting bestfit model depends strongly on the specific detrending function, e.g. on the order of the polynomial or on the minimum time scale (or wavelength) of a cosine. This is crucial for any search of secondary effects in the transit light curves -moons, rings, evaporating atmospheres etc. -and is in stark contrast to a claim by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aizawa et al. (2017)</ref>, who stated that neither the choice of the detrending function nor the choice of the detrending window of the light curve would have a significant effect on the result. We find that this might be true on a by-eye level but not on a level of 100 ppm or below. Part of the difference between our findings and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aizawa et al. (2017)</ref> could be in the different time scales we investigate. While they considered the effect of stellar flairs on time scales of less than a day, much less than the ∼2 day transit duration of their specific target, our procedure operates on various time scales of up to several weeks. Moreover, we develop a dynamical moon model to fit multiple transits, whereas Aizawa et al. (2017) study only a single transit.</p><p>Since the actual presence and the putative orbital position of a hypothetical exomoon around Kepler-1625 b is unknown a priori, it is unclear how much of the light curve would need to be protected from (or neglected for) the pre-fit detrending process in order to avoid a detrending of a possible moon signal itself. In turn, we show that in the case of Kepler-1625 different choices for this protected time scale around the transit yield different confidences and different solutions for a planet-moon system. We find that the previously announced solution by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> is only one of many possibilities with similar likelihoods (specifically: Bayesian Information Criteria). This suggests, but by no means proves, that all of these solutions could, in fact, be due to red noise artifacts (e.g. stellar or instrumental) rather than indicative of a moon signal.</p><p>Our finding of higher true positive rate compared to a false positive rate from injection-retrieval experiments could be interpreted as slight evidence in favor of a genuine exomoon. This interpretation, however, depends on the number of transiting planets and planet candidates around stars with similar noise characteristics that were included in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref> search. Broadly speaking, if more than a handful of similar targets were studied, the probability of at least one false positive detection becomes quite likely.</p></div>

Our ∆BIC value would certainly change if we could include the additional data from the high-precision transit observations executed in October 2017 with the Hubble Space Telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. 2018</ref>) in our analysis. Moreover, by varying the free parameters of our detrending procedure, we also find completely different solutions for a planet-moon system, i.e. different planet-moon orbital configurations during transits and different moon radii or planet-moon orbital semimajor axes.</p><p>As an extension to this validation of the previously published work, we performed 200 injection-retrieval experiments into the original out-of-transit parts of the Kepler light curve. We also extended the previous work by exploring different detrending methods, such as second-, third-, and fourth-order polynomials as well as trigonometric methods and find false-positive rates between 8.75 % and 16.25 %, depending on the method. Surprisingly, we find that the moon radius and planet-moon distances of these false positives are very similar to the ones measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>. In other words, in 8.75 % to 16.25 % of the light curves that contained an artificially injected planet only, we find a moon that is about as large as Neptune and orbits Kepler-1625 b at about 20 R J .</p><p>To sum up, we find tentative statistical evidence for a moon in this particular Kepler light curve of Kepler-1625, but we also show that the significant fraction of similar light curves, which contained a planet only, would nevertheless indicate a moon with properties similar to the candidate Kepler-1625 b-i. Clearly, stellar and systematic red noise components are the ultimate barrier to an unambiguous exomoon detection around Kepler-1625 b and follow-up observations have the potential of solving this riddle based on the framework that we present.</p><p>Of all the detrending methods we investigated, the trigonometric method, which is very similar to the CoFiAM method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teachey et al. (2018)</ref>, can produce the highest true positive rate. At the same time, however, this method also ranks among the ones producing the highest false positive rates as well. To conclude, we recommend that any future exomoon candidate be detrended with as many different detrending methods as possible to evaluate the robustness of the classification. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: Effect of the window length on the Bayesian Information Criterion</head><p>Given the constraint of orbital stability, a moon can only possibly orbit its planet within the planet's Hill sphere. Hence, transits may only occur within a certain time interval around the midpoint of the planetary transit. This time t Hill can be calculated as</p><p>where v orbit is the orbital velocity of the planet-moon system around the star, M p and M the planet and star mass, P the orbital period of the planet-moon system, and R Hill is the Hill radius of the planet. η is a factor between 0 and 1, which has been numerically determined for prograde moons (η ≈ 0.5) and for retrograde moons (η ≈ 1), details depending on the orbital eccentricities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Domingos et al. 2006</ref>). We focus on prograde moons and choose η = 0.5. For a 10 M J planet in a 287 d orbit around a 1.1 M star the Hill time is t Hill = 3.25 d. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the length of the light curve, which is neglected for the polynomial fit has a strong effect on the resulting detrended light curve. <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.1 shows the effect that different cutout times t c and detrending base lines D can have on whether a moon is detected or not.</p></div>			</div>
