				<p>An Earth-like exoplanet orbiting a white dwarf would be exposed to different UV environments than Earth, influencing both its atmospheric photochemistry and UV surface environment. Using a coupled 1D climate-photochemistry code we model atmospheres of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of white dwarfs for surface temperatures between 6000 K and 4000 K, corresponding to about 7 billion years of white dwarf evolution, as well as discuss the evolution of planetary models in the habitable zone during that evolution.</p>

Exoplanet searches are underway around white dwarfs (WDs) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fulton et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fossati et al.

(2015)</ref>), as the similarity with Earth's size should make Earth-sized exoplanets transiting WDs easier to detect and characterize than such planets around much larger main sequence stars (e.g. via atmospheric profile measurements from transit observations, "weather" modeling from orbital light curves, direct measurement of atmospheric constituents with spectroscopy, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agol 2011</ref>). Studies of close-by WDs with NASA's K2 mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Howell et al. 2014</ref>) constrain the occurrence of Earth-sized habitable zone (HZ) planets in those systems to be &lt; 28% <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(van Sluijs &amp; Van Eylen 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Assuming that an Earth-like planet could form or survive around a WD, the WD cooling process will provide a changing luminosity as well as UV environment, which affects an orbiting planet's temperature, atmospheric photochemistry, and UV surface flux. The luminosity of a cool WD evolves slower than in its initial hot phase, thus cool WDs could provide stable environments for potentially habitable planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agol 2011</ref>). Several studies have suggested that the unique UV environment would be high enough to sustain complex chemical processes necessary for Earthlike life, while not being strong enough to damage DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McCree 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fossati et al. 2012</ref>) using estimates assuming present day Earth atmospheres.</p><p>Multiple teams have shown that a fraction of WDs show evidence of recent heavy metal pollution, which could signal the existence of either disks or planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Koester &amp; Wilken (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Koester et al.

For reviews of WD debris disks and pollution see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jura &amp; Young (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Farihi (2016)</ref>, and for potential post-main sequence planetary evolution see <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Veras (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Transit simulations using an unchanged present-day Earth-analog atmosphere composition suggest that the depth of Earth's biosignatures around a WD would be very strong and detectable by future missions such as JWST <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Loeb &amp; Maoz 2013)</ref>. However a WD's spectral energy distribution (SED) can be significantly different from our presentday Sun. To model the effects of the WD's emitted flux on the atmosphere as well as the surface UV environment of an exoplanet, we use incident WD SED models at different points of a 0.6 M WD's evolution <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) in our models between 6000 K and 4000 K ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>We model planets orbiting WDs at three points in their evolution <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>, with surface temperatures at 6000 K, 5000 K and 4000 K, during which time the WD's luminosity does not change significantly compared to the early luminosity change in a WD's evolution (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). That surface temperature change corresponds to about 7 billion years (Gyr) for a 0.6 M WD. We consider planets with eroded atmospheres as well as with higher surface pressure (e.g. super-Earths). We show the atmospheric structure and chemical composition as well as the UV surface fluxes at biologically relevant wavelengths.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">White Dwarf Model Spectra</head><p>WDs are unique stellar environments with very high surface gravities and extremely dense interiors and physical conditions. They have no internal heat source, and thus cool off over time <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). We use WD spectral energy distribution models (SED) calculated as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Saumon et al. (2014)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure 2)</ref> as irradiation for the planetary models (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bergeron et al.

The WD models assume a pure H atmospheric composition with a surface gravity of log g = 8.0 in creating the models for the average mass of WD in the field (0.6 M ; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kepler et al. (2016)</ref>). The WD radius is then recovered by finding the intersection of the standard surface gravity formula with the WD mass-radius-(temperature) relation for C-O core WDs with thick H layers discussed by <ref type="bibr">Parsons</ref>  extrapolated to T&lt;10,000 K. The radius of the WD in our model is 0.0128±0.0001 R for surface temperatures of 6000 K to 4000 K. WD spectra are similar to black bodies with only Balmer absorption lines for surface temperatures greater than 5000 K, where hydrogen becomes neutral as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. We use models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergeron et al. (2001)</ref> for the temperature evolution of the WD (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Photochemistry of some biologically interesting species</head><p>Some atmospheric species exhibit noticeable features in our planet's spectrum as a result directly or indirectly from biological activity. The main ones are oxygen (O 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">De- marais et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kaltenegger (2017)</ref>). We summarize the most important reactions that influence these species in Earth's atmosphere here. Many reactions in Earth's atmosphere are driven by the Sun's UV flux. Ozone and O 2 are created with UV photons through the Chapman reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chapman 1930)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O 2 + hν → O + O (λ &lt; 240 nm), O + O 2 + M → O 3 + M, O 3 + hν → O 2 + O (λ &lt; 320 nm), O 3 + O → 2O 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where M is a background molecule such as N 2 . These reactions are primarily responsible for ozone production on present day Earth. A higher UV flux additionally increases the primary source reactions of tropospheric hydroxyl (OH) for 300 &lt; λ &lt; 320 nm in the troposphere,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">O 3 + hν → O( 1 D) + O 2 , O( 1 D) + H 2 O → OH + OH,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>reducing O 3 and H 2 O. Increased OH is the primary sink for H 2 , CH 4 , CH3Cl, and CO abundances.</p><p>Methane <ref type="bibr">(CH 4</ref> ) is a reducing gas that has a lifetime of 10-12 years in present day Earth's atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr">Hougton et al. 2004</ref>) due to reactions with oxidizing species. It has both natural (termites, wetlands) and anthropogenic sources (rice agriculture, natural gas). It is oxidized via</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">CH 4 + 2O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>creating H 2 O and H 2 via photolysis,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">CH 4 + hν → CH 2 + H 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Its main sink is due to the reaction,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">OH + CH 4 → CH 3 + H 2 O,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>in the troposphere, and photolysis in the stratosphere. This reaction also creates H 2 O in the stratosphere, above where it is shielded by the ozone layer. On Earth both nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) are primarily produced by life, and are depleted by higher amounts of UV. N 2 O is a greenhouse gas that is extremely effective when trapping heat. It is produced naturally in soil through nitrification and denitrification, and its anthropogenic source is from agriculture. Photolysis of N 2 O occurs for λ &lt; 220 nm, and is its main sink on present day Earth. Increased O 3 , e.g. due to UV irradition, is also a sink of N 2 O,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N 2 O + O( 1 D) → 2NO,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>creating NO. It depletes ozone via During the cooling process of a WD, its surface temperature as well as its overall luminosity decreases. This, in turn, influences the orbital distance of its HZ. The HZ is the circular region around one or multiple stars in which standing bodies of liquid water could exist on a rocky planet's surface (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. (1993)</ref>; ; ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kopparapu et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kopparapu et al. ( , 2014</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ramirez &amp; Kaltenegger (2017)</ref>) and facilitate the detection of possible atmospheric biosignatures (see e.g. Kaltenegger <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2017)</ref>). The classical, conservative N 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O HZ is defined by the greenhouse effect of two gases: CO 2 and H 2 O vapor. The inner edge corresponds to the distance where mean surface temperatures exceed the critical point of water (∼647 K, 220 bar), triggering a runaway greenhouse that leads to rapid water loss to space on very short timescales (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. (1993)</ref> for details). Toward the outer edge of the classical HZ weathering rates decrease, allowing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations to increase as stellar insolation decreases. At the outer edge, condensation and scattering by CO 2 outstrips its greenhouse capacity, the so-called maximum greenhouse limit of CO 2 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2 .<label>(7</label></formula><p>The cooling of a WD translates into an inward shift of the orbital distances of the WD HZ, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3a</ref>). In addition to the decrease in overall irradiance (S ef f ) as the WD cools, some of the change in the HZ orbital distance is also caused by the shift of the peak wavelength of emission of the WD SED to redder wavelengths, which heat the surface of the planet more efficiently than bluer light (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. (1993)</ref>). A 0.6 M WD spends about 7 Gyr cooling from 6000 K to 4000 K, providing a phase during which its luminos-ity does not rapidly change and thus it could provide temperate conditions for an orbiting planet. The size of the WD HZ is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3a</ref> as well as the corresponding irradiance of a planet, normalized to the value for Earth (S ef f ) shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref>. Because of the small size of a WD compared to the Sun, the WD HZ is a factor of ∼100 to ∼1000 times closer to the WD than Earth is to the Sun.</p><p>An alternative HZ limit that is not based on atmospheric models (like the classical HZ) but on empirical observations of our Solar System is also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> for comparison. The inner edge of the empirical HZ is defined by the stellar flux received by Venus when we can exclude the possibility that it had standing water on the surface (about 1 Gyr ago), equivalent to a stellar flux of S ef f = 1.77, corresponding to a distance of 0.75 AU for Earth's current Solar flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>). The "early Mars" limit is based on observations suggesting that the Martian surface may have supported standing bodies of water ∼3.8 Gyr ago, when the Sun was only 75% as bright as today. For our solar system, S ef f = 0.32 for this limit, corresponding to a distance of ∼1.77 AU (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. (1993)</ref>).</p><p>We first explore the range of conditions for Earth-like planets orbiting WDs of different temperatures seen at one point in time (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). Then we model two case studies, A and B, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, which explore the environment of a planet in the HZ of a WD as it cools (see Section 3.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Planetary photochemistry environments for different stages in a WD's evolution</head><p>The lack of chromospheric activity for a WD at different stages in its evolution causes photochemical differences in the atmospheres of planets orbiting it compared to Earth. We modeled planets with different surface pressures, which receive an equivalent total irradiance as Earth from the Sun (S ef f ) from a WD at three different stages in its evolution: for WD surface temperatures of 6000 K, 5000 K and 4000 K. We model planets with surface pressures ranging from 2 bar to 0.3 bar. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> summarizes the model planet surface temperature and integrated overall ozone column depth (ozone column depth) for the different planetary models as well as our Earth model for comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows the changes in temperature as well as the mixing ratio for O 3 , CH 4 , H 2 O, CH 3 Cl and N 2 O for the different models, compared to Earth. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows that in the model atmospheres H 2 O photolysis increases with higher UV levels in the upper atmosphere, where H 2 O is not shielded from incoming photons below the ozone layer. N 2 O is depleted by photolysis, with a decreasing mixing ratio toward the top of the atmosphere, but remains well mixed beneath the ozone layer, where it is shielded. All higher surface pressure models show increased amounts of CH 4 , N 2 O, and CH 3 Cl in the upper atmosphere. Atmospheric H 2 O increases with higher surface temperatures.</p><p>The WD cooling process provides a changing luminosity as well as UV environment at a set orbital distance, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The decrease in UV incident flux leads to an overall decrease in the ozone level. Compared to present day Earth's integrated overall ozone column depth, a higher surface pressure atmosphere receiving similar UV irradiance has a higher ozone column depth, as seen in the values for our planet models with surface pressures above 1 bar orbiting a WD with a surface temperature of 6000 K. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2014)</ref>). The red (recent Venus) and blue (early Mars) lines show the limits of the empirical HZ (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ramirez &amp; Kaltenegger (2017)</ref>).

However, the different WD UV environments compared to the Sun's lead to a 5% increase in ozone column depth for the 6000 K WD surface temperature, and a 28% and 67% decrease of ozone column depth for the 5000 K and 4000 K WDs compared to Earth.</p><p>Higher ozone levels cause a higher rate of the R2 reaction, producing OH. Increased amounts of OH for higher UV levels depletes CH 4 via the R5 reaction, and similarly CH 3 Cl via the R8 reaction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>).</p></div>

The different UV WD environments, the decreased overall amount of oxygen, as well as the decreased density of 8 the atmosphere lead to a 33%, 52%, and 80% decrease in ozone column depth compared to Earth. Longer mean-free-paths due to lower atmospheric density result in photolysis occurring at lower altitudes, causing ozone to form closer to the ground (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4)</ref>. Planet models with a 2 bar surface pressure show surfaces temperatures of 289.0 K, 298.1 K, 305.1 K for WD surface temperatures of 6000 K, 5000 K and 4000 K respectively. The different UV environments compared to the Sun and the increase in overall oxygen content as well as density of the atmosphere lead to a 28% increase in ozone column depth for the 6000 K WD surface temperature, and a17%, and 57% decrease in ozone column depth compared to Earth, less than for the 1.5 bar surface pressure case.</p></div>

Case A shows the maximum time a planet can stay in the HZ of the WD as the WD cools from 6000 K to 4000 K. This amounts to ∼6 Gyr for the classical (conservative) HZ and ∼8.5 Gyr for the empirical HZ. Case B focuses on a planet that initially receives the same irradiance as Earth around a WD with a surface temperature of 5000 K. As the WD cools from 6000 K to 4000 K the planet spends ∼4 Gyr in the conservative HZ and ∼7 Gyr in the empirical HZ. Model parameters and results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 4 and 5</ref>, with comparisons to Earth in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> for both cases. UV environments are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> for Case A and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> for Case B, and photochemistry is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>Such a planet could have orbited in the HZ of a cool WD for longer than the Earth has existed.

This leads to decreasing planetary surfaces temperatures of 328.4 K, 249.6 K, 191.9 K for WD surface temperatures of 6000 K, 5000 K and 4000 K, respectively.</p><p>In our model the planet's surface temperature is on average above freezing for only a part of the time the planet spends in the WD's HZ, a few billion years <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). However we have not adjusted the CO 2 content in our models, thus if a cycle similar to the carbonate silicate cycle on Earth existed on such a planet, CO 2 concentration should increase, heating the planet's surface temperature and keeping it from freezing. As shortly discussed, a geologically active planet is the underlying as-sumption of continued habitability during a star's evolution, and is what led to the concept of the HZ (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. (1993)</ref>). For a WD, a similar cycle could be possible, extending the time the surface of such a planet can be above freezing to the full range of its time in the WD's HZ.</p><p>The different WD UV environments compared to the Sun lead to a 29%, 18%, and 82% decrease in overall ozone column depth compared to Earth. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, ozone levels are highest for a WD model of 5000 K, providing a slightly higher shielding from UV than present day Earth. However, during both the 6000 K and 4000 K WD surface temperature stages, the UVC flux at the surface increases substantially for different reasons. During the 6000 K WD surface temperature period, UV photons with λ &lt; 320 [R1] are available. These can dissociate ozone, therefore increasing the UV surface flux. The 4000 K WD model has a comparably high amount of surface UVC radiation because low UV irradiation from the 4000 K WD cannot initially produce enough ozone to efficiently shield the surface of the planet.</p><p>The amount of UVA integrated surface flux compared to the ITOA integrated flux is 71%, 74%, and 78%, for the 6000 K, 5000 K, and 4000 K WD surface temperature cases, comparable to the 70% for model Earth models. For UVB flux, which is partially shielded by ozone, 24%, 15%, and 32% of the integrated ITOA UVB reach the surface, for the 6000 K, 5000 K, and 4000 K WD surface temperature cases, compared to 11% for present day Earth models. The UVC flux is almost completely shielded by an ozone layer, and the percentage of the integrated ITOA flux reaching the planetary surface 1.0×10 −5 %, 2.4×10 −14 %, and 1.0×10 −3 %, for the 6000 K, 5000 K, and 4000 K WD surface temperature cases, respectively, compared to 5.4×10 −18 % for present day Earth models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">How could white dwarf planets form?</head><p>The mechanisms required for a WD planetary system to form as secondary generation objects from a disk or to survive postmain sequence evolution are not well understood. During the post main sequence evolution of the host into a WD, inner rocky planets (within 1-2 AU) would likely be destroyed (e.g. Villaver <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2011)</ref>  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2014)</ref>), while stellar mass loss would cause semimajor axis expansion for outer planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Veras (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ramirez &amp; Kaltenegger (2016)</ref>). Exomoons of outer planets could potentially migrate inward <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Veras 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ramirez &amp; Kaltenegger 2016)</ref>, although the estimated occurrence rate wouldn't explain the rate of polluted WDs (van Sluijs &amp; Van Eylen 2017; Van Eylen et al. 2017). Second-generation planets could even form from fall-back of debris initially expelled during the post-main sequence evolution of the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Veras 2016</ref>). An interesting system is WD1145+017, a WD orbited by a rocky minor planet undergoing tidal disintegration at the system's Roche limit (Vanderburg et al. 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Only dry planets? White dwarfs</head><p>start with an extremely hot phase</p><p>With no stellar mass loss during the WD phase (and assuming rapid tidal circularization of its orbit), a planet should remain at the same orbital distance during a WD's evolution. Due to the extreme change in luminosity early in a WD's evolution <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) a temperate planet around a cool WD would have thus experienced an extremely high luminosity and corresponding surface temperature early in its history. This would initiate a runaway greenhouse process and extreme water loss on such planets early in their history. Similarly for planets orbiting pre-main sequence M-type stars, which also are more luminous initially and should be able to initiate a runaway greenhouse phase and water loss on a temperate planet that can be found in the main sequence HZ later on (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ramirez &amp; Kaltenegger (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnes et al. (2015)</ref>), there may be methods of late water delivery occurring in a WD system after to the WD has cooled to a surface temperature that maintains a slower changing luminosity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jura &amp; Xu (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Farihi et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Malamud &amp; Perets (2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017a</ref>).</p><p>Any Earth-like planet that is orbiting too close to the WD would remain in a runaway greenhouse stage for a certain time, until it entered the WD HZ. Whether or not such planets would have lost all their water at that point would depend strongly on the initial water reservoir, and whether it can be replenished. Thus, whether a WD planet can host water and an Earth-like atmosphere, is an open question and will depend on its evolution as well as when the WD planet is formed, from what materials it is made of and whether the possibility of a continuous water delivery exists in WD planetary systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">A white dwarf planet's evolution differs from that of Earth</head><p>A planet orbiting a WD will receive decreasing overall energy from its host during the WD's cooling process. Its evolution is very different from that of a planet orbiting a main sequence star, whose luminosity increases with time, pushing the HZ to wider separations. For a planet around a main sequence star, the increase in greenhouse gases at the inner edge of the HZ coupled with the increasing luminosity of the host star limit the time it can remain habitable. If a cycle similar to the carbonate silicate cycle could also operate on WD planets, planets on the inner edge of a WD could build up substan-tial greenhouse gas amounts in their atmospheres as well; however due to the decreasing luminosity of their WD host, such build up of greenhouse gases could help to maintain warm surface temperature as the WD flux decreases, possibly extending the length of time life could survive on WD planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Our models explore the atmospheric environments of planets orbiting WDs, taking into consideration the changing surface temperatures and UV environments of WDs during their cooling process.</p><p>We model the atmospheric composition as well as the UV surface environments of Earth-like planets orbiting WDs during different points throughout a WD's evolution. Our planet models have surface pressures ranging from 2 bar to 0.3 bar, including Earth-analog planets with 1 bar atmospheres, as well as planets with 0.3 bar surface pressure (e.g. eroded atmospheres) and planets with higher surface pressures of 1.5 bar and 2 bar (e.g, super-Earths).</p><p>The integrated overall ozone column depth is less than on present day Earth for all our model runs, except for the models with surfaces pressures of 1 bar or above for the WD 6000 K surface temperature model, which provides similar UV to the Sun. The UV surface environment on a planet is controlled primarily by the incoming irradiation and by the planetary atmospheric composition. The UV surface environment for all our planetary models orbiting WDs show increased surface UVC flux up to several orders of magnitude compared to present day Earth, except for the models with surface pressures of 1 bar or above for the 6000 K WD model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>). The UVC can become substantially higher for the cool 4000 K WD surface temperature model runs, making those model planet surface environments harsh for life as we know it.</p><p>In addition to individual models that represent a planet orbiting a WD at a certain time during the cooling process (i.e., specific WD surface temperatures), we also model two planets through their evolution while the WD cools, representing two possible tracks through a WD's HZ. Both cases show a decrease of ozone for the three points modeled (for WD surface temperature of 6000 K, 5000 K and 4000 K and the corresponding irradiation on the planets) as well as an increase in UVC surface flux over time.</p><p>Due to the extreme change in luminosity early in a WD's evolution a temperate planet around a cool WD would have experienced extremely high luminosity and corresponding surface temperature early in its history, what should initiate a runaway greenhouse process and extreme water loss on such planets early in their history. Whether or not such planets would have lost all their water at that point would depend strongly on the initial water reservoir, and whether it can be replenished, leaving open the question about whether an Earth-like planet could survive around WDs if formed. However due to the extremely favorable size ratio of an Earth-like planet compared to a WD, as well as the low luminosity of a WD compared to a main sequence host star, WD exoplanets will make interesting targets for characterization.</p><p>LK and TK acknowledge support by the Simons Foundation (SCOL # 290357, Kaltenegger) and the Carl Sagan Institute.
