				<p>Aims. Variations in the timing of transiting exoplanets provide a powerful tool detecting additional planets in the system. Thus, the aim of this paper is to discuss the plausibility of transit timing variations on the Qatar-1 system by means of primary transit light curves analysis. Furthermore, we provide an interpretation of the timing variation. Methods. We observed Qatar-1 between March 2011 and October 2012 using the 1.2 m OLT telescope in Germany and the 0.6 m PTST telescope in Spain. We present 26 primary transits of the hot Jupiter Qatar-1b. In total, our light curves cover a baseline of 18 months. Results. We report on indications for possible long-term transit timing variations (TTVs). Assuming that these TTVs are true, we present two different scenarios that could explain them. Our reported ∼ 190 days TTV signal can be reproduced by either a weak perturber in resonance with Qatar-1b, or by a massive body in the brown dwarf regime. More observations and radial velocity monitoring are required to better constrain the perturber&apos;s characteristics. We also refine the ephemeris of Qatar-1b, which we find to be T 0 = 2456157.42204 ± 0.0001 BJD TDB and P = 1.4200246 ± 0.0000007 days, and improve the system orbital parameters.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The discovery of Neptune in 1846 was a milestone in astronomy. The position at which the planet was detected by J. G. Galle had been predicted -independently -by U.J. Le Verrier and J. C. Adams, who attributed the observed irregularities of Uranus' orbit to the gravitational attraction of another perturbing body outside Uranus' radius. Thus, Neptune became the first planet to be predicted by celestial mechanics before it was directly observed.</p><p>Similar to the case of Neptune, in the realm of exoplanets an additional planet or exomoon can reveal itself by its gravitational influence on the orbital elements of the observed planet. Most notably, for transiting planets a perturber is expected to induce short-term transit timing variations (TTVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Holman &amp; Murray (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>); because timing measurements can be carried out quite accurately, the TTV searches are quite sensitive, and it is possible to detect additional objects in the stellar system and to derive their properties with TTVs.</p><p>The detection of TTVs in ground-based measurements requires both a sufficiently long baseline and good phase coverage. The search for planets by TTVs has been a major activity in ground-based exoplanet research. So far, TTVs have been claimed in WASP-3b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maciejewski et al. 2010</ref>), WASP10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Maciejewski et al. 2011</ref>), WASP-5b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fukui et al. 2011</ref>), HAT-P-13 <ref type="bibr">(Pál et al. (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nascimbeni et al. (2011)</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fulton et al. (2011)</ref>), and OGLE-111b ( <ref type="bibr">Díaz et al. (2008)</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2010)</ref>).</p><p>In recent years, the search for TTVs in extrasolar planetary systems has entered a new era, marked by the advent of the space-based observatories <ref type="bibr">CoRoT and Kepler, which</ref>  vide photometry of unprecedented accuracy. On one hand, the Kepler team has already presented more than 40 TTVs in exoplanetary systems, such as <ref type="bibr">Kepler-9 (Holman et al. (2010)</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Kepler-19 Ballard et al. (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-18 (Cochran et al. 2011</ref>), and <ref type="bibr">Kepler 29, 30, 31 and 32 (Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>). On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Steffen et al. (2012)</ref> searched for planetary companions orbiting hot-Jupiter planet candidates and found that most of the systems show no significant TTV signal. Yet, the Kepler satellite observes only a small area of the sky and has a limited lifetime, thus TTV will continue to play a major role also in ground-based studies.</p><p>The transiting Jovian planet Qatar-1b was discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alsubai et al. (2011)</ref> as the first planet found within The Qatar Exoplanet Survey. Qatar-1A is an old (&gt; 4 Gy) K3V star with 0.85 M ⊙ and 0.82 R ⊙ , orbited by a close-in (0.023 AU) planet with a mass of 1.1 M J and a period of 1.42 d. Qatar-1b has a radius of 1.16 R J and an inclination angle of 83.47 • , implying a nearly grazing transit. Therefore Qatar-1 offers an outstanding opportunity to search for TTVs for several reasons: Its large inclination and close-in orbit yield a high-impact parameter, making the shape and timing of the transit sensitive to variations of the orbital parameters. Its large radius and short orbital period allow for the study of a large number of deep transits over hundreds of epochs.</p><p>We have therefore observed transits in Qatar-1b over the past few years, which we describe here. We specifically describe the observational setup in section 2 as well as the data reduction process. We subsequently present the details of our light curve analysis and transit modeling in Sect. 3 and describe our TTV analysis in section 4. We interpret our results in Section 5, where we present different dynamical scenarios that were tested to suggest the existence of an additional body in the system. In Section 6 we conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations and data reduction</head><p>Our observations comprise 18 transits of Qatar-1 obtained using the 1.2 m Oskar-Lühning telescope (OLT) at Hamburg Observatory, Germany, and 8 transits using the 0.6 m Planet Transit Study Telescope (PTST) at the Mallorca Observatory in Spain.</p><p>The OLT data were taken between March 2011 and October 2012 using an Apogee Alta U9000 CCD with a 9 ′ × 9 ′ field of view. Binning was usually 4 × 4, but the first transit observations were taken in a 2 × 2 configuration. The binning was increased to reduce individual exposure times. The data were obtained with typical exposure times between 45 and 300 seconds depending on the night quality, the binning configuration, and the star's altitude. All exposures were obtained using a Johnson-Cousins Schuler R filter. Because Qatar-1 is circumpolar at Hamburg's latitude, typical airmass values range from 1 up to 1.9, while the average seeing value is 2.5 arcsec.</p><p>The PTST data were taken between May and August 2012 using a Santa Barbara CCD with a 30 ′ × 30 ′ field of view in a 3×3 binning and a Baade R-band filter setup. The exposure times range from 50 to 90 seconds. The observations were obtained with airmass values between 1.1 and 3 and typical seeing values of 2 arcsec. In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we summarize the main characteristics of our observations obtained at both sites. Combining OLT and PTST data, the observations cover a total of 416 epochs.</p><p>Calibration images such as bias and flat fields were obtained on each observing night. We used the IRAF task ccdproc for bias subtraction and flat-fielding on the individual data sets, followed by the task apphot to carry out aperture photometry on all images including individual photometric errors. We measured fluxes using different apertures centered on the target star and six more stars with a similar brightness as Qatar-1, which are present in both field of views. The apparent brightness of the reference star chosen to produce the differential light curves is very close to Qatar-1. Multiband photometry of the same field of view reveals no significant difference between both stars as a function of photometric color, either suggesting that they are of similar spectral type. This minimizes any atmospheric extinction residuals on the differential light curves, and in addition, the apparent proximity of the two stars (∼2 arcmin) minimizes systematic effects related to vignetting, comatic aberration, or CCD temperature gradients, which all increase with increasing distance from the telescope's optical axis (i.e., the center of the chip). We also checked the constancy of the reference star against the other five comparison stars and chose as final aperture the one that minimized the scatter in the resulting light curves. The differential light curves were then produced by dividing the flux of the target star by that of the reference star.</p><p>Typical sky brightness values per binned pixel were of about 3500 counts for OLT, and 2000 for PTST. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the PTST field of view (light background) superposed on the field of view of OLT (dark background). Qatar-1 lies at the center of the field of view, marked with a large red circle. The five comparison stars are indicated with green squares and the reference star, indicated with a small blue circle, is the one used to produce the differential light curves.</p><p>After the reduction process, we fitted a straight line to the out-of-transit data points to correct for any residual systematic trend and to normalize the differential light curves. It is worth mentioning that we calculated the timing offsets using both raw and normalized data. We therefore confirm that the normalization process does not produce any shifts in the mid-transits but only more accurate planetary parameters. This might be because the amplitude of any systematic trend present in our light curves was smaller than ∼2 mmag. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>: Oskar-Lühning telescope (dark background) and Planet Transit Search Telescope (light background) field of views. Qatar-1 is indicated with a large red circle centered on the OLT field of view, along with the comparison stars as green squares.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Limb-darkening coefficients</head><p>Alsubai et al. (2011) presented a spectroscopic characterization of Qatar-1 based on comparing their observed spectrum with synthetic template spectra and suggested that Qatar-1 has an effective temperature T eff of 4861 ± 125 K, a surface gravity log g of 4.536 ± 0.024, and solar metallicity [Fe/H] of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Summary of our observations carried out with OLT (top) and PTST (bottom) specifying epoch, exposure time ET, filter configuration F, number of data points NoP, airmass and transit coverage (TC); a description of the transit coding is detailed in the footnote of this 0.20 ± 0.10. Because our observations with OLT and PTST were obtained using different (non-standard) filter sets, we decided to calculate angle-resolved synthetic spectra from spherical atmosphere models using PHOENIX <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hauschildt &amp; Baron (1999)</ref>, Witte et al. <ref type="formula">(2009)</ref>) for a star with effective temperature T eff = 4900 K, [Fe/H] = 0.20 and log g = 4.5, thereby closely matching the spectroscopic parameters of Qatar-1A. We then convolved each synthetic spectrum with the OLT and PTST filter transmission functions and integrated in the wavelength domain to compute intensities as a function of µ = cos θ, where θ is the angle between the line of sight and the radius vector from the center of the star to a reference position on the stellar surface. The thus derived intensities were then fitted with a quadratic limb-darkening prescription, viz.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(µ)/I(1) = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ) 2 ,</formula><p>to obtain the u 1 and u 2 limb-darkening coefficients. As an aside, we note that the best approach to obtain limb-darkening coefficients would be to fit a more sophisticated bi-parametric approximation to the stellar intensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Claret &amp; Hauschildt 2003)</ref> to the PHOENIX intensities, which produces the smallest deviations in the generation of the limb-darkening coefficients, which fits the stellar limb better. However, to introduce such a limbdarkening law in the production of primary transit light curves would be computationally cumbersome. Moreover, Qatar-1 is a nearly grazing system, where changes in limb darkening do <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Best-fit limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) for OLT and PTST, along with the 1 σ errors.</p><p>LDCs OLT PTST u 1 0.5860 ± 0.0053 0.6025 ± 0.0051 u 2 0.1170 ± 0.0075 0.1140 ± 0.0073 not strongly affect the primary transit light curves. We checked that the time that the planet spends in the small-µ regime is very short. Furthermore, at a given time the planet covers a broad range of µ-values. Neglecting these points in determining the limb-darkening coefficients will probably not affect the subsequent parameter determination. To calculate the OLT and PTST limb-darkening coefficients, we fitted a quadratic limbdarkening law to PHOENIX intensities, neglecting the data points between µ = 0 and µ = 0.1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows the OLT and PTST limb-darkening normalized functions, and <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> the fitted limb-darkening coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Parameter errors</head><p>To determine reliable errors for the fit parameters given the mutual dependence of the model parameters, we explored the parameter space by sampling from the posterior-probability distribution using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approach. The near-grazing transit geometry of Qatar-1 introduces a substantial amount of correlation between the system parameters, which can easily render the MCMC sampling process inefficient. To cope with these difficulties we used a modification to the usually employed Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm, which is able to adapt to the strong correlation structure. This modified Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is described in the seminal work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haario et al. (2001)</ref> and has become known as the adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm. It works like the regular Metropolis-Hastings sampler, but relies on the idea of allowing the proposal distribution to depend on the previous values of the chain.</p><p>The regular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm produces chains based on a proposal distribution that may depend on the current state of the chain. The proposal distribution is often chosen to be a multivariate normal distribution with fixed covariance. The main difference between the regular Metropolis sampler and AM is that AM updates the covariance matrix during the sampling, e.g. every 1000 iterations. Because the proposal distribution is thus tuned based on the entire sampling run, AM chains in fact lose the Markov property. Nonetheless, it can be shown that the algorithm retains the correct ergodic properties under very general assumptions, i.e., the covariance matrix stabilizes during the sampling process and AM chains properly simulate the target distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haario et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vihola 2011</ref>). Although adaptive MCMC algorithms are a recent development, they have successfully been used by other authors in the astronomical community, for instance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balan &amp; Lahav (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Irwin et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Irwin et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our MCMC calculations make extensive use of routines of PyAstronomy 3 , a collection of Python routines providing a convenient interface for fitting and sampling algorithms implemented in the PyMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Patil et al. 2010</ref>) and SciPy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jones et al. 2001</ref>) packages. The AM sampler is implemented in the PyMC package, which is publicly available for download. We refer to the detailed online documentation 4 .</p><p>We checked that AM does yield correct results for simulated data sets with parameters close to Qatar-1, and found that this approach showed fast convergence and was efficient. To express our lack of more a priori knowledge regarding the Qatar-1 system parameters, we assumed uninformative uniform prior probability distributions for all parameters, but we found that the parameters are well determined, so that the actual choice of the prior is unimportant for our results.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> we show our 26 obtained light curves, along with the residuals after removing the primary transit feature. Our final relative photometry is available in its entirety in machinereadable form in the electronic version of this paper. First columns contain BJD TDB , second columns normalized flux, and third columns individual errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Correlated noise</head><p>Carter &amp; Winn (2009) (and references therein) studied how time-correlated noise affects the estimation of the parameter of transiting systems. To quantify whether and to what extent our light curves are affected by red noise, we reproduced part of their analysis as follows: First, we produced residuals from our final fits by subtracting the primary transit model from each light curve. We individually divided each light curve into M bins of equal duration. Since our data are not always equally spaced, we calculated a mean value N of data points per bin. If the data are not affected by red noise, they should follow the expectation of independent random numbers,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">σ N = σ 1 N −1/2 [M/(M − 1)] 1/2 ,</formula><p>where σ 1 is the sample variance of the unbinned data and σ N is the sample variance (or RMS) of the binned data, with the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ N = 1 M M i=1 (&lt; ˆ µ i &gt; − ˆ µ i ) 2 ,</formula><p>wherê µ i is the mean value of the residuals per bin, and &lt; ˆ µ i &gt; is the mean value of the means.</p><p>If correlated noise is present, then each value σ N will differ by a factor β N from their expectation. The parameter β, an estimation of the strength of correlated noise in the data, is found by averaging β N over a range ∆n corresponding to time scales that are judged to be most important. For data sets free of correlated noise, we expect β = 1. For primary transit observations, ∆n is the duration of ingress or egress. For Qatar-1, the time between first and second contact (or equivalently, the time between third and fourth contact) is ∼ 15 minutes.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> we show the results of our correlated noise analysis for nine of the longest light curves. Black lines represent the expected behavior in the absence of red noise, and red and green lines represent the variance of the binned data for OLT and PTST, respectively, as a function of bin size. As expected, the larger the bin size, the smaller the RMS. For each light curve we calculated β considering ∆n = 15 minutes. For the OLT and PTST primary transits, β lies between β = 0.78 and β = 1.33, with &lt; β &gt; = 1.038. Thus, there is no evidence for significant correlated noise in our light curves.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Effects of exposure times and transit coverage</head><p>The accuracy in determining of the mid-transit time is affected by the number of data points during transit and the number of off-transit data points, even more so when a normalization is involved.</p><p>To study whether the mid-transits are affected by the transit observation duration, we computed the timing residual magnitudes as a function of the number of data points per transit. If any systematic effect dominates the light curves, a larger timing offset for those transits that are sampled the least is expected. We show our results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. Since the light curves are normalized and the mid-transits might be sensitive to normalizations, we also computed the timing-residual magnitudes as a function of the number of off-transit data points. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient r to quantify the correlation of the mid-transit offsets. In both cases this was r ∼ -0.11 for all data points, and r ∼ 0.05, which rules out the 0 th epoch, which was expected to be zero by construction. We found no significant correlation.</p><p>Kipping (2010) studied the effects of finite integration times on the determination of the orbital parameters. He showed that the time difference between the mid-transit moment and the nearest light curve data point might cause a shift in the TTV signal, which is expected to be one half of the rate sampling. To test how significant this effect is over our light curves, we calculated the mean exposure times per observing night, which was about 80 seconds. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the mean exposure times per night, versus the magnitude of the timing residuals. Most of the data points lying around the half-mean exposure time (∼ 35 seconds) were identified to have the most accurate mid-transit timings, with exposure times of about one minute, which makes it unlikely that they are affected by a sampling effect. The Pearson correlation coefficient of r = -0.15 again reveals no significant correlation.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Results</head><p>In general terms, the parameters P and T 0 are usually correlated with each other, but are uncorrelated with the remaining transit parameters. Therefore, these parameters can be determined quite accurately without interference of the remaining ones. We used a Nelder-Mead simplex to approach the best-fit solution, which is provided as the starting values of the MCMC sampler. The AM algorithm then samples from the posterior distribution for the parameters to obtain error estimates. After 10 8 iterations we discarded a suitable burn-in (typically 10 6 samples) and determined the combination of parameters resulting in the lowest deviance. We consider the lowest deviance as our global best-fit solution. The errors were derived from the 68 % highest probability density or credibility intervals (1 σ). Our results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. None of our fit parameters are consistent with those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alsubai et al. (2011)</ref>; a possible explanation for this inconsistency might be that these authors determined the system parameters using only four light curves, two of which were incomplete, obtained in less than two weeks. During the revision of this paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Covino et al. (2013)</ref> presented high-precision radial velocity measurements from which the Rossiter-McLauglin effect was observed. The authors also obtained five new photometric transit light curves, from which the orbital parameters of the system were improved. With respect to the orbital period, one of the most important parameters for determining TTVs, our best-fitted orbital period seems to be consistent within errors with the one found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Covino et al. (2013)</ref>. To obtain individual mid-transit times T mid,i , we considered the best-fit values of p, a, i, u 1 , u 2 , and P. We specified Gaussian priors on these parameters and refitted each one of the 26 individual transit light curves for the mid-transit time T mid,i . Our results are listed in Tab. 4 together with the derived 1 σ errors on these transit times. To compute the timing deviations compared with a constant period we fitted the observed mid-transit times T o,i to the expression </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T o,i = P · E i + T o ,</formula></div>

This high value led us to reject the null hypothesis that OC vanishes.</p><p>We then applied the Lomb-Scargle periodogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lomb (1976)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Scargle (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zechmeister &amp; Kürster (2009)</ref>) to search for any significant periodicity contained in the OC diagram. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows the data points used to perform the periodogram, along with a list in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. The resulting periodogram reveals a first peak at ν T T V,1 = 0.00759 ± 0.00075 cycl P −1 (corresponding to a period of 187 ± 17 days) and a second one at about half the frequency ν T T V,2 = 0.00367 ± 0.00059 cycl P −1 (corresponding to 386 ± 54 days). For both periodic signals, new ephemeris were refitted using the linear trend and a sinusoidal variation in the form   For the most significant frequency, the fitted amplitude and phase are A T T V,1 = 0.00052 ± 0.0002 days (equivalently, 0.75± 0.28 minutes) and φ T T V,1 = 0.04 ± 0.05. We then recalculated χ 2 red = 1.85 for the first frequency. Using an F-test to check the significance of the fit improvement we obtained a p-value of 0.02, indicating that the sinusoidal trend does indeed provide a better description than the constant at 2.8σ level. We can also compare the models using the Bayesian information criterion, BIC = χ 2 + k ln N, which penalizes the number k of model parameters given N = 26 data points. We obtained BICs of 68.1 and 57.2 for the constant and sinusoidal trend, respectively. Since the BIC is no more than a criterion for model selection among a set of models, the method one more time favors the sinusoidal trend.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T o,i = P · E i + T o + A T T V sin(2πν T T V [E i − E T T V ]).</formula><p>We finally estimated the false-alarm probability (FAP) of the TTV signal, using a bootstrap resampling method by randomly permuting the mid-transit values (5 × 10 5 times) along with their individual errors, fixing the observing epochs and calculating the Lomb-Scargle periodogram afterward. We estimated the FAP as the frequency with which the highest power in the scrambled periodogram exceeds the maximal power in the original periodogram. In this fashion we estimated an FAP of 0.05% for our observed TTV signal, consistent with our previous estimates.</p><p>To further check whether the addition of the sinusoidal variation provides an explanation for the timing offsets, we made use of the mid-transits of Qatar-1 available in the Exoplanet Transit Database 5 (ETD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Poddan´yPoddan´y et al. 2010</ref>) to reinforce our results. The ETD data are very heterogeneous, we therefore converted the best 26 mid-transits from HJD UTC to BJD TDB . Each ETD primary transits has a data quality indicator ranging from 1 (small scatter and good time-sampling) to 4 (the opposite). For our analysis we only selected the transits with quality flags 1 (5 primary transits) and 2 (21 primary transits). These transits span a total of ∼ 500 epochs. We produced the OC diagram <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5)</ref>  The primary transit selected for the 0 th epoch is the most accurate one of all available light curves. We produced a periodogram using the resulting timing offsets and found one peak at ν T T V,ET D = 0.00784 ± 0.0011 cycl P −1 (corresponding to a period of 181 ± 22 days) with an amplitude of A T T V,ET D = 0.0009 ± 0.0005 days (equivalently, 1.29 ± 0.72 minutes) and a phase of φ T T V,ET D = 0.02 ± 0.03. Within the errors, the frequency, amplitude, and phase are consistent with the ones found using OLT and PTST data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref> shows two periodograms, the one on top produced using our data, and the one on bottom produced with ETD data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Error analysis</head><p>To test the reliability of our error estimates for each mid-transit time and to check the influence of the error magnitude on the estimated peak frequencies, we iteratively constructed new LombScargle periodograms randomly increasing the individual midtransit errors mostly by a factor of two.</p><p>At each iteration, we first added the absolute value of a random number that was drawn from a normal distribution (µ = 0, σ = 0.0004 days) to each mid-transit error, and calculated the leading frequency afterward. After 5 × 10 5 of such iterations, we found that the only effect on the error increment is the permutation of the leading frequency from ν T T V,1 to ν T T V,2 . This permutation occurred only ∼9% of the times.    In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 9</ref> we show the resulting histogram of the calculated leading frequencies. They all fall inside the 1σ errors of ν T T V,1 and ν T T V,2 , estimated from our original fits. Thus, the derived mid-transit errors do not significantly affect the outcome in terms of dominating frequencies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Interpretation of the observed transit timing variations</head><p>For the purposes of this section we assumed that the reported TTVs are real and explored possible physical scenarios that would explain the observed variations. We considered both the ∼190 and ∼380 day periods, although the ETD data set is consistent only with the former period. As is well known, a suitably placed third body in the Qatar-1 system can lead to perturbations in the orbit of Qatar-1b, which manifest themselves as TTVs.</p><p>Since there are no complete analytical solutions to the threebody problem, we made use of a numerical integration scheme. Because a planetary orbit is determined by a large number of parameters (i.e., the eccentricity, the longitude of the nodes, the orbital inclination, among many others), it is a real challenge to estimate true orbital parameters by fitting TTV models to groundbased mid-transit shifts only. We therefore started with the simplest approach and assumed coplanar orbits using the inclination derived from the light curve fitting, along with the best-fit orbital period, and the transiting planet mass and eccentricity obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alsubai et al. (2011)</ref> as fixed. Given trial mass, orbital period, eccentricity, longitude of periastron and ascending node, and the time of periastron passage, the n-body code calculates the time of occurrence of the primary transits taking into account the interaction between the planets. We specifically considered two scenarios, a putative low-mass planet in a resonant orbit relative close to Qatar-1b, and a putative high-mass planet or brown dwarf in an 190-day orbit around Qatar-1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Weak perturber in resonance with Qatar-1b</head><p>Two planetary bodies in orbital resonance with each other will experience long-term changes in their orbital parameters. On one hand, since only a relative short stretch of data (less than two years) is available, expecting a unique solution is too ambitious.</p><p>On the other hand, most of the perturber's dynamical setups will translate into negligible TTVs. Taking into account these difficulties, we calculated the modeled TTV scatter for a two-planetary system, to study in advance which would be the parameter space giving rise to TTVs simi-  lar to the scatter of our data. We first considered both bodies in circular orbits and then the perturber in an eccentric orbit. The mass of the perturber was systematically changed between 1, 8, and 15 M ⊕ . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 10</ref> shows our results. The vertical dashed lines indicate the 2:1, 3:1, and 5:2 resonances. In these regions, perturbers of the order of several Earth masses would produce TTVs similar to the observed ones.</p><p>We thus investigated some possible solutions that would satisfy the first two TTV periods assuming the specific resonant orbits indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 10</ref>. As an example we show in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> and Tab. 6 three arbitrary cases; similar solutions can be derived with other choices of resonant orbits. To produce <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> we ran our n-body simulation with specified initial conditions (cf., Tab. 6) and compared the results with the observed OC-values and our (original) sinusoidal fit (cf., <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>). As is clear from <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>, all these solutions have χ 2 values similar to our first fitting attempt. Thus, it is futile to produce a proper fitting procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Massive perturber in a 190-day orbit</head><p>As an alternative to a lower-mass perturber in a resonant orbit, we also considered a more massive perturber in a non-resonant 190-day orbit. In this case the TTV amplitude strongly depends on the mass and the eccentricity of the assumed perturber. Again considering the simplest case of coplanar orbits and both longitude of periastron and longitude of the ascending node fixed to zero, we computed the amplitude of the TTV signal as a function of the perturber mass and its orbital eccentricity using our n-body code, and we compared the predicted TTV amplitudes with those observed. Our results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>, where we plot the expected TTV amplitude as a function of the perturber mass for various eccentricities in the range between zero and 0.8. For low eccentricity values we require perturber masses of more than 80 Jupiter masses, i.e., we would require a low-mass star. For eccentricities above 0.6 a brown dwarf could explain the observed TTV amplitudes. It is obvious that such an object would lead to RV variations in the host of Qatar-1, which could in prin- Fig. 11: OC diagram for OLT (red circles) and PTST (green squares) data points plus n-body solutions for two different dynamical scenarios (black lines) and our best initial sinusoidal fit (blue dashed lines) artificially shifted in phase for a better comparison. ciple be observed. Since for a very eccentric orbit the RV variations are concentrated around the periastron passage and since only ten days of RV measurements are available for Qatar-1 so far, any long-term RV variations of Qatar-1 are unknown so far and could confirm or reject the presence of a massive perturber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Our analysis of the mid-timing residuals of Qatar-1 taken during almost two years indicate that the orbital period of the exoplanet is not constant. The observed long-term timing variations are highly significant from a statistical point of view and can be explained by very different physical scenarios. RV monitoring of Qatar-1 will provide an upper limit to the mass of a possible perturber and continued timing observations of Qatar-1 are required to better delineate the solution space for the possible perturber geometries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Qatar-1 normalized intensities considering the OLT and PTST filter transmission functions.
