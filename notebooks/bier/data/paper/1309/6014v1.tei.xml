			<abstract>
				<p>Biosignature gas detection is one of the ultimate future goals for exoplanet atmosphere studies. We have created a framework for linking biosignature gas detectability to biomass estimates, including atmospheric photochemistry and biological thermodynamics. The new framework is intended to liberate predictive atmosphere models from requiring fixed, Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes. New biosignature gases can be considered with a check that the biomass estimate is physically plausible. We have validated the models on terrestrial production of NO, H 2 S, and CH 4 , CH 3 Cl, and DMS. We have applied the models to propose NH 3 as a biosignature gas on a &quot;cold Haber World&quot; a planet with an N 2-H 2 atmosphere, and to demonstrate why gases such as CH 3 Cl must have too great of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a sun-like star. To construct the biomass models we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and found that gases (such as CH 4 , H 2 S, N 2 O) produced from life that extracts energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does, and gases (such as DMS, CH 3 Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are far less likely to have false positives, but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely to be produced in small quantities. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude; the goal is an independent approach to testing whether a biosignature gas is plausible rather than on a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature gases and their corresponding biomasses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The future detection of signs of life on exoplanets through the detection of atmospheric biosignature gases has been a topic of long-standing interest (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Lovelock 1965)</ref>. With the push to discover exoplanets of lower and lower masses, the foundation for biosignature gases is becoming more relevant. The sheer variety of exoplanets is furthermore motivating the community to take a broader view of biosignature gases than has been conventionally considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Exoplanet Biosignature Background</head><p>The canonical concept for the search for atmospheric biosignature gases is to find a terrestrial exoplanet atmosphere severely out of thermochemical redox equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Lovelock 1965)</ref>. Redox chemistry 1 is used by all life on Earth and is thought to enable more flexibility for biochemistry than nonredox chemistry . Redox chemistry is also used to capture environmental energy for biological use. The idea is that gas byproducts from metabolic redox reactions can accumulate in the atmosphere and would be recognized as biosignature gases because abiotic processes are unlikely to create a redox disequilibrium. Indeed, Earth's atmosphere has oxygen (a highly oxidized species) and methane (a very reduced species), a combination several orders of magnitude out of thermodynamic equilibrium.</p><p>In practice it could be difficult to detect molecular features of two different gases that are out of redox disequilibrium. The Earth as an exoplanet, for example (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Meadows &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>, has a relatively prominent oxygen absorption feature at 0.76 µm, whereas methane at present-day levels of 1.6 ppm has only extremely weak spectral features. During early Earth, CH 4 may have been present at much higher levels (1,000 ppm or even 1%), as it was possibly produced by widespread methanogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Haqq-Misra et al. 2008</ref>, and references therein). Such high CH 4 concentrations would be easier to detect, but because the Earth was not oxygenated during early times, O 2 and CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4</ref> would not have been detectable concurrently (see Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Marais et al. 2002)</ref>. There may have been a short period of time in Earth's history when CH 4 levels were high and before the rise of oxygen when both could have been detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Kaltenegger et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The more realistically identifiable atmospheric biosignature gas from future remote sensing observations is a single gas completely out of chemical equilibrium with the other known or expected atmospheric constituents. Earth's example again is oxygen or ozone. With the oxygen level about ten orders of magnitude higher than expected from equilibrium chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Kasting &amp; Walker 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Segura et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2012</ref>) and has no known abiotic production at such high levels. Although a single biosignature gas may be all that is detectable by future exoplanet atmosphere observations, reliance on a single biosignature gas is more prone to false positives than the detection of two (or more) gases that are out of equilibrium. In the paradigm of detecting signs of life by a single biosignature gas, we still retain the assumption that life use chemical reactions to extract, store, and release energy, such that biosignature gases are generated as byproducts somewhere in life's metabolic process.</p><p>How can we decide upon the exoplanet atmosphere gases that are identifiable as biosignature gases? Regardless of the strategy used, only the spectroscopically active, globally-mixed gases would be visible in an exoplanet spectrum. Most work to date has focused on conservative extensions of the dominant biosignature gases found on Earth, O 2 (and its photochemical product O 3 ) and N 2 O, as well as the possibility of CH 4 on early Earth. Research forays into biosignature gases that are negligible on present-day Earth but may play a significant role on other planets has started. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Pilcher (2003)</ref> suggested that organosulfur compounds, particularly methanethiol (CH 3 SH, the sulfur analog of methanol) could be produced in high enough abundance by bacteria, possibly creating a biosignature on other planets. CH 3 Cl was first considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. (2005)</ref> and sulfur biogenic gases on anoxic planets were comprehensively investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>A slight deviation from terracentricity is to consider Earth-like atmospheres and Earth-like biosignature gases on planets orbiting M stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. (2005)</ref> found that CH 4 , N 2 O, and even CH 3 Cl have higher concentrations and, therefore, stronger spectral features on planets orbiting quiet M stars compared to Earth. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. (2005)</ref> work strictly focuses on Earth's production rates for the biosignature gases. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The reduced UV radiation on quiet M stars enables longer biosignature gas lifetimes and, therefore, higher concentrations to accumulate. Specifically, lower UV flux sets up a lower atmospheric concentration of the OH radical than in Earth's solar UV environment. OH is the major destructive radical in Earth's atmosphere and with less OH, most biosignature gases have longer lifetimes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Seager et al. (2012)</ref> have reviewed the range of gases and solids produced by life on Earth.</p><p>A necessary new area of biosignature gas research will be predicting or identifying molecules that are potential biosignature gases on super Earth planets different from Earth. The reasons are two fold. First, the microbial world on Earth is incredibly diverse, and microorganisms yield a broad range of metabolic byproducts far beyond the gases called out in exoplanet biosignature research so far. In an environment different from Earth's, these metabolic byproducts may accumulate to produce detectable biosignature gases different from those on past and present Earth. Second, while we anticipate the discovery of transiting super Earths in the habitable zones of the brightest low-mass stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Nutzman &amp; Charbonneau 2008)</ref> and in the future Earths from direct imaging (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cash 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Trauger &amp; Traub 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Lawson 2009</ref>), the prize targets around bright stars will be rare. It follows that the chance of finding an Earth twin might be tiny and so we must be prepared to identify a wide range of biosignature gases.</p><p>In this paper we take a step forward to expand the possibilities for biosignature gas detection in the future. We provide a quantitative framework to consider biosignature gas source fluxes of any type and any value in any exoplanet environment, via a new biomass model es-timate that provides a physical reality plausibility check on the amount of biomass required. This new method liberates modelers from assuming that exoplanet biosignature gas source fluxes are identical to those on Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Terrestrial Biofluxes</head><p>We summarize terrestrial biosignature gas fluxes for later reference as to what is a physically reasonable local (F field in units of mole m −2 s −1 ) and global annual total biosignature gas flux (F global , in units of Tg yr −1 ). Biological production of gases on Earth are limited by the availability of energy and nutrients. We emphasize that these terrestrial biosignature gas fluxes-which we call field fluxes -are strictly used in this work for consistency checks by comparison with our calculated biosignature gas fluxes.</p><p>For Earth as a whole, the dominant energy-capture chemistry is photosynthesis. Photosynthesis generates around 2.0 × 10 5 Tg (of oxygen) yr −1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Friend et al. 2009</ref>). The primary carbon production rate from photosynthesis is about 1 × 10 5 Tg yr −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Field et al. 1998</ref>).</p><p>Earth has many biosignature gases beyond photosynthesis-produced O 2 .</p><p>Some of the other biosignature gases can be produced at relatively high flux rates, as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 1</ref>. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 1</ref> we list the geometric mean of the maximum field flux from one or more environmental campaigns. The main point is that very high fluxes of biosignature gases can be generated where the surface environment is appropriate (suitable levels of relevant nutrients and energy sources).</p><p>We now turn to some specific examples of high terrestrial biosignature gas fluxes. As listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 1</ref>, fluxes of some biosignature gases (e.g., isoprene and N 2 O) can be very large when extrapolated from their local maximum values to a global total. In addition to the values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 1</ref>, biogenic NO x fluxes from natural (unfertilized) environments can be 10 to 30 ng (N) m −2 s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Williams et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Davidson &amp; Kingerlee 1997)</ref>, which translates to a global flux across Earth's land surface of ∼150 to 300 Tg yr −1 . For environments where organic matter, water, and other nutrients are abundant (such as swamps), flux rates of methane can reach 10 4 ng (C) m −2 s −1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Prieme 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Dalal et al. 2008)</ref>, which if scaled to a global flux would be 10 to 20 Pg yr −1 . We note, however, that scaling the flux from a swamp, which is rapidly degrading biomass imported from other environments, to a global flux is not realistic, so we do not include these methane rates in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Measured field fluxes, F field as presented in the literature vary over many orders of magnitude for the same gas species either within a given study or among different studies. We must therefore take an average of the literature reported F field values and we choose to take the geometric mean of the maximum F field values reported in each study. We choose to use the maximum of the field fluxes for a given study; because the maximum represents the ecology with the maximum number of gasproducing organisms in an environment where they are producing gas with maximal efficiency, and a minimum density of non-producing organisms and gas-consuming organisms. The huge variation in measured F field is due to different growth conditions, different nutrient and energy supply, and different diffusion rates. It is important  <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Seinfeld &amp; Pandis (2000)</ref>, with the exception of isoprene which is from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Arneth et al. (2008)</ref>.</p><p>to note that the biomass of bioflux-producing organisms in the field is rarely measured. Because the field fluxes are measured from an ecosystem with a range of organisms other than the bioflux-producing organisms, in some cases the biosignature gas of interest is consumed before it reaches the atmosphere. To take an average of all of the maximum field fluxes from different studies for a given organism, we use the geometric mean (of the maximum). The geometric mean is the appropriate average of concentrations of processes limited by energy. There is a log relationship between concentration and the energy needed to drive a reaction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆G = −RT ln(K),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where, G is the Gibbs free energy, R is the universal gas constant, T is temperature, and K is the equilibrium constant. To properly compare a set of concentrations produced by metabolism requiring energy, the logs of the concentrations are appropriate. For R lab just as for F field we take the geometric mean of the maxima of each study. We choose the maximum observed rate because it represents the closest approximation to the case where the organisms are dependent on the gas generating reaction for the majority of their energy. The bioflux produced by laboratory cultures is also relevant for exoplanet biomass calculations, in addition to the above described field fluxes. We call the labmeasured metabolic byproduct production rate per unit mass R lab , in units of mole g −1 s −1 . The R lab values of a variety of biosignature gases are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. R lab is used for validation of the biomass models and as input into one of the biomass models (see §3.3). The R lab measurements are an important complement to field measurements as they are made on pure cultures of known mass, unlike the mixed culture of unknown mass in the field. A summary of different flux definitions is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>The lab production rates R lab vary by several orders of magnitude. The variation in lab production rates is in part due to differences in the organisms studied in the lab, but mainly due to different laboratory conditions, especially growth conditions (nutrient concentration, temperature, and other environmental factors such as whether the organisms are stressed by stirring or shaking, non-natural light levels or spectra, or the presence or absence of trace chemicals such as metal ions.) For R lab for biological reactions based on energy extraction from the environment (defined as Type I biosignature gases; see §2.1) we again use the geometric mean as an average quantity of R lab , because the energy released is related to the log of the concentration of the reactants and products (see above). For biological reactions that do not extract energy from the environment (defined as Type III biosignature gases; see §2.3) we use the maximum value of R lab . Their production rate is determined by the ecology of the organism. Ecological factors include the chemical environment of the species and the presence of other species, which are rarely mimicked accurately in the laboratory. As a result laboratory production is likely to be very substantially lower than that in the wild. We therefore take the maximum flux found in the laboratory measurement of Type III biosignature gas production as being the nearest approximation to the natural flux capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Terrestrial Biomass Densities</head><p>We summarize terrestrial biomass surface densities for later reference as to what is a reasonable biomass surface density. For our exoplanet biomass model use and validation we require an understanding of the range of biomass surface densities on Earth. Based on life on Earth, a summary overview is that a biomass surface density of 10 g m −2 is sensible, 100 g m −2 is plausible, and 5000 g m −2 is possible. Real world situations are nearly always limited by energy, bulk nutrients (carbon, nitrogen), trace nutrients (iron, etc.) or all three.</p><p>We distinguish active biomass from inactive biomass. Active biomass is the mass of organisms metabolizing at a sufficiently high rate to grow (see ahead to the discussion on the microbial minimal maintenance energy consumption rate in §3.1.2). Most terrestrial environments contain an excess of material that is biologically derived but is not actively metabolizing. For example, the mass of organic material in soil is 10 to 100 times greater than the mass of actively metabolizing microorganisms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Anderson &amp; Domsch 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Insam &amp; Domsch 1988)</ref>. Some of this organic material is dormant organisms but most is the remains of dead organisms (bacteria, fungi, and plants.) In the following paragraphs we are concerned solely with the surface density of active biomass-the biomass actively generating byproduct gases.</p><p>We now turn to some specific examples of biomass surface densities on Earth.</p><p>Photosynthesizing marine microorganisms are the dominant life over the majority of the surface area of Earth. Their biomass is limited by phosphate, nitrogen, iron and other micro-nutrients (because there is no "soil" in the surface of the deep ocean from which to extract micro-nutrients), and reaches 5-10 g m −2 on the ocean surface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ishizaka et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Karl et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mitchell et al. 1991</ref>  2 for more details. Up to dozens of individual studies were considered. Blank entries have no suitable data available in the literature. The categories are: "sea" = microscopic marine species (phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria); "seaweed" = oceanic macroalgal species; "land micro" = microscopic land-based species; "land macro" = macroscopic land-based species. Some values were reported in the literature per g of dry weight. Conversion from dry to wet weights was performed according to the following fraction dry weight/wet weight: seaweed = 0.18 (Nicotri 1980); bacteria = 0.35 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Bratbak &amp; Dundas 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Simon &amp; Azam 1989)</ref>; phytoplankton = 0. <ref type="bibr">2 (Ricketts 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Omori 1969)</ref>; fungi = 0.23 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bakken &amp; Olsen 1983)</ref>; lichen = 0.45 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Lang et al. 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Larson 1981)</ref>; land plants (green, not woody) = 0.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Chandler &amp; Thorpe 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Black et al. 1999</ref>  to 50 g m −2 or more ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bishop et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Buesseler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Boyd et al. 2000</ref>).</p><p>The biomass surface densities for ocean life described above are all in about the top 10 m of water, i.e., the well-mixed surface zone. Nearly all of the active ocean biomass is in the top layers of the ocean, both photosynthetic organisms and their predators. The above ocean biomass estimates do not include the biomass in the deep ocean, where light does not penetrate. Deep-living organisms must gain their energy either from the small amount of biological material that falls from the photosynthetic layer above, or from rare geochemical energy sources such as ocean ridge or mantle hot-spot volcanic sites. While deep heterotrophs and hotspot geotrophs are of great conceptual importance in our understanding of the range of environments in which life can exist, their contribution to the total active biomass of the Earth is not dominant.</p><p>Microbial biofilms are limited by nutrients, energy and space. Films on seashores, in rivers, in acid mine drainage have a huge range of organism surface densities ranging from 0.1 g m −2 to 10 g m −2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(MacLulich 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Lawrence et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Neu &amp; Lawrence 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Gitelson et al. 2000</ref>). Densities of 1000 g m −2 or more can be achieved if very high density of nutrients are provided, as, for example, in agricultural waste water ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Gitelson et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The mass of actively metabolizing microorganisms in soil is approximately 3 100-200 g m −2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Olsen &amp; Bakken 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Anderson &amp; Domsch 1989)</ref>. Energy-generating nutrients are probably limiting in this case: if unlimited energy-generating substrates are provided to fungi, as occurs, for example, in commercial mushroom farming, densities of &gt; 20,000 g m −2 can be reached routinely ( <ref type="bibr">Shen et al. 2002)</ref>. Actively metabolizing land plant tissue has surface densities varying from 0 to over 5000 g m −2 , depending on the availability of energy and nutrients. Densities of 5000-10000 g m −2 of active biomass are achieved in environments where sunlight provides unlimited energy and nutrients are provided in excess, for example in modern agriculture settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Brereton 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Hamilton &amp; Bernier 1975)</ref>. Densities of 100 g m −2 are more typical of productive grasslands.</p><p>We do not include trees or forests in our biomass density comparisons. While forests are visually very obvious, high density accumulations of organic carbon, nearly all of that carbon is relatively metabolic inactive. Wood (formally, secondary xylem) acts as a passive mechanical support for trees and a conduit for transport of water and nutrients between the metabolically active leaves and root surfaces. Wood produces negligible amounts of metabolic product on its own. As most of a tree is wood, it is an inappropriate comparison for active microbial or algal biomass. Nevertheless, for comparison, tree biomass densities of ∼ 6.0 × 10 4 g m −2 , of which 1-5% represents actively metabolizing green matter, are common in mature temperate forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Whittaker 1966</ref>).</p><p>We do not include the deep rock biosphere in our estimates of biomass density, as (as far as is known today) crustal subsurface life has minimal direct effect on the atmosphere. In the last decade, organisms have been found in deep crustal rocks that use geochemical sources of energy for growth. The amount of this ecology is unknown-some suggest that there is as much life in the crust as on its surface <ref type="bibr">(Gold 1992)</ref>. However crustal life's direct impact on the atmosphere is not obvious. Subsurface life had remained undiscovered for so long because it does not impinge on the surface with gases, soluble molecules, or other obvious indicators that the subsurface organisms are present. The subsurface organisms can only be found by drilling into the rocks. A review of a number of studies of microbial communities found in deep drill rock samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Pedersen 1993)</ref>, shows that there are 10 2 to 10 4 microorganisms/gram of rock. Most studies look at bore-hole water. Typically water from deep (&gt;1 km) bore-holes contains 10 3 -10 5 organisms per ml, and the water probably makes up 2-4% of the rock by mass (i.e., organism density in the total rock is around 10-10 3 cells g −1 ). Actual biomass surface densities will depend on how thick the inhabited rock layer is. Any extrapolation of these figures to the possible deep rock microbial community elsewhere on Earth, let alone on an exoplanet, must be speculative.</p><p>Closing with a total biomass on Earth estimate, the total amount of carbon on Earth as in cellular carbon in prokaryotes is estimated as 3.5-5.5 × 10 14 kg ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Whitman et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Lipp et al. 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">A New Biosignature Approach</head><p>The main goal of this paper is the presentation of a biomass model estimate that ties biomass surface density to a given biosignature gas surface source flux. The motivating rationale is that with a biomass estimate, biosignature gas source fluxes can be free parameters in model predictions, by giving a physical plausibility check in terms of reasonable biomass. The new approach enables consideration of a wide variety of both gas species and their atmospheric concentration to be considered in biosignature model predictions. In the future when biosignature gases are finally detected in exoplanet atmospheres, the biomass model estimate framework can be used for interpretation.</p><p>We argue that in order to explore the full range of potential exoplanet biosignature gases, the biosignature gas source flux should be a fundamental starting point for whether or not a biosignature gas will accumulate in an exoplanet atmosphere to levels that will be detectable remotely with future space telescopes. Instead, and until now, biosignature gas fluxes are always adopted as those found on Earth or slight deviations thereof (see §1.1 for references), and could not be considered as a free parameter because there is no first principles theoretical methodology for determining the biosignature gas source fluxes. In lieu of a first principles approach, we present model estimates which depend on both the amount of biomass and the rate of biosignature gas production per unit biomass. See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Our proposed approach for biosignature gas studies is to:</p><p>1. Calculate the amount of biosignature gas required to be present at "detectable" levels in an exoplanet atmosphere from a theoretical spectrum (we define a detection metric in §4.3);</p><p>2. Determine the gas source flux necessary to produce the atmospheric biosignature gas in the required atmospheric concentration. The biosignature gas atmospheric concentration is a function not only of the gas surface source flux, but also of other atmospheric and surface sources and sinks ( §4.1);</p><p>3. Estimate the biomass that could produce the necessary biosignature gas source flux ( §3);</p><p>4. Consider whether the estimated biomass surface density is physically plausible, by comparison to maximum terrestrial biomass surface density values ( §1.3) and total plausible surface biofluxes ( §1.2).</p><p>We begin in §2 with a categorization of biosignature gases into three classes, needed for the respective biomass model estimates presented in §3. In §4 we describe our atmosphere and photochemistry models used to determine both the required biosignature gas concentration for theoretical detection and the lifetimes of biosignature gases that are produced at the planet surface. In §5 we present our results followed by a discussion in §6 and a summary in §7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BIOSIGNATURE GAS CLASSIFICATION</head><p>A classification of biosignature gases based on their origin is needed to develop appropriate biomass models. We make the following definitions. Type I biosignature gases are generated as byproduct gases from microbial energy extraction. The Type I biosignature gas biomass model is based on thermodynamics. Type II biosignature gases are byproduct gases produced by the metabolic reactions for biomass building, and require energy. There is no useful biomass model for Type II biosignature gases because once the biomass is built a Type II biosignature gas is no longer generated. Type III biosignature gases are produced by life but not as byproducts of their central chemical functions. Type III biosignature gases appear to be special to particular species or groups of organisms, and require energy for their production. Because the chemical nature and amount released for Type III biosignature gases are not linked to the local chemistry and thermodynamics, the Type III biosignature gas biomass model is an estimate based on field fluxes and lab culture production rates. We further define bioindicators as the end product of chemical reactions of a biosignature gas.</p></div>

Terrestrial microbes can capture this potential energy also described as in the form of chemical disequilibria (we also favor the term "dark energy"). Specifically, chemotrophic organisms couple energetically favorable pairs of oxidation and reduction half-reactions. The disequilibria can involve either completely inorganic compounds or can make use of organic matter. In fact the only clear limitations upon the types of reactions used are that they have a negative Gibbs free energy, and that life can make the reactions occur faster than the rate of non-biological reactions. In other words, Earthbased metabolic pathways exploit chemical energy potential gradients in the form of chemical reactions that are thermodynamically favorable but kinetically inhibited (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Madigan et al. 2003</ref>, for more details).</p></div>

Furthermore, while in one environment a given redox reaction will be kinetically inhibited and thus proceed only when activated by life's enzymes, in another environment with the right conditions (temperature, pressure, concentration, and acidity) the same reaction might proceed spontaneously. Methane, for example, is produced geologically and emitted from mid-ocean floor ridges.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Type II Biosignature Gas: Biomass Building</head><p>Byproduct We define Type II biosignatures as byproduct gases produced by the metabolic reactions for biomass building. On Earth these are reactions that capture environmental carbon (and to a lesser extent other elements) in biomass. Type II biosignature reactions are energyconsuming, and on Earth the energy comes from sunlight via photosynthesis. On Earth photosynthesis captures carbon for biomass building,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H 2 O + CO 2 → CH 2 O + O 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where CH 2 O represents sugars. O 2 is Earth's most robust biosignature gas because it is very hard to conceive of geochemical processes that would generate a high partial pressure of oxygen in an atmosphere with CO 2 in it at the Earth's atmospheric temperature, making the probability that oxygen is a "false positive" signal very low ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Selsis et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Segura et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). It is, however easy to explain why life produces oxygen in an oxidized environment. In order to build biomass in an oxidized environment, where carbon is tied up as carbonates or CO 2 , living organisms have to generate a highly oxidized byproduct in order to reduce CO 2 to biomass. The most plausible oxidized species is molecular oxygen itself. For more subtleties about why building biomass in an oxidizing environment results in a Type II biosignature gas that is more oxidized than the equilibrium atmospheric components, see the detailed discussion in . Other potential oxidized Type II biosignature gases might include volatiles that are oxidized forms of nitrogen (nitrogen oxides) or halogens (molecular halogens, halogen oxides or halates; see Haas (2010) regarding chloride photosynthesis), all other common elements that could form volatile chemicals are completely oxidized in the Earth's surface environment. The oxidized forms of nitrogen or halogens are less likely Type II biosignature gases than oxygen itself, as they are all more reactive (and hence damaging to life) than molecular oxygen, require more energy to generate from environmental chemicals, or both.</p><p>On a planet with a reduced atmosphere, we can generally state 2.3. Type III Biosignature Gas: Secondary Metabolic Byproduct We define Type III biosignatures as chemicals produced by life for reasons other than energy capture or the construction of the basic components of life. Type III biosignature gases have much more chemical variety as compared to Type I or Type II biosignature gases because they are not the products of reactions that are executed for their thermodynamic effect out of chemicals that exist in the environment. Rather, Type III biosignature gases have a wide variety of functions, including defense against the environment or against other organisms, signaling, or internal physiological control. Like Type II biosignature gases, energy is required to generate Type III biosignature gases.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H 2 O + CH 4 → CH 2 O + H 2 , (7) CO 2 + H 2 O + NH 3 → CH 2 O.N + H 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>There are a wide range of Type III biosignatures including: sulfur compounds (e.g., DMS, OCS, CS 2 ; (see Domagal-Goldman et al. 2011)); hydrocarbons; halogenated compounds (e.g., CH 3 Cl (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. 2005</ref>), CH 3 Br); and a variety of volatile organic carbon chemicals (VOCs including isoprene and terpenoids). These products are sometimes called the products of secondary metabolism. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Seager et al. (2012)</ref> for a summary.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of secondary metabolism gas byproducts as a biosignature class is the much more diverse range of molecules than produced by gas products from energy extraction (the Type I biosignature gases). Just as importantly, Type III biosignatures are not as prone to confusion by abiotic false positives as Type I biosignatures. As specialized chemicals, most are not naturally occurring in the atmosphere. Because they require energy and specific catalysis to be produced, Type III biosignature gases are unlikely to be made geologically in substantial amounts, and so are unlikely to be present in the absence of life. In general, the more complicated a molecule is (i.e., the more atoms it has) and the further from fully oxidized or reduced the molecule is, the less are produced by geological sources as compared to more simple molecules. For example, volcanoes produce large quantities of CO 2 , somewhat smaller amounts of CH 4 , small amounts of OCS, trace amounts of CH 3 SH, and none of isoprene. The downside to Type III biosignatures is that because they are usually such specialized compounds they typically are produced in small quantities that do not accumulate to detectable levels by remote sensing.</p><p>Type III biosignatures are not directly tied to the environment and therefore could be produced by life on any exoplanet.</p></div>

In this way, in models of exoplanet spectra, the biosignature gas source fluxes can be free parameters, and checked to be physically plausible via the biomass model estimates. Such a plausibility check is meant to enable study of a wide variety of candidate biosignature gases in both gas species and atmospheric concentration to be considered. The discussion of biosignature flux rates and hence of biosignature detectability can thus be liberated from the requirement of assuming Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes. We emphasize that we are trying to test whether a biosignature gas can be produced by a physically plausible biomass and we are not trying to predict what a biosphere would look like.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Type I Biomass Model Derivation</head><p>The biomass surface density for Type I biosignatures can be estimated by conservation of energy. We may equate the required energy rate for organism survival to the energy generation rate from an energy-yielding reaction. The organism survival energy requirements come from an empirical measurement of so-called minimal maintenance energy rate that depends only on temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. 1993</ref>). We describe the minimal maintenance energy rate, P me , in units of kJ g −1 s −1 (i.e., power per unit mass) 5 later in this section. The energy yield rate comes from the Gibbs free energy of the energy-yielding reaction times the rate at which a group of organisms processes the reaction. The Gibbs free energy of the reaction is denoted by ∆G, in units of kJ mole −1 . The metabolic byproduct gas production rate per unit mass is described by R in units of mole g −1 s −1 .</p><p>The conservation of energy per unit mass and time is then described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P me = ∆GR.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The equation tells us that under the assumption that the energy yield ∆G is used only for maintenance, the byproduct gas production rate per unit mass R can be constrained if P me is known. The byproduct gas production rate is what we have been calling the biosignature gas surface flux. The biomass surface density is the parameter of interest and so we breakdown R into a biomass surface density Σ B and a biosignature gas source flux F source .</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R = F source Σ B ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where Σ B is the biomass surface density in g m −2 . The biosignature gas source flux F source (in units of mole m −2 <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We use g as a proxy for g of wet weight.</p><p>s −1 ) describes the surface flux emitted as the metabolic byproduct and is also used as an input in a computer model of an exoplanet atmosphere. An important point for exoplanet atmospheres is that F source can not be directly converted into a detectable gas concentration that makes up a spectral feature-any source flux coming out of a planet surface is usually modified by atmospheric chemical reactions including photochemical processes. In atmosphere modeling, a photochemistry model is needed to translate the source flux into the amount of gas that accumulates in an exoplanet atmosphere. (False positives in the form of geologically-produced source fluxes must be also be considered; see §6.5.)</p><p>The biomass estimate follows from equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(9)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Σ B ≃ ∆G F source P me .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The free parameter in this biomass estimate equation is the biosignature gas source flux F source , because the Gibbs free energy is known and minimal maintenance energy rate is empirically adopted ( §3.1.2). A caveat is that both ∆G and P me depend on temperature. Σ B is an apparent minimum biomass surface density estimate because F source may be weakened to a net biosignature gas surface flux if some of the gas is consumed by other organisms. See §6.3 for a discussion.</p><p>We review the point that ∆G depends on gas concentration. The energy available to do work depends on the concentration of both the reactants and products via</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆G = ∆G 0 + RT ln(Q t ).<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Here ∆G 0 is the "standard free energy" of the system (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>), i.e., the free energy available when all the reactants are in their standard state, 1 molar concentration (for solutes) or 1 atmosphere pressure (for gases). R in this context is the universal gas constant and T is temperature. The reaction quotient Q t is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q t = [A] n [B] m [X] o [Y ] p ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>for the reaction</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">oX + pY → nA + mB,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref> is the concentration or partial pressure of species X. In general, care must be taken for the Type I biomass calculations described in this paper as relates to the appropriate ∆G. Most of our ∆G are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Amend &amp; Shock (2001)</ref>. The biosignature gas source flux, F source can now be used as a free parameter in exoplanet model atmosphere calculations, whereby, again, the purpose of the biomass estimate from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> is to ensure the biomass surface density underlying the source flux is physically reasonable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">The Minimal Maintenance Energy Consumption</head><p>Rate, Pm e</p><p>We now turn to discuss the microbial minimal maintenance energy consumption rate, P me , in more detail. Although P me is not yet a familiar quantity in exoplanets research, it is both measured empirically and tied to thermodynamics. P me is a fundamental energy flux central to the biomass estimate. P me is the minimal amount of energy an organism needs per unit time to survive in an active state (i.e., a state in which the organism is ready to grow). An empirical relation has been identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. (1993)</ref> that follows an Arrhenius law</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P me = A exp −E A RT .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Here E A = 6.94 × 10 4 J mol −1 is the activation energy, R = 8.314 J mol −1 K −1 is the universal gas constant, and T in units of K is the temperature. The constant A is 3.9 × 10 7 kJ g −1 s −1 for aerobic growth and 2.2×10 7 kJ g −1 s −1 for anaerobic growth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. 1993</ref>). Here per g refers to per g of wet weight of the organism. Note that we have explicitly converted from Tijuis' P me units of kJ (mole-C) −1 yr −1 in bacterial cells to kJ g −1 s −1 per organism by dividing the P me values by a factor of 60 (molecular weight of carbon (= 12) × the ratio of dry weight to carbon (=2) × the ratio of wet weight to dry weight in bacteria (=2.5)).</p><p>The P me maintenance energy rate equation (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>) is species independent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. 1993)</ref> and also applicable for different microbial culture systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Harder 1997</ref>). The equation is not intended to be very precise, the confidence intervals are 41% and 32% for aerobic and anaerobic growth respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. 1993)</ref>.</p><p>P me as measured is not strictly a minimal energy requirement. P me is in fact the minimal energy needed for a bacterial cell to keep going under conditions under which it is capable of growth. The P me is measured during growth, and is extrapolated to growth = 0. This extrapolated P me is nevertheless not the same as "maintenance energy" for non-growing cells. Growing cells have a variety of energy-required mechanisms "turned on" which non-growing cells will turn off to save energy, such as the machinery to make proteins, break down cell walls and so on. P me as a maintenance energy rate therefore separates out the baseline energy components from the energy needed to actually build biomass. P me is therefore the minimal energy needed to maintain active biomass 6 . See Hoehler (2004) for a more detailed review of the different types of "maintenance energy" and their relationship to organism growth.</p><p>The P me (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>) is an Arrhenius equation and it is natural to ask why the microbial maintenance energy rate follows Arrhenius' law. Organisms use energy for repair and replacement of damaged molecular components. Molecular damage is caused by non-specific chemical attack on the components of the cell by water, oxygen, and other reactive small molecules. The rate of such reactions is no different than other chemical reactionswell described by an Arrhenius equation. In aggregate, therefore, the overall rate of breakdown of the macromolecular components of the cell is expected to follow Arrhenius' law. Arrhenius' law describes chemical reaction rates (indeed any thermally activated process) and has two reaction-specific parameters A and E A . For two stable molecules to react, chemical bonds need to be broken. E A , the activation energy of a reaction, represents the energy needed to break the chemical bonds. In uncatalyzed reactions, E A comes from the thermal energy of the two reacting molecules, which itself follows from the Boltzmann velocity distribution. The probability that any two colliding molecules will have a combined energy greater than E A , is exp[−E A /RT ]. The parameter A is an efficiency factor that takes into account that molecules have to be correctly oriented in order to react.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Type I Biomass Model Validation</head><p>Tests of the biomass model for Type I biosignature gases aim to both validate the model and understand the intended range of model accuracy. Because our end goal is to estimate whether the flux of gas necessary to generate a spectral signature is plausible, we aim only for an order of magnitude estimate of the biomass that is producing the biosignature gas of interest.</p><p>The first test is to check our basic assumption of conservation of energy in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(9)</ref>: that the maintenance energy rate (P me ) is approximately equal to the redox energy yield rate (R lab ∆G), via lab measured rate values. We consider the biosignature gases and corresponding reactions described below and compare the maintenance energy rate to the redox energy yield rate, along with the values for R lab , ∆G, and P me at the temperature, T , considered (each of these three quantities are temperature-sensitive). To validate using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(9)</ref> we have averaged the validation results from different literature studies. In other words, we used the appropriate concentration, pH, and temperature for the ∆G and the appropriate temperature for P me with the validation result shown in the last column in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>. To provide overview values for each individual parameter, <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref> also shows averaged values for each of R lab and ∆G.</p><p>We consider four different Type I biosignature gasgenerating reactions. These reactions are selected because they involve the reaction of geochemically available starting materials, have well characterized microbial chemistry, and for which sufficient F field and R lab measurements are available.</p><p>The first reaction is ammonia oxidation to nitrogen oxides, described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">2NH + 4 + 2O 2 → N 2 O + 3H 2 O + 2H + (16) 4NH + 4 + 5O 2 → 4NO + 6H 2 O + 4H + .</formula><p>We note that the oxidation of ammonia is only a relevant route for production of N 2 O in an environment containing molecular oxygen. In both laboratory systems and real ecosystems, organisms oxidize ammonia to N 2 O and to NO at the same time, the ratio depending on oxygen availability and other environmental factors. To validate our estimates of gas flux based on energy requirements, we therefore have to account for an organism's production of N 2 O and NO, as the production of both of these gases contributes materially to the organism's energy budget. For ammonia oxidation we summed the R lab ∆G for NO and N 2 O generation for each experiment and calculated the geometric mean of those summed val-ues.</p><p>Our second, third, and fourth validation examples are for H 2 S, a gas produced by many biological reactions. As examples, we choose the reduction of elemental sulfur (at two different temperatures),</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">H 2 + S → H 2 S,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>and the disproportionation of thiosulfate,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S 2 O 2− 3 + H 2 O → HSO 2− 4 + H 2 S.<label>(18)</label></formula><p>These two reactions can use geochemically produced substrates, and hence are not dependent on pre-existing biomass.</p><p>We choose as a fifth example methanogenesis, via the reduction of CO 2 by H 2 to produce CH 4 . Methanogenesis is a key energy-capturing reaction in hydrothermal environments, and a reaction which relies only on geochemical inputs,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">CO 2 + 4H 2 → 2H 2 O + CH 4 .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Methanogenesis is discussed at length in sections §5.2 and §5.3.</p><p>The validation results-that the lab-based redox energy yield rate compares to the maintenance energy rate within an order of magnitude-are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref> (right-most column). The results show a reasonable confirmation of our application of the minimal maintenance energy concept to biosignature gas production rates, to within about an order of magnitude with one exception. An order of magnitude is expected because of uncertainties in the individual factors: P me a factor of 2; the gas flux typically a factor of 2; the biomass measurement and conversion values a factor of 2).</p><p>We pause to discuss the relevance of validating the P me equation against lab production rates, given that <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. (1993)</ref> already used laboratory measurements in the original paper. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Tijhuis et al. (1993)</ref> equation for P me (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>) was developed from studies in which all the inputs and outputs from energy metabolism were completely characterized, so that the energy balance of the organisms could be calculated exactly. The organisms' growth rate was also controlled, so that the energy consumption at zero growth (P me ) could be inferred directly from the data. In our application we wish to infer the biomass from a single measure of gas output, from organisms whose rate of growth is not known. We therefore needed to validate that such an extrapolation of the application of the P me concept is valid.</p><p>Based on the lab and P me comparison in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>, the rate of production of gas in growing cultures of organism in the laboratory is higher than that predicted by the P me calculations. This is expected. P me is the minimal maintenance energy-the energy needed to maintain the cell in a state ready to grow. Actual growth requires additional energy to assemble cell components. This extra energy demand in turn requires that the cell produce more Type I metabolic waste products per unit mass than is expected from the P me calculations. The amount of the excess will depend on specifics of the growth conditions (e.g., what nutrients are supplied to the organisms), the organisms growth rate, and specifics of its metabolism. Thus <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref> is consistent with our model, showing that organisms use at least the P me of energy in cultures capable of active growth.</p><p>Now we comment more specifically on the actual validation numbers in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>. Two of the test validation results are too high, at a factor of 20 when they should be close to unity. Based on this high value and reasons described further below, the Type I biomass model should only be used for temperatures below ∼343 K, because the Tijhuis et al. (1993) P me equation was derived from measurements taken between 283 and 338 K (with one measurement at 343 K). Both of the anomalously high values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref> are for cultures grown at the upper end of this temperature range. It is possible that at such extreme temperatures organisms require more energy for stress and damage response than predicted from culture at lower temperature. We note that the deviation of P me as compared to ∆GR lab may also be reflected in the temperature dependencies: P me follows an exponential with T whereas ∆G changes linearly with T (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>).</p><p>As a second test of the Type I biomass model we check the biomass estimate equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, specifically that the quantity of interest, the biomass surface density (Σ B ) is reasonable based on the field fluxes and ∆G and P me . In other words, for this second test we ask if the surface biomass (estimated via equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>) is reasonable by comparison with Earth-based biomass surface densities for the microbial redox energy equation and environment in question. For the N 2 O and H 2 S examples given above, we find biomass surface densities are below 0.0024 g m −2 , as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 5</ref>, well within a plausible biomass surface density ( §1.3).</p><p>We did not validate CH 4 for surface biomass density because maximum local field fluxes of methane are not meaningful for comparison with other gas fluxes in our analysis. Extremely high CH 4 fluxes can be generated from anaerobic biomass breakdown (fermentation), but these represent the rapid breakdown on biomass that has been accumulated over much wider areas and over substantial time. As an extreme example, sewage processing plants can generate substantial methane, but only because they collect their biomass from an entire city. This flux does not therefore represent a process that could be scaled up to cover a planet.</p><p>We also did not validate the biosignature gas NH 3 because no natural terrestrial environment emits detectable amounts of ammonia on a global scale. NH 3 is sometimes generated by the breakdown of biomass, especially protein-rich biomass or nitrogen-rich excretion products. But NH 3 represents a valuable source of nitrogen, which is taken up rapidly by life. Because ammonia is very soluble in water, any residual NH 3 not taken up by life remains dissolved in water and does not generate any significant amount of NH 3 gas in the atmosphere.</p><p>We conclude this subsection by summarizing that the Type I biomass model is a useful estimate to about an order of magnitude. This is validated from our use of the minimimum maintenance energy P me as compared to lab flux values (∆GR lab ). We also showed that a reasonable biomass surface density is derived using the field flux values in the main Type I biomass equation (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref> Type I biomass model validation for select biosignature gases.

The actual validation given in column 7 is an average of individual values (not shown) of R lab , ∆ G , and Pm e . The biosignature gas producing reactions are listed in the text but can be summarized as: N 2 O: produced via ammonia oxidation; H 2 S a and b sulfur reduction with H 2 ; H 2 S c: S 2 O 3 disproportionation to H 2 S; CH 4 produced via methanogenesis (see text in §3.1.3) for details.</p><p>Gas  ture gases are produced as a result of biomass building.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Type III Biosignature Biomass Estimates</head><p>Type III biosignature gases have no physically-based biomass model because Type III biosignatures are not linked to the growth or maintenance of the producing organism. Because the amount of biosignature gas produced is arbitrary from the point of view of its overall metabolism, there can be no quantitative biomass model for Type III biosignature gases.</p><p>We therefore instead construct a biomass estimate from a framework based on terrestrial Type III biosignature gas fluxes. While tying the biomass estimate to the specifics of terrestrial metabolism is unsatisfactory, it is still more general than the conventional adoption of Earth-like environmental flux rates which assume both terrestrial metabolism and terrestrial ecology. With our Type III biomass estimate approach, we can scale the biosignature gas source flux to different biomass densities that are not achieved on Earth.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Type III Biomass Estimate Validation</head><p>We now turn to a validity check of the Type III biomass estimate. To validate we compare the flux rates of Type III biosignature gases observed in the field (F field ) with the production rate of Type III gases from laboratory culture (R lab ) of pure organisms. The field rates give a flux per unit area, and the laboratory rates give a flux rate per unit mass. Also, the lab rates are from single species whereas the field rates are from an ecology. We wish to confirm that comparison of the two predicts a physically plausible biomass per unit area to explain the field flux. We use the values for F field and R lab as given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 6</ref>.  Most of the Type III biomass surface density values (as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 6</ref>) are well within the values of biomass density seen in natural ecosystems ( §1.3). We can therefore say that using laboratory fluxes is a reasonable way to approximately estimate the biomass necessary to generate biosignature gas fluxes. We emphasize approximate, because the biomass densities are somewhat high for Type III organism biomass densities.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Molecule F field R lab Σ B = F field R lab CH 3 Cl 2.</formula><p>The biomass surface density validation for COS is somewhat large at 622 g m −2 . The problem with COS is that it is both given off and absorbed by ecosystems, often by the same ecosystem at different times. The net field flux may therefore be poorly defined, perhaps representing the release of stored gas. In addition, COS is usually only produced by organisms in response to attack by other organisms such that COS is produced in large quantities in soils but produced in much smaller quanaties in lab cultures. The same argument applies to CS 2 and also gives rise to a somewhat large biomass. In any case, COS and CS 2 are examples of how the Type III biomass model based on scaling is approximate only.</p><p>The biomass surface density validation for DMS is much lower than the other Type III biomass estimates in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 6</ref>. All of the molecules in the table except DMS are produced at a cost to the organism for carbon and energy in order to perform specific signaling or defense functions. DMS, in contrast, is a product of the consumption of DMSP. DMSP is produced in response to stress and then is broken down enzymatically to DMS by zooplankton. In the lab DMSP is often fed to the phytoplankton at a level unavailable in the natural environment, and the phytoplankton consume the DMSP at a very high rate likely leading to the high lab DMS production rates, and hence the low biomass surface density estimate.</p></div>

Values of K AB are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 7</ref> for gases studied in this paper. The loss rate can also be due to photochemical dissociation of species A, as in</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">L[A] = J[A] = λ q λ I λ exp −τ λ σ λ [A]dλ,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where J is the photodissociation loss rate, q λ is the quantum yield, I λ is the stellar intensity, exp −τ λ is the attenuation by optical depth τ λ , σ is the photodissociation cross section of the species A, and λ is wavelength. Photodissociation is most relevant high in the atmosphere typically above mbar levels to which stellar UV radiation can penetrate from above. Gases can be lost from the atmosphere by deposition to the ground. This loss is at the surface only (and numerically is treated as a lower boundary condition), in contrast to the photochemical loss rate reactions which take place throughout the upper atmosphere. Dry deposition is deposition onto a surface (either solid land or liquid water oceans) and wet deposition is deposition into water (rain) droplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Seinfeld &amp; Pandis 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The deposition velocity at the planetary surface can be described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Φ dep = nv d ,<label>(28)</label></formula><p>where Φ is the molecular loss flux at the surface due to dry deposition, n is the number density (in units of   molecules m −3 ) at the surface of the species under consideration, and v d is the dry deposition velocity (in units of m s −1 ). The wet deposition is relevant for watersoluable gases and is not usually described as a velocity but as a process that occurs througout the layer where water condenses (on Earth the troposphere) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). Where photochemical reactions are slow, the deposition rate (the rate of loss to the ground) can control the atmospheric concentration of gas. Surface deposition consists of two processes: transfer of a gas between the atmosphere and the surface and removal of the gas from the surface. The rate of transfer from the atmosphere to the surface is proportional to the concentration difference between the atmosphere and the surface. Thus once transferred to the surface, the gas has to be chemically removed, or the surface will saturate with gas there will be no more transfer-the deposition rate will be zero. The values of wet and dry deposition velocities can be measured on Earth (e.g., Sehmel 1980), but the wet and dry deposition rates for various gases are highly variable and therefore averages tend to be used in models. Caution must be taken, however, in applying Earthbased averages to exoplanets. The chemistry that removes many of Earth's atmospheric gases at the surface such as methane, ammonia, OCS and methyl chloride from Earth's atmosphere are biochemical, not geochemical. Life actively consumes these gases. So deposition rates on exoplanets may be very different from those in the terrestrial atmosphere. We discuss this in more detail in the context of CH 4 and NH 3 in §5.2 and §5.1 respectively. In summary, caution should be taken when extrapolating the Earth measured values to planetary applications. Notably, if the surface is saturated with a specific molecule, the surface uptake of the molecule may be reduced to zero.</p><note type="other">Reaction A n E T = 270 K T = 370 K T = 470</note><p>The production rate are written in terms of the two different loss rates (and considering Φ dep as a surface boundary condition,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">P = [A](J + K AB [B]).<label>(29)</label></formula><p>The production rate is here assumed to be from biological sources, but when considering false positives the geological source should also be considered. For biosignature gases that are minor chemical perturbers in the atmosphere, the biosignature lifetime can be estimated based on the dominant loss rate via equation (26). The simplified example for one species A gets more complicated for the case where there are several terms in the loss rate and when the production rate also includes other chemical reactions, and this is where the photochemistry model calculation is required. The steady state concentration <ref type="bibr">[B]</ref> is unknown and calculating <ref type="bibr">[B]</ref> is one reason why a full photochemical model is needed to go beyond estimates.</p><p>The full photochemical model is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>. The photochemical code computes a steady-state chemical composition of an exoplanetary atmosphere. The system can be described by a set of time-dependent continuity equations, one equation for each species at each altitude. Each equation describes: chemical production; chemical loss; eddy diffusion and molecular diffusion (contributing to production or loss); sedimentation (for aerosols only); emission and dry deposition at the lower boundary; and diffusion-limited atmospheric escape for light species at the upper boundary. The code includes 111 species, 824 chemical reactions, and 71 photochemical reactions.</p><p>Starting from an initial state, the system is numerically evolved to the steady state in which the number densities no longer change. Because the removal timescales of different species are very different, an implicit inverse Euler method is employed for numerical time stepping. The generic model computes chemical and photochemical reactions among all O, H, N, C, S species, and formation of sulfur and sulfate aerosols. The numerical code is designed to have the flexibility of choosing a subset of species and reactions in the computation. The code therefore has the ability to treat both oxidized and reduced conditions, by allowing selection of "fast species". For the chemical and photochemical reactions, we use the most up-to-date reaction rate data from both the NIST database (http://kinetics.nist.gov) and the JPL publication ( <ref type="bibr">Sander et al. 2011</ref>). Ultraviolet and visible radiation in the atmosphere is computed by the δ-Eddington 2-stream method with molecular absorption, Rayleigh scattering and aerosol Mie scattering contributing to the optical depth.</p><p>We developed the photochemistry model from the ground up from basic chemical and physical principles and using both established and improved computer algo-rithms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2012</ref>, and references therein  <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Zahnle et al. 2008</ref>). In particular, the code correctly illustrates the effect of HO x catalytic chemistry that stabilizes Mars' CO 2 -dominated atmosphere, predicting an O 2 mixing ratio of ∼1500 ppb. The temperature profiles for the simulated atmospheres are self-consistently computed with the grey atmosphere assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Guillot 2010</ref> , CO, NH 3 are considered, if they are needed in the atmospheric scenario under consideration. For the grey-atmosphere temperature profiles, we have assumed isotropic irradiation, and applied the convection correction if the radiative temperature gradient is steeper than the adiabatic lapse rate. We have assumed for all cases the planetary Bond albedo is 0.3; in other words, we have implicitly assumed a cloud coverage of 50% (assuming cloud albedo to be 0.6). For consistency we account for the effect of clouds on the planetary reflection and thermal emission spectrum by a weighted average of spectra with and without clouds as in Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Marais et al.

NH 3 is a good biosignature gas candidate for any thin H 2 -rich exoplanet atmosphere because of its short lifetime and lack of production sources. NH 3 as a biosignature gas is a new idea, and one that is specific to a non-Earth-like planet. On Earth, NH 3 is not a useful biosignature gas because, as a highly valuable molecule for life that is produced in only small quantities, it is rapidly depleted by life and unable to accumulate in the atmosphere.</p><p>The biosignature idea is that ammonia would be produced from hydrogen and nitrogen, in an atmosphere rich in both,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">3H 2 + N 2 → 2NH 3 .<label>(31)</label></formula><p>This is an exothermic reaction which could be used to capture energy. We propose that in an H 2 -rich atmosphere, life can catalyze breaking of the N 2 triple bond and the H 2 bond to produce NH 3 , and capture the energy released. In an H 2 -rich environment, life could use the reduction of N 2 to capture energy-in contrast to life on Earth which solely fixes nitrogen in an energy-requiring process. Energy capture would yield an excess of ammonia over that needed by life to build biomass, and so the excess would accumulate in the atmosphere as a Type I biosignature gas. A catalyst is required to synthesize ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gas because the reaction in equation (31) does not occur spontaneously at temperatures below 1300 K, at which temperature the formation of ammonia is strongly thermodynamically disfavored. On Earth, the industrial production of NH 3 by the above reaction is called the Haber process: an iron catalyst is used at high pressure (150-250 bar) to allow the reaction to happen at 575-825 K at which temperature the formation of ammonia is thermodynamically favored <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Haber 1913)</ref>. The Haber process is the principle industrial method for producing ammonia <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . More efficient catalysts are known, which can catalyze the formation of ammonia from elemental nitrogen and hydrogen gases at 500 K and standard pressure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Yue et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Avanier et al. 2007</ref>). Others catalyze the formation of ammonia from nitrogen gas and a proton <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Yandulov &amp; Schrock 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Shilov 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Weare et al. 2006</ref>) or from an activated nitrogen molecule and hydrogen gas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Nishibayashi et al. 1998)</ref>, in water at room temperature and pressure. The final step of combining a room temperature nitrogen reduction catalyst with a room temperature hydrogen splitting catalyst has not been achieved in the lab but is believed to be a realistic goal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Weare et al. 2006</ref>). Such a combined catalyst would make NH 3 from H 2 and N 2 and would generate energy (heat) from the reaction.</p><p>Life on Earth does not use the "Haber" reaction. This might be because the appropriate catalysts have not evolved. It might be because the rare environments in which H 2 is available provide other more easily accessible sources of energy (such as methanogenesis; §5.2). On Earth life inputs energy to break the N 2 triple bond, and the fixed nitrogen is a valuable resource representing an investment of energy and so is avidly taken up by other Earth life. Haber life using the Haber chemistry in an atmosphere with plenty of N 2 would produce generous amounts of NH 3 , more than enough for the rest of life to use, enabling NH 3 to accumulate in the atmosphere as a biosignature gas.</p><p>To check the viability of NH 3 as a biosignature gas, we follow the steps listed in §3. For background, we consider a planet of Earth mass and size, a 290 K surface temperature and with a 1-bar atmosphere composed of 25% H 2 and 75% N 2 by volume, and including carbon species via a CO 2 emission flux from the planet's surface. NH 3 has significant opacity in the 10.3-10.8 µm band in a thermal emission spectrum. A mixing ratio of 0.1 ppm is radiatively significant for a 1-bar atmosphere in this band in an H 2 -N 2 atmosphere <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2</ref>) according to our detection metric ( §4.3). We next determine the NH 3 surface source flux required for the gas to accumulate in the atmosphere to the 0.1 ppm concentration level. For this, we compute the photochemical equilibrium steadystate composition (results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>) with the <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch were awarded the Nobel Prize for this chemistry in 1918, ironically, as the Haber process' principal deployment in the previous four years had been for making explosives for munitions, the application of chemistry that Alfred Nobel most wanted to discourage. ammonia surface source flux as a free parameter ( §4.1). The dominant loss mechanism of NH 3 is due to photolysis (or reaction with OH; each process breaks the NH 3 bond) with some NH 3 eventually being converted to N 2 ). We adopt an NH 3 deposition velocity of 0 m s −1 , assuming that the surface is saturated in NH 3 . (See the below for a further discussion of deposition removal rate assumptions and related consequences). The resulting NH 3 surface source flux is 5.0 × 10 15 molecule m −2 s −1 . We note that this planet has a column-averaged mixing ratio of 0.4 ppm of NH 3 , and to meet a surface temperature of 290 K the semi-major axis would be 1.1 AU. We also point out that NH 3 concentrates mostly in the lower atmosphere, and decreases very rapidly with altitude above 15 km <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3</ref>) because of the high-altitude destruction rates. To compute ∆G we used T = 290 K, and reactant and product concentrations at the surface in terms of partial pressures of N 2 = 0.75, H 2 = 0.25, NH 3 = 6.6 × 10 −7 .</p><p>We next estimate the biomass surface density. Using the biomass equation (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> . We therefore consider the NH 3 production flux to be viable in our Haber World scenario. The global annual biogenic NH 3 surface emission in the Haber World would be about 6700 Tg yr −1 . This is much higher than the Earth's natural NH 3 emission at 10 Tg yr −1 (Seinfeld &amp; Pandis 2000). Comparing NH 3 production on the Haber world and on Earth, however, is not valid. We are postulating that production of NH 3 on the Haber world is a major source of metabolic energy for life. A better emission rate comparison is to the biosignature gas O 2 from Earth's principle energy metabolism, photosynthesis. Earth's global oxygen flux is 500 times larger than the Haber World's NH 3 surface emission, at about 2 × 10 5 Tg yr −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Friend et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Deposition rates require more description, because on Earth deposition is the dominant atmospheric removal process for NH 3 , yet we argue the deposition rates to play a minor role for NH 3 atmospheric removal on the Haber World. On Earth, ammonia is taken up avidly by life in soil and in water. On our proposed Haber World, life is a net producer of ammonia, not a net consumer, and so water (as raindrops or ocean) and soil would saturate with ammonia. Wet and dry deposition rates would therefore be limited to chemical consumption, the rates of which would depend on specifics of the surface chemistry. We therefore assume that the deposition rates are much less than atmospheric loss rates and this is considered in the photochemical calculation. A larger deposition rate implies a larger NH 3 emission flux and therefore a larger biomass to maintain the biosignature. When deposition is the dominant removal process, the relation between the source flux and the steady-state mixing ratio of NH 3 is linear. A Haber World with Earth-like NH 3 deposition rates (10 −3 m s −1 )requires a NH 3 source flux of about 3.0 × 10 17 molecule m −2 s −1 , a surface emission flux 100 times higher than the zero-deposition rate case. The biomass is also 100 times higher, and at Σ B ∼ 9 g m −2 is still a reasonable value.</p><p>The molecule HCN can be considered a bioindicator gas in the specific situation where HCN is detectable but its formation components, NH 3 and CH 4 (or any other dominant carbon source such as CO or CO 2 ) are not. More specifically, in an H 2 -rich atmosphere, if NH 3 and CH 4 are emitted at comparable rates, HCN will be produced with little NH 3 and CH 4 remaining in the atmosphere above the convective layer (or above the first several scale heights from the surface; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). It can therefore be expected that if emissions of methane and ammonia are both elevated, the mixing ratio of HCN in the atmosphere can be as high as 1 ppmv and then become detectable via its prominent spectral feature at ∼3 microns. In other words, HCN can be an indicator of surface NH 3 emission, even if NH 3 itself is depleted and not detectable due to atmospheric photochemistry. The photochemical pathway of HCN under such conditions is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>. In general, in an atmosphere with enough NH 3 or N 2 and CH 4 , the formation of HCN is inevitable in anoxic environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Zahnle 1986</ref>). Also of potential interest, HCN is the second most common N-bearing species in the Haber World. In terms of false positives for NH 3 , the NH 3 biosignature gas concept is not changed in the massive atmosphere case with high surface pressure. As long as the surface conditions are suitable for liquid water, NH 3 will not be created by uncatalyzed chemical reactions. False postives may still exist such as chemical or biological breakdown of abiotic molecules. An additional false positive for NH 3 could be generated by non-life-compatible surface temperatures: at 820 K with surface iron, NH 3 could be generated by the conventional Haber process. These false positive statements hold for a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere; other cases such as planets with a massive atmosphere where NH 3 could be generated kinetically at extremely high pressures, or planets withh icy interiors where NH 3 is outgassed during planetary evolution, have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Seager et al. (2013)</ref>).</p><p>In summary, we propose NH 3 as a biosignature gas on a planet with an N 2 -H 2 composition. NH 3 should be photodissociated and therefore its presence would be indicative of biogenic production. We have nicknamed this planet "cold Haber World" because life would have to perform the Haber process chemistry using a highly efficient catalyst, low temperature to break both the N 2 triple bond and the H 2 bond, rather than the elevated temperature and relatively inefficient catalyst used in the industrial "hot" Haber process.</p></div>

CH 4 has long been considered a prime biosignature gas for Earth-like exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Hitchcock &amp; Lovelock 1967)</ref> and especially for early Earth analogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Des Marais et al. 2002</ref>). An early Earth analog prevalence of CH 4 theory is motivated by the early faint young sun paradox. A few billion years ago, the sun was 20-30% fainter than today, specifically with 26% lower luminosity 4 Gyr ago, based on asteroseismology-constrained stellar evolution models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bahcall et al. 2001</ref>). Yet, there is no evidence that Earth was frozen over during that time. A reduced greenhouse gas is a good, viable explanation for keeping Earth warmed despite the much cooler sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Sagan &amp; Mullen 1972)</ref>. The greenhouse gas CH 4 is a favored greenhouse gas explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Kiehl &amp; Dickinson 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Haqq-Misra et al. 2008</ref>). Methane at 1,000 times today's atmospheric concentration would have been sufficient to keep the Earth warm (i.e., concentrations of 1600 ppmv instead of 1.6 ppmv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Pavlov et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Haqq-Misra et al. 2008</ref>, and references therein). Moreover, accumulation of atmospheric CH 4 to levels much higher than Earth's would have been possible in the anoxic environment of early Earth. CH 4 could have accumulated to 1000 ppmv levels in the weakly reducing early Earth atmosphere because the CH 4 loss rate was so much smaller, owing to the lack of O 2 . In more detail, the dominant removal rate of methane in an oxidized atmosphere is due to reaction with atmospheric OH. OH is produced via photochemistry, from both O 3 (itself a photochemical byproduct of O 2 ) and H 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Seinfeld &amp; Pandis 2000)</ref>.</p><p>To consider the biomass required on any methanogenesis world, we must work with surface fluxes generated only by primary production methanogenesis. Overlooked or unstated for early Earth in past work is that most of Earth's biogenic methane production today is from fermentation of biomass. This biomass available for fermentation is almost entirely produced via photosynthesis. For an early Earth analog, before the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, there is likely no large reservoir of biomass for fermentation. We note that on early Earth itself, there should have been a small reservoir of biomass, from, for example, anoxic photosynthesis. For exoplanets we want to consider biologically-produced methane from an ecosystem that uses methanogenesis as a primary energy source. In such a methanogenesis world, there would be biomass for fermentation, but the amount of methane produced by fermentation would be minor compared to the amount of methane produced from energy capture.</p><p>The methanogens of interest are those that convert H 2 and CO 2 to CH 4 in the process of extracting energy from the environment. These methanogens do not require biomass to feed upon and today live in anoxic environments including hydrothermal vents at the deep sea floor, subterranean environments, and hot springs.</p><p>The methanogens of interest produce CH 4 by using carbon from CO 2 from inorganic sources,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">H 2 + CO 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O.<label>(32)</label></formula><p>At the deep-sea floor, H 2 is released from rocks by hot water emitted from hydrothermal vents (serpentinization). CO 2 is available dissolved in seawater. In other Earth environments, H 2 is also produced as a byproduct of biological metabolism, and CO 2 is available as gas in air or dissolved in water. The metabolic byproducts from methanogenesis are CH 4 and H 2 O. We now turn to the biomass estimate for CH 4 as the biosignature from a primary producing methanogenesis ecology on an early Earth analog exoplanet. We take early Earth (Earth-size, Earth-mass with a 1 bar atmosphere) to be an anoxic, N 2 -dominated atmosphere with CO 2 mixing ratios of 1% and 20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ohmoto et al. 2004</ref>), the time period before the rise of oxygen (an Archaen atmosphere, 3.8 to 2.5 Gyr ago). For the planets to have surface temperatures of 290 K, they would be at 1.2 AU for the 1% CO 2 atmosphere and 1.3 AU for the 20% CO 2 atmosphere. Using our detection metric ( §4.3) We find a detectable CH 4 mixing ratio to be 200 ppm in the 3.1 to 4 µm band. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> for the chemical composition of the 1% CO 2 atmosphere.</p><p>Although we consider the effect of clouds on weakening the spectral features in the exoplanet spectrum, we do not treat formation of hydrocarbons that have more than . Atmospheric composition for the early Earth methanogenesis world. The 1 bar atmosphere is taken to be N 2 -dominated with 1% CO 2 . We take the planet's surface to be a net emitter of CH 4 , with a surface flux of 7 × 10 14 molecules m −2 s −1 computed to match the 200 ppm concentration required by our detection metric. Our photochemistry model shows that methane can accumulate to a mixing ratio of 220 ppm in the atmosphere and that the major photochemical product is H 2 having a mixing ratio of 40 ppm and CO having a mixing ratio of 18 ppm. two carbon atoms. The formation of hydrocarbons that have more than two carbon atoms should only have minor impact on our estimate of required biomass, because the most abundant hydrocarbons that have more than two carbon atoms, C 3 H 8 , has still five orders of magnitude lower mixing ratio at the steady state than C 2 H 6 in N 2 atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Pavlov et al. 2001</ref>). The formation of hydrocarbon haze (commonly hydrocarbons with more than 5 carbon atoms), a point we do not address in this paper, may impact the energy budget of the planet and therefore the surface temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Haqq-Misra et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A <ref type="formula">CH</ref>  Using the above values, together with P me = 7.0 × 10 −6 kJ g −1 s −1 for the minimal maintenance energy rate for anaerobic microbes at 290 K, the biomass estimate is 7.8 × 10 −3 g m −3 and 4.9 × 10 −3 g m −3 , for the 1% and 20% CO 2 atmospheres respectively, globally averaged values. This is a reasonable biomass as compared to terrestrial microbial biomass surface density values (Section 1.3). In this scenario, methanogenic organisms would dominate a biosphere where methanogenesis is the main energy source for life, just as on Earth photosynthetic organisms (including plants and waterbased photosynthesizes) dominate the biosphere because photosynthesis is the dominant energy source for life.</p><p>For an early Earth analog "slime world", the critical question is whether H 2 would be a limiting input for methanogenesis on a planet with Earth-like atmospheric conditions (see equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(32)</ref>). For the methanogenesis world, a global CH 4 flux of about 750 Tg yr −1 is required to reach the detectability threshold (this global CH 4 flux is the value corresopnding to the CH 4 production rate calculated above). To investigate we look at fluxes of hydrogen gas from Earth's hydrothermal systems and levels of hydrogen gas in hydrothermal fluids. Fluxes of hydrogen from hydrothermal systems on Earth can be as high as 1.8% of the total gases (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Gerlach 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Le Guern et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Taran et al. 1991)</ref>. If this flux of H 2 is extrapolated to the global fluxes by comparison with fluxes of H 2 S and SO 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Halmer et al. 2002)</ref>, it would imply global H 2 fluxes of between 0.8 and 1.6 Tg/year 8 . If all of the hydrogen were used in methanogenesis, that would result in 3.2-6.4 Tg yr −1 methane.</p><p>If the H 2 needed to support the required rate of methanogenesis comes from volcanism alone-as in the case of modern Earth-a methanogenesis world with an Earth-like atmosphere, requires about 100 times more hydrogen flux outgassing than on present day Earth. This high H 2 flux outgassing could be sustained by either a more reduced mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Holland 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>), more serpentization, and/or more volcanism than on the present-day Earth.</p><p>The required large amounts of H 2 could be also produced from atmospheric photochemistry, in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, enabling a biochemical cycle to sustain surface methanogenesis. In our photochemistry code, atmospheric H 2 forms from photolysis of CH 4 . The net accumulation of CH 4 results from the difference in production and loss of CH 4 , being computed selfconsistenly with the appropriate mass balance. A form of this methanogenesis scenario was describe previously in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Kharecha et al. (2005)</ref>. In this biochemical cycle, a reasonable quantity of H 2 is required only at the onset of the evolution of methanogenesis.</p><p>We note that methane can reach high abundances through abiotic means especially if the mantle is reduced. More work is needed on false positives in the hope of finding a way to distinguish biotic and abiotic methane, or at least to assign a probability to the chance of methane being biotic.</p><p>We finish the early Earth methanogenesis scenario with an emphasis on the deposition velocity as a loss rate. For CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4</ref> , we have considered a zero deposition velocity, with the concept that a slime world covered in methanogens has a CH 4 -saturated surface. We also assume that this world has few CH 4 -consuming organisms compared to the CH 4 -producing organisms. In other words, the rationale is that on a methane slime world, living organisms are net producers of CH 4 at the surface and would not destroy CH 4 -the surface would likely be saturated in CH 4 making the deposition rate zero. On Earth CH 4 deposited to the surface is rapidly oxidized by life to CO 2 , so deposition is efficient, although only a minor contribution to the CH 4 loss rate. If we treat the N 2 -CO 2 atmosphere with an Earth-like CH 4 deposition rate (for CH 4 on Earth typically 10 −6 m s −1 ), then CH 4 is prevented from accumulating to 200 ppm, but instead is at a lower concentration, at values of 15 ppm. A deposition velocity could be non-zero due to life other than the methanogens consuming CH 4 ; but see the discussion in §6.1.</p><p>To summarize this subsection, we have revisited methane as a biosignature gas on early Earth. We have found the biomass surface density needed to sustain a detectable CH 4 biosignature gas from primary production is reasonable at ∼ 5 × 10 −3 g m −2 . Although volcanism alone is unlikely to provide the amount of H 2 needed to sustain methanogenesis at the level required for CH 4 detection, an atmospheric photolysis of CH 4 can recycle the H 2 to provide sufficient flux.</p></div>

CH 4 has been detected in the atmosphere of Mars with three independent instruments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Formisano et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Krasnopolsky et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Mumma et al. 2009</ref>). The Martian CH 4 detection is difficult to reconcile with present understanding of the planet and some believe the ground-based CH 4 detection may be a result of observational artifacts (see the references in the summary review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Atreya et al. 2011</ref>). The Martian CH 4 may be the result of geochemical outgassing or atmospheric photochemistry <ref type="bibr">(Bar-Nun and Dimitrov 2006)</ref>. A more intriguing, if speculative CH 4 source, is Martian life ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Krasnopolsky et al. 2004</ref>).

We can calculate the free energy available from the reaction ), we find from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> surface biomass density of Σ B ≃ 10 −6 -10 −7 . This a very small biomass surface density as compared to terrestrial biofilm values ( §1.3), and hence the Martian CH 4 production by microbial life appears physically plausible. The Martian surface is believed to be sterile, in part because the surface atmospheric pressure is incompatible with the existence of liquid water at any temperature and in part because the surface is unshielded from extremely destructive radiation from space (Solar UV and X rays, cosmic rays) <ref type="bibr">(Dartnell 2011</ref>). Water, if it exists near the surface, will be present as ice. Viking's finding of a complete lack of organic molecules in the top few centimeters of soil supports the sterility of the surface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Biemann et al. 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Biemann et al. , 1977</ref>. A few tens of centimeters of regolith would shield organisms from radiation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Pavlov et al. 2002)</ref>. However orbital radar suggests that water is frozen to a depth of several km in most sites on Mars (reviewed in Kerr 2010), so Martian life must either be more deeply buried than current radar penetration, or be living in highly concentrated brines at depths of 1 to 3 km. The column-integrated density of ∼ 10 −6 -10 −7 g m −2 of biomass would therefore be present not as surface life but living in rock interstices. This density is well below that of the density of such rock-dwelling microbial communities on Earth <ref type="bibr">(Pedersen 1993, and refer- ences therein)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">4H 2 + CO 2 → CH 4 + 2H 2 O,<label>(33)</label></formula><p>In summary, we have applied our biomass model to the putative methane detections on Mars. We found that if the CH 4 is produced by methanogenesis only a very small biomass surface density is required, Σ B ≃ 10 −6 -10 −7 g m −2 . Martian methane could be generated by microorganisms living in subsurface rocks. Our model predicts that the amount of biomass needed to generate the proposed methane flux is plausible for a rock-based microbial community. By itself, a biomass surface density prediction does not rule out methanogenesis as the cause of the atmospheric CH 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">H 2 S: An Unlikely Biosignature Gas</head><p>The gas H 2 S is generated by bacteria on Earth, and also by volcanism. The majority of Earth's H 2 S emission is from life (Watts 2000). With our biosignature framework we can calculate a consistent biosphere, based on sulfur-metabolizing organisms and estimate how much biomass is required to generate a detectable amount of H 2 S. Although detection of H 2 S will be very difficult due to water vapor contamination of H 2 S features, and just as seriously H 2 S has a serious risk of false positive through volcanic production, the biomass estimate turns out to be reasonable.</p><p>H 2 S would be very difficult to detect in a future exoplanet atmosphere spectrum, mostly because there are no spectral features that are not heavily contaminated by water vapor spectral features. In the UV, H 2 S absorption features are mixed in with those of SO 2 and elemental sulfur, both of which are likely to be present in the atmosphere with H 2 S (http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/2295/) and for specific UV cross sections see the references in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>. At visible wavelengths there are no prominent spectral features. In the IR, at 30-80 µm, a huge amount of H 2 S would be needed to differentiate from water vapor spectral features. Even so, the H 2 S features may cause a quasi-continuum absorption lowering the thermal emission flux below a reasonable detection threshhold. There might be a way to detect H 2 S in a spectrum that spans UV to IR: it might be plausible to detect total sulfur via UV spectral characteristics, infer from this a relative absence of SO 2 , and then infer from an IR signature that there was a significant flux of H 2 S (or DMS) from the ground. This is implausibly demanding of instrumentation, but not in theory impossible.</p><p>H 2 S is commonly regarded as a poor biosignature gas because it is released by volcanoes. In general, we consider an atmospheric gas a potential biosignature gas if it is present in such large quantities, that, in the context of other atmospheric gases, has no likely geological origin.</p><p>We nonetheless now turn to explore H 2 S as a biosignature gas based on its biomass estimate. On a highly reduced planet, organisms could gain energy from reducing sulfate to H 2 S, but in this environment H 2 S would likely be the dominant volcanic sulfur gas as well. On an exoplanet with a more oxidized crust and atmosphere, we can imagine an ecosystem of sulfur disproportionators as the primary producers.</p><p>Microorganisms can disproportionate sulfur compounds of intermediate oxidation state, including thiosulfate, sulfite, and elemental sulfur, into H 2 S and sulfate <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Finster 2008)</ref>. H 2 S would be released as a biosignature gas. For example, the sulfite reducers include microorganisms in the genus Desulfovibrio and Desulfocapsa that obtain energy from the disproportionation of sulfite <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kramer &amp; Cypionka 1989</ref>) The equation of the disproportion of sulfite in the ocean is</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">4HSO − 3 → 3SO 2− 4 + 2H + + H 2 S.<label>(34)</label></formula><p>Note that the accumulation of sulfite and sulfate in an ocean would make the ocean acidic, and at acidic pH levels H 2 S will exist in solution primarily as H 2 S molecules, which will exchange readily with the atmosphere (unlike a neutral or basic ocean, where S(II) would exist as HS − or S 2− which are not volatile). To continue to explore H 2 S as a biosignature gas, in our biomass estimate framework, we take an Earth-size, Earth-mass planet with a 1-bar exoplanet atmosphere composed almost entirely of N 2 with a minor H 2 O concentration (like Earth above the cold trap but much drier below the cold trap) and a small amount of CO 2 (1 ppm), assuming volcanic emission. We consider detection at IR wavelengths, where absorption of H 2 S might only be detected when the planet has a relatively dry troposphere (10 −6 mixing ratio throughout the troposphere), meaning that there will be reduced contamination of H 2 S spectral features by water vapor. Even for an extremely high H 2 S emission (3000 times Earth's volcanic emission) on a desiccated planet, we have estimated an H 2 S concentration of 10 ppm for detection via thermal emission in the 45-55 µm range according to our detection metric ( §4.3). The H 2 S surface flux required is 3000 times Earth's volcanic emission, (10 17 molecules m −2 s −1 ). The SO 2 surface flux (used by the sulfur disproportionators) is scaled up accordingly (2× the H 2 S surface flux). To compute the ∆G value we used the reactant and product molecule concentrations at the surface in terms of partial pressures as follows SO 2 = 2.9 × 10 −7 , H 2 S= 9.4 × 10 −6 , and we assumed the ocean was saturated with sulfate (1.1 mole litre −1 ) with an ocean pH of 3 (i.e., 10 −3 mole). This results in a ∆G = 71.3 kJ mole −1 .</p><p>To summarize, using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> and the values P me = 7.04 × 10 −6 kJ g −1 s −1 at 290 K; F source = 3.0×10 17 molecule m −2 s −1 (or 5.0×10 −7 mole m −2 s −1 ); and ∆G = −71.3 kJ mol −1 , we find a surface biomass density of about 5.1 g m −2 . The total flux produced on an Earth-sized exoplanet would be 4.0 × 10 5 Tg yr −1 . This total flux is very high, on the order of 10 5 times more than H 2 S produced on Earth, and similar to the benchmark values for primary production of carbon on Earth.</p><p>A further challenge with H 2 S as a biosignature (or even as a geosignature) has to do with atmospheric photochemistry. As soon as H 2 S (or SO 2 ) is released into the atmosphere at an amount greater than 10 to 100 times Earth's current H 2 S or SO 2 surface flux, a blanket of aerosols or condensates form. These aerosols or condensates are present at optically thick amounts, potentially masking any H 2 S or SO 2 spectral features, depending on the particle size distribution.</p><p>As a side note we explain why we consider sulfur dioxide, SO 2 , is a failed potential biosignature gas, even though it is a gas produced by life. SO 2 as a Type I biosignature would result from the oxidation of sulfur or sulfides, via the reaction</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">S − 2 + 3[O] + 2H + → SO 2 + H 2 O (35) S + 2[O] → SO 2<label>(36)</label></formula><p>(where <ref type="bibr">[O]</ref> represents an oxidizing agent such as Fe 3+ or O 2 .) The resulting SO 2 would almost certainly be dissolved in water as sulfite; in an oxidized environment further energy would be generated from oxidizing sulfite to sulfate</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">SO 2− 3 + [O] → SO 2− 4 .<label>(37)</label></formula><p>So if the environment is sufficiently oxidizing to allow energy generation from sulfide oxidation, the end product is likely to be sulfate, not SO 2 . Furthermore, because SO 2 is geologically generated, it would be hard to distinguish from biogenic SO 2 . If there are oxidants available for life (i.e., there are oxidants available for life to use to oxidize sulfides for energy), then the crust and upper mantle will also be oxidized, and SO 2 will be a major volcanic gas. In summary, H 2 S is a potential biosignature gas as seen from the view of a biomass estimate, in a reduced atmosphere where H 2 S can accumulate. In general H 2 S is ruled out as detectable or identifiable as a biosignature gas because of its weak or H 2 O-contaminated spectral features and because of geological false positives.</p></div>

On Earth CH 3 Cl is thought to generated mostly by land soils (by plants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Keppler et al. 2005</ref>), changed from an earlier view that phytoplankton in the open ocean contributed most of the Earth's CH 3 Cl. On Earth, CH 3 Cl has a global production rate of between 2-12 Tg yr −1 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Ta- ble 1</ref> and references therein). Averaged over Earth's land mass, the CH 3 Cl translates into a source flux of 3.2 × 10 −12 mole m −2 s −1 . This value of source flux does not produce a detectable biosignature gas in the "Earth as an exoplanet spectrum", where CH 3 Cl has a mixing ratio of 1 ppb. For an Earth-like atmosphere around a low-UV quiet M dwarf, CH 3 Cl can accumulate up to 1 ppm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>For an Earth-like exoplanet atmosphere spectrum, CH 3 Cl is a difficult biosignature gas to detect because of its overlap with other spectral features, notably O 3 or CO 2 . As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. (2005)</ref>, the CH 3 Cl spectral feature at 9.3-10.3 µm coincides with the O 3 9.6 µm band, and would be difficult to identify, necessitating detection of CH 3 Cl features at 13-15 µm or a weaker feature near 7 µm. Under the conditions of a UV-quiet M star with low OH concentration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Segura et al. (2005)</ref> have shown that CH 3 Cl in an Earth-like atmosphere orbiting a quiet M dwarf can accumulate to 1 ppm. In an N 2 atmosphere with little CO 2 , CH 3 Cl would be easier to detect, but still difficult owing to even a tiny amount of atmospheric CO 2 .</p><p>With our framework for biomass estimates, we ask the question, "What biomass surface density of CH 3 Clproducing life is required to generate a detectable CH 3 Cl biosignature gas?" We answer the question for presentday Earth and for early-Earth conditions before the rise of atmospheric O 2 . We take a planet of Earth's size and mass with an Earth-mass atmosphere. The temperature profiles are self-consistently computed with photochemistry, and the semi-major axis of the planet is adjusted so that the surface temperature is kept at about 300 K.</p><p>For a planet with the present-day Earth atmosphere concentration, our detection metric ( §4.3) finds a 20 ppm mixing ratio at 13-14 µm on the short-wavelength wing of the 15 µm CO 2 band (note that in Earth's atmosphere, the CO 2 concentration is low enough not to fully saturate the 15 µm wing). The concentration of 20 ppm is 20,000 times more than Earth's current atmospheric concentration of CH 3 Cl, a value of 0.001 ppm. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref>. The Type III biomass equation scales linearly (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21)</ref>), so for all other atmospheric conditions being equal to the present-day Earth, the biomass must therefore be 20,000 times higher than the present day. By adopting the scaling relationship, we also assume that the 20 ppm concentration of CH 3 Cl is not enough to feed back on the dominant destructing molecule <ref type="bibr">[OH]</ref> concentration or to significantly effect the temperature-pressure profile.</p><p>Is it reasonable to imagine a world with a planet biomass surface density of CH 3 Cl-generating life 20,000 times higher than on Earth? If the conventional view that CH 3 Cl is produced overwhelmingly by oceanic plankton is adopted, then densities of tens of kg of phytoplankton per m −2 in the oceans would be required. If the more recent view that land plants are a major source of CH 3 Cl, then a 20,000-fold increase in biomass requires all the planet's land be covered with plants at a density not even achieved in the most intensively farmed land in the most favorable conditions. Neither seem plausible.</p><p>We can only escape from this conundrum if we assume that a much larger fraction of organisms on an exoplanet produce CH 3 Cl, or they produce it at a much higher rate than organisms on Earth. We have no reason for making such assumptions.</p><p>We now turn back to Earth's past, prior to the oxidation of Earth's atmosphere, with solar-like EUV conditions, where the CO 2 concentration was thought to be as high as 1% to 20% by volume ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Ohmoto et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>In an atmosphere with so much CO 2 , CH 3 Cl is much harder to detect than on present-day Earth because of overlap with the 15 µm CO 2 feature, the CH 3 Cl feature at 10 µm must be considered. A CH 3 Cl concentration of 1000 ppm would be needed (and barely detectable according to our detection metric), for either the 1% or 20% CO 2 atmosphere, requiring a surface biosignature gas source flux of 3.5 × 10 19 m −2 s −1 (or 5.8 × 10 −5 mole m −2 s −1 ). Although our photochemistry code does not yet self-consistently treat halogentated compounds, we computed this surface source flux by considering the loss rates: The source flux F source , is the production rate P integrated over an atmosphere column, and P is related to the loss rate L, (recall §4.1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">F source = z P = z [CH 3 Cl](z)L(z) = z [CH 3 Cl](z)[OH](z)K CH3Cl,OH (z),<label>(38)</label></formula><p>where <ref type="bibr">[OH]</ref> is the main reactive molecule that destroys CH 3 Cl.

The uncertainties in the Type III biomass estimate, however, should be considered.</p><p>To summarize this subsection, Type III biosignature gases are not produced in large quantities on Earth because they are specialized chemicals, each produced by a small number of species. Furthermore, collisional destruction by OH is rapid. Type III biosignature gases have shown to be detectable in low-UV environments, which as a consequence have less OH. We have shown that in order to reach levels detectable on present-day Earth, we can scale up the biomass estimates based on the concentration of the atmospheric gas required for detection, although in the case of CH 3 Cl this results in an implausible biomass surface density.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">On the Possible Terracentricity of the Biomass</head><p>Estimates A question arises as to the terracentricity of the biomass estimates, and whether or not we have interchanged the conventionally used Earth-based surface biofluxes with an Earth-based biomass model estimate.</p><p>For the Type I biosignature gases we argue no, because thermodynamics is universal. The Type I biosignature biomass model uses a prefactor A and an activation energy E A for the minimum maintenance energy rate P me equation. These parameters are lab-measured values for Earth-based microbes. A critical question is to what extent are A and E A specific to Earth life. A simple argument is that the particular repair mechanisms and molecular turnover involved in maintaining an organism are specific to Earth life, which is very unlikely to be exactly replicated on other worlds. There are stronger arguments, however, that the energy rate is more broadly applicable: P me follows Arrhenius' law, we think because the rate of molecular component damage (and hence repair rate) is no different than other chemical reactionswell described by an Arrhenius equation. E A , the activation energy of a reaction, represents the energy needed to break chemical bonds during the chemical reaction. In uncatalyzed reactions, E A comes from the thermal energy of the two reacting molecules, which itself follows from the Boltzmann velocity distribution. The probability that any two colliding molecules will have a combined energy greater than E A , is exp[−E A /RT ]. The parame-ter A is an efficiency factor that takes into account that molecules have to be correctly oriented in order to react. Thus the basic physics of the Arrhenius equation is general to all chemistry.</p><p>The argument for applying the Arrhenius equation to calculating P me starts with the point that terrestrial life is composed of many of the possible structures in CHON chemistry. The principle way that random chemical attack breaks those molecules down is through hydrolysis (attack by water) or oxidation (attack by oxygen) if oxygen is present. The A and E A terms in the equation for P me represent those relevant to the breakage of the most fragile of metabolites (as more stable molecules will not need to be repaired). Although the specific chemicals in non-terrestrial metabolism could be quite different from those on Earth, the nature of the chemical bonds will be similar. In particular, non-terrestrial biochemistry will be made up of chemicals that are moderately stable at ambient temperature and pressure, but not too stable. Thus the overall distribution of molecular stability in a non-terrestrial metabolism is likely to be similar to that in terrestrial metabolism, even if the chemical specifics differ. As a consequence, it is reasonable to propose that the rate of breakdown of those metabolites, and the rate at which energy is needed to repair them (i.e., P me ) will be of a similar order of magnitude as the rate of breakdown and energy requirement seen on Earth. Therefore A and E A are likely to be based on chemical principles and therefore similar to those calculated for Earth.</p><p>Turning to the terracentricity of the production rates for Type III biosignature gases, they are derived from lab measurements of each organism, and are likely to be specific to those organisms. The rates may, however, be plausible indications of the Type III fluxes to be expected from non-terrestrial life because the gas production represents investment of energy and mass for a speciaized biochemical function. The maximum flux rates used here represent the maximum investment that organisms make in these Type III gases, given essentialy unlimited energy and nutrient resources in a lab envirionment. We speculate that it is unlikely that non-terrestrial life would be more wasteful of resources through making any Type III biosignature gas at rates orders of magnitude greater than those used in this study.</p><p>The biomass surface density limits we use as a reference point are based on Earth data, and so are terracentric. We believe that adopting Earth values is an acceptable approximation in our model, as what limits Earth life in environments with abundant nutrition is the physics of mass transfer, not the specifics of how Earth life evolved. This, however, should be validated by future research.</p><p>We do not argue the biosignature biomass model estimates are accurate, rather we emphasize the goal of the biomass model estimate is the order of magnitude nature for a first order asssessment of the plausibility of a given biosignature gas candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Biomass Estimates in the Context of an Ecology</head><p>A serious criticism against the biomass estimate is lack of an ecology context. An ecology will contain organisms that consume gases as well as produce them. Hence the concern is that potential biosignature gases will be destroyed by life in the same ecosystem, rendering the biomass estimates invalid. Indeed the biomass estimate must be a minimum biomass estimate because there is no guarantee that biosignature gas flux (F source ) is not being consumed by other organisms.</p><p>The biomass estimate model is intended as a check on the plausibility of a specific gas as a biosignature gas. It is not intended to be a prediction of the ecology of another world. If the biomass estimate is low, then we have confirmed that the gas is plausible as a biosignature, given the caveats presented in §6.1 and §6.2 and discussed throughout this paper. In this low biomass estimate case, even if the planetary ecology has a mix of gas-producing and gas-consuming organisms, a net production of the gas from a moderate biomass is quite plausible. If the biomass estimate is too high, the gas is not a plausible biosignature gas in any ecology. For the intermediate case where a large but not unreasonable biomass is needed to generate a detectable biosignature, the decision on whether the gas is a plausible biosignature is more complicated, and will depend on the context: geochemistry, surface conditions, atmospheric composition and other factors.</p><p>In the future when we have spectra with candidate biosignature gas detections, in most cases we will assign a probability and not a certainty to a biosignature gas candidate. The biomass estimate, in the context of an ecology, will be just one of the input factors to the probability assessment. We give an example here to sketch out other factors to consider, which also bear weight on the ecology. The example is the question, how would we interpret the detection of 500 ppm CH 3 Cl in the atmosphere of an anoxic, Earth-like planet (well above the detectable amount according to our detection metric and assumed future telescope capabilities)? Our biomass model predicts that we would need a highly implausible surface biomass density to generate such an atmospheric concentration through metabolism. Volcanic chemistry on Earth produces traces of methyl chloride, but only as a tiny fraction of emitted gases, making a volcanic source seems also highly improbable. Conceivably the CH 3 Cl could be an industrial waste gas from a technological civilization, but in the absence of other signs of civilization this is also improbable. In this abstract sense, the conundrum of the intermediate biomass estiamte has no solution, but the plausibility of a biosignature gas is still addressable through Baysian statistics in principle, if the prior probabilities of the different assumptions about geochemical sources, biological sources or technological sources can be estimated. Our biomass model provides a numerical approach to quantifying the assumptions made concerning the potential biological production of a biosignature gas. Further work will integrate this into a model of our confidence that the detection of the gas represents a detection of life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Massive Atmospheres and the Biomass Estimates</head><p>In an atmosphere more massive than Earth's 1 bar atmosphere the biomass surface density estimates could be different, depending on the biosignature gas loss rate mechanism. In an atmosphere where the photochemical loss rates dominate, the biosignature source flux and hence biomass is the same as for a less massive atmosphere. In an atmosphere where the deposition rate is the dominant loss mechanism, the biosignature source flux and hence biomass surface density will scale linearly with planetary atmosphere mass. These conclusions are under the caveat that the surface pressure and temperature do not cause unusual chemistry (e.g., supercritical fluid or high chemical kinetic rates).</p><p>The biosignature source flux (i.e., production rate) is balanced by the loss rate, as described in equation <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Photochemical removal is only effective at and above the mbar pressure level in the atmosphere, because the UV radiation typically penetrates only down to the mbar level. The loss rate is therefore unaffected by how much atmosphere there is below the mbar pressure level: the mbar level can be "sitting on top of" a small atmosphere or a very large one. Hence the loss rate is the same (all other factors being equal) regardless of the total mass of the atmosphere. The loss rate is balanced by the source flux and hence the source flux needed to maintain a given concentration of gas in an atmosphere is unaffected by the mass of the atmosphere (assuming that there is no new, non-photochemical loss of gas at much higher pressures). Thus, against loss from photochemistry, the surface biomass density required to maintain a given gas concentration is the same regardless of atmospheric mass for any planet of a given surface area.</p><p>Loss by deposition, in contrast to loss by photochemical removal, occurs at the planetary surface. The loss rate at the surface is proportional to the number density of the biosignature gas at the surface (see equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref>) The number density of any well-mixed species scales as the surface pressure for an ideal gas atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium. We can estimate the surface gas concentration n ref by considering a uniformly mixed atmosphere and integrating over a vertical atmosphere column under hydrostatic equilibrium,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">p ref p0 dp = − z ref 0 gρdz,<label>(39)</label></formula><p>where p is pressure and g is surface gravity. Here we integrate from p = 0, z = 0 at the top of the atmosphere down to a reference pressure p ref at a reference altitude.</p><p>Integrating the above equation, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">p ref = gm atm ,<label>(40)</label></formula><p>where m atm is the atmospheric mass in a vertical column of 1 m 2 cross-sectional area. We can therefore define n atm by rewriting the column-integrated mass of the atmosphere in terms of number density and the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere µ atm m H (where µ is the mean molecular weight and m H is the mass of the hydrogen atom,</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">X i n ref = X i p ref kT = gm atm kT ,<label>(41)</label></formula><p>where X i is the mixing ratio of the gas under consideration.</p><p>We can now explain why, when surface deposition is the dominant gas loss mechanism, a larger biosignature surface density is required as an atmosphere mass scales up, even for a fixed atmospheric gas concentration. We see from equation (41) that the gas number density at the surface scales with the surface pressure p ref . The deposition velocity scales with the number density and hence surface pressure. With a higher loss rate that scales linearly with surface pressure, a higher source flux (production rate) is required to balance the loss rate. Because biomass scales linearly with source flux, a higher biomass surface density is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">False Positives</head><p>Type I biosignature gases are fraught with geologicallyproduced false positives because geological processess have the same chemicals to work with as life does. The redox reaction chemical energy gradients exploited by life are thermodynamically favorable but kinetically inhibited. Enzymes are used by life to accelerate the reaction. We can be sure that a chemical reaction that is kinetically inhibited in one environment on Earth could proceed spontaneously somewhere else on the planet (in an environment with a favorable temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations). Hence Type I biosignature gases will almost always have a possible geological origin.</p><p>Typically astronomers assume that the biosignature gas must be produced in high enough quantities that it couldn't be confused with a geophysical false positive. But how high of a surface flux could be produced geologically? We plan to model the maximal geofluxes possible for planets of different characteristics <ref type="bibr">(Stamenkovic and Seager, in prep.)</ref>, with the end goal of assigning a probability to the dominant Type I biosignature gases (H 2 S, CH 4 , CO, CO 2 , N 2 O, NO, NO 2 ) for being produced as biofluxes vs. geofluxes. More progress might also be made with biogeochemical cycles and the whole atmosphere context via other atmospheric diagnostics.</p><p>False positives for O 2 , the most obvious Type II biosignature gas in an oxidizing environment, are limited and can most likely be identified by other atmospheric diagnostics. For example, photodissociation of water vapor in a runaway greenhouse with H escaping to space could lead up to detectable O 2 levels. This situation could be identified by an atmosphere heavily saturated with water vapor. O 2 could also accumulate in a dry, CO 2 -rich planet with weak geochemical sinks for O 2 , a case which could be identified via weak H 2 O features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Selsis et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Segura et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Type III biosignature gases, in contrast to Type I biosignature gases, are less likely to have false positives. Type III biosignature gases are chemicals produced by life for reasons other than energy capture and are not usually naturally existing in the environment. As byproduct gases of highly specialized physiological processes, the Type III biosignature gases tend to be larger or more complex molecules than Type I biosignature gases, and are not usually replicated by nonbiological processes. In general, the more complicated a molecule is (i.e., the more atoms it has) and the further from fully oxidized or reduced the molecule is, the less are produced by geological sources as compared to more simple molecules. For example, volcanoes produce large quantities of CO 2 , somewhat smaller amounts of CH 4 , small amounts of OCS, trace amounts of CH 3 SH, and none of isoprene. The downside to Type III biosignatures is that because they are usually such specialized compounds they typically are produced in small quantities that do not accumulate to levels detectable by remote sensing.</p><p>For Type III biosignature gases we should therefore depart from requiring huge concentrations in the atmosphere. But, as we have seen, detectable atmospheric concentrations are almost by definition high concentration.</p><p>Light isotopes are used to identify biologicallyproduced molecules on Earth.</p><p>For exoplanets, no planned telescope will allow molecular isotopes to be observationally distinguished from one another. In the distant future when isotopic ratios of molecules are observable, care has to be taken to understand the isotopic distribution of all key molecules in the environment. In particular the isotopic ratios of the input gases must be different than the biologically output gases. The isotopic ratios of both the input and output gases need to be inventoried, because exoplanets may have varying natural distributions of isotopic ratios not seen on Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Aerosols and Hazes</head><p>The view in biosignature gas studies is to find a biosignature gas that exists in concentrations of orders of magnitude above the naturally occuring values. This picture may supercede the goal to find biosignature gases that are out of redox equilibrium (such as O 2 and CH 4 ) because while both might exist they might not both be in high enough quantities to be detectable remotely.</p><p>For a biosignature gas produced orders of magnitude higher than natural values, how much is too much? We have seen from our H 2 S study ( §5.4) that when H 2 S is emitted from the surface at an amount greater than 10 to 100 times Earth's current H 2 S or SO 2 surface flux, a blanket of aerosols or condensates form ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hu et al. 2013</ref>). These aerosols or condensates are present at optically thick amounts, masking any H 2 S or SO 2 spectral features. The particle size partially dictates the optical properties of the aerosols, and hence which wavelengths the spectral features will be washed out.</p><p>Aerosol formation by CH 4 photolysis in N 2 -CO 2 atmospheres are expected to be significant when methane reaches 5,000 ppmv ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Haqq-Misra et al. 2008</ref>). There are two effects if aerosol formation is significant. First, aerosols may be a net loss for CH 4 , leading to a decreasing marginal gain in atmospheric CH 4 concentration for increasing CH 4 emission. Second, aerosols may impede CH 4 detection. As an aside we point out a basic assumption in the haze formation model used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Haqq-Misra et al. (2008)</ref> that could be improved upon: a treatment of all hydrocarbons higher than C 4 as solid particles when they might be in the gas phase makes hazes easier to form. NH 3 emission itself does not lead to aerosol formation, as NH 3 is readily converted to N 2 by photolysis.</p><p>The situation for DMS is virtually the same as H 2 S and SO 2 . Sulfur in the terrestrial atmosphere is likely to end up as aerosols (S 8 and H 2 SO 4 , for H 2 S and SO 2 respectively). The reason is that S 8 and H 2 SO 4 are relatively easy to form from sulfur gas compounds, and they have relatively low vapor pressures enabling aerosol formation at Earth atmospheric temperatures (see Seinfeld &amp; Pandis 2000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7.">Subsurface Life</head><p>If the surface of a planet is not habitable, could the subsurface harbor life? On Earth, there is substantial subsurface life, but its effect on the atmosphere is limited. On Earth, surface life will likely use any product of subsurface life as a food source, generating the characteristic biosignature gas of the surface life. Thus H 2 S or CH 4 emitted by subsurface life on Earth is (largely) oxidized at the surface, and so does not accumulate in the atmosphere.</p><p>If the surface is not habitable, however, then any subsurface biological activity will eventually affect the surface, just as surface biology on Earth eventually oxidized the stratopshere. In the absence of surface life, subsurface life biosignature gases will diffuse to the surface and then escape. (The methane on Mars may be an example of this). If Mars had surface life, then that surface life would "eat" all the methane, and none would accumulate in the atmosphere. Thus our model is applicable to the biomass of subsurface life as well as surface life, with the caveat that we do not know what a plausible upper boundary on the density of subsurface life is.</p><p>There remains the problem that subsurface life will generate gases that are just absorbed by the surrounding material (rock, ice, or water). If life is too deep (as life in the internal oceans of the Gallilean moons would be, if there is any) then biosignature gases would take geological time to reach the surface, and would be chemically transformed by the interposed geology (rocky or icy) in the process. In other words, if life is deep, the rock will only saturate on geological timescales, and over that time any biosignature will be chemically converted to other substances. If life is subsurface but shallow, rocks will become saturated with biosignature gases in a short timescale and the biosignature may then be outgassed to the atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.8.">Life on Titan: Ruled Out by Biomass Calculations?</head><p>It has been speculated that anomalies in the atmosphere of Titan could be signs of surface life. With substantial caveats, we can apply the biomass model to test the plausibility of Titanian life. Acetylene is not detected on the surface of Titan, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Clark et al. (2010)</ref>, although some models suggest that acetylene should be more abundant on the surface than benzene, which was detected. There is an apparent deficit of acetylene on Titan's surface, because acetylene was detected in Titan's atmosphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Strobel (2010)</ref> modeled the atmosphere of Titan, and predicted a tropospheric deficit of H 2 in Titan's atmosphere, compared to stratospheric levels, implying a downward flux of H 2 of the order of 2 × 10 14 m −2 s −1 . Several authors have speculated this is a sign of life on Titan (see e.g., Norman 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Seager et al. 2012)</ref> 10 , deriving energy from either of the following reactions, C 2 H 2 + 2H 2 → C 2 H 6 ∆G 0 = −242 kJ mole −1 (42) C 2 H 2 + 3H 2 → 2CH 4 ∆G 0 = −375 kJ mole −1 . <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(43)</ref> We can test the hypothesis that the acetylene deficit is a biosignature gas using the Type I biomass model. Life on Titan could live on the surface, using liquid methane as a solvent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bains 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">McKay &amp; Smith 2005)</ref>, or near the surface, or in the deep interior using water as a solvent. Life in liquid methane/ethane at ∼100 K must have radically different chemistry from terrestrial life; it is almost inevitable that the biomass model in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> will not be valid for such different biochemistry. Specifically, we might expect the constant A term in the minimal maintenance energy rate equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> to be lower for liquid methane life. The major source of damage for terrestrial biomolecules is attack by water, which will be much slower when the molecules are not dissolved in water. While we have no idea how much smaller A should be, we can, however, still attempt to apply equation (11) to predict the minimum biomass necessary to generate a biosignature gas. If on Titan the P me constant A is smaller than on Earth, then from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>, the minimal maintenance energy rate P me will be smaller (at a given temperature), and so from equation (11) our biomass estimate will be larger.</p><p>If hydrogen and acetylene are being consumed by water-based life on Titan today, then that life must be near the surface. Water near the surface would freeze to a eutectic of whatever solutes are present in the internal ocean-as these are unknown, we have assumed a water/ammonia eutectic with a freezing point of 176 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Leliwa-Kopysty´nskiKopysty´nski et al. 2002)</ref>. The deeply buried "internal ocean" is likely to be warmer, but is too deeply buried to account for a high surface flux of hydrogen (Fortes 2012); however we include a calculation for a saturated freezing brine at 252 K for comparison.</p><p>The flux of H 2 downwards is proposed to be 2 × 10 14 m −2 s −1 = 3.3 × 10 −10 mole m −2 s −1 . The surface concentration of acetylene is taken to be 0.15 mM in water <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(McAuliffe 1966)</ref>, in the methane/ethane lakes acetylene concentration is taken to be the same as its mixing ratio in the higher atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Strobel 2010)</ref>. Hydrogen, methane, and ethane are assumed to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Given these constraints, the biomass calculations for the three conditions mentioned above and the two reactions are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 8</ref>.</p><p>The values for the biomass predicted for life in liquid methane/ethane are clearly far too high to be in any way acceptable or plausible. We therefore have reason to doubt that life that uses chemistry similar to terrestrial life in liquid methane is generating the hydrogen deficit on Titan. An obvious caveat is that equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> based on terrestrial, carbon/water-based life: life operating at 100 K will have radically different, and probably more fragile, chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bains 2004</ref>), and hence different constants in equation <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>.</p><p>Life in near-surface water "only" requires a Titancovering layer between ∼1 and 1.5 m thick, equivalent to a modern cabbage farm. A Titan-wide layer of life 1.5 m thick implies a near-surface water layer of at least this thickness across the whole moon, or a thicker layer concentrated in specific regions of the moon, One would have thought that evidence of this would have been detected by IR spectrometry, which it is not ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Clark et al. 2010</ref>). Again our model suggests that near-surface life is not the sink for atmospheric hydrogen.</p><p>Only a modest density of living matter is needed to explain the hydrogen flux if life is present in freezing brine. However if freezing brine is present, it will be buried under a 100 km thick layer of ice. It is unlikely that gases could exchange with the atmosphere through an ice shell of this sort fast enough to explain the apparent deficit of hydrogen in Titan's atmosphere.</p><p>This speculative application of the biomass model illustrates that the model can be used to rule out Earth-like life in some circumstances that are quite unlike Earth. As noted in §6.2, there is good reason for our model to apply to other biochemistries based on C, O, N, P, and S. If life on Titan is based on radically different chemistry that Earth's biochemistry, then the constants in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> will be different, and our model will not accurately predict biomass requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">SUMMARY</head><p>We have created a framework for linking biosignature gas detectability to biomass surface density estimates. This enables us to consider different environments and different biosignature gases than are present on Earth. This liberates predictive atmosphere models from requiring fixed, terracentric biosignature gas source fluxes. We have validated the models on terrestrial production of N 2 O/NO, H 2 S, CH 4 , and CH 3 Cl. We have applied the models to the plausibility of NH 3 as a biosignature gas in a reduced atmosphere, to CH 4 on early Earth and present day Mars, discussed H 2 S as an unlikely biosignature gas, and ruled out CH 3 Cl as a biosignature gas on Earth or early Earth.</p><p>We presented a biosignature gas classification (described in §2), needed as a precursor to develop classspecific biomass model estimates. The relevant summary point is that Type I biosignature gases-the byproduct gases produced from metabolic reactions that capture energy from environmental redox chemical potential energy gradients-are likely to be abundant but always fraught with false positives. Abundant because they are created from chemicals that are plentiful in the environment. Fraught with false positives because not only does geology have the same molecules to work with as life does, but in one environment where a given redox reaction will be kinetically inhibited and thus proceed only when activated by life's enzymes, in another environment with the right conditions (temperature, pressure, concentration, and acidity) the same reaction might proceed spontaneously. In contrast to Type I biosignature gases, Type III biosignature gases-as chemicals produced by life for reasons other than energy capture or the construction of the basic components of life-are generally expected to be produced in smaller quantities, but will have a wider variety and much lower possibility of false positives as compared to Type I biosignature gases. These qualities are because Type III biosignature gases are are produced for organism-specific reasons and are highly specialized chemicals not directly tied to the local chemical environment and thermodynamics.</p><p>Model caveats are related to the order of magnitude nature of the biomass estimates, the possible terracentricity of the biomass model estimates, and the lack of ecosystem context.</p><p>Exoplanets will have planetary environments and biologies substantially different from Earth's, an argument based on the stochastic nature of planet formation and on the observed variety of planet masses, radii, and orbits. The biomass model estimates are intended to be a step towards a more general framework for biosignature gases, enabling the move beyond the dominant terracentric gases. We hope this new approach will help ensure that out of the handful of anticpated potentially habitable worlds suitable for followup spectral observations, we can broaden our chances to identify an inhab-    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>7</head><label>7</label><figDesc>Reaction rates with H, OH, and O of select Type-III biosignature gases.

Our photochemistry model shows that methane can accumulate to a mixing ratio of 220 ppm in the atmosphere and that the major photochemical product is H 2 having a mixing ratio of 40 ppm and CO having a mixing ratio of 18 ppm.</figDesc></figure>

To compute the ∆G value we used the reactant and product molecule concentrations at the surface in terms of partial pressures as follows. For the CO 2 case of 0.01 we used H 2 = 3.9 × 10 −5 , CH 4 = 2.2 × 10 −4 , H 2 O = 0.01, and this results in a ∆G = 47.4 kJ mole −1 . In the CO 2 of 0.20 case we used H 2 = 1 × 10 −5 , CH 4 = 2.5 × 10 −4 , and H 2 O = 0.01, and this results in a ∆G = 41.2 kJ mole −1 .</figDesc></figure>

However dormant and dead organsims will not be significant generators of biosignature gases, and so we are not interested in them for our present study. Equally, we are not interested in dormant organisms&apos; lower energy requirements.</note>
