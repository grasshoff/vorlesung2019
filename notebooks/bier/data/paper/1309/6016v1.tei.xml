			<abstract>
				<p>Super Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency and some will be able to retain stable H 2-dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H 2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, by using a model atmosphere with photochemistry, and biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibilty of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H 2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO 2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulation of detectable biosignature gases in an H 2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as DMS and CH 3 Cl are therefore more favorable in low UV, as compared to solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH 3 and N 2 O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH 4 , H 2 S, are not effective signs of life in an H 2-rich atmosphere, because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H 2-rich atmospheres for super Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The detection of exoplanet atmospheric biosignature gases by remote sensing spectroscopy is usually taken as inevitable for the future of exoplanets. This sentiment is being borne out with the discovery of increasing numbers of smaller and lower mass planets each year. In addition, the natural evolution to development of larger and more sophisticated telescopes (such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) slated for launch in 2018, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gardner et al. (2006)</ref>) and the giant 20-to 40-meter class ground-based telescopes 1 continues to fuel the concept that the eventual detection and study of biosignature gases is a near certainty.</p><p>The topic of biosignature gases, however, may remain a futuristic one unless a number of extreme challenges can be overcome. The biggest near-term challenge is to find a large enough pool of potentially habitable exoplanets accessible for followup atmosphere study 2 . By potentially habitable we mean rocky planets with surface liquid water, and not those with massive envelopes making any planet surface too hot for complex molecules required for life. The large pool of such planets is needed because there could be a large difference in the numbers of seemingly potentially habitable planets (based on their measured host star type, orbit, and mass or size <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The</head><p>Extremely Large Telescope (http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/e-elt.html), the Giant Magellan Telescope (http://www.gmto.org/), and the Thirty Meter Telescope (http://www.tmt.org/). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For example the all-sky space-based TESS mission (Transting Exoplanet Planet Survey Satellite, PI George Ricker) has been selected under NASA's Astrophysics Explorer Program for launch in 2017. and inferred surface temperature) and those that are inhabited by life that produces useful biosignature gases (which will be inferred from measured atmospheric spectra). Useful biosignature gases means those that can accumulate in the planet atmosphere, are spectroscopically active, and are not overly contaminated by geophysical false positives. A contemporary, related point on identifying a large enough pool of planets is that even the fraction of small or low-mass planets that are potentially habitable-that is with surface conditions suitable for liquid water-is not yet known. The reason is that the factors controlling a given planet's surface temperatures are themselves not yet observed or known, including the atmosphere mass (and surface pressure), the atmospheric composition, and hence the concomitant greenhouse gas potency (see the review by Seager 2013).</p><p>A second major challenge for the study of biosignature gases is the capability of telescopes to robustly detect molecules in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. This challenge is continously faced in today's hot Jupiter atmosphere studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Seager 2010)</ref>, where many atmospheric molecular detections based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope or the Spitzer Space Telescope remain controversial (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deming et al. 2013</ref>, and references therein). For transiting planets, the ability to identify and remove systematics to a highly precise level while adding together numerous transit events from different epochs is a necessity to reach the small signals of terrestrial planet atmospheres. For directly imaged planets, the ability to reach down to Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits is one of the most substantial technological challenges to ever face astronomers. While technology development is ongoing, there are as yet no solid plans to launch a space telescope capable of directly imaging terrestrial-size planets.</p><p>A third major challenge in the study of biosignature gases has to do with the geological false positive signatures. These false positives are gases that are produced geologically and emitted by volcanoes or vents in the crust or ocean. Geochemistry has the same chemicals to work with that life does, and therefore false positives are inevitable. While early theoretical studies favored detection of redox disequilibrium (such as O <ref type="bibr">2</ref> and CH 4 ) that should not both exist in an atmosphere in photochemical steady state, often one molecule of the set is too weak spectroscopically for potential detection. The conventionally adopted approach (at least in theoretical studies) is therefore to identify a biosignature gas that is many orders of magnitude out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the expected gas composition of the atmosphere and to study the gas in the context of the planet atmosphere environment via atmospheric spectra that cover a wide wavelength range. A more likely outcome to the field of biosignature gases will be to develop probabilistic assessment of the likelihood a molecule in a given atmosphere can be attributed to life, because spectroscopic data and the information for a complete assessment of the planetary environment will be limited.</p><p>To increase the chances of detecting exoplanet atmospheric biosignature gases we are motivated to widen the parameter space of types of planets where biosignature gases can accumulate and should be sought out observationally. We here describe, for the first time to our knowledge, the case for and against biosignature gases in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Some massive enough or cold enough super Earths (loosely defined as planets with up to 10 Earth masses) will be able to retain hydrogen in their atmospheres (see the discussion in §5.2). In general, planets are expected to outgas or capture hydrogen from the nebula during planet formation. Here we are concerned with super Earths with relatively thin hydrogen atmospheres and not planets with massive atmospheres or envelopes (as in mini-Neptunes) which will have surfaces too hot for liquid water (Rogers and Seager, in prep.) or may not even have a surface. A thin hydrogen atmosphere does not add much to either the mass or the size of the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2008</ref>), so that an H 2 -rich atmosphere itself does not aid in planet discovery or detection.</p><p>Super Earths with H 2 -rich atmospheres are nonetheless in some ways more favorable for detection and study than their terrestrial planet counterparts with N 2 -or CO 2 -dominated atmospheres. A more massive planet than Earth (i.e., more likely to retain atmospheric H 2 than Earth) is easier to discover than an Earth-mass planet via the radial velocity technique. A more massive planet than Earth is also larger and so easier to discover or detect by the transit technique than a lower-mass planet. For example a 10 M ⊕ planet of Earth-like composition would have a radius 1.75 times larger than Earth (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. 2007</ref>). The larger planet area is more favorable for atmosphere study in reflected or thermally emitted radiation than an Earth-size planet. For transit transmission spectra, planets with H 2 -rich atmospheres have a much larger signal compared to H-poor atmospheres because of the larger scale height H, based on the mean molecular weight µ (e.g., Seager 2010),</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H = kT µm H g ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, m H is the mass of the hydrogen atom, and g is the surface gravity. The point is that when H 2 dominates the atmospheric composition over terrestrial planet atmosphere gases CO 2 and N 2 , the mean molecular weight is ∼20 times smaller and hence the scale height is ∼20 times larger. The observational imprint of an atmosphere is usually taken as about 5H. Turning back to biosignature gases, they have been studied theoretically as indicators of life on planets with oxidized atmospheres for over half a century, beginning with <ref type="bibr">Lederberg (1965)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lovelock (1965)</ref>. One highlight from the last decade is the realization that low UV radiation environments compared to solar lead to a much higher concentration of biosignature gases, as studied for Earth-like planet atmospheres. This is because the stellar UV creates the radical OH (in some cases O) which destroys many gases in the atmosphere and thus reduces the gas lifetime. A low UV radiation environment is taken to be that of a planet orbiting a UV quiet M dwarf star (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and discussion in §5.6).</p><p>A second highlight in biosignature gas research in the last decade is the theoretical exploration of potential biosignature gases beyond the conventionally considered dominant Earth or early Earth based ones of O 2 , O 3 , N 2 O, and CH 4 . The variations studied include dimethylsulfide (DMS; Pilcher 2003), methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2005</ref>), and other sulfur compounds including CS 2 and COS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2011)</ref>. See Seager et al. (2012) for a review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> for a biosignature gas classification scheme, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> for a biomass model estimate intended as a plausability check to consider biosignature gas surface fluxes different from Earth values.</p><p>We begin with a description of our atmosphere and biomass estimate model in §2. We present general results in §3 and specific results for a number of potential and unlikely biosignature gases in §4. A discussion in §5 is followed by a summary and conclusion in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODEL</head><p>The model goal is to computationally generate atmospheric spectra for exoplanets with H 2 -rich atmospheres with biosignature gases. The model consistes of a photochemistry code which takes biosignature gases as surface fluxes, an approximate temperature profile calculation, and a line-by-line spectral calculation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). The model also uses a biomass model estimate, to check whether or not a biosignature gas could be the result of a plausible surface ecology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Model Atmosphere Photochemistry Model</head><p>The focus on chemistry is critical for biosignature gases, because sinks control a biosignature gas lifetime and hence the gas' potential to accumulate in the planetary atmosphere. A model for atmospheric chemistry is required to connect the amount of biosignature gas in the atmosphere (as required for detection) to the biosignature source flux at the planetary surface. , and a theoretically simulated quiet M dwarf star with an effective temperature of 3000 K with no chromospheric emission. The flux is scaled so that the planet has a surface temperature of 290 K. The spectrum of the sun-like star is from the Air Mass Zero reference spectrum during a solar quiet period (http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am0/). The spectrum of GJ 1214 contains two parts: for wavelengths shorter than 300 nm we take the most recent HST measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(France et al. 2013</ref>), for wavelengths longer than 300 nm we take the NextGen simulated spectrum for an M dwarf star having parameters closest to those of GJ 1214 (i.e., effective temperature of 3000 K, surface gravity log(g) = 5.0, and metallicity = 0.5). The spectrum with no chromospheric emission is also from the NextGen model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allard et al. 1997)</ref>. Under the common definition of weakly active, or relatively quiet M dwarf, the UV environment in its habitable zone can differ by more than six orders of magnitude.</p><p>Our photochemical model is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>. The photochemical code computes the steadystate chemical composition of an exoplanetary atmosphere. The system can be described by a set of timedependent continuity equations, one equation for species at each altitude. Each equation describes: chemical production; chemical loss; eddy diffusion and molecular diffusion (contributing to production or loss); sedimentation (for aerosols only); emission and dry deposition at the lower boundary; and diffusion-limited atmospheric escape for light species at the upper boundary. The code includes 111 species, 824 chemical reactions, and 71 photochemical reactions. Starting from an initial state, the system is numerically evolved to the steady state in which the number densities no longer change.</p><p>The generic model computes chemical and photochemical reactions among all O, H, N, C, S species, and formation of sulfur and sulfate aerosols. The numerical code is designed to have the flexibility of choosing a subset of species and reactions in the computation. The code therefore has the ability to treat both oxidized and reduced conditions, by allowing selection of "fast species". For the chemical and photochemical reactions, we use the most up-to-date reaction rates data from both the NIST database (http://kinetics.nist.gov) and the JPL publication ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sander et al. 2011</ref>). Ultraviolet and visible radiation in the atmosphere is computed by the δ-Eddington two-stream method with molecular absorption, Rayleigh scattering and aerosol Mie scattering contributing to the optical depth. The model was developed from the ground-up and has been tested and validated by reproducing the atmospheric composition of Earth and Mars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hu 2013</ref>).</p><p>For biosignature gases that are minor chemical perturbers in the atmosphere, the biosignature lifetime can be estimated based on the abundance of the major chemical sink. For this paper, the values of NH 3 and N 2 O surface source fluxes are calculated from the full photochemistry model, whereas the calculations of surface source fluxes for other biosignature gases are simplified estimates. One more point to note is that photochemistry is relevant high in the atmosphere typically above mbar levels to which stellar UV radiation can penetrate from above.</p><p>Temperature-Pressure Profile The precise temperaturepressure structure of the atmosphere is less important than photochemistry for a first-order description of biosignatures in H 2 -rich atmospheres. The reason is that most biosignature gases of interest have sources and sinks not signficantly affected by minor deviations in the temperature pressure profile. Morever the biosignature gases themselves are secondary players in governing the heating structure of the atmosphere.</p><p>We therefore justify using the photochemistry model in a stand-alone mode, with a pre-calculated temperaturepressure profile. The calculated temperature-pressure profile is approximate and is one which assumes a surface temperature (e.g., 290 K), an appropriate adiabatic lapse rate for H 2 -rich compositions, and a constant temperature above the convective layer of the atmosphere. Such assumed temperature profiles are consistent with greenhouse warming in the troposphere and lack of ultraviolet absorber in the stratosphere. The semi-major axis of the planet is then derived based on the assumed temperature profile by balancing the energy flux of incoming stellar radiation and outgoing planetary thermal emission. The details of this procedure are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Synthetic Spectra To generate exoplanet transmission and thermal emission spectra, we use a lineby-line radiative transfer code <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). Opacities are based on molecular absorption with cross sections computed based on data from the HITRAN 2008 database ( <ref type="bibr">Rothman et al. 2009</ref>), molecular collisioninduced absorption when necessary (e.g., Borysow 2002), Rayleigh scattering, and aerosol extinction computed based on Mie theory. The atmospheric transmission is computed for each wavelength by integrating the optical depth along the limb path (as outlined in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miller-Ricci et al. 2009</ref>). The planetary thermal emission is computed by integrating the radiative transfer equation without scattering for each wavelength (e.g., Seager 2010).</p><p>We consider clouds in the emergent spectra for thermal emission by considering 50% cloud coverage by averaging a cloudy and cloud-free spectra. We omit clouds for the transmission spectra model because the clouds are at low altitudes whereas the spectral features form at high altitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Biomass Model Estimates</head><p>A biomass model estimate has been developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> that ties biomass surface density to a given biosignature gas surface source flux. The motivating rationale is that with a biomass estimate, biosignature gas source fluxes can be free parameters in model predictions, by giving a physical plausibility check in terms of reasonable biomass. The approach aims to enable consideration of a wide variety of both gas species and their atmospheric concentration to be considered in biosignature model predictions. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude. We provide a summary of the biomass model here with the full details available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>The biomass model is used in the following algorithm. First we calculate the amount of biosignature gas required to be present at "detectable" levels in an exoplanet atmosphere from a theoretical spectrum (we define a detection metric in §2.3). Second, we determine the gas source flux necessary to produce the atmospheric biosignature gas in the required atmospheric concentration. The biosignature gas atmospheric concentration is a function not only of the gas surface source flux, but also of other atmospheric and surface sources and sinks. Third, we estimate the biomass that could produce the necessary biosignature gas source flux. Fourth, we consider whether the estimated biomass surface density is physically plausible, by comparison to maximum terrestrial biomass surface density values and total plausible surface biofluxes.</p><p>Based on life on Earth, a summary overview is that a biomass surface density of 10 g m −2 is sensible, 100 g m −2 is plausible, and 5000 g m −2 is possible. In real situations, the total biomass is nearly always limited by energy, bulk nutrients (carbon, nitrogen), trace nutrients (iron, etc.) or all three. Regarding global surface biofluxes we provide values and references where needed in our results and discussion.</p><p>The biomass model estimates are tied to the type of biosignature gas and so we briefly summarize our biosignature classification scheme before discussion each biomass model estimate.</p><p>Type I biosignature gases are generated as byproduct gases from microbial energy extraction. For example, on Earth many microbes extract energy from chemical energy gradients using the abundant atmospheric O 2 for aerobic oxidation, </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X + O 2 → oxidized X.<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 2 + X → reduced X.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The oxidant must come from the interior. In other words, for chemical potential energy gradients to exist on a planet with an H 2 -rich atmosphere, the planetary crust must (in part) be oxidized in order to enable a redox couple with the reduced atmosphere. The byproduct is always a reduced gas, because in a reducing environment H 2 -rich compounds are the available reductants. To be more specific, oxidants would include gases such as CO 2 and SO 2 .</p><p>The Type I biosignature gas biomass model is based on thermodynamics and is derived from conservation of energy and discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref>. The biomass model estimate is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σ B ≃ ∆G F source P me .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here Σ B is the biomass surface density in g m −2 , ∆G is the Gibbs Free energy of the chemical redox reaction from which energy is extracted (e.g., equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>). ∆G depends on the standard free energy of reaction (∆G 0 ), and the concentration of the reactants and products. Reactant and product concentrations can include ocean pH (concentration of H + ) in reactions that generate or consume protons. ∆G 0 values are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amend &amp; Shock (2001)</ref>. The term P me is an empirically determined microbial maintenance energy consumption rate, that is, the minimum amount of energy an organism needs per unit time to survive in an active state (i.e., a state in which the organism is ready to grow). An empirical relation has been identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tijhuis et al. (1993)</ref> that follows an Arrhenius law</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P me = A exp −E A RT .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Here E A = 6.94 × 10 4 kJ mol −1 is the activation energy, R = 8.314 kJ mol −1 K −1 is the universal gas constant, and T in units of K is the temperature. The constant A is 4.3 × 10 7 kJ g −1 s −1 for aerobic growth and 2.5 × 10 7 kJ g −1 s −1 for anaerobic growth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tijhuis et al. 1993</ref>).</p><p>Here per g refers to per g of wet weight of the organism. P me is in units of kJ g −1 s −1 . The free parameter in this biomass model estimate (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref>) is the biosignature gas source flux F source (in units of mole m −2 s −1 ). F source is the flux of the metabolic byproduct and is also the surface bioflux required to generate a given biosignature gas concentration in the atmosphere.</p><p>Type II biosignature gases are byproduct gases produced by the metabolic reactions for biomass building, and require energy. On Earth these are reactions that capture environmental carbon (and to a lesser extent other elements) in biomass. Type II biosignature reactions are energy-consuming, and on Earth the energy comes from sunlight via photosynthesis.</p><p>There is no useful biomass model for Type II biosignature gases because once the biomass is built a Type II biosignature gas is no longer generated.</p><p>Type III biosignature gases are produced by life but not as byproducts of their central chemical functions. Type III biosignature gases appear to be special to particular species or groups of organisms, and require energy for their production. Because the chemical nature and amount released for Type III biosignature gases are not linked to the local chemistry and thermodynamics, the Type III biosignature gas biomass model is an estimate based on lab culture production rates.</p><p>We estimate the biomass surface density by taking the biosignature gas source flux F source (in units of mole m −2 s −1 ) divided by the mean gas production rate in the lab R lab (in units of mole g −1 s −1 ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Σ B ≃ F source R lab .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>We take the maximum observed for the Type III R lab rates F field values from different studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. 2013</ref>). The caveat of the Type III biomass estimate explicitly assumes that the range of R for life on exoplanets is similar to that for life in Earth's lab environment.</p><p>Nonetheless we have showed based on Earth's values that the Type III biomass model is valid to one or two orders of magnitude. The goal, again, is to use the biomass estimate to argue for or against plausibilty of a biosignature gas based on Earth's biomass surface density values and not for any prediction of quantitative values.</p><p>Bioindicators are defined as the end product of chemical reactions of a biosignature gas.</p><p>Model caveats are related to the order of magnitude nature of the biomass estimates, the possible terracentricity of the biomass model estimates, and the lack of ecosystem context (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> §6.1, 6.2, 6.3 for a detailed discussion). Here we provide a summary overview.</p><p>The order of magnitude nature of the Type I biomass estimate derives from the dependency of the estimate on P me , itself very sensitive to temperature. The possible terracentricity of our estimates is related to use of P me , which is derived from observations of terrestrial microorganisms, but we argue the dependency is largely on thermodynamics ). The order of magnitude nature of the Type III biosignatures derives the reliance on laboratory rates for microbial production rates, and this is also possibly a terracentricity issue.</p><p>The lack of ecosystem context is a major limitation for the biomass estimate. An ecosystem contains not only the producers (i.e., the biomass estimate derived ultimately from the bioflux F source ) but also consumers, whereas the biomass model estimate considers only the producers. In this sense the biomass estimate in equation (4) is a minimum. We can fairly say that in the case of a very small or very large biomass estimate, the assessment of biosignature gas plausibility is valid: a small biomass estimate gives room for consumers even as a minimum biomass and a large biomass estimate as a minimum will remain large regardless of the consumers. For the intermediate case where a large but not unreasonable biomass is needed to generate a detectable biosignature, the decision on whether the gas is a plausible biosignature is more complicated, and will depend on the planetary context: geochemistry, surface conditions, atmospheric composition and other factors.</p><p>Again, we do not argue the biosignature biomass model estimates are an accurate prediction of an extraterrestrial ecology, rather we emphasize the goal of the biomass model estimates is the order of magnitude nature for a first order asssessment of the plausability of a given biosignature gas candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Detection Metric</head><p>We now describe our metric for a "detection" that leads to a required biosignature gas concentration. For now, the detection has to be a theoretical exercise using synthetic data. We determine the required biosignature gas concentration based on a spectral feature detection with a SNR=10. Specifically, we describe the SNR of the spectral feature as the difference between the flux in the absorption feature and the flux in the surrounding continuum (on either side of the feature) taking into account the uncertainties on the data,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">SNR = |F out − F in | σ 2 Fout + σ 2 Fin ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where F in ± σ Fin is the flux density inside the absorption feature and F out ± σ Fout is the flux density in the surrounding continuum, and σ is the uncertainty on the measurement.</p><p>The uncertainties of the in-feature flux and continuum flux are calculated for limiting scenarios. For thermal emission we consider a futuristic space telescope able to block out the light of the host star. The uncertainties of the in-feature flux and continuum flux are calculated for a limiting scenario: an 1.75 times Earth-sized planet orbiting a star 3 at 10 pc observed (via direct imaging) with a 6 m-diameter telescope mirror operating within 50% of the shot noise limit and a quantum efficiency of 20%. The integration time is assumed to be 20 hours. We note that collecting area, observational integration time, and source distance are interchangeable depending on the time-dependent observational systematics. This telecope scenario is based on a TPF-I type telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lawson et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>For transit transmission spectra, we use the same equation as above, but with the denominator replaced by the noise in the stellar flux (F * ), as in (4σ 2 F ), because transmission observations measure the difference between the in-transit stellar flux and out-of-transit stellar flux. For transmission spectra we consider a 6.5-m space telescope, having quantum efficiency of 0.25 observing with 50% photon noise limit, with integration time of 60 hours in-transit and 60 hours out-of-transit (assuming observing of multiple transits).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHOTOCHEMICALLY-PRODUCED REACTIVE SPECIES IN H 2 -RICH ATMOSPHERES</head><p>In an H 2 -rich terrestrial exoplanet atmosphere, atomic H is the largest sink for most atmospheric molecules including biosignature gases. This is in contrast to oxidizing atmospheres (atmospheres with substantial O 2 or CO 2 and H 2 O and without H 2 ) where the OH radical (and in some cases O) plays the role of the dominant sink. We note that for H 2 -rich atmospheres with high CO 2 levels, atomic O will be abundant ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) and for some molecules will dominate the removal chemistry.</p><p>To explain the high H concentration we review the production of H, OH and O in H 2 -rich atmospheres. To qualitatively outline the main points we use a simplified description of the main chemical pathways. This discussion serves for illustration only, and is later backed up with a more detailed computational photochemistry model.</p><p>To derive atmospheric concentrations of a species [A] we take photochemical equilibrium,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d[A] dt = P − [A]L = 0, (8) [A] = P L .

The first major point is that the role of OH in Shown are different CO 2 levels. The curves correspond to a CO 2 surface emission flux of Earth's volcanic emission rate (3 × 10 15 m 2 s −1 ; solid lines), CO 2 emission rate 100 times higher than Earth's rate (dashed lines) and CO 2 emission rate 100 times lower than Earth's rate (dotted lines). The planet has 10 M ⊕ and 1.75 R ⊕ and is in a 1.6-AU orbit of a sun-like star (with UV adjusted). The fiducial atmosphere is 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume, in a 1 bar atmosphere with a 290 K surface temperature. The main point is that the H concentration does not depend on the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere, whereas the amount of O is critically controlled by the level of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Compared to H, OH is always a minor constituent in the atmosphere (by a few orders of magnitude). As the UV flux increases, more of the destructive, reactive species are generated. forming H from H 2 (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>) illustrates the importance of water vapor. Water is needed to form H in the first place, in this case.</p><p>The second major point is that the reason H can accumulate to high concentrations is because the H + H + M reaction rate that removes the H atoms is relatively slow. The rates are</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K = 2.8 × 10 −18 exp(−1800.0/T ) [m 3 s −1 ],<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">K m = 6.64 × 10 −39 (T /298.0) −1 × N [m 3 s −1 ], (16) J ≃ 10 −6 [s −1 ],<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where N is the number density of species M in units of molecules m −3 . The rates are from Sander et al. (2011). The third major point is that in the H 2 -rich atmosphere the OH concentration is low, because <ref type="bibr">[OH]</ref> reacts with H 2 to recombine to H 2 O.</p><p>H is produced by photodissociation of water vapor and not predominantly by the direct photodissociation of H 2 . The reason is that the photons with high enough energy (λ &lt; 85 nm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mentall &amp; Gentieu 1970)</ref> to photodissociate H 2 are not available. The high-energy photons that could dissociate H 2 directly are absorbed at the pressure levels of nanobars by H 2 itself, and the photons that could penetrate down to pressure levels relevant to observations (0.1 mbar to 1 bar) are those that can dissociate water. Photodissociation of H 2 O, in comparison, is caused by photons of lower energy (λ ≤ 240 nm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banks &amp; Kockarts 1973)</ref>, photons which can penetrate more deeply in the atmosphere than the ones that photodissociate H 2 . We note that like other photochemical products, H is formed primarily above the mbar level, before all of the photodissociating stellar photons are absorbed.</p><p>The H concentration is dependent on the stellar UV levels and presence of H 2 O. Low-UV environments are favorable for biosignature build up, since the initial photolysis that starts the OH formation chain will be weaker. A similar situation is described for oxidized atmospheres in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>We must beware that for some molecules, in some situations, atomic O will be the dominant destructive species. There is no simple model (as in the above equations) but with our full simulation we find in atmospheres with high CO 2 atomic O will abundant (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The key point is that reaction rates with O are faster than reaction rates with H for some molecules (see <ref type="table">Ta- ble 1</ref>).</p><p>There is a very important point of comparison between the dominant reactive species, H in H 2 -rich atmospheres and OH in oxidized atmospheres. The concentrations of H and OH in the two different types of atmospheres vary (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, as well as more generally <ref type="table">Table  4</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>). This can be understood qualitatively because OH is much more reactive than H. OH will react faster with any atmospheric component than H, and so, for the same impinging stellar UV flux, OH will build up to a lower atmospheric concentration than H. The rate of removal of a biosignature gas by H or OH is a product of the concentration and the reactivity. OH, with lower concentration but greater reactivity will remove a biosignature gas at a similar rate to H, which has a greater concentration but a lower reactivity. In other words, while the mechanism of chemistry clearance and the end products are different, the loss rate is fairly similar.

The biosignature categories developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> and summarized in §2.2 are an essential aide for calculations because of the common formation pathways that belong to each biosignature class.</p><p>We consider a planet with 10M ⊕ , 1.75 R ⊕ , an atmosphere with 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume. The atmosphere scenario is the hydrogen-rich case among the exoplanet benchmark scenarios detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. (2012)</ref>, and we here outline the key specifics. The planet surface pressure is 1 bar and the planet surface temperature is 290 K. The temperature drops with increasing altitude according to an adiabatic lapse rate, until reaching 160 K and is prescribed as constant above. The semi-major axis of the planets orbit is 1.4 AU if orbiting a sun-like star, 0.037 AU if orbiting an M5V dwarf star, this is the consistent planet-star separation given the atmospheric composition and the required surface temperature. The eddy diffusion coefficients are scaled up by a factor of 6.3 from those measured in Earths atmosphere, in order to account for the difference in the mean molecular mass. Important minor gases considered are H 2 O (evaporated from a liquid water ocean), CO 2 (about 100 ppm), and CH 4 and H 2 S (emitted from surface). Deposition velocities of H 2 , CH 4 are assumed to be zero, the deposition velocity of CO is 10 −10 m s −1 , and deposition velocities of oxidants including O 2 , O 3 , and H 2 O 2 and sulfur species are assumed to be the values as on Earth. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al.

Whether or not a biosignature gas is detectable can be technique and spectral feature dependent. The required atmospheric concentration depends on the strength of a given absorption feature, and different techniques are sensitive to different wavelength ranges. For example, thermal emission detection sensitivity follows the planetary thermal emission flux (approximately a black body peaking in the mid-IR), whereas the transmission spectra sensitivity in the infrared follows the thermal emission flux of the star (approximately a black body). An illustrative example is NH 3 with a strong absorption feature at 10.3-10.7 µm suitable for planetary thermal emission but for transmission a weaker absorption feature at 2.8-3.2 µm is more easily detected than the 10 µm feature because of overall photon fluxes of the star. For transmission spectra we avoid consideration of sun-like stars because the observational signal (the planet atmospherestar area ratio) is too low (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kaltenegger &amp; Traub 2009)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Reaction A n E T = 270 K T = 370 K T = 470 K DMS + H → CH 3 SH +</formula><p>Biosignature gas results are summarized for thermal emission detectability (for sun-like and M dwarf stars) in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and for transmission spectra detectability (for M dwarf stars only) in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), and via their transmission spectra for H 2 -dominated atmospheres <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Type I Biosignature Gases: Fully Reduced Forms</head><p>We start by focusing on the Type I biosignature gases, gases generated by reactions that extract energy from external, environmental redox gradients. The most likely Type I metabolic product in an H 2 -rich atmosphere would be those in which non-hydrogen elements are in their most hydrogenated form <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . In a reducing environment, life captures chemical energy by reducing environmental chemicals. In the presence of excess hydrogen, the most energy life could extract from chemical potential energy gradients would be from converting elements from relatively oxidized compounds to their fully reduced form. An additional reason for focusing on Type I biosignature gas products that are in their most hydrogenated from is that they are likely long lived in an H 2 -dominated atmosphere, because molecules in their most hydrogenated form cannot undergo any further reactions with H.</p></div>

The most promising Type I biosignature gas is NH 3 , which is further described below ( §4.1.2). The other reduced molecules are unlikely biosignature gases for a variety of reasons. Some (PH 3 , SiH 4 ), require energy input to make the reduced product from geologically available materials, and so would not be produced by Type I biosignature gas reactions. Some are always present in their most reduced form and so life cannot reduce them further (F, Cl). H 2 S and CH 4 are not viable for reasons discussed below, largely because geological and biologically sources cannot be discriminated between.

Phosphine is a potential biosignature in other highly reduced environments. Phosphine is reactive and thermodynamically disfavored over elemental phosphorus and hydrogen at Earth surface pressure and temperature. Phosphine might be a Type I biosignature gas under conditions of very high H 2 pressure, which would favour production of PH 3 over elemental phosphorus. Phosphine could be also be produced as a Type III biosignature gas, analogous to reactive signaling molecules such as NO or C 2 H 4 on Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">NH3 as the Strongest Candidate Biosignature Gas in an H2 Atmosphere</head><p>NH 3 is the strongest candidate biosignature gas in a thin, H 2 atmosphere because, like O 2 in Earth's atmosphere, there is no plausible geological or photochemical mechanism for producing high concentrations on rocky planets with thin atmospheres (but c.f. the false positive discussion below). NH 3 is readily photolyzed in the upper atmosphere to yield N 2 and in volcanic gases is thermally broken down at high temperatures. The triple bond of N 2 makes it extremely kinetically stable and so any N in the atmosphere ends up being trapped as N 2 .</p><p>We have therefore proposed NH 3 as a biosignature gas in an H 2 -rich atmosphere ). NH 3 is a good biosignature gas candidate for any thin H 2 -rich exoplanet atmosphere because of its short lifetime and lack of geological production sources. NH 3 as a biosignature gas is a new idea, and one that is specific to a non-Earth-like planet. On Earth, NH 3 is not a useful biosignature gas because, as a highly valuable molecule for life that is produced in only small quantities, it is rapidly depleted by life and is unable to accumulate in the atmosphere. NH 3 is also a very poor biosignature gas on Earth because it is very soluble, so the trace amounts produced will stay dissolved in water and not escape to the atmosphere.</p><p>The summary of the biosignature gas idea is that NH 3 would be produced from hydrogen and nitrogen, in an atmosphere rich in both,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">3H 2 + N 2 → 2NH 3 .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>This is an exothermic reaction which could be used to capture energy. is not yet known is a catalytic system that can break both at once. We showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref> that for an Earthsize, Earth-mass planet with a 1 bar atmosphere of 75% by volume N 2 and 25% by volume H 2 (including carbon species via a CO 2 emission flux), a potentially detectable NH 3 atmosphere concentration of 0.1 ppm is sustainable by a very reasonable biomass surface density of 9 × 10 −2 g m −2 . This modest surface density corresponds to a layer less than one bacterial cell thick. For comparison, the phytoplankton that are the major contributor to Earth's oxygen atmosphere are present in Earth's oceans at around 10 g m −2 . For interest, we note that standard printer paper is between 80 and 100 g m −2 .</p><p>For an H 2 -dominated atmosphere with 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 on a planet with 10 M ⊕ , 1.75 R ⊕ orbiting a sunlike star, but all other parameters the same as the above, the viability of NH 3 as a biosignature gas in a thermal emission spectrum still holds based on a physically reasonable biomass surface density. We now describe the estimate for the biomass surface density, using the Type I biomass equation (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref>). We use the NH 3 source flux of 2.4×10 15 molecule m −2 s −1 (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). To compute ∆G we used T = 290 K, and reactant and product concentrations at the surface in terms of partial pressures of N 2 = 0.1, H 2 = 0.9, NH 3 = 1.4 × 10 −7 , giving ∆G = 85.6 kJ mole −1 . P me = 7.0 × 10 −6 kJ g −1 s −1 , we find a biomass surface density of 4.9 × 10 −2 g m −2 . Based on a reasonable biomass surface density, we therefore consider the NH 3 production flux to be viable in our Haber World scenario. The global annual biogenic NH 3 surface emission in the Haber World would be about 1100 Tg yr −1 . This is much higher than the Earth's natural NH 3 emission at 10 Tg yr −1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Seinfeld &amp; Pandis 2000)</ref>. Comparing NH 3 production on the Haber world and on Earth, however, is not valid. We are postulating that production of NH 3 on the Haber world is a major source of metabolic energy for life. A better emission rate comparison is to the biosignature gas O 2 from Earth's principle energy metabolism, photosynthesis. Earth's global oxygen flux is 200 times larger than the Haber World's NH 3 surface emission, at about 2 × 10 5 Tg yr −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Friend et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>Turning to a weakly active M5V dwarf star, for the same fiducial planet, the NH 3 surface flux required to sustain a detectable level of atmospheric NH 3 in a thermal emission spectrum is 5.1 × 10 14 molecule m −2 s −1 (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). This value is about 5 times lower than the sun-like star example above and therefore converts into a biomass estimate of about 5 times smaller than the sun-like star example above, or about 1 × 10 −2 g m −2 , due to the linear scaling of the problem. For a transmission spectra measurement for the same planet orbiting the same weakly active M dwarf star, the optimal wavelength range for detection is 2.8-3.2 µm, the required concentration is 11 ppm, and the required surface source flux is 5.5 × 10 16 molecule m −2 s −1 , resulting in a surface biomass of 1 g m 2 . For this particular example, NH 3 in transmission vs. thermal emission, it is more difficult to detect NH 3 and hence a higher biomass is actually required for the same hypothetical type of life.</p><p>We emphasize that the NH 3 biosignature gas concept is not changed for a planet with a massive (yet still "thin") atmosphere with high surface pressure. As long as the surface conditions are suitable for liquid water, NH 3 will not be created by uncatalyzed chemical reactions. NH 3 is not immune to false postives. Although a rocky planet with a thin H 2 -dominated atmosphere is unlikely to have an NH 3 false positive, the challenge is in identifying the planetary (and stellar) characteristics. We describe three scenarios that could lead to the nonbiological production of NH 3 .</p><p>A rocky world with a hot surface of ∼820 K could generated NH 3 by the conventional Haber process if there is surface iron. Such a hot surface temperature could presumably be ruled out from other observations.</p><p>A second scenario where NH 3 is naturally occuring is in the atmospheres of gas giant planets or the so-called mini Neptunes. The deep atmosphere may reach conditions where NH 3 can be formed kinetically at the extremely high pressures necessary for NH 3 formation to be possible thermodynamically. On Jupiter, for example, the H 2 + N 2 → NH 3 reaction becomes significant in comparison with vertical transport at about 1500 K, 1400 bar <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Prinn &amp; Olaguer 1981)</ref>. The only way we can discriminate between planets with a massive envelope and a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere where the pressures for the thermodynamic formation of NH 3 are not reached, is with high-resolution spectra to assess the surface pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benneke &amp; Seager 2012</ref>.</p><p>A third scenario for an NH 3 false positive is for planets with outgassed NH 3 during evolution. The importance of ammonia for the atmospheric evolution of Titan relates to primordial ammonia which accreted with the ices of the moon and has not subsequently been broken down either by internal heat (likely on a rocky planet) or by external UV photolysis (which will rapidly break down any NH3 in the atmosphere) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Shin et al. 2012</ref>). In this case, ammonia is therefore present as ice in the interior. This would be a challenging case to ascertain, and illustrates of how an assignment of any gas as a biosignature gas candidate has to be given a detailed probabilistic assessment based on what we know about the planet concerned.</p><p>For any case, a quiescent M star with no chromospheric UV emission-hence a planet with little to no destructive UV flux-NH 3 can easily accumulate in the planet atmosphere and act as a signficant false positive. NH 3 is destroyed by photolysis and is very sensitive to the amount of UV radiation.</p></div>

This is despite the risk of a geologically derived false positive, because it is believed that in an oxidized environment geological production of CH 4 will be small, and so if enough CH 4 is produced it may be attributed to life. This is the case on Earth where at least 99% of the atmospheric CH 4 derives directly from life or from industrial destruction of fossil hydrocarbons formed from past life ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al. 2004</ref>).

Even in the case of no surface CH 4 emission, CO 2 emission into the same atmosphere would lead to the atmospheric production and accumulation of CH 4 up to 5 ppm. This example is intended to show that the false positive risk of CH 4 is so high in a H 2 -dominated atmosphere as to make CH 4 an implausible biosignature gas. H 2 S is even more unfavorable than CH 4 as a biosignature gas in an H 2 -rich atmosphere because of the same geological false positive issues as with carbon gases. An added problem is the generation of aerosols which may blanket any spectral features and the fact that the H 2 S spectral features are heavily contaminated by atmospheric water vapor making them potentially difficult to detect ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>

The null result for biosignature photosynthetic biosignatures on an H 2 -dominated atmosphere is based on the point that most non-metals (C, O, S, the halogens) are likely to be in their most reduced state already on the surface of this world, and so cannot play the role of X in the above described photosynthesis process.</p><p>One exception might have been hydrogen, which is oxidized in water and methane, and so a possible photosynthetic reaction is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">CH 4 + H 2 O → CH 2 O + 2H 2 ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>but again H 2 is not a useful biosignature gas because it is already present in the H 2 -dominated atmosphere.

Silicon, phosphorus and boron are likely to be present as the oxidized minerals silicates, phosphates and borates respectively, but using these as a sink for the electrons in photosynthesis, for example in the reaction with silica to generate silane,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">CH 4 + 1 2 SiO 2 → CH 2 O + 1 2 SiH 4 ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>requires more energy than the reaction in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> under a range of conditions, and so would represent a very inefficient way of generating biomass. Reduction of a metal with a positive electrochemical potential would be more energetically efficient, as for example in the reduction of copper oxide to copper,</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">CH 4 + 2Cu(O) → CH 2 O + 2Cu + H 2 O,<label>(24)</label></formula><p>but produces no volatile product, and is dependent on a supply of oxidized metal. (There are clear parallels</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">atmospheres.</formula><p>with anoxygenic photosynthesis on Earth for this type of reaction.) By contrast, the reaction in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> is limited only by the supply of methane, as life in water is not limited by the chemical availability of water. In summary, photosynthesis in the reducing environment will either generate H 2 , which will not be detectable in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, or will produce nonvolatile products, i.e. not products not in gas form which by definition will not be detectable as atmospheric gases.</p></div>

The gases are produced for reasons such as stress, signaling, and other physiological functions, and some of these have already been discussed quantitatively in detail as biosignature gases in oxidized atmospheres, (e.g., CH 3 Cl ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2005</ref>) and DMS and other sulfur compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Domagal-Goldman et al. 2011)</ref>).</p><p>The fate of Type III biosignature gas molecules depends on the level of relevant reactive species in the atmosphere, and hence on stellar UV flux. In low UV environments, some Type III gases can accumulate to detectable levels. In the relatively high UV environments of sun-like stars, in an H 2 -rich atmosphere, many Type III gases could be rapidly driven to their most hydrogenated form, and in some cases will not accumulate to detectable levels unless we assume unrealistic production rates. In these extreme cases in a high UV environment, we would only be able to infer the presence of the biosignature gas by detecting the end-product of photochemical attack, which we call a bioindicator. Only in a few cases might bioindicators be useful, because many are not spectroscopically active (and hence not detectable) and others are indistinguishable from geological cases as well (e.g., DMS will end up as CH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and H 2 S, and N 2 O will end up as N 2 and H 2 O.)</p><p>We now show that Type III biosignature gas survival and hence plausibility depends highly on the UV flux level of the host star. We consider the three fiducial star types that differ in UV radiation levels: the sun-like star; the weakly active M5V dwarf star; and the quiescent M5V dwarf star <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. We consider the same model planet as above, a 10 M ⊕ , 1.75 R ⊕ planet with an atmosphere with 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume, with a surface temperature of 290 K and a surface pressure of 1 bar. Results for the cases we modeled are listed for thermal emission spectra in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and for transmission spectra in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Our first example of a Type III biosignature gas is methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl). CH 3 Cl is produced in trace amounts by many microorganisms on Earth. The detectability of CH 3 Cl in Earth-like atmospheres in the low UV environment of UV quiet M stars has already been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. (2005)</ref> and later as a potential biosignature gas in more generalized oxidized atmospheres by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Here for the first time we study CH 3 Cl as a potential biosignature gas in a thin H 2 -rich atmosphere. For this, we go beyond previous work not only by considering an H 2 atmosphere but also by using our biomass estimate framework so as not to be constrained by terrestrial bioflux production rates. We now show why CH 3 Cl is a potential biosignature gas in H 2 rich atmospheres in low UV environments-because the amount of biomass to generate a detectable concentration of CH 3 Cl is physically plausible. We use our biomass estimate framework ( §2. <ref type="bibr">2 and Seager et al. (2013)</ref>).</p><p>Considering the thermal emission spectrum for our fiducial planet with a 1 bar atmosphere of 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 , a spectral signature of 9 ppm is required for spectral detection using our detection metric. This statement is for a spectral band feature in absorption at 13.0-14.2 µm (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>; this is the band accessible in an H 2 atmosphere, weaker than the 6.6-7.6 µm band that would be masked by H 2 -H 2 collision-induced absorption. In order to sustain an atmospheric concentration of 9 ppm of CH 3 Cl on our model planet in the habitable zone for a sun-like, weakly active M5V dwarf star, and UV quiet M5V dwarf star, the surface bioflux production rate would need to be 1.0 × 10 17 molecule m −2 s −1 (1.7 × 10 −7 mole m −2 s −1 ), 2.9 × 10 15 molecule m −2 s −1 (4.8 × 10 −9 mole m −2 s −1 ), 4.7 × 10 11 molecule m −2 s −1 (7.8 × 10 −13 mole m −2 s −1 ), respectively. Estimating the biomass with equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref> and with the lab rate at 6.17 × 10 −11 mole g −1 s −1 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. 2013</ref>), the biomass surface density would need to be about 3000 g m −2 , 80 g m −2 , 0.001 g m −2 for each star-type respectively. A globally averaged density of 3000 g m −2 is likely too high, one of 80 g m −2 is high but not impossible, according to terrestrial biodensities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The results show that CH 3 Cl is a more viable biosignature gas in low-UV as compared to high-UV environments. We emphasize that although our estimates of biomass surface density for Type III biosignature production are approximate, the resulting trend is robust.</p><p>For a spectral detection in transmission for our fiducial Earth transiting an M5V star, the required concentration is about 10 ppm in the wavelength range 3.2-3.4 µm. The surface bioflux and biomass estimates for a weakly active and quiet star respectively are 3.2 × 10 15 molecule m −2 s −1 and 900 g m −2 and 5.2 × 10 11 molecule m −2 s −1 and 0.001 g m −2 . The required biomass surface density for the weakly active M star is higher than the average surface biomass in Earth's oceans and the biomass surface density for the quiet M5V dwarf star is much lower than Earth's and very plausible, again emphasizing the trend that low-UV radiation environments are more favorable for Type III biosignature gas accumulation.</p><p>The different values for biosignature gas surface flux and for the biomass estimates for transmission spectra as compared to thermal emission spectra are in general due to either or both of longer atmospheric pathlengths and different favorable wavelengths (depending on the molecule of interest).</p><p>The fate of CH 3 Cl in its destruction by H, is to end up in its fully hydrogenated form, HCl, with the overall reaction as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">CH 3 Cl + H 2 → CH 4 + HCl.<label>(25)</label></formula><p>HCl could be a bioindicator. The HCl molecule is stable to further photochemistry, because if it is photolyzed, the Cl atoms generated will be predominately react with   <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.

(2012)</ref> for the N 2 and CO 2 dominated cases. We find that over 5 ppm of CH 3 Cl is required for detection via thermal emission for H 2 -, N 2 -, and CO 2 -dominated atmospheres.</p><p>H to reform HCl. HCl would not be expected to be present in significant levels at atmospheric altitudes for spectral detection without life taking non-volatile forms of Cl and putting it into the atmosphere, because all geological sources are non-volatile chlorides (such as NaCl) and any HCl that is volcanically released would be efficiently rained out of the troposphere. The limiting problem is that the HCl spectral features are too weak to be detectable and are likely to be contaminated by CH 4 in the 3 to 4 µm range. As a second Type III biosignature gas example we consider dimethyl sulfide (DMS). DMS has been studied before in oxidizing atmospheres by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011)</ref> who concluded that DMS itself is not a potentially detectable biosignature gas in oxidized atmospheres under sun-like UV radiation, but one of its photolytic breakdown products ethane is detectable (we call this a "bioindicator" gas). Using the same atmosphere and framework as the above CH 3 Cl example, for thermal emission spectra we find a mixing ratio required for detection of 0.1 ppm in the 2.2-2.8 µm band (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Via photochemistry, this mixing ratio corresponds to a surface flux in our fiducial H 2 -dominated atmosphere for a sun-like star, weakly active M5V dwarf star, and quiet M5V dwarf star as 4.2×10 19 molecules m −2 s −1 (6.9×10 −5 moles m −2 s −1 ), 1.8×10 19 molecules m −2 s −1 (3.0×10 −5 moles m −2 s −1 ), 2.4×10 13 molecules m −2 s −1 (4.1×10 −11 moles m −2 s −1 ), respectively. Using a DMS lab production rate of 3.64 × 10 −7 moles g −1 s −1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Seager et al. 2013</ref>), we come up with am implied biomass surface density estimate for the three star types of about 200 g m −2 , 100 g m −2 , 10 −4 g m −2 , respectively. The first two values are high, but physically plausible as compared to Earth biomass surface density ranges. For transmission spectra the numbers are about a factor of two higher for the weakly active and quiet M5V dwarf star (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).   <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Theoretical infrared thermal emission spectra of a super Earth exoplanet with various levels of atmospheric DMS in a 1 bar atmosphere with a surface temperature of 290 K for a planet with 10 M ⊕ and 1.75 R ⊕ . From top to bottom, the panels show the spectra of H 2 -, N 2 -, and CO 2 -dominated atmospheres, respectively, and the detailed compositions of these reference atmospheres are described in §4 for the H 2 -dominated planet and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al. (2012)</ref> for the N 2 and CO 2 dominated cases. We find that 0.1 ppm of DMS is required for future detection via thermal emission for H 2 , N 2 , and CO 2 -dominated atmospheres.</p><p>The DMS results show again that the lowest UV environment is most favorable. There are two other other relevant points related to DMS appearing to be a favorable biosignature gas in each of the three UV radiation environments studied. The first point is that gases destroyed by reaction with O (as opposed to gases destroyed by reactions with H) show a similar surface flux requirement between the sun-like and weakly active M dwarf star. This is because the release of O from CO 2 photolysis is largely driven by Lyman-alpha emission which are similar at the habitable zones for the sun-like and weakly active M dwarf star used in this study <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>The second point is that the high R lab values used for DMS, and hence the low biomass surface density estimates, are a result of the biology of DMS production. On Earth, DMS is the waste product of consumption of DMSP by marine organisms consuming marine plankton. DMSP is accumulated in large amounts by some marine species. Thus organisms that generate DMS do not have to invest their own resources to make DMS, and so are not limited to how much they can make. Maximal production rates are therefore very high. This is discussed further in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Seager et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of a bioindicator, DMS will react with H 2 to generate CH 4 and H 2 S. Neither is a useful bioindicator as CH 4 and H 2 S are expected to be present in the atmosphere naturally. This is in contrast to oxidized atmospheres, where ethane may be a bioindicator gas, as the expected to be the end product of DMS photodestruction by combination of methyl radicals generated from attack of O on DMS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>As a third and fourth Type III biosignature gas example, we used CS 2 and OCS. For these two gases we find the same trend as the other Type III biosignature gases, that is in a low UV environment the biosignature gases can accumulate (see <ref type="table">Tables 2 and 3</ref>). The biomass estimates (as a plausibility check) are too high for the sun-like and weakly active M dwarf star environments to be plausible as compared to terrestrial biomass surface density values. OCS in the UV environment of a weakly active M dwarf star may be an exception with an estimate at the upper limit of plausibility.</p><p>As a fifth example we describe N 2 O. On Earth N 2 O is a Type I biosignature gas produced by nitrifying bacteria. N 2 O is not likely to be produced in a thin H 2 -rich atmosphere because there is unlikely to be much nitrate available. Here we explain further. N 2 O has been suggested as a biosignature gas in Earths atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2005</ref>). N 2 O is a Type I biosignature gas formed by two processes on Earth-the oxidation of ammonia by atmospheric oxygen and the reduction of nitrate in anoxic environments,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">2NH 3 + 2O 2 → N 2 O + 3H 2 O,<label>(26)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">NO − 3 + H → N 2 O + H 2 O. (27)</formula><p>Analogous reactions on a hydrogen-dominated world would be the reduction of nitrate by atmospheric hydrogen</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">NO − 3 + H 2 → N 2 O + H 2 O + OH − ,<label>(28)</label></formula><p>or the oxidation of ammonia by a geologically derived oxidant.</p><p>Nitrate is formed on Earth by oxidation of NO generated by lightning in Earths oxygen-rich atmosphere, or by biological processes-neither are likely in an H 2 -rich environment, so it is not clear whether nitrate reduction is a useful energy source in a world with an atmosphere rich in H 2 . Ammonia oxidation requires a strong oxidizing agent, which again is likely to be missing from the environment.</p><p>N 2 O as a Type I biosignature gas, therefore, seems unlikely, although not impossible, from very rare environments in which there are oxidized nitrogen species generated geochemically. N 2 O, however, could be a Type III biosignature gas as NO is for some organisms on Earth. We have calculated the surface fluxes for a detectable amount of N 2 O in a thin, H 2 -dominated atmosphere and find relatively low required surface fluxes. The reason is that N 2 O is destroyed by photodissociation, a slower rate than by reaction with H. N 2 O may therfore be a plausible biosignature gas candidate, even in an atmosphere subject to strong UV radiation (see <ref type="figure">Figures 6 and 7</ref> and Tables 2) and 3). A biomass estimate (as a plausibility check) is not possible for N 2 O, as it is only known as a Type I biosignature on Earth (and so therefore Type III R lab rates are not available).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">What Constitutes an H 2 -Dominated Atmosphere?</head><p>We have calculated biosignature gas accumulation in an atmosphere with 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume. A super Earth exoplanet atmosphere can have many other gas species. The concentration of the major destructive species, H, O, and OH will depend on the amounts of these other gas species.</p><p>As an example, we explore the changing effect of the reactive species in an H 2 -dominated atmosphere for different UV flux levels, based on the surface flux levels of CO 2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). A few key points are as follows. The H abundance is almost not affected by the CO 2 mixing ratios ranging from 10 −8 to 10 −2 . The O abundance depends on both CO 2 and UV levels, such that both a high CO 2 level and a high UV flux lead to high atmospheric O. Only in extreme cases (e.g., H 2 -dominated atmospheres with &gt;1% CO 2 , shown by dashed lines), the abundance of O may be very close to the abundance of H. The OH abundance depends on a complex source-sink network, ultimately driven by H 2 O and CO 2 photolysis. Notably, the amount of H is always at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than the amount of OH.</p><p>The effect of changing the H 2 mixing ratio and the addition and variation of other active gases on the H concentration will need to be considered on a case-bycase basis as they will react not only with H and OH but also with other gas species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Can Super Earths Retain H 2 -Dominated</head><p>Atmospheres? Whether or not a super Earth planet can retain H 2 stably from atmospheric escape is not known. Although many models and studies for exoplanet atmospheric escape exist (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lammer et al. 2012</ref>, and references therein), the permanent limitation is that there are too many unknowns to provide a definitive and quantitative statement on which planets will retain H 2 . One of the challenges is the unknown history and present state of the host star's EUV flux. Another major challenge is the defining the mechanism for atmospheric escape for a given exoplanet, for example whether or not the regime  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

With an unknown initial atmospheric reservoir and an unknown present atmospheric composition, the regime and type of atmospheric escape is difficult to impossible to identify. Some super Earths will have been formed with atmospheres with H 2 , based on both theoretical and observational evidence. Theoretically, planetary building blocks containing water-rich minerals that can release H <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schaefer &amp; Fegley 2010)</ref>. Observationally, a large number and variety in radius of Kepler mini-Neptunes that must have H or an H/He envelope to explain their radii. So either from outgassing or nebular capture of gases, some super Earths should have started out with H 2 -rich atmospheres and those with high enough gravity and low enough temperatures and/or with magnetic fields should be able to retain the H 2 (e.g., Pierrehumbert &amp; Gaidos 2011). Observational detection of H 2 -rich atmospheres will ultimately be needed to confirm the scenario of thin H 2 -dominated atmospheres on super Earths.</p></div>

The main argument for a maximum temperature for life involves the temperature at which the basic building blocks of life (DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) break down. Many of the component chemicals of life, including DNA, many of the amino acids that make up proteins, and many of the key metabolites that allow lifes biochemistry to function are rapidly chemically broken down above 470 K (e.g., Cowan 2004) The maximum temperature at which life could exist therefore may lie between 420 K and 470K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">What Surface Pressure is too High?</head><p>Many super Earth atmospheres will be much more massive than the 1 bar atmosphere on Earth. For temperatures suitable for the existence of liquid water (see §5.3), the surface pressure could be as high as 1000 bar or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wagner &amp; Pruß 2002)</ref>. There are three key points to show that the high surface pressures does not destroy the biosignature gases before they can reach the high atmosphere. "Can life generate potentially detectable biogsignature gases under a massive atmosphere?" The answer is yes, provided the surface temperature is compatible with life, then in principle life can survive and generate biosignature gases. The chemistry described in this paper still holds under a massive atmosphere, because the photochemical destruction occurs above 1 mbar. Furthermore, we showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Seager et al. (2012)</ref> that the biomass surface density estimates are unchanged under a massive atmosphere as long as the photochemical loss rate dominates. For biosignature gases whose loss is dominated by deposition at the surface (i.e. are absorbed by the surface), then the biosignature source flux and hence biomass surface density will scale linearly with planetary atmosphere mass.</p><p>The second key question is, "Can the high density and pressures on the surface under a massive atmosphere gen-  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Theoretical transmission spectra for potential biosignature gases in a 10 M ⊕ , 1.75 R ⊕ , 1 bar atmosphere composed of 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 and with a surface temperature of 290 K. Potential biosignature gases, including CH 3 Cl, DMS, N 2 O, and NH 3 , have spectral features in infrared wavelengths from 1 to 10 µm, making these gases detectable at various atmospheric mixing ratios (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>erate false positives?" The answer is almost entirely no, because we have shown that it is largely the Type III biosignature gases that are viable biosignature candidates. Recall that Type III gases are those produced for reasons other than energy extraction, and not from chemicals in the environment. Therefore they are unlikely to be the product of nonbiological chemistry; a statement that holds even under a massive atmosphere. A comment related to NH 3 potential false positive is in order.</p><p>For NH 3 to be generated from N 2 and H 2 kinetically, the temperature has to be well above any temperature compatible with life for any pressure where water is liquid, extrapolating from the known fact that at 300 bar and 673 K N 2 and H 2 still need a catalyst to be converted to NH 3 , and higher pressures shouldn't change this. The false positive risk is instead in detecting NH 3 without being able to identify the surface as cold enough not to possibly generate NH 3 kinetically. The third key question is, "Will the high surface pressures enable fast chemical reactions that destroy the biosignature gases generated at the surface?" The answer is no, for pressures under about 1000 bar. In principle, if the upward diffusion or convective motions bring the biosignature gas to higher altitudes faster than the gas is destroyed by kinetic reactions, the higher surface pressures will not interfere with biosignature gas accculumation in the atmosphere.</p><p>Up to 1000 bar, reaction rates extrapolated from lowpressure kinetic experiments should be valid to an order of magnitude. The additional caveat is that lowpressure gas kinetics are usually measured at high temperature and we are extrapolating to high pressure and low temperature. For example, at 1000 bar and 300 K, we estimate the half life of hydrogenation of CH 3 Cl to be 6.0×10 11 yr, the half life of DMS to be 3×10 10 yr, and the half-life of N 2 O at 1 × 10 20 yr. These numbers are based on thermochemical equilibrium of H 2 and H based on the relative Gibbs free energy of formation of atomic hydrogen and T and P (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Borgnakke &amp; Sonntag 2009</ref>). The overview is that there is very little free H at high pressures and low temperatures since in the absence of UV, H atoms will be generated almost entirely thermochemically.</p><p>At pressures above 1000 bar we are less confident that chemistry can be extrapolated even qualitatively from low pressure experiments. By 1000 bar, most gases will have densities approaching those of their liquids. Increases in pressure will force molecules closer than their van der Waals radii, directly altering molecular orbitals and reaction pathways. Below ∼1000 bar we can consider molecules separate entities and we can still consider the molecules chemistry to be qualitatively similar to that of their dilute (ideal) gas state, and hence order-of-magnitude extrapolations from low pressure gas chemistry is justifiable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Can we Identify Exoplanets with H 2 -Dominated</head><p>Atmospheres that are Potentially Habitable? Given the argument that life can generate biosignature gases on a planet with an H 2 -rich atmosphere, but that the surface must have the right temperatures, how can we identify suitable planets for further study? The problem is that super Earths are observed with a wide range of masses and sizes, and we can anticipate that a range of atmosphere masses will also exist. A challenge is presented in observational atmosphere studies because we can only "see" to an optical depth of a few and this limiting optical depth can be reached well above any surface for a thick atmosphere. In many cases surface conditions cannot be probed. Ideally, high-resolution spectra can be used to tell whether or not the atmosphere is thick or thin (i.e. whether or not one can observe down to the planetary surface), based on the shape of the spectral features, as described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Benneke &amp; Seager (2012</ref>.</p><p>We support the search for biosignature gases regardless of being able to classify a planet as habitable, because identifying biosignature gas molecules may be more easily attainable than high-spectral resolution characterization of a super Earth atmospheric spectrum.

Other studies with much larger numbers of M dwarf stars are ongoing, including some with UV emission from GALEX <ref type="bibr">(A. West, 2013 private communication)</ref>. A general understanding is that magnetic activity, as traced by Hα in M dwarfs decreases with age but that M dwarfs appear to have finite activity lifetimes such that the early-type M dwarfs (M0-M3) spin down quickly with an activity lifetime of about about 1 to 2 Gyr whereas later-type M dwarf stars (M5-M7) continue to spin rapidly for billions of years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">West et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">West et al. , 2008</ref>.</p><p>For the time being UV (that is the relevant FUV and EUV) radiation emitted by stars of interest is not usually measured or theoretically known and so we have worked with three different UV-radiation environments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>A relevant point for quiet M stars with extremely low UV radiation (if they exist) is that false positives for biosignature gases destroyed by photolysis may also more easily accumulate. This is relevant for NH 3 , for which the lifetime in our fiducial H 2 planet atmosphere for a planet orbiting a quiet M star is about 1.4 Gyr, according to our photochemistry models. This means that the false positive risk that comes from primordial NH 3 would be high <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . Related issues with other gases that are primarily destroyed by photolysis (and not destruction by reactions with H and O) should be investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Detection Prospects</head><p>Is there any hope that the next space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope could be the first to provide evidence of biosignature gases? Yes, if-and only if-every single factor is in our favor.</p><p>First, we need to discover a pool of transiting planets orbiting nearby (i.e., bright) M dwarf stars. Second, the planet atmosphere should preferably have an atmosphere rich in molecular hydrogen to increase the planetary atmosphere scale height. Third, the M dwarf star needs to be a UV quiet M dwarf star with little EUV radiation. Fourth, the planet must have life that produces biosignature gases that are spectroscopically active.</p><p>Several biosignature gases, if they exist, are detectable with tens of hours of JWST time, based on our detection metric. Although our detection metric assumes photon noise is the limiting factor, many more detailed simulations of JWST detectability show that spectral features of similar magnitude are detectable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deming et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>For detecting molecules using transmission spectroscopy, the background exoplanet atmosphere dominated by H 2 or CO 2 has little effect on the detectability of the biosignature gases of interest we studied. This is because the transmission observations are better performed in the near infrared than in the mid infrared because of a higher stellar photon flux at near-infrared wavelengths, and the contamination effects of either of the dominant CO 2 absorption or collision-induced H 2 -H 2 absorption are minimal in the near infrared. As long as all of the biosignature gases of interest have features in the near infrared (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> for the spectral features), these gases may be detected for atmospheres with any level of CO 2 .</p><p>The key issue here, instead of spectral contamination, is the mean molecular mass. The depth of the transmission spectral feature is 1 order-of-magnitude larger for H 2 -dominated atmospheres compared with CO 2 -dominated atmospheres (see the scale height in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>).</p><p>For detecting molecules via thermal emission with future direct imaging techniques, one may expect the CO 2 or H 2 -H 2 contamination to be important because thermal emission of the planet peaks in the mid infrared where CO 2 and H 2 -H 2 contamination is most substantial. For individual gases, however, there are often multiple absorption bands to mitigate this issue. Similarly, a variety of wavelength ranges are usually available to choose from for the other biosignature gases of interest studied in this paper (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 4 to 7)</ref>.</p><p>At this point we conclude by emphasizing a related point that the plausibility of a specific biosignature gas depends on the planet surface gravity, atmospheric pressure, and other characteristics, because such characteristics affect which atmospheric wavelength "windows" are most favorable. Individual planets and their atmospheres should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We have provided a "proof of concept" that biosignature gases can accumulate in exoplanets with thin H 2 -dominated atmospheres. We used a model atmosphere including a detailed photochemistry code and also employed a biomass model estimate to assess plausibility of individual biosignature gases. We considered a fiducial super Earth of 10 M ⊕ and 1.75 R ⊕ with a 1 bar atmosphere predominantly composed of 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume, and semi-major axes compatible with habitable surface temperatures. Although deviations from our fiducial model will yield different spectral features, atmospheric concentrations, etc., the main findings summarized here will still hold.</p><p>Our major finding is that for H 2 -rich atmospheres, low-UV radiation environments are more favorable for biosignature gas accumulation than high-UV radiation environments. Specifically, H is the dominant reactive species generated by photochemistry in an H 2 -rich atmosphere. In atmospheres with high levels of CO 2 atomic O will be the dominant destructive species for some molecules. The low UV environments of UV quiet M stars are favorable for accumulation of biosignature gases in an H 2 -dominated atmosphere. The high UV environment of sun-like and active M dwarf stars largely prevents biosignature gas accumulation due to rapid photochemical destruction via H (or sometimes O), its concentration controlled by UV photolysis. High UV radiation is also unfavorable for the accumulation of biosignature gases in oxidized atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2005</ref>), although in contrast OH is the main reactive species in oxidized atmospheres.</p><p>We investigated the plausibility of a number of biosignature gases, including H 2 ,CH 4 , H 2 S, DMS, NH 3 , N 2 O, NO, CH 3 Cl, HCl. While not exhaustive, we came up with some plausible biosignature gases and others that are unsuitable as biosignature gases, as follows.</p><p>Our list of plausible biosignature gases is dominated by Type III biosignature gases in low-UV environments. These include CH 3 Cl, DMS, and N 2 O. Type III are gases produced for specialized functions and therefore could well include small molecules as yet unknown. We therefore support the idea of searching for high concentrations of gases that do not belong in chemical equilibrium.</p><p>We also presented a new biosignature gas candidate, NH 3 , the only one we found reasonable as a Type I biosignature gas candidate, and one unique to a hydrogen-rich environment. Type I are gas produced as byproducts from energy extraction from the environment.</p><p>Our list of unlikely biosignature gases is dominated by Type I biosignature gases, as any biosignature gases produced from energy extraction (such as CH 4 or H 2 S and numerous others), will be either be produced by geochemical or photochemical processes or likely rapidly destroyed by hydrogenation in a hydrogen-dominated environment.</p><p>We have not identified any unique biosignature gas produced by any type of photosynthesis in a thin H 2 -rich atmosphere comparable to O 2 in oxidized atmospheres. In an H 2 -dominated environment the most likely photosynthetic byproduct is molecular hydrogen, already prevalent in the H 2 -dominated atmosphere, or non-volatile mineral products. This is in contrast to O 2 produced by photosynthsis in oxidized environments that is quite robust to most false positive scenarios. (We call biosignature gases from biomass building Type II.) Bioindicators would be helpful, but aren't easily or uniquely detectable. The examples we gave were the hydrogen halides.</p><p>Overall, the promise of biosignature gases in H 2 atmo-spheres is real. We have aimed to provide a conceptual and quantitative framework to show that there are at least some viable biosignature gases that could be produced either by life's capture of environmental chemical energy or are in a category of gases produced by terrestrial life. We intend for the results here to fuel the motivation for discovery of habitable Earths and super Earths orbiting M dwarf stars and their atmospheric followup with the JWST.</p><p>We thank Jean-Michel Desert and Kartik Sheth for motivating questions. We thank Foundational Questions Institute (FQXI) for funding the seeds of this work many years ago.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Comparison of stellar fluxes. The radiative flux received by a planet in the habitable zone of a solar-like star, a weakly active M dwarf star (like GJ 1214), and a theoretically simulated quiet M dwarf star with an effective temperature of 3000 K with no chromospheric emission. The flux is scaled so that the planet has a surface temperature of 290 K. The spectrum of the sun-like star is from the Air Mass Zero reference spectrum during a solar quiet period (http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am0/). The spectrum of GJ 1214 contains two parts: for wavelengths shorter than 300 nm we take the most recent HST measurement (France et al. 2013), for wavelengths longer than 300 nm we take the NextGen simulated spectrum for an M dwarf star having parameters closest to those of GJ 1214 (i.e., effective temperature of 3000 K, surface gravity log(g) = 5.0, and metallicity = 0.5). The spectrum with no chromospheric emission is also from the NextGen model (Allard et al. 1997). Under the common definition of weakly active, or relatively quiet M dwarf, the UV environment in its habitable zone can differ by more than six orders of magnitude.</figDesc></figure>

Mixing ratio dependence of the reactive species (H, OH, and O) on UV flux in a H 2 -rich atmosphere with some CO 2 . Shown are different CO 2 levels. The curves correspond to a CO 2 surface emission flux of Earth's volcanic emission rate (3 × 10 15 m 2 s −1 ; solid lines), CO 2 emission rate 100 times higher than Earth's rate (dashed lines) and CO 2 emission rate 100 times lower than Earth's rate (dotted lines). The planet has 10 M ⊕ and 1.75 R ⊕ and is in a 1.6-AU orbit of a sun-like star (with UV adjusted). The fiducial atmosphere is 90% H 2 and 10% N 2 by volume, in a 1 bar atmosphere with a 290 K surface temperature. The main point is that the H concentration does not depend on the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere, whereas the amount of O is critically controlled by the level of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Compared to H, OH is always a minor constituent in the atmosphere (by a few orders of magnitude). As the UV flux increases, more of the destructive, reactive species are generated.</figDesc></figure>
