				<p>We present an analysis of the papers published in the journals Nature and Science in the years from 2006 to 2010. During this period, a total of 7788 papers were published in the two journals. This includes 544 astronomy papers that comprise 7.0% of the papers in &apos;all&apos; research fields and 18.9% of those in the fields of &apos;physical sciences&apos;. The sub-fields of research of the astronomy papers are distributed, in descending order of number of papers, in Solar System, stellar astronomy, galaxies and the universe, the Milky Way Galaxy, and exoplanets. The observational facilities used for the studies are mainly ground-based telescopes (31.1%), spacecrafts (27.0%), and space telescopes (22.8%), while 16.0% of papers did not use any noticeable facilities and 1.7% used other facilities. Korean scientists have published 86 papers (33 in Nature and 53 in Science), which is 1.10% of all the papers (N=7788) in the two journals. The share of papers by Korean astronomers among the scientific papers by Koreans is 8.14%, slightly higher than the contribution of astronomy papers (7.0%) in both journals. key words: history and philosophy of astronomy-sociology of astronomy-astronomical data bases: miscellaneous</p>

These achievements that have a high impact on science and mankind are often acknowledged by press releases to the public and/or prestigious prizes such as the Nobel Prize.

Recently, <ref type="bibr">Kim (2011)</ref> presented results of an investigation on the paper productivities of ground-based large <ref type="bibr">(D &gt; 8 m)</ref> optical telescopes from an analysis of papers published from 2000 to 2009. highest number of citations and those published in the journals Nature and Science are the outputs with the greatest impact on science and on mankind <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Benn &amp; Sánchez , 2001b)</ref>, we have investigated the papers published in the journals Nature and Science from 2006 and 2010 in this study. Specifically, we have tried to answer the following questions which people often ask: (1) how many papers are published in the journals <ref type="bibr">Nature and Science, (2)</ref> what is the percentage of astronomy papers among these papers, (3) what are the distributions and portions of sub-research fields of astronomy, (4) what facilities were used for those astronomy papers and what were the percentages of their uses, and (5) how many Korean scientists and Korean astronomers contributed to those papers. Because in some countries including Korea there is insufficient capability in the society to assess the scientific competence of personnel or the qualities of research output, it is common to consider publications in highly cited journals/magazines like Nature and Science as the proxy of scientific expertise. It will be, therefore, meaningful to investigate the statistics and distribution of papers in the two representative journals. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data utilized in this work. Section 3 presents the analysis results of the number of papers, research fields in astronomy, astronomical facilities used, and papers by Koreans. Finally, Section 4 provides summary and discussion of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>The academic papers investigated in this study are those contained in the two weekly journals Nature 1 and Science 2 for five years from 2006 to 2010. Among the contents of the two journals, we only counted 'articles' and 'letters' in Nature and 'research articles' and 'reports' in Science in order to take into account original studies (cf. Isaac Newton Group webpage 3 ).</p><p>In this paper, we have used the term 'astronomy' to include both astronomy and astrophysics. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the basic statistics of the papers in the journals Nature and Science from 2006 to 2010. Dur-ing this period, 4004 papers were published in Nature, while 3784 papers were published in Science, with yearly mean numbers of 800 and 757, and weekly (i.e., per issue) mean numbers of 15.6 and 14.8, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Number of Papers</head><p>For the journal Nature, we have used the webpage of the Japanese table of contents, which shows a detailed field classification for each article. Using these classifications, we distributed each research field into two areas of life sciences and physical sciences, of which items are shown in the footnotes of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The second column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the yearly number of papers in each of these two main categories for the journal Nature.</p><p>The subject index of the journal Science's webpage gives three main classifications; life sciences, physical sciences, and other subjects. Astronomy is included in the physical sciences; 'other subjects' include education, economics, sociology, policy/research ethics, etc. The numbers of papers in each of these categories for each year are shown in the fourth column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>For the period of 2006 to 2010, there were 319 and 225 astronomy papers published in the journals Nature and Science, with yearly mean values of 64 and 45, respectively. The astronomy papers in Nature accounted for 8.0% and 24.1% of 'all' and 'physical sciences' papers, while those of Science accounted for 5.9% and 14.4%, respectively. These 544 (= 319 + 225) papers in astronomy for the journals Nature and Science comprise a total of 7.0% of the papers for 'all' research fields (N= 7788 = 4004 + 3784) and 18.9% of the papers for the fields of 'physical sciences' (N= 2885 = 1321 + 1564).</p><p>If we simply compare the fraction of astronomy papers among all science papers with the fraction of funds given to astronomy field among all research fields, the portion of astronomy papers among all science papers is greater than that of the fund given to astronomy among all the research related budgets. For example, in the case of the United States (we take the U.S. case as an example because it is not easy to get funding information for other countries), funds approved and disbursed by the National Science Foundation for the field of astronomy in 2011 were only 4.3% (236.6 million USD) of the research and related activities (R&amp;RA) fund of 5.56 billion USD 4 . All the more interesting is to note that astronomy papers make up almost one fifth of the physical science papers, which include all the natural Nature and Science Papers 3 sciences and engineering fields. This implies that astronomy has a greater impact on science and mankind and generates great interest from the general public. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the distribution of papers in the subfields of astronomy for the journals Nature and Science. The classification criterion has been set up by the authors and modified by comparing the results from the two journals. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the general distribution of the sub-fields. The data in this <ref type="figure">Figure shows</ref> that the order, sorted by number of papers, is Solar System, stellar astronomy, galaxies and the universe, the Milky Way Galaxy, and exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sub-fields in Astronomy</head><p>'Solar System' is the most studied sub-field in the two journals, with a percentage of 37.9%, followed by 'Stars' (11.4%), 'External Galaxies' (10.5%), 'Supernovae and Novae' (7.2%), 'Exoplanets' (7.0%), and so on ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>. 'Solar System' and 'Stars' comprise half of astronomy papers (see the sixth column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref>), while the five fields (Solar System, Stars, External Galaxies, Supernovae and Novae, and Exoplanets) make up three quarters.</p><p>Reasons why the field of 'Solar System' takes the largest portion of astronomy papers could be the following. The first reason could be the launches of several spacecrafts/satellites, which bring us much closer and more detailed views/information on Solar System objects. This is shown in the following subsection, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (a), the papers that used spacecrafts comprised 27.0% (147/544) of all the astronomy papers; and spacecrafts were used in 32.2% (147/457) of astronomy papers (excluding papers of 'no facility used'). Another reason might be the great interest of both scientists and the public in the neighborhood of our home planet, which extends from the Earth and Moon to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, and on to the far side of the Solar System, as well as to asteroids and comets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> show the statistics of the observational facilities used in the astronomy papers under consideration. When multiple facilities are used in a certain paper, we either (1) focused on the main facility which is presumed to have provided the most critical data for the research (e.g., taking the Very Large Telescope instead of the Keck Telescope in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gal-Yam et al. (2009)</ref>'s paper), or (2) took the larger (more expensive) facility over the smaller(cheaper) ones when they were used with similar importance (e.g., taking the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope instead of the 2.2 m/3.5 m telescopes at the Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory, in <ref type="bibr">Krause et al. (2008)</ref>). Although these selections can leave some ambiguities in certain cases, we assume that they do not significantly affect the distribution shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Facilities for Astronomy Papers</head><p>While 16.0% of papers did not use any noticeable facilities for their studies (e.g., theory, simulation), large (D &gt; 8 m) optical telescopes were dominantly used for the studies of 10.5% papers (combining Nature and Science). They are currently the largest facilities in optical wavebands. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows that the next most heavily-used facilities were spacecrafts to Saturn and Mars (14.9%) and space telescopes in the gamma-ray, optical, and infrared wavebands (15.8%). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (a) shows that the percentages of papers that used ground-based telescopes, spacecrafts, and space telescopes were 31.1%, 27.0%, and 22.8%, respectively, for all astronomy papers. Optical and radio &amp; sub-mm telescopes make up 69.2% and 23.7%, respectively, of all the ground-based telescopes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2 (b)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (c) shows that space telescopes of gamma-ray, optical, infrared, X-ray, and ultraviolet wavebands take 24.2%, 23.4%, 21.8%, 16.1%, and 3.2%, respectively.</p><p>Among the 105 papers that used ground-based optical telescopes, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2 (d)</ref>, the largest telescopes of D &gt; 8 m comprise 54.3% (N=57), while those of 3.0 ≤ D ≤ 4.2 m take 21.0% (N=22), those of D &lt; 3.0 m take 19.0% (N=20) and those of 5.0 ≤ D ≤ 6.5 m take 5.7% (N=6). The possible reason why groundbased optical telescopes of diameters between 5.0 m and 6.5 m take a lesser percentage of papers (1.1% among all the facilities in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>) than those of diameters between 3.0 m and 4.2 m (4.0%) or even those of diameters smaller than 3.0 m (3.7%) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2 (d)</ref>) could be the lower ( &lt; ∼ 1/3) number of telescopes for groundbased optical telescopes of diameters between 5.0 m and 6.5 m. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, among the groundbased optical telescopes, it is remarkable that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) project, operated with only one 2.5 m telescope, stands out with 2.2% of papers. This might result from a large survey program covering a quarter of the sky and the creation of 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars via both photometry and spec- <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-The distribution of subjects for papers published in the journals Nature and Science. 'Stellar astronomy' includes stars, supernovae, novae, star formation, and the Sun; 'galaxies &amp; universe' includes external galaxies, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, galaxy clusters, large scale structure, and cosmology; 'Milky Way' includes our Galaxy, star clusters, and interstellar matter; 'etc.' includes cosmic rays and instrumentation. This shows only the general trend and the exact order could change, depending on the classification criteria of each item.</p><p>Nature and Science Papers 5 troscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abazajian et al. , 2009)</ref>. Although the large fraction of ground-based optical telescopes of D &gt; 8 m <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2 (d)</ref>) could be somewhat biased, if at all, by the second criterion explained in the first paragraph of this subsection, it is still valuable to note that state-ofthe-art facilities and big science (e.g. space telescopes, ground-based optical telescopes of D &gt; 8 m) and dedicated facilities (e.g. SDSS, Cassini, Voyager, CoRoT) might be one of the critical factors to create high impact papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Papers by Koreans</head><p>For the papers published in Nature and Science from 2006 and 2010, we have probed the papers with Korean scientists in the author lists and show the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. We extracted papers with authors of Korean names and Korean affiliations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows that 86 papers (33 for Nature and 53 for Science) have Koreans as the authors, and among them seven papers (two for Nature and five for Science) are astronomy papers written by Korean astronomers. In total, Korean authors contributed 1.10% of the total 7788 papers published in the two journals. Astronomy papers by Korean authors (N= 7) make up 8.14% of the 86 papers by Korean scientists. While astronomy papers comprise 7.0% of the papers of 'all' research fields in the two journals Nature and Science, as can be seen in Section 3.1, this contribution of Korean astronomers to the Korean sciences (at least in the statistics of the two journals for the given period) shows a slightly higher percentage than the world normal. If we take only the first author and corresponding author papers, the rate even increases to 11.1% (5/45). <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> shows the number distribution of papers written by Korean scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry (including biochemistry), biology &amp; life science, earth sciences &amp; astronomy, and engineering (including materials science). Although biology &amp; life science is the field of most abundance and earth sciences &amp; astronomy is the field with least number of papers, the fraction of papers in biology &amp; life science in Korea (29.1%) is much lower than the fraction of this field in the world <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>; 4860/7788 = 62.4%). It is also worthwhile to note that astronomy papers make up two thirds (7/11) of the papers in the field of earth sciences &amp; astronomy.     <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> provides a detailed bibliography of the seven Nature and Science papers written by Korean astronomers from 2006 and 2010, of which five papers are with first/corresponding authors and the remaining two are with co-authors.</p><p>Among the seven papers, two <ref type="bibr">(Yoon, Yi, &amp; Lee , 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryu et al. , 2008</ref>) used no observational facilities; two papers that used GALEX 5 as the main facility ( <ref type="bibr">Schawinski et al. , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">Schawinski et al. , , 2008</ref>) actually used multiple facilities; one paper <ref type="bibr">(Lee, Park, &amp; Hwang , 2010</ref>) used the SDSS data; and the remaining two papers ( <ref type="bibr">Lee et al. , 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gaudi et al. , 2008</ref>) used small optical telescopes of 1 m class. This status of facilities used by Korean astronomers reflects well the current situation of facilities for the Korean astronomical community, and shows (1) participation in one space project (GALEX), (2) use of small ground-based optical telescopes (CTIO 1.0 m and Mt. Lemmon 1.0 m telescopes), (3) use of public archive data (SDSS), and (4) studies without any noticeable facilities. Since the tools that we use to look at the Universe are essential in astronomical studies, as can be seen in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, construction of or participation in more facilities/projects will bring a greater number of Nature and Science papers in the future.</p><p>While the sub-fields of the seven Nature and Science papers published by Korean astronomers are diverse, it is interesting that three (43%) out of seven papers are on 'star clusters'. It is true, in general, that scientists with more and better facilities produce more and better papers. Nevertheless, considering the fact that these three papers did not use any of the current largest (or most expensive) facilities, this statistic shows that excellence in scholarship is another indispensable element in its own way. 5 Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite astronomy papers comprise 7.0% of the papers for 'all' research fields and 18.9% of the papers for the fields of 'physical sciences' in the two journals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Summary and Discussion</head><p>The sub-fields of study for these astronomy papers are as follows: 'Solar System' (37.9%) and 'Stars' (11.4%) comprise half of the astronomy papers, while the five fields of Solar System, Stars, External Galaxies, Supernovae and Novae, and Exoplanets make up three quarters.</p><p>While 16% of the astronomy papers did not use any noticeable facilities for their research, spacecrafts, space telescopes, and ground-based telescopes were used for 27.0%, 22.8%, and 31.1%, respectively. Such spacecrafts, which explore in detail objects in the Solar System, might have been an important factor in increasing the large number of the research papers in this field. Space telescopes are mainly those in the gammaray (24.2%), optical (23.4%), infrared (21.8%), and Xray (16.1%) wavebands; ground-based telescopes are largely optical (69.2%) and radio (23.7%) telescopes. The largest (D &gt; 8 m) ground-based optical telescopes produced the greatest number of Nature and Science papers (57/105, 54.3%) among all ground-based telescopes. While this value could be affected somewhat, if not much, by one of the facility-selection criteria in Section 3.3 (taking the larger facility as the primary facility for the paper when one large and one small facilities are used in equal amounts), it seems that the order of importance among the ground-based optical telescopes would not change.</p><p>From the 4004 Nature and 3784 Science papers, we have extracted 86 papers by Korean authors with Korean affiliations. Among these 86 papers, seven astronomy papers (two in Nature and five in Science) are included, making up 8.14% of the 86 Korean papers. While 'astronomy' papers comprise 7.0% of the papers for 'all' the research fields of the journals Nature and Science, Korean astronomers appear to contribute slightly more (8.14%) to all Korean papers in these two journals.</p><p>We anticipate that these results might be used, at least, for establishing criteria to assess leading research groups (especially for astronomy fields), and estimating future production of Nature and Science papers.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 S</head><label>2</label><figDesc>.
