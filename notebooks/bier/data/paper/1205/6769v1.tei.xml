				<p>We present the results from a search of data from the first 33.5 days of the Kepler science mission (Quarter 1) for exoplanet transits by the Planet Hunters citizen science project. Planet Hunters enlists members of the general public to visually identify tran-sits in the publicly released Kepler light curves via the World Wide Web. Over 24,000 volunteers reviewed the Kepler Quarter 1 data set. We examine the abundance of ≥ 2 R ⊕ planets on short period (&lt; 15 days) orbits based on Planet Hunters detections. We present these results along with an analysis of the detection efficiency of human classifiers to identify planetary transits including a comparison to the Kepler inventory of planet candidates. Although performance drops rapidly for smaller radii, ≥ 4 R ⊕ Planet Hunters ≥ 85% efficient at identifying transit signals for planets with periods less than 15 days for the Kepler sample of target stars. Our high efficiency rate for simulated transits along with recovery of the majority of Kepler ≥4 R ⊕ planets suggest suggests the Kepler inventory of ≥4 R ⊕ short period planets is nearly complete.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the past nearly two decades, there has been an explosion in the number of known planets orbiting stars beyond our own solar system, with over 700 extrasolar planets (exoplanets) known was also found to be an important factor, with cool stars more likely to host planets.</p><p>These results naturally depend on the performance of the Kepler transit detection and vetting processes. There remains a pressing need for an independent assessment of the ability of the combined automated TPS pipeline and data validation process to recover candidates. The Kepler light curves are complex, with many exhibiting significant structure which includes multiple oscillations as well as quasi-periodic oscillations and short-lived variations. Traditional transit searches and validation techniques looking for a periodic signal may potentially miss transit signals that are dominated by the natural variability of the star or the Kepler light curves may have artifacts or other systematics that might potentially compromise automatic fitting routines. We employ a novel method of searching for transit signals in the Kepler light curves via visual inspection. The human brain is a superb pattern recognition device and with minimal training can often outperform the most sophisticated machine learning devices and perform tasks not easily adapted to computer algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Simpson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Khatib 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dashti et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lintott et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lintott et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Méndez 2008)</ref>. The detection of transits is essentially an exercise in pattern recognition, and is thus ideally suited to human classification. Transits that may be missed by traditional transit detection and vetting techniques may be identified by the human eye; highlighted by the serendipitous detection of a previously unknown transiting brown dwarf found by visual inspection of the Kepler light curves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Johnson et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>While classifying light curves from 150,000 stars would be beyond any single classifier, by using the World Wide Web it is possible to gather multiple independent assessments of the same data set. This approach also allows for a careful analysis of the reliability of any individual classification. With Planet Hunters <ref type="bibr">1 (Fischer et al. 2012</ref>), part of the Zooniverse 2 collection of citizen science projects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lintott et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lintott et al. , 2008</ref>, the Kepler light curves have been reviewed by eye for the signatures of extrasolar planets collectively by more than 173,000 volunteers to date with over 24,000 citizen scientists participating in the analysis presented here. Although novel in the search for exoplanets, human classification and crowd-sourcing citizen science have been applied to a wide range of astronomical applications including the morphological classification of galaxies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lintott et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lintott et al. , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Land et al. 2008</ref>), the search for supernovae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Smith et al. 2011</ref>), the identification of solar coronal mass ejections ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davis et al. 2012</ref>), cataloging of star forming regions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Simpson et al. 2012</ref>), and cratering counts on the Moon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Joy et al. 2011</ref>) in the Zooniverse suite of projects, as well as for discovery of solar grains entrapped in aerogel collected by the Stardust mission <ref type="bibr">(Méndez 2008)</ref>, and cratering counts on Mars <ref type="bibr">(Méndez 2008</ref>).</p><p>The success of the Planet Hunters has already been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref>, who report, in a preliminary search of Kepler Quarter 1 light curves, the discovery and follow-up of two new planet candidates which were not identified as planet candidates in the Kepler team's analysis of the first four months of Kepler observations. Transits in the light curves of KIC 10905746 and KIC 6185331 were detected by TPS but failed to pass the data verification stage and therefore not promoted to KOI status ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. 2012</ref>). These discoveries, interesting in themselves, illustrate the desirability of an independent check on the Kepler team's planet transit detection and validation scheme.</p><p>This paper presents an independent assessment of the Kepler planet inventory, examining the abundance of ≥ 2 R ⊕ planets on short period (&lt; 15 days) orbits in the first 33.5 days of Kepler science observations (quarter 1), based on the classifications gathered from Planet Hunters. We detail how the classifications were obtained and processed and present our candidate detection scheme. We also assess the detection efficiency of the Planet Hunters project including a comparison to the Kepler inventory of planet candidates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Planet Hunters</head><p>The Planet Hunters interface presents the volunteer with a single 33.5-day Q1 light curve for a given star, plotting the star's relative brightness <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 1</ref>). Error bars representing the 1-sigma measurement uncertainties are also displayed in the interface. The default setting is to show the entire 33.5 days at once. Volunteers have the ability to freely zoom the time axis or to scan the curve while zoomed in. A button allows the zoom on the y-axis (relative brightness) to automatically be adjusted to an appropriate level. The y-axis range spans from the minimum value to the mean level plus three times the standard deviation. The display is then adjusted to 5-85% of that range; this was found experimentally to produce a good result for the majority of curves.</p><p>Visitors to the Planet Hunters site can begin classifying almost immediately. Basic training is provided via an inline interface, accessible with a single click from the Planet Hunters home page. A sample light curve with example simulated transits is shown before volunteers can review real light curves. More detailed training material is also available elsewhere on the site. It is possible to train and then to take part in the project without registering a Zooniverse account, although volunteers who are not logged in will receive repeated reminders to register. The site is designed so that volunteers are unable to select which curve to classify in order to minimize the risk of deliberate manipulation of input data. Light curves are prioritized according to the stellar properties and previous classifications as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref>. To ensure the volunteers have no prior knowledge about a given light curve that may effect their judgment, the KIC identifier is not revealed during classification; only an approximation of the star's stellar temperature, radius, and magnitude are presented to the reviewer.</p><p>Classification proceeds via a decision tree, as detailed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The first series of questions produce a coarse categorization of the light curve's variability which is primarily intended to assist in identifying transits and in identifying any gaps or defects in the light curve that may have been introduced during the PDC process, typically due to removing a cosmic ray event ( <ref type="bibr">Jenkins et al 2009)</ref>. If the light curve has no visible gaps, volunteers are asked to categorize the star as 'variable' or 'quiet'. If the star is deemed variable, the volunteer is further prompted to characterize the variability as: 'regular' (showing periodic repeating pattern), 'pulsating' (rapid variations observed in star's brightness on the timescales of a few hours to days), or 'irregular' when no discernible pattern is seen. Representative light curves for each variability class are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>Volunteers are then asked to mark any transit features visible in the light curve. Clicking a button produces a box on the light curve <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 1</ref>) positioned in the center of the review interface which can then be moved and resized. If necessary, more than one box can be added to each curve, and transits marked in error can be removed. The current zoom level of the interface determines the default box size. The box width and height initially correspond respectively to 1/8th the xaxis range and half the y-axis range displayed. A second version of the interface, introduced on 2011 Jan 31, allows in addition for transit boxes of any size to be drawn directly onto the curve, without the need to click a button first. In the upgraded interface, if a transit box already exists when the button to add a new transit box is clicked, a box with the same dimensions as the one previously made is generated. To aid in refining the transit box dimensions, with a single click the improved interface will automatically center on a selected transit box, zooming in to a width twice the size of the region highlighted by the specific transit box. Due to the way that transit boxes are presented on the screen, only approximately eighteen boxes can be placed without hiding the button to submit the classification, effectively creating a limit on the number of transits that can be identified. This issue only significantly affects the marking of transits from planets with orbital periods less than ∼2 days.</p><p>Classifications are stored in a live Structured Query Language (SQL) database. For each entry question in the decision tree, the time stamp, user identification, light curve identifier, and response are recorded. If transit boxes are drawn, the position of the box center, width, and height of each box are recorded as well. Each of the 156,092 Q1 light curves is examined and classified multiple times, by normally 10 and at least 5 classifiers including both logged-in and unregistered users before being retired and removed from circulation. The variability and gap questions are only asked of those volunteers registered with a Zooniverse account; non-logged in classifiers are asked only to identify transit-like features. Before the first classification and subsequently after every 5 classifications, a non-logged classifier is reminded to create a Zooniverse account. If the user registers, subsequent classifications are attributed to the user in the classification database, but previously made classifications are labeled as from a non-logged in user.</p><p>Once the classification is submitted, the Planet Hunters internal designation for the light curve is revealed to the user. Classifiers are then asked if they would like to discuss the particular light curve on the Planet Hunters Talk site <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Each Q1 light curve has a dedicated page where users can write comments, add searchable Twitter-like hash tags, and link similar light curves together. This system is useful in identifying objects of particular interest and unusual light curves that are difficult to find via automatic classification schemes, a complement to the systematic analysis described here.</p><p>110,997(71%) of the Kepler Q1 light curves were completed with the original version of the interface and decision tree launched on 2010 December 16. We note that on 2011 Feb 1, the decision tree was modified for the inclusion of Kepler Quarter 2 data. All Quarter 2 light curves presented in the Planet Hunters interface have missing data gaps due to safe mode events or the Kepler spacecraft pointing towards Earth to transmit data. In the original interface, the light curve variability questions were skipped if the user had identified a gap in the light curve. The decision tree was modified such that if there was a gap in the light curve the variability questions would still be asked. In subsequent changes on 2011 March 9, the gap question was removed entirely. The responses to the gap question are not used in identifying possible planet candidates. 7,759 light curves received classifications after 2011 May 1 when the majority of the light curves presented in the classification interface were Quarter 2 Kepler light curves. The appearance and quality of the Quarter 2 observations is different from that of Quarter 1 which may make Q1 light curves identifiable to more experienced users. We address the introduction of Q2 light curves on Q1 classifications and the impact of the interface modifications on the user responses and behavior in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Synthetic Transits</head><p>In order to characterize our detection efficiency, simulated transit events were injected into a subset of the Kepler light curves and presented on the Planet Hunters classification interface. Synthetic transit light curves were created from the Q1 light curves randomly sampling from the 156,097 publicly released long cadence light curves excluding known Kepler planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2011b</ref>), transit false positives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2011b</ref>), and known eclipsing binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Prša et al. 2011</ref>) available online as of 2011 April 6 . A total of 6494 synthetic light curves were created. Simulations were divided into 7 radii bins from 2-15 R ⊕ and 6 orbital period bins between 0.5 and 15 days. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> details the number of synthetic light curves generated for each radii and period bin.</p><p>Synthetic transit points are implanted into the Kepler light curve by subtracting the amount of flux decremented during the transit, following the equations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Winn (2010)</ref> for transit depth and duration and assuming no limb darkening. We neglect inclination and eccentricity effects assuming circular edge on orbits as viewed from Earth. We do not adjust the measurement flux errors for data points implanted with the transit event, providing a conservative and slight overestimate of the Poisson measurement noise. The starting time of the first injected transit is randomly chosen between the starting time of the light curve and one orbital period later. Each simulation has at least two injected transits present in the light curve.</p><p>We adopt the stellar radii and surface gravity (i.e. log(g)) values reported in the Kepler Input Catalog 7 (KIC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) to compute the stellar mass and the transit depth. The KIC uses multi-band color photometry to distinguish between main sequence dwarf and cool giant stars in the Kepler field. The KIC performs this task reasonably well with only a small fraction of the catalog estimated to be giants misidentified as dwarf stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Koch et al. 2010</ref>). The KIC provides a first estimate of the stellar properties of the Kepler target stars, with log(g) reliable to within 0.4 dex with a 0.25 dex rms in comparison to high resolution spectra taken for a subsample of KIC stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. 2011</ref>). The reported uncertainty for the KIC stellar radii varies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. (2011)</ref> note that subgiants misidentified as main sequences stars may have their radii underestimated by as much as a factor of 1.5-2. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard et al. (2011)</ref>, stellar radii are reliable within an rms of 35%, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. (2011b)</ref> quoting errors in stellar diameters as high as 25%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Verner et al. (2011)</ref> find that the KIC systematically underestimates stellar radii by as much as 50% for stars with radii less than 1 R ⊙ . Given this large uncertainty in the KIC values and differences in the reported error estimates, we assume the KIC is representative of the bulk properties of the Kepler stars and simply employ the KIC calculated stellar parameters in the same manner as other previous works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Latham et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The simulations are presented to logged-in users only and classified in the exact same manner as the real light curves. After the classification is submitted, the user is notified that the light curve was simulated with the injected transit points identified. We note that the simulations were classified on the Planet Hunters site after the completion of the majority of the Q1 light curves and were presented alongside the Quarter 2 light curves in the second version of the classification interface. Quarter 2 is substantially and notably different in data quality than Q1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Christiansen et al. 2011</ref>). However, we expect these effects to be small and the complete simulation set to be a good test of volunteer behavior on the entire Q1 data set. We discuss the impact of these effects and detection efficiency further in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Selecting Transit Candidates</head><p>In this section we detail our algorithm for combining the individual classifications received for each light curve and the selection pipeline developed to produce a final catalog of transit candidates. Each light curve in our sample was examined and classified multiple times, with a minimum of 5 and a mean of 10 independent classifications. In total, 1,687,547 individual classifications were generated searching the Q1 data and examining the synthetic light curves. 24,300 registered volunteers made 98% of those responses, with the remaining 2% from unregistered volunteers. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> plots the distribution of user classifications for registered users. As is common for online projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zachte 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crowston &amp; Fagnot 2008)</ref>, most volunteers typically classify only a few light curves, a median of 5 and mean of 68 light curves. 47% of logged-in users have classified fewer than 5 Q1 light curves. Only 10% of classifiers have made more than 100 classifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">User Weighting</head><p>Rather than combining results from all classifiers equally in a majority vote, the first step in converting the raw classifications to transit candidates is to determine a user weighting. The weighting scheme distinguishes those classifiers who are more sensitive to identifying transits and less prone to providing false positives in order to consider their responses more heavily than others when selecting transit candidates. We evaluate the ability of each classifier and assign a weight based on their tendency to agree with the majority opinion and for those who classified the synthetic light curves, on their performance identifying the simulated transit events. We follow a modified prescription developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lintott et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Land et al. (2008)</ref> for user weighting based on the visual morphological classifications of galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project.</p><p>We assign user weights in a two stage process. Initially, all users start out equal, with a weight of unity. We then use the results of the synthetic light curves to seed the initial weighting for those users that classified a synthetic light curve. From the synthetic transits we have a direct evaluation of an individual user's ability to identify transits for a given planet radii and orbital period. Only logged-in users are served synthetic light curves to classify. 6,307 (26% percent) of the registered Q1 volunteers examined at least one synthetic light curve. A median of 2 and a mean of 10 simulations were classified by those 6307 volunteers. For every synthetic light curve and classifier who viewed the simulation, we evaluate how well the user identified the injected transits events. The synthetic transit is deemed marked if the middle of the injected event is within one of the user boxes drawn. A given user-drawn box only counts once. If the user draws a single box around two simulated transits, credit is only given for successfully identifying one transit.</p><p>For each simulation a user classifies, his or her weight is incremented by the fraction of markable transits correctly identified. Typically the number of markable transits is the number of synthetic transits present in the light curve but for those few simulations with more than 18 transits (only 14% of the total) where marking more would cause the submit button to disappear effectively limiting the transits that can be identified, the maximum number of markable transits is set to 18, and the weight of any volunteer who correctly marked 18 or more transits is increased by one. If no synthetic transits are marked, the user weight is decreased by 0.2 times the fraction of the simulation's classifiers who marked at least one transit on the simulated light curve. User weights are normalized such that the maximum user weight attainable, if all synthetic transits seen were identified correctly, is 2. Thus the weighting scheme rewards more heavily users who mark correctly the majority of the injected transits and down-weights users more significantly for missing easily identifiable transits and less so for harder to perceive transit depths.</p><p>At this point, user weights have only been modified for those logged-in users who have classified at least one synthetic light curve. All other registered volunteers still have an initial user weight of 1. We next use an iterative scheme to assign weightings to all users based on the responses for all the real Q1 light curves. We divide user responses into two classes: 'transit' or 'no transit' based only on whether or not a user drew a transit box. For a given Kepler star i and for each class j, a score s i (j), is then calculated. We define s i (j) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s i (j) = 1 W i k w k k=users who voted j for light curve i (1)</formula><p>where W i is the sum of the users weights for all the users who classified light curve i. We then update w k , the weight of user k based on the calculated light curve transit scores (s i (j)). A user whose behavior is in line with the majority weighted vote will be rewarded and up-weighted, whereas those that disagree with the majority opinion will be down-weighted. We adjust w k as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w k = A N k i</formula><p>s i (j for light curve i chosen by user k) i= all light curves reviewed by user k (2) where N k is the number of Q1 light curves classified by user k, and scaling factor A is chosen to be such that the mean user weight remains at 1.</p><p>The light curve scoring and updating of the user weights is iterated until convergence is achieved, when the median absolute difference between the old and updated user weights is less than or equal to 1x10 −4 . Classifications from non-logged in users are included in the weighting scheme to calibrate the other logged-in users but all non-logged in users are effectively treated in the weighting scheme as a single user with an unchanging weight of 1. All users have final weights greater than zero with 55% of the logged-in users having values greater than or equal to 1. The final distribution of user weights is plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Candidate Selection</head><p>Once a user weighting solution has been found, the Q1 light curves are searched for transit candidates. In this analysis, our search focuses on the identification of planet candidates with radii greater than 2 R ⊕ and orbital periods less than 15 days. From this point forward, the synthetic light curves are treated in exactly the same as the real Kepler light curves. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes the candidate selection process and the number of light curves and simulations remaining at each step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Transit Score</head><p>We use the 'transit' scores, s i (transit), for each of the Kepler light curves as a measure of the light curve's likelihood to have a planet transit. Each synthetic light curve is scored using the previously calculated user weights to determine s i (transit). We plot the cumulative distribution of transit scores for the Q1 Kepler light curves and simulations in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>We aim to include as many possible transit candidates without the number of false positives light curves overwhelming the list. A cut in s i ( transit) is made to create the initial list of potential transit candidates. This threshold was chosen after visual inspection of a random subset of the remaining light curves and light curves with transit-like events detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref> previously found during a preliminary search through the Q1 data set. The science team found that at s i ( transit) = 0.5 the false positives were overwhelming the number of candidate transit detections. Therefore we select our potential planet candidates as those light curves with s i ( transit) &gt; 0.5. 5,511 (3.5%) of the Kepler light curves have s i ( transit) greater than 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Removing Single Transit Events</head><p>We restrict our search to transiting planets with periods less than 15 days where there will be at least two transit events present in Q1. The 50% transit score threshold only discriminates between the likelihood of the light curve having a transit or not, and is not dependent on the number of transits present in the light curve. There will inevitability be light curves with single transit-like events due to longer period transiting planets (orbital periods greater than 15 days) and primary transits from eclipsing binaries with orbital periods greater than 15 days where the secondary eclipse will occur in future quarters of Kepler data. We remove the most obvious of these single transit-like events from our candidates list, discarding light curves where a single transit box was drawn by all classifiers who identified transits. Of the 5,508 candidates, 570 light curves were removed by this cut. These cut light curves were separately analyzed for potential transits and the first candidates from that analysis are further discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lintott et al. (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Light Curve Variability</head><p>Visual inspection of the remaining candidate light curves revealed that a significant portion were pulsators, light curves which exhibit rapid variations in the star's brightness on the timescales of a few hours to days. Many classifiers mistook the individual pulsations for transits. To further cull the candidates list of these false positives, we assess the light curve variability on timescales less than 33 days, placing a more stringent transit score threshold for the pulsating light curves.</p><p>While classifying, users are asked to broadly characterize the observed variability of the Q1 systematic error-corrected light curves as described in Section 3. We note this may not reflect a true assessment of the stars' intrinsic astrophysical variability. The Pre-Search Data Conditioning (PDC) applied to the raw Kepler light curves may remove real astrophysical signals from, and potentially inject high-frequency signals, into the light curves when correcting for instrumental systematics and optimizing the light curves for transit detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(van Cleave 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jenkins et al. 2010b</ref>). The Planet Hunters variability assessment serves as an evaluation of the bulk properties of the Q1 light curve sample rather than the properties of individual Kepler target stars.</p><p>We first group the light curves into quiet and variable classes, then further subdividing the variable stars into pulsating, regular, and irregular. We combine together the multiple user classifications by simply taking the majority, selecting the variability class with the highest fraction of votes. If the light curve has less than 3 classifications or a majority is not reached, we deem the light curve unclassified. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> summarizes the variability properties of the Q1 light curves based on Planet Hunters classifications. The majority of the Kepler light curves, 65.6% are quiet with the bulk of the variable stars being classified as pulsators (48.9% of variable light curves, 16.5% of the full sample).</p><p>The majority answer does not necessarily mean the proper identification of the light curve's variability. Little direct instruction is provided to the user when categorizing the light curve's variability. The inline tutorial does not address the variability questions asked in decision tree, instead focusing on the identification of planet transits, but there are prototypes for each variability class in the help material that is accessible to the user by a single click during classifying. <ref type="bibr">McQuillan</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  4</ref> we compare the variability fractions from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ciardi et al. (2011)</ref> to this work. Like Ciardi et al. (2011) we only examine stars that have KIC entries for radius and temperature. We observe the same trend of light curve variability decreasing with increasing magnitude with 49.6% of stars with instrumental magnitudes less than 14 in our sample deemed variable. This is to be expected as measurement precision is highest for the brightest stars in the sample.</p><p>The variability fractions of the light curves with transit scores greater than 0.5 are detailed in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Only 497, or 10%, of the candidate light curves had too few classifications to secure variability identifications. The pulsators are overrepresented in the candidates, composing 36% the sample, nearly double the amount in the entire sample as a whole, confirming the results from visual inspection of the candidates. It is not surprising that the largest source of false positives in our candidates list would be due to pulsators. With the user classifications producing an accurate picture of Q1 light curve variability, we can use the Planet Hunters variability identifications to place a more stringent threshold for pulsators and remove pulsator light curves with transit scores less than 0.8 from the remaining list of planet candidates. Of the 4938 candidates, 1534 light curves were removed by this variability cut.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Round 2 Review</head><p>After the series of cuts described above, 3404 candidate light curves and 4974 simulations remain, including a mixture of eclipsing binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Prša et al. 2011</ref>), Kepler planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2011b</ref>), transit false positives, and potentially previously unidentified planet candidates. Planets with periods less than 15 days will have at least two transits during the Q1 observations. In the analysis presented here, we are only interested in those light curves with two or more identified transits. The current selection criteria only determine whether or not transits are likely to present in a given light curve, not identifying the number of visible transits found by the Planet Hunters classifiers. In order to sort through the remaining list of candidates and identify those light curves with at least two transits, a second classification interface was built and second round of review performed.</p><p>In this simplified interface, the full 33.5-day light curve is plotted with the same horizontal and vertical range as presented in the main classification interface To assist the reviewer, the positions of all the user-drawn transit boxes are overlaid on the light curve in blue such that regions where there is more overlap between the transit boxes are shaded darker. Reviewers can toggle on and off the plotting of the transit box locations with a click of a button. The light curve is presented as a static image; Round 2 reviewers are not able to zoom in or adjust the resolution of the light curve like the main classification interface. Both real and simulated light curves are presented and reviewed blindly by the screeners. Unlike the main classification interface, simulated light curves are not identified after classification.</p><p>Screeners for the Round 2 review were recruited from the Planet Hunters Talk site and through a blog post. These volunteers are asked if the presented light curve has two or more transits. The volunteer has three possible responses: 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe'. In Round 2, the reviewers are not asked to determine whether the transits are due to a single planet or to identify possible secondary eclipses within the light curve. Instead we instruct the user to ignore whether the transits have the same depth in the tutorial information and ask them to focus only on the number of transit-like events identifiable in the light curve.</p><p>Round 2 review was performed in two stages; the first in September 2011 and the second in February 2012. A much smaller number of classifiers examined the light curves in Round 2 review interface compared to the total number of individuals who reviewed Q1 light curves and simulations in the main Planet Hunters interface. 137 volunteers participated in Round 2 review. Every candidate light curve and simulation received at least 5 and an average of 9 independent classifications. A total of 75,291 classifications were made in the Round 2 review interface with volunteers examining an average of 550 and median of 75 light curves and simulations. The majority of Round 2 classifiers are experienced users, having classified a median number of 177 Q1 classifications, with 55% of the Round 2 reviewers having classified more than 100 Q1 light curves and simulations. Only 25 of the Round 2 reviewers had not previously classified a Q1 light curve. 72% of the classifiers have user weights greater than or equal to 1; therefore, we choose to simply tally the number of responses for each answer choice ('yes', 'no', 'maybe'). If the candidate light curve received a majority of 'yes' votes, the light curve is passed on for further review and scrutiny by the Planet Hunters science team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Planet Candidates</head><p>In total 1220 light curves, 0.78% of the Q1 light curves, were passed on for further inspection. We note one light curve, KIC 8953426, which is a known eclipsing binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Prša et al. 2011</ref>), did not receive Round 2 review due to a processing error but was passed on with the other remaining candidates to inspection by the Planet Hunters science team. At this stage, we identify and remove reported eclipsing binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Prša et al. 2011</ref> The Planet Hunters science team reviewed the 75 remaining light curves, first verifying there were at least two transits present in the light curve. For those candidates with multiple transits visible, the Quarters 2-6 light curves were next inspected to confirm repeat transits in subsequent quarters. We note that Quarters 2-5 light curves are currently being analyzed by the Planet Hunters community. Odd/even transits were checked for depth to remove obvious unlisted eclipsing binaries. We also examined the Kepler target stars surrounding each of the remaining light curves for nearby eclipsing binaries that could be contaminating the photometric aperture and mimicking transit-like signals in the candidate light curve. If the transit times are correlated with that of a known eclipsing binary light curve in the vicinity or after examination of the individual pixel by pixel light curves for the star with PyKE 8 it can be seen that only a small subset of pixels exhibit the transit features, the candidate is deemed a false positive. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> details the outcome of the review. 23 sources, including a known RR Lyrae star (KIC 6186029, Benk˝ o et al. 2010), did not have two or more visible multiple transit-like events in the Q1 light curve or were data processing glitches. 18 light curves did not have repeats in subsequent quarters of data, and 27 light curves have alternating transit depths indicating they are likely to be previously unknown eclipsing binaries or have transits correlated with an nearby eclipsing binary contaminating the photometric aperture. This left only 7 surviving candidates (KIC 551108, 6616218, 8240797, 9729691, 10905746 11017901, 11551692) from our review not identified as KOIs in the Kepler analysis of Quarters 0-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2011b</ref>). All 7 candidates have been subsequently identified in later runs of an updated version of TPS and data validation pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tenenbaum et al. 2012</ref>) and promoted to KOI status by the Kepler team during a multi-quarter TPS analysis of Quarters 1-6 and data validation using products from Quarters 1-8 (Batalha 2012-private communication, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>).Additionally KIC 5511081, 6616218, 8240797, 9729691, 11551692 have been subsequently identified by the Kepler team as multiplanet systems with at least one ≥ 1.9R ⊕ planet candidate orbiting the host star in less than 15 days.</p><p>All seven light curves are plotted in Figures 7 and 8. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> we provide a zoom-in of a chosen transit for each set of transits identified in the 7 light curves. Visually the science team could identify two separate sets of repeating transits in the mutli-planet KIC 8240797, 9729691, and 11551692 based on the user drawn boxes. We note that KIC 10905746 is a short period planet candidate first reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref>, found in a preliminary search of the Planet Hunters Q1 classifications. The second planet candidate reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref> was not in this analysis since it has a period of 40 days with only a single transit in Q1. Additionally KIC 5511081 was also identified as a planet candidate by Planet Hunters in an preliminary search of Q2 data as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lintott et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al.

All 7 light curves were flagged as having potential transits with the multi-quarter TPS analysis of  <ref type="formula">(2012)</ref> report that KIC 10905746 was identified by TPS but the automatic light curve fitting failed to converge to a solution and the star was rejected. 4 of the 7 systems have two transiting planets with periods less than 15 days, this may have been an additional factor. Regardless, for the exact reason these candidates were not initially identified, they are now KOIs by the multi-quarter TPS and upgraded data validation scheme detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tenenbaum et al. (2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Detection Efficiency</head><p>In this section, we discuss the detection efficiency of Planet Hunters for finding short period planets with radii larger than or equal to 2 R ⊕ and periods less than 15 days. We first assess the performance based on the detection of our sample of simulated transit light curves and then compare to the known sample of Kepler planet candidates. We explore the potential biases that may effect user responses and behavior and their impact on the calculated detection efficiency in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Synthetic efficiency</head><p>Simulations were processed and screened by Planet Hunters users in a similar manner to the real Kepler light curves, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarize the simulation light curves that were retained at each stage in the planet candidate selection process. Those synthetic light curves that survived the transit score threshold, the single transit removal step, and the variability cut were shown in the Round 2 review. The simulations were shown with real light curves and at this stage users were not notified which light curves had injected transits or which ones were real Kepler light curves.</p><p>To estimate the detection efficiency, we bin the simulations into the same radii and period bins used to generate the light curves. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref> (with Poissonian 68% errors as prescribed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kraft et al. 1991</ref>) and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7</ref> present the recovery rates for the 6494 generated synthetic light curves. We deem a simulation recovered if the synthetic light curve successfully passed Round 2 review stage. We find that greater than or equal to 4 R ⊕ , independent of orbital period, Planet Hunters is ≥ 85% efficient at detecting short period planet transits. The detection efficiency begins to drop at 3-4 R ⊕ to 75% and for the 2-3 R ⊕ bin 40% of the synthetic light curves were recovered. For the larger planet radii bins in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>, the majority of the missed simulations were around ≥ 2 R ⊙ stars where the transit depths are as low as those for &lt; 3 R ⊕ planets around solar radii stars. For all the radii bins, the detection efficiency was relatively insensitive to orbital period. We note that we injected into a random sampling from the Q1 light curves including giant stars, thus our synthetic recovery rate represents the Planet Hunters detection efficiency for the overall Kepler target star sample.</p><p>We find that our detection efficiency is independent of the number of transits present in the light curve. Classifiers are are just as likely to identify and mark transits in a light curve if there are 2 or 18 transits visible. With our detection efficiency independent of orbital period, we can examine the recovery rate as a function of the relative transit depth for the synthetic light curves. The transit depth is the true observable in the light curve, depending on both the planet radius and radius of the host star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 11</ref> presents the recovery rate of synthetic light curves as a function of the relative transit depth of the injected transits binned with a bin size of 3x10 −4 for transits with depths less than 0.005. We find as expected, detection efficiency drops at small transit depths. Beyond a relative depth of 0.0013 (relative transit depth of a ∼4 R ⊕ planet around 1R ⊙ star), nearly all the simulated light curves are recovered. 3326 (97%) of the 3417 synthetic light curves generated with transit depths larger the 0.0013 pass the candidate selection process and Round 2 review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison with the Kepler Planet Candidates</head><p>A natural comparison to make is to the known list of KOIs identified by the Kepler team's detection scheme. Our candidate detection scheme was not tested or tuned to specifically identify known Kepler planet candidates. Thus we can use the population of known KOIs to serve as an additional check of the Planet Hunters detection sensitivity. We divide the KOIs into the same 7 radii bins ranging in 2-15 R ⊕ and 6 orbital periods bins between 0.5 and 15 days as used to generate the synthetic light curves. Of the 1235 KOIs identified in the first two quarters of Kepler observations, 408 planet candidates are associated with multi-transit systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borucki et al. 2011b</ref>). Very few of the multiplanet systems satisfy our criteria where we can be certain a single set of transits in Q1 were identifiable to a Planet Hunters classifier, therefore we restrict our analysis to only those currently identified to reside in single planet systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al. (2011)</ref>. 330 KOIs fit our criteria and are used in our analysis presented here. We note that KOI 01.01 was missing from our Q1 sample of light curves and was not examined by Planet Hunters classifiers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 12</ref> plots the Planet Hunters efficiency for the Kepler sample of short period planets. Error bars are taken as the Poissonian 68% uncertainty (as prescribed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kraft et al. (1991)</ref> ) for the value in each radii/period bin. The number of planet candidates and the number recovered by Planet Hunters is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 8</ref>. The KOI was deemed detected if it passed the Round 2 review process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref> had visually inspected the classifications from the 306 Kepler planet candidates announced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2010a)</ref> finding that 2/3rds of the 1371 transits with planet radii between 1 and 10 R ⊕ were flagged by Planet Hunters users with only 10% of transit boxes marking spurious detections. From the past visual inspection and low spurious detection rate, we are therefore confident that at least one of the appropriate KOI transits in each of the Planet Hunters candidate KOI light curves was identified. We note that majority of our comparison sample of KOIs are lost due to the transit score threshold cut with Round 2 review eliminating only 21 light curves and the pulsator variability removing only 2 KOIs.</p><p>Although the error bars are large, we find that above 4 R ⊕ , Planet Hunters is &gt; 80% efficient at identifying transits. We also observe the same trend observed in the simulations. Less than 4 R ⊕ the detection efficiency drops with a 20% reported efficiency for the 2-3 R ⊕ KOIs. Beyond 4 R ⊕ , the KOI recovery rates are in agreement with the detection efficiency measured for the injected transits. Additionally we see the same result we reported for the simulated transits, the detection efficiency is relatively insensitive to the number of transits present in the light curve. The largest discrepancy occurs in the 2-3 R ⊕ bin, where only 20% of the Kepler planet candidates are recovered. 40% of the simulated 2-3 R ⊕ light curves were identified by Planet Hunters classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">2-3 R ⊕ Detection Efficiency</head><p>To further explore this discrepancy between the KOI recovery rate and the synthetic detection efficiency in the 2-3 R ⊕ bin, we examine the detection efficiency as a function of relative transit depth for the 144 Kepler and 1799 synthetic 2-3 R ⊕ light curves. We expect that if the classifiers are able to detect a transit of a given depth from the Planet Hunters simulations, they should equally be able to detect a KOI of similar transit depth. The detection efficiency for the 2-3 R ⊕ simulated light curves as a function of relative transit depth is plotted as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 13</ref>. As expected if the Planet Hunters classifiers are marking transits and not spurious features in the light curves, detection efficiency decreases with decreasing transit depth. Higher efficiencies are seen for transits with larger depth for both the simulations and the KOI distribution.</p><p>We test if there are any significant differences between the detection sensitivity for the synthetic distribution and that obtained from the Kepler planet candidates. We bin the 2-3 R ⊕ Kepler KOI and synthetic samples into transit depth bins of 1.5x10 −4 in size. We generate 100,000 'synthetic KOI' distributions by randomly selecting from the larger synthetic light curve population, the same number of simulations as there are real 2-3 R ⊕ Kepler KOIs in each transit depth bin. For each 'synthetic KOI' sample generated, we determine which of the synthetic light curves were correctly identified as having transits by Planet Hunters. We then total the number of simulations recovered by Planet Hunters in each bin for the sample and compare with a chi-squared test to the binned histogram of Planet Hunters recovered real 2-3 R ⊕ Kepler KOIs. We find there is no significant difference between the synthetic distribution and that obtained for the Kepler planet candidates.</p><p>Of the 100,000 'synthetic KOI' samples, 81.9% percent can be rejected as being drawn from the same population as the recovered KOIs at a significance greater than 68%, with only 9.6% rejected at the 95% confidence level. Therefore at the two-sigma level, the recovery rates for the Kepler KOIs and synthetic transits as a function of relative transit depth are consistent.</p><p>Nonetheless, when we plot the distribution of detected simulations and Kepler candidates as a function of radius, we do see significant differences. We use the Kuiper variant of the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) test, as detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Press et al. (1992)</ref>, to compare the 2-3 R ⊕ KOI transit depth distribution to that of the synthetic population. The significance of the computed D statistic is found by performing 10,000 realizations of the KS test by randomly selecting the number of real KOIs from the simulated transit depth distribution and comparing to the full simulated sample and computing the fraction of instances where the computed D statistic was higher than the D statistic measured for the real KOI distribution. We find the hypothesis that both synthetic and KOI distributions are drawn from the same distribution can be rejected at the 99.98% confidence level. As sensitivity to transit depth is the same in both cases, the discrepancy in the recovery rate at the 2-3 R ⊕ bin, can then be attributed to differences in relative transit depth distribution between the two samples.</p><p>The depth of the transit is the squared ratio between the planet and stellar radii, and the simulations randomly sample the Kepler target stellar population and have a uniform distribution of planet radii between 2 and 3 R ⊕ bin. If there is a significant difference in the distribution of stellar radii and planet radii for the 2-3 R ⊕ KOIs this would explain the difference in the distributions. A 2-dimensional KS test <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Press et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Peacock 1983)</ref> of the real and simulated population's planet radii and stellar radii distributions rules out at greater than the 95% confidence level that the two populations are compatible. The significance of the D statistic is estimated in the same manner for the 1-dimensional case, drawing 144 planets and their associated host star radii randomly from the synthetic population and comparing to the parent synthetic population 10,000 times and calculating the fraction of instances where the computed D statistic was higher than the D statistic measured for the real KOI distribution. Our simulation population fundamentally differs from the true underlying planet population, producing different transit depth distributions.</p><p>The KOI planets are skewed towards smaller radii than the simulations. Additionally the KOI stellar radii are also slightly shifted towards lower radii compared to the simulations. These differences likely are representative of the true underlying planet population and formation environments. Though we note that any selection effect in Kepler candidate selection, systematic errors in planet radii or stellar radii estimations would shift the planet radius distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents results from our analysis of the first 33.5 days of Kepler science data, focusing on the detection via transits of planets larger than or equal to 2 R ⊕ with orbital periods shorter than 15 days. We use a set of 1,687,547 classifications provided by more than 24,000 citizen scientists using the Planet Hunters interface, we have performed a systematic search for short period planet candidates. After vetting 75 potential candidates identified via the Q1 classifications that were not identified as KOIs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. (2011b)</ref> with an examination of all currently available Kepler public data (Quarters 1-6), we find seven candidate light curves <ref type="bibr">(KIC 551108, 6616218, 8240797, 9729691, 10905746 11017901, 11551692</ref>) not listed as planet candidates by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. (2011b)</ref> during the initial search of the first four months of Kepler observations but were identified in search of the first 16 months of Kepler data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>) with an improved pipeline. KIC 11017901 was previously discovered and characterized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fischer et al. 2012</ref>) and the remaining six additional candidates have been identified as containing at least one ≥ 1.9 R ⊕ planet candidate with transits repeating less than 15 days in later runs of the Kepler pipeline searching Quarters 1-6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lintott et al. 2012</ref>). All seven candidates require additional follow-up observations to confirm their planetary nature. No additional candidates not listed as a KOI were found.</p><p>Using synthetic planet transits inserted into the data and the known Kepler sample of short period planet candidates, we have measured the detection efficiency of human classifiers to identify planet transits in the Kepler Q1 light curves. Although performance drops rapidly for smaller radii, ≥ 4 R ⊕ Planet Hunters is ≥ 85% efficient at identifying transit signals for planets with periods less than 15 days for the Kepler sample of target stars. For 2-3 R ⊕ planets, the recovery rate for &lt; 15 day orbits drops to 40%. Our high recovery rate of both ≥4 R ⊕ simulations and KOIs and the lack of additional candidates not recovered by the improved Kepler TPS and data validation routines and procedures suggests the Kepler inventory of ≥4 R ⊕ short period planets is nearly complete.</p><p>Although our search was not specifically developed and optimized for identifying eclipsing binaries in the Q1 Kepler sample, we can comment on the Kepler team's detection efficiency for the catalog of detached eclipsing binaries with orbital periods &lt; 15 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Prša et al. 2011</ref>). Our detection scheme is highly sensitive to finding detached eclipsing binaries where the separation distance between the two stars is much larger than their stellar radii, and the light curve has clearly defined and separated primary transits and secondary eclipses. Only in our final stage of candidate selection, after Round 2 review, are the transit depths considered; any potential new eclipsing binaries would be found during the science team review. Even for those light curves where the secondary eclipse is relatively obscured due to the vertical scaling needed to display the primary transit, the Planet Hunters volunteers would have marked the primary transit and in the final review stage the light would have been identified as an eclipsing binary. Most of the possible eclipsing binaries appear to be blends with a nearby eclipsing binary, leaving only a few possible new identifications. With 926 detached eclipsing binaries identified in the Slawson et al. (2011) catalog as having periods less than 15 days, this would suggest the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog has identified almost all eclipsing binaries with periods less than 15 days.</p><p>Planet Hunters is a novel and complementary technique to traditional planet transit methods. The previous discovery of new planet candidates highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lintott et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer et al. (2012)</ref> and the high detection efficiency for 4 R ⊕ and larger planets shows the efficacy of visual review of light curves for detecting large transiting planets. With a detection efficiency greater than 85% for 4R ⊕ and larger planets orbiting on periods less than 15 days, it is likely Planet Hunters can easily detect these large planets even for single transits present in the 30-day light curve sections presented on the website. With the completion of Quarter 1, Quarters 2-5, each spanning approximately 90 days, have been added to Planet Hunters once publicly released, extending the observational baseline to ∼400 days, and classification of these light curves is currently underway. With the public release of Quarters 1-6, Planet Hunters will be able to examine the abundance of single transit events that do not repeat and would not be identified by TPS as well as search for additional transit events that may have been missed from longer period planets with repeating transits in Q1-Q6. However, transits due to planets significantly smaller than 2 R ⊕ will likely remain difficult to detect; particularly Earth-sized planets will be nearly impossible to identify by visual inspection with Planet Hunters due to the low signal to noise ratio of the individual transits. Improved user weighting schemes particularly promoting users who are more adept at identifying smaller radii planets may improve the detection efficiency at 2-3 R ⊕ in the future, but the majority of small rocky planet discoveries will likely remain in the realm of the traditional transit detection methods. Human review may have a niche and be particularly valuable for systems which are unusual, such as circumbinary planets, or difficult because the presence of Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) prevents detection by automated routines which look for periodic repeats of transit features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">García-Melendo &amp; López-Morales (2011)</ref> highlight the difficulties such routines have with significant TTVs, and an application of the algorithm described here, which identifies individual transits rather than a periodic signal, to further releases of Kepler data may be able to catch them. </p></div>

Additionally we explore the potential biases that may effect the calculated synthetic detection efficiency.</p><p>The entirety of the simulations and a subset of the real Q1 light curves, have been screened, since 2011 Feb 1, after the interface upgrade enabling volunteers to draw transit boxes directly on the displayed light curve. With classifiers now drawing their own transit boxes rather than being given a predefined box size, the frequency of boxes drawn and the typical transit box width and height likely changed. We do not place a stringent requirement on the number of transits identified or the transit width in the selection criteria to identify candidates. Thus, there should be little effect on our results. We only use the box width as a criteria during the weighting of the simulations, and since all the simulations were viewed in the updated interface there is no bias in the weighting scheme and the impact on candidate selection should be minimal.</p><p>The subset of Q1 light curves and the simulations reviewed after the completion of the majority of Q1 data were interspersed with Q2 light curves which are scaled to a slightly different value and appear visibly different from the Q1 light curves. In particular, the Q2 light curves contain gaps due to missing data where as Q1 is continuous for a majority of the Kepler targets. This makes the Q1 data and simulations possibly recognizable such that when a user views a light curve without a gap he or she assumes the light curve is a simulation and is being tested therefore behaving differently than when the same user classifies real Kepler light curves, i.e. the 'Hawthorne effect' <ref type="bibr">(Mayo 1933;</ref><ref type="bibr">Adair, Sharpe &amp; Huynh 1989)</ref>. For example, the classifier may mark more transit boxes on features that the user is less certain about because he or she wants to correctly identify the 'simulated' transits, and the simulations would then not reflect an accurate picture of the typical behavior of Planet Hunters volunteers. Most classifiers come to the Planet Hunters interface and classify a handful of light curves before leaving (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. Therefore most of the classifiers at any given time on the Planet Hunters classification interface will be unaware of there being a difference between the two sets of light curves and what that significance is. Their responses will be the same whether they are a classifying a synthetic light curve, Q1 light curve, or Q2 light curve. Although a small subset of users who have examined many tens of light curves may have noticed the pattern, these users remain a small fraction of the entire Q1 classifications. Only 13% of those users who classified a synthetic light curve classified more than 10 simulations. In addition the simulations and the remaining Q1 light curves were both shown at the same rate. 1 in 5 light curves served was either a Q1 or synthetic. Although the user might be able to identify the quarter of origin, they could not be certain if the light curve presented was a simulation or real data. We believe this effect is negligible for the majority of our synthetic light curve classifications, and that they reflect the typical behavior of Planet Hunters classifiers.</p><p>We also note that simulations were added to the Planet Hunters interface after 2011 May. The simulations were classified by a different set of users than were classifying the bulk of Q1. 34% of synthetic classifiers never examined a Q1 light curve. In order to estimate a detection efficiency, we make the assumption that behavior between the two sets of classifiers is the same. Although there may be some evolution of the classifier population as a subset continue to classify curves and improve their ability to identify transits, the nature of the site, is such there is always new users who are classifying light curves. On average a visitor spends only 18 minutes on the Planet Hunters site. These new classifiers would be just as likely to review a simulation and have the same level of expertise as the original set of Q1 classifiers. Therefore, we feel they the synthetic classifiers serve as a representative sampling of the skill set and ability of the typical Planet Hunters classifiers, 154 of the 330 single planet KOIs with periods less than 15 days and 2-15 R ⊕ were completed before the upgrade and were shown when the majority of the Q1 data was present in the classification interface. We can use classifications as an independent test of our estimated synthetic detection efficiency. We find a similar recovery rate from these KOIs as for the injected transit light curves and full short period planet KOI sample. Therefore, we feel they the synthetic classifiers serve as a representative sampling of the skill set and ability of the typical Planet Hunters classifiers, and our detection efficiency calculated from the classifications of the synthetic light curves is appropriate for the entire Planet Hunters classifications.</p></div>

The data were obtained from the Kepler Mission Archive 3 hosted by the Multi-Mission archive at STScI (MAST 4 ). The majority of the light curves used in our analysis are from the 2010 June 15 data release. A subset of Q1 targets, 5828 stars, had long cadence light curves publicly released after 2010 June. We obtained data for those stars from the 2011 February 2 release. Due to an error in uploading, five stars (KIC 8349808, 3656476, 6603624, 11446443 [KOI 1.01 (Tres-2, O'Donovan et al. 2006)], KIC 11026764), comprising ∼0.004% of the total Kepler sample, were not included in this analysis. Planet Hunters utilizes the long cadence observations from Kepler where measurements are effectively obtained once per 29.4-minute interval, presenting the scaled systematic error-corrected flux outputted by the Kepler science processing pipeline (Jenkins et al. 2010b). The flux values and uncertainties used correspond to the Pre-Search Data Conditioning (PDC) PDCSAP FLUX and PDCSAP FLUX ERR, previously labeled AP CORR FLUX and AP COR ERR columns of the released Kepler FITS tables (Fraquelli &amp; Thompson 2011). The PDC correction removes systematic effects and long term trends from the light curves. For further details of the Kepler Q1 observations and data processing we refer the reader to Borucki et al. (2011a) and Jenkins et al. (2010b,a).</figDesc></figure>
