				<p>Foreword This volume collects the abstracts in extended format of the 15 th Microlensing Conference held in the University of Salerno on January 20-22, 2011. The Conference has gathered 68 scientists from 17 countries confirming microlensing as a mature and established tool of research over a broad range of astrophysical issues, from dark matter searches to the detection of new extrasolar planets of very low mass, down to Earth-size or below. The 3-days Conference has been preceeded by a 2-days school on &quot;Modelling Planetary Microlensing Events&quot; focused on this last issue. The abstracts collected here offer an updated snapshot of the current researches in this field. The topics include: the status of current surveys, planetary events, dark matter searches, cosmological microlensing, theoretical investigations and an outlook towards the future, with in particular a discussion on the possible role to be played by microlensing searches for exoplanets in the forecoming space missions, WFIRST and EUCLID. Finally, the conference has been enriched by a series of topical speeches on related issues from a non-microlensing point of view: the physics of giant planet accretion and evolution, &quot;new physics&quot; and dark matter in the LHC era and an update on the GAIA mission and its potential to characterize planetary systems with high-precision astrometry. iii iv Scientific Rationale 25 years after the seminal intuition by Bohdan Paczynski, microlensing has rapidly evolved into a new promise for modern astrophysics. Indeed, the detection of celestial bodies by their gravitational effects on the light of background sources has proved to be a very powerful tool for the study of many aspects of our Galaxy and beyond. The original proposal of using microlensing to estimate the amount of baryonic dark matter in the form of compact substellar bodies is still topical. The observation of microlensing events toward nearby galaxies still represents a hard challenge for present observational facilities. Very strong efforts are under way for upgrading the current strategies in particular toward the galaxy M31. Hundreds of microlensing events are discovered toward the Galactic Bulge every year. This considerable amount of statistics can be used to characterize the stellar populations of the bulge and the disc of our Galaxy. After several years of observations , the significance of the microlensing sample in the characterization of our Galaxy is growing more and more. Yet, the most intriguing perspective offered by microlensing is represented by its power to discover new extrasolar planets of very low mass, down to Earth-size or below. Several planetary events have already been detected and studied, while many more are expected as soon as future dedicated telescopes become operational. Interestingly, microlensing is already being used to estimate the abundance of planets around stars in the disc of our Galaxy and to characterize their distributions in distance and mass. As the planetary anomalies typically last only a few hours, the cooperation among all observing groups is mandatory, in order to characterize the events properly and maximize the scientific achievements. Even amateur astronomers are now giving their fundamental contribution. In this respect, microlensing stands as a perfect example of how science can unite the whole mankind in a common path toward pure knowledge. Salerno Microlensing Conference 2011 will gather all people active in this field, providing the state of the art of microlensing searches and the perspectives opened by new methodologies and new observational and computational facilities. Colloquia on dark matter searches and planet formation theories are also foreseen as a central part of the conference. The three-days conference will be preceded by a school dedicated to the delicate issue of efficient modelling of planetary microlensing events, which requires major efforts and new ideas from new talents in order to get access to the precious physical information hidden in microlensing light curves.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction to microlensing</head><p>Philippe Jetzer Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Zurich Switzerland</p><p>In the lecture I will present the basic formalism of gravitational lensing such as the lens equation and the special case of the Schwarzschild lens with its application in microlensing. I will discuss the microlensing probability for different targets such as the galactic bulge, LMC, SMC and the Andromeda galaxy as well as give a short review of the present status of microlensing searches conducted by the various collaborations in particular with respect to the problem of the galactic dark matter content in form of MACHOs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Martin Dominik SUPA, University of St Andrews, School of Physics &amp; Astronomy United Kingdom</head><p>An elaborate integrated strategy incorporating target selection and scheduling, data flow, assessment, and final analysis is required to ensure that the scientific goals that we aim for are achieved. Specific issues that need to be taken care of are dealing with uncertainties, ambiguities, and degeneracies, as well as having the capacity to keep track with data being acquired at ever increasing rate. I will present you with some challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The theory and Phenomenology of Planetary Microlensing</head><p>Scott Gaudi Department of Astronomy, Ohio State University USA I discuss the theory and phenomenology of planetary microlensing. I begin with a review of the basic theoretical formalism: starting with the time delay surface, and continuing with the lens equation, I describe how critical curves, caustics, and magnifications can be computed. I then explore the properties of the caustic curves of planetary microlenses. I illustrate the topology of caustic curves and how these change with the parameters of the planetary system. In addition, I review the generic, universal behavior of images near caustics. I then delve into the rich phenomenology and salient observable properties of planetary microlensing light curves, and discuss how these can be intuitively understood based on consideration of the microlensed images and shape of and magnification near the caustics. Finally, I demonstrate how all of these considerations can be used to roughly estimate the properties of a planetary system giving rise to an observed light curve based purely on visual inspection.</p><p>From raw images to lightcurves: how to make sense of your data Yiannis Tsapras Queen Mary University UK I will present an overview of astronomical image processing with special focus on the difference imaging technique in the context of microlensing observations towards the galactic bulge. Starting from how to calibrate the raw data, I will discuss the various steps involved in the analysis, possible pitfalls, and how to extract the photometric information from the images in order to construct a clean lightcurve. Examples using the RoboNet DIA software will be given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Efficient Modeling of Planetary Microlensing Events</head><p>David P. Bennett University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN USA I present a general method for the modeling of planetary microlensing events, with an emphasis on the most difficult events which involve more than two lens masses, microlensing parallax and/or orbital motion. Finite source calculations are done with the image centered ray-shooting method, which can be made both highly efficient and flexible enough to model any events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contour integration and downhill fitting</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valerio Bozza Department of Physics, University of Salerno Italy</head><p>By Green's theorem, the two-dimensional integration on the microlensed images is written as a line integral on the image boundaries. We will discuss the advantages and the shortcomings of this method, presenting several improvements of the basic idea: parabolic correction, error control, optimal sampling, limb darkening. We will also review some basic downhill fitting methods, which rapidly provide preliminary models for microlensing events starting from suitable initial conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microlensing Modelling and High Performance Computing</head><p>Ian Bond Massey University New Zealand I will go over the practical aspects of the modelling and analysis of microlensing events. I will discuss two programming environments for high performance computing: cluster computers and GPU (graphical processor units) platforms. I will describe, with examples, how to design and implement software to run on these platforms. In particular, GPUs are emerging as a powerful tool for scientific computation and their potential in microlensing modelling is promising. The use of GPUs will be particularly emphasized in this seminar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The classical model of giant planet formation envisions that multi-Earth mass solid cores formed from the accretion of planetesimals and that these cores then captured by gravity a massive atmosphere from the gas in the proto-planetary disk <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A problem in this scenario is that the solid cores have to grow on a timescale shorter than the gas-dissipation timescale, which observations set to be a few My only <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. This is not easy, particularly in disks with small densities, such as those around low-mass stars. For this reason it is expected that giant planets cannot form around low-mass stars <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> or they form very rarely <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. However, micro-lensing and radial velocity detections show that giant planets do exist around stars down to at least 0.2M ⊕ . This conflict between models and observations suggests that the process of giant planet accretion needs to be revisited</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The problem of core accretion</head><p>It has been recently pointed out that our ideas on the accretion of the cores of the giant planets were simplistic even in the case of disks around solar-mass stars.</p><p>In fact, N-body simulations show that, once the cores become sufficiently massive (about 1M ⊕ ), they tend to scatter the planetesimals away, rather than accrete them. In doing this, they clear their neighboring region, which in turn limits their own growth, even if initially there are a lot of solids available in the system. If damping effects are included in the simulation, in the hope of limiting the ability of the cores to scatter the planetesimals away, the result is that the planetesimals end up in stable circular orbits that are dynamically separated from the cores (i.e. no close encounters with the cores are possible). Effectively, the cores open radial gaps in the planetesimal distribution <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. One could think that core migration or planetesimal radial drift due to gas drag can help to break the isolation of the cores from the planetesimals. However the simulations show that, in these cases, most planetesimals end up locked in resonances with the cores; resonances prevent collisions, so radial migration is unlikely to boost accretion in a significant way <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Hints for a new model of formation of giant planets cores</head><p>New results on the migration of proto-planets in gas-disks show that the concept of inward migration of Earth-mass objects (the so-called Type I migration <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>) is valid only in idealized isothermal disks. In more realistic radiative disks, the migration of the proto-planets is outward in the inner part of the disk and inward in the outer part <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>[8] <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. There are therefore one (or sometimes two) orbital radii where migration is cancelled. All proto-planets formed in the disk tend to migrate towards these equilibrium radii <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. This can concentrate the proto-planets in a narrow region of space and favor further mutual accretion, thus leading to the formation of giant planets cores. A proof-of-concept simulation will be presented at the conference, leading to the formation of a 12M ⊕ body from a system of 1M ⊕ planetary embryos. If this idea is correct, the formation of the cores of the giant planets is not due to the local runaway accretion of small planetesimals, but to the concentration of all planetary embryos that formed throughout the disk and their subsequent mutual collisions. This is a big change of emphasis. The concept of the local surface density is not relevant any more because the material is migrated to the site of growth of the core from a large range of distances. This gives hope that the formation of the cores is less sensitive to the surface density of the disk than previously expected, and that therefore giant planet formation is more likely also around low-mass stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dynamical evolution of giant planets</head><p>Once giant planets are formed, they open gaps in the gas distribution in the protoplanetary disk. Once this happens, giant planets are expected to undergo Type II migration towards the central star <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Also Type-II migration, though, is an idealized concept. It is valid in the case where planets are much less massive than disks and they open extremely deep gaps that gas cannot pass through. In the other cases, the planets do not migrate at the Type-II rate; they can even move outward and, instead of gaps, they can open cavities in the inner part of the disk, removing most the gas between the star and the orbit of the planet <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In case of two (or more) planets, the migration pattern is even more complex. For two planets in resonance, migration is inward if the outer planet has a mass comparable to the inner one, or larger. If the outer planet has a mass that is a sizeable fraction of the inner one (as in the Jupiter-Saturn case), migration is outward. If the outer planet has a negligible mass (say Jupiter and Neptune), migration is inward again <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Thus, for our solar system we can envision that Jupiter migrated inwards while Saturn was growing and then, once Saturn reached a mass close to its current one, they migrated outward. This kind of evolution may be relevant for the system around the star OGLE-06-109L, discovered by microlensing, which looks like a SunJupiter-Saturn system slightly scaled down in mass.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antonio Masiero INFN -University of Padova Italy</head><p>After more than four decades of relentless tests of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, one can safely state that it correctly describes the fundamental interactions all the way up to the energy scale of 100 GeV. Yet, the observational evidences that neutrinos are massive and that a large amount of non-baryonic dark matter exists corroborate the theoretical demand for the presence of new non-SM physics at the TeV scale. Interestingly enough, the main theoretical motivation for new physics (NP) at the electroweak scale (i.e., the presence of an ultraviolet SM completion to enforce the stability of the electroweak breaking scale) nicely joins the need for some form of cold matter: indeed, most theoretically dictated extensions of the SM (low-energy supersymmetry, extra-dimensions, etc.) entail the existence of some new stable particle which can play the role of dark matter candidate. I'll discuss the interplay between the searches for TeV NP which are going on at the LHC and the searches for dark matter related to TeV NP both in direct and indirect DM probes. It is exciting that the coming decade has the potentiality to witness the simultaneous success of the high-energy (LHC) and astroparticle (DM) roads in our endeavour to unveil the presence of NP at the electroweak scale.</p></div>

The data collected in the Gaia catalogue, to be published by the end of the decade, will likely revolutionize our understanding of many aspects of stellar and Galactic astrophysics. One of the relevant areas in which the Gaia observations will have great impact is the astrophysics of planetary systems. There are many complex technical problems related to and challenges inherent in correctly modelling the signals of planetary systems present in measurements collected with an observatory poised to carry out precision astrometry at the micro-arcsecond (µas) level. Provided these are well understood, Gaia µas astrometry has great potential for important contributions to the astrophysics of planetary systems, particularly when seen in synergy with other indirect and direct methods for the detection and characterization of planetary systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Astrometric Modeling of Planetary Systems</head><p>The problem of the correct determination of the astrometric orbits of planetary systems using Gaia data (highly non-linear orbital fitting procedures, large numbers of model parameters) will present many difficulties. For example, it will be necessary to assess the relative robustness and reliability of different procedures for orbital fits, with a detailed understanding of the statistical properties of the uncertainties associated with the model parameters. For multiple systems, a trade-off will have to be found between accuracy in the determination of the mutual inclination angles between pairs of planetary orbits, single-measurement precision and redundancy in the number of observations with respect to the number of estimated model parameters. It will be challenging to correctly identify signals with amplitude close to the measurement uncertainties, particularly in the presence of larger signals induced by other</p><p>The Gaia potential companions and/or sources of astrophysical noise of comparable magnitude. Finally, for systems where dynamical interactions are important (a situation experienced already by Doppler surveys), fully dynamical fits involving an n-body code might have to be used to properly model the Gaia astrometric data and to ensure the dynamical stability of the solution (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Sozzetti 2005</ref>). All the above issues could significantly impact Gaias planet detection and characterization capabilities. For these reasons, a Development Unit (DU), within the pipeline of Coordination Unit 4 (object processing) of the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium, has been specifically devoted to the modelling of the astrometric signals produced by planetary systems. The DU is composed of several tasks, which implement multiple robust procedures for (single and multiple) astrometric orbit fitting (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) and the determination of the degree of dynamical stability of multi-planet systems.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆d N⋆ ∆a ∆Mp N d Nm (pc) (AU) (M J ) 0</formula></div>

With the new 32 chip mosaic camera covering 1.4 square degrees on the sky with the resolution of 0.26 arcsec/pixel and fast reading time of the entire array of 20 seconds the observing capabilities of the OGLE survey increased by an order of magnitude compared to the previous OGLE-III phase.

About 4.5 square degrees of the Galactic bulge regions with the highest microlensing rate were observed with the cadence of 20 minutes while additional 8.5 square degrees with the cadence of 1 hour. Moreover, large area of the Galactic bulge was observed once or twice a day.</p><p>The automatic data pipeline of OGLE-IV images reductions has been recently finished.

Several planetary candidates have also been detected via direct imaging, and astrometry.</p><p>The gravitational microlensing was proposed as a unique method to search exoplanets <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. The planet's gravity induces small caustics, which can generate small deviations in standard <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> single-lens microlensing light curves. Compared to other techniques, microlensing is sensitive to smaller planets, down to an Earth mass <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, and in wider orbits of 1-6 AU. Because microlensing observability does not depend on the light from the lens host star, it is sensitive to planets orbiting faint host stars like M-dwarfs and even brown dwarfs. Furthermore, it is sensitive to distant host stars at several kpc from the Sun, which allows the Galactic distribution of planetary systems to be studied.</p><p>In 2003, the gravitational microlensing method yielded its first definitive exoplanet discovery <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. So far ten planetary systems with eleven planets have been found by this technique <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, which have very distinct properties from those detected by other techniques.</p><p>Although the radial velocity and transit discoveries are more numerous, microlensing is uniquely sensitive to the cold Neptunes outside of the snow-line, and the microlensing results to date indicate that this class of planets may be the most common type of exoplanet yet discovered <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p></div>

John Observatory in New Zealand. We observe our target fields very frequently (every 15-90 min) and analyze data in real-time to issue alerts. This high cadence is specifically designed to find the short timescale planetary signature. Our real-time anomaly alert system searches for planetary signatures in ongoing microlensing events in which new data points are available on the light curves within 5 min after exposure.

LCOGT is in the process of developing a global network of 1m and 0.4m telescopes capable of robotic around-the-clock observations. These will be used for science as well as education. The 0.4m and 1m prototypes are currently being tested and deployment around the world will begin in 2011. The first ones will be deployed in Chile and South Africa, followed by Tenerife, Australia and China. The complete network will comprise of twelve to fifteen 1m and twenty-four 0.4m telescopes and is expected to be complete by the end of 2014. The final numbers depend on the relative costs. The SUPA-II Planet Hunter bid from the University of St Andrews will finance the construction of an extra three 1m telescopes with exactly the same specifications. The 0.4m telescopes will be primarily used for educational purposes. Schools from around the world will have access to these telescopes through web interfaces and will be able to make observations during daylight hours in Europe by using the telescopes in Chile, Hawaii and Australia. Furthermore, they will have the option to get involved in certain science projects, like microlensing or transits, and contribute observations. The LCOGT education pages provide descriptions of possible projects available to the students. The 1m telescopes will be used for science observations. Each site will eventually host two to four telescopes which can be operated individually or in parallel, allowing simultaneous observations of targets in different pass-bands. Each telescope will be fitted with a fast readout CCD camera that has a field of view of about half a degree and filters in the UBVRI and Pan-STARRS Z and Y bands. Each cluster of telescopes will have an optical fiber-feed to a shared medium-resolution spectrograph.</p><p>The observation requests sent out to the telescopes will be scheduled by a highly dynamic scheduling algorithm that will constantly farm the database of TAC-approved science projects for the most appropriate observations to perform at any given time given the current conditions and the scientific priority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RoboNet: A microlensing search for cold planets</head><p>In order to draw conclusions about planetary populations, it is not enough to just detect planets, it is necessary to understand the selection bias of the surveys. This requires the adoption of an observing strategy that is not based on human intervention, since this cannot be simulated. RoboNet's unique advantage is that our entire system is completely automated, which makes it easier to understand the selection biases of our strategy. As the system is designed for a network with continuous Bulge coverage, we expect to address this question with the help of the full LCOGT network in future seasons.</p><p>The methodology used by the RoboNet team is described in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Our pilot campaign (RoboNet-I) contributed to 5 of the first 6 microlensing planet discoveries and provided the impetus to develop our system further. We are continuing this development in preparation for the deployment of the LCOGT network of 1m and 0.4m telescopes.</p><p>RoboNet has pioneered the technique of adaptive scheduling of microlensing targets through the use of a prioritisation algorithm that continuously shuffles the observable microlensing targets, giving higher priority to the ones that are more likely to reveal a planetary signal <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. It calculates the optimal frequency at which each ongoing microlensing event needs to be sampled at in order to maximize the planet detection probability. Once an observation is obtained for a specific event, it's priority is adjusted upwards in the case that it deviates from the expected single-lens case, or downwards if it doesn't. The relative priorities are reassessed every few minutes and active events that have not been observed recently will start to appear higher and higher in the list until an observation is obtained. At that point their relative priority will be readjusted according to the previous scheme. In order to be sensitive to "cold Earths", a sampling interval of 15-45 mins is required, which the extended robotic network will be able to deliver.</p><p>RoboNet makes use of difference image analysis software <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> to extract accurate brightness measurements from the incoming images which are used to construct the event lightcurves. One image is selected as a template and all other images are geometrically and photometrically aligned to and subtracted from it. Any stars that show variability are immediately obvious on the resulting subtracted images, while stars of constant brightness leave no residuals.</p><p>The resulting lightcurves are immediately shared with the extended microlensing community via automated rsync transfers but are also available on the project website for downloading. The lightcurves are continuously assessed by our SIGNALMEN software, which uses robust methods to automatically detect the onset of anomalous features. If such a feature is detected, an override request is sent to the network to obtain prompt observations that will confirm or disprove the anomaly. While most observations are performed in queued observing mode, we sometimes use our override capability in order to respond to anomaly alerts. Once more telescopes are included in our network, we will be able to operate in a fully automated mode throughout the microlensing season. I present all publicly available Chandra observations of 14 X-ray bright quadruply lensed quasars. The X-ray data reveal flux ratio anomalies which are more extreme than those seen at optical wavelengths, confirming the microlensing origin of the anomalies originally seen in the optical data. The X-ray emitting regions are essentially point sources and therefore give a microlensing signal unencumbered by source size considerations. Building on our previous work, we have completed a thorough investigation of the best way to analyze the X-ray data, resulting in improved determinations of the X-ray flux ratios. We have constructed custom microlensing magnification maps for a range of stellar fractions for the four images of each quasar, and we have implemented a more sophisticated Bayesian analysis of the data to determine the most likely dark matter fraction in the lensing galaxies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Accelerating expansion of the Universe is a great challenge for both physics and cosmology. In light of lacking the convincing theoretical explanation, an effective description of this phenomenon in terms of cosmic equation of state turns out useful.</p><p>The strength of modern cosmology lies in consistency across independent, often unrelated pieces of evidence. Therefore, every alternative method of restricting cosmic equation of state is important. Strongly gravitationally lensed quasar-galaxy systems create such new opportunity by combining stellar kinematics (central velocity dispersion measurements) with lensing geometry (Einstein radius determination form position of images).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Idea and methods</head><p>Strong gravitationally lensed systems create opportunity to test cosmological models of dark energy in a way alternative to Hubble diagrams (from SNIa or GRBs), CMBR or LSS. The idea is that formula for the Einstein radius in a SIS lens (or its SIE equivalent)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">θ E = 4π σ 2 SIS c 2 D ls D s</formula><p>depends on the cosmological model through the ratio: (angular-diameter) distance between lens and source to the distance between observer and lens. Provided one has reliable knowledge about lensing system: the Einstein radius θ E (from image astrometry) and stellar velocity dispersion σ SIS (central velocity dispersion inferred from spectroscopy) one can used such well studied systems to test background cosmology. This method is independent on the Hubble constant value (H 0 gets cancelled in the distance ratio) and is not affected by dust absorption or source evolutionary effects. It depends, however, on the reliability of lens modelling (e.g. SIS or SIE assumption). The method was proposed by Biesiada <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and also discussed in details by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grillo et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Here we apply such method to a combined data sets from SLACS and LSD surveys of gravitational lenses <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In result we obtain the cosmic equation of state parameters, which generally agree with results already known in the literature. This demonstrates that the method can be further used on larger samples obtained in the future <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. We have also performed joint analysis taking into accout standard rulers (combining lensing system data with CMB acoustic peak location and BAO data) and standard candles (SNIa data -we used Union08 compilation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kowalski et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> ). The observables we used had different parameter degeneracies and so different restrictive power in the parameter spaces of cosmological models. It can be best seen in figures. Figure 1: Best fits (dots) and (68 %, 95%) confidence regions in (Ω, w) plane for quintessence model. Confidence regions displayed separately for standard rulers, standard candles and joint analysis.</p><p>We considered five cosmological scenarios of dark energy, widely discussed in current literature. These are ΛCDM, Quintessence, Chevalier-Polarski-Linder model, Chaplygin gas and Braneworld scenario. Then we performed χ 2 fits to different cosmological scenarios on described samples. The probes were combined by calculating joint likelihoods.</p><p>Because standard rulers and standard candles probe distance measures based on different concepts (angular diameter distance and luminosity distance), one step before making a full joint fit we performed fits based on rulers and candles separately. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusions</head><p>The best fits we obtained for the model parameters in joint analysis turned out to prefer cases effectively equivalent to ΛCDM model. They are also in agreement with other combined studies performed by other authors on different sets of diagnostic probes. As comparison between models in terms of chi-square values does not account for the relative structural complexity of the models we also made use of information theoretic methods. According to Akaike criterion (AIC) ΛCDM it is only slightly preferred over the quintessence and both models with a dynamical equation of state w(z) (CPL parametrization) and Chaplygin gas scenario get considerably less support from the data. Odds against the brane-world scenario are so high that it can be considered as ruled out by the data. According to the Schwartz Bayesian Information criterion (BIC) ΛCDM wins, the quintessence model is considerably less supported by data, and the other ones are ruled out.  <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> it represents the system with the highest data-flow today. In addition to the large area 3Pi Survey some fields are exposed deeper, and visited more frequently. One of these so called medium deep fields (MD) targets the Andromeda galaxy. PAndromeda monitors M31 for 2% of the overall PS1 time. This means that M31 is observed for 0.5 h per night during a period of 5 months per year. PAndromeda is designed to identify gravitational microlensing events, caused by bulge and disk stars (self-lensing) and by compact matter in the halos of M31 and the MW (halo lensing, or lensing by MACHOs). The main science goals of PAndromeda are measuring the masses and mass-fraction of compact objects in the M31 and MW halos, and constraining the M31 bulge mass function at the low mass end. As a side product PAndromeda is also able to search for microlensing events towards M32 and NGC 205.</p><p>The interpretation of the microlensing events (see <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>) requires i) understanding the mix of stellar ages and metalicities in the bulge, disk, and halo of M31 as obtained from resolved stellar populations (census of supergiants, OB-associations, analysis of CMD diagrams as a function of location) variability studies (from Cepheids to LPVs), and color gradients in the light profiles, ii) deriving improved 3 dimensional models for the density and velocity distributions of the bulge and disk, iii) including improved constraints on the extinction in M31 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. All these informations can directly extracted from the PAndromeda data itself.</p><p>The continuous monitoring in the r ′ and i ′ bands with PAndromeda allows to confirm the achromaticity of events; the main filter (detection filter) is the r ′ -band to optimize the number of source stars accessible for measurable lensing events, which Riffeser et al.</p><p>PAndromeda -Deep Survey of M31 depends on the brightness of the stars, the photon noise (mostly by M31), and the sensitivity of filters in each band. During the first season we focussed on the integration depth in the filters r' and i'. We split the r ′ -band imaging into two integrations (separated by 4-6 hours) per night, for the whole season. This allows to measure light curves with shorter time scales than 1 day more accurately, since a large fraction of events is predicted (and found in previous surveys) with short time scales. PAndromeda monitored M31 from 07/23/2010 till 12/27/2010 on 91 nights (58%). In total 1782 images were exposed, 1179 in r' (90 nights, 70740 sec) and 603 in i' band (66 nights, 36180 sec). The total amount of reduced data is 14 TB. Depending on our observing strategy in 2011 the remaining filters and integration times for PAndromeda will be chosen such, that in turn these observations can be used to study many other aspects of M31 with the aim to improve the predictions of the microlensing event rates. These microlensing predictions depend on the mass function of stars, their luminosities and sizes as determined by their ages and metallicities, on their density and velocities distributions, and on the extinction.</p><p>The PS1 Gigapixel Camera (GPC1) produces images consisting of 3840 CCDs (60×8×8) with roughly 580×590 pixels each. This results in 1.3×10 9 pixels which are exposed and read-out. The GPC1 data are de-biased, flat-fielded, and astrometrically registered with the Pan-STARRS Image Processing Pipeline (by Magnier E.). A reduced GPC1 exposure requires a disk storage of 8.0 GB consisting of frame, weight and mask. After this basic reduction the data are further processed by our own image processing software (MUPIPE, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>). For the PAndromeda difference imaging analysis we adapted the MUPIPE pipeline to the specifications of PS1 data and data flow and implemented it into the Astro-WISE system.</p><p>From the 2010 season we analyzed the central field of M31 (21 ′ × 21 ′ ). This is to test the detection process in the field where we expect the highest lensing rate because of self lensing. So far we detected 3 high quality microlensing light-curves. The third one is very bright with 19 mag in r'. Note that high flux excess events are more difficult to reconcile with self-lensing than with halo-lensing <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The full data set is currently analyzed. </p></div>

All but one of them are consistent with the expected signal from lensing by Clouds own stars (self-lensing), therefore there is no need of introducing dark microlenses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Luigi Mancini &amp; Sebastiano Calchi Novati Department of Physics, University of Salerno, Italy IIASS, Vietri Sul Mare Italy</head><p>The nature of the observed microlensing events towards the Magellanic Clouds is still an open issue. Indeed, in order to draw meaningful insights into the contribution of dark matter objects in form of MACHOs, it is essential first to estimate accurately all the possible contributions due to (luminous) lenses belonging to known populations located along the line of sight (to which we refer too as "self lensing"). A possibly non exhaustive list includes lenses belonging to the luminous components of the LMC (the disc and the bar) that can act as sources , the disc of the Milky Way and the somewhat elusive stellar halo for both the Milky Way and the LMC.</p><p>The results reported so far by the collaborations who carried out observational campaigns towards the LMC as for the MACHO contribution to the Galactic halo are in agreement to exclude MACHOs as a viable dark matter candidate for masses below (10 −1 − 10 −2 ) M ⊙ . However, a relevant discrepancy still exists as for compact halo object in the mass range (0.1 − 1) M ⊙ . The MACHO collaboration claimed for an mass halo fraction in form of MACHOs of about f ∼ 20% out of observations towards the LMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Alcock et al., 2000</ref>), a result more recently confirmed by . On the other hand, the EROS ( ) and the OGLE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wyrzykowski et al., , 2010</ref> collaborations, out of observations towards both the LMC and SMC, concluded that the expected self-lensing rate is sufficient to explain the observed rate also in this mass range. It is therefore important to address the issue of the nature of the observed events, either to be attributed to MACHO lensing or to self lensing.</p><p>In previous analyses we have considered the set of events reported by the MACHO collaboration and shown that, on the basis of both their number number and their characteristics (event duration and spatial distribution), they cannot all be attributed to self lensing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mancini et al., 2004</ref> Here we report on a detailed analysis of the recent results of the OGLE-III campaiagn towards the LMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wyrzykowski et al, 2010</ref>). For all the possible lens populations (both luminous and dark), we present maps of the optical depth and a study of the expected characteristics (duration, spatial distribution and number), to be compared with the observed events. This is done through an evaluation of the microlensing rate towards all the observed fields. Finally, we evaluate the probability distribution for the mass halo fraction in form of MACHO via a likelihood analysis. Overall, we find the observed rate to be compatible with the expected lensing signal by known luminous populations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sedighe Sajadian &amp; Sohrab Rahvar Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran Iran</head><p>In this work we propose a new strategy of pixel lensing observation of the unresolved stars of M87 in the Virgo cluster by HST. We show that in contrast to the previous observational strategy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Baltz et al. (2004)</ref> with one observation per night for the duration of one month, a few days intensive observation with taking one image per one HST orbit, we can substantially increase the number of events more than one order of magnitude. In this observational strategy, high magnification microlensing events is predicted to be observed with the rate of ∼ 4 event per day with a typical transit time scale of ∼ 19 hours. We examine the possible detection of dark matter mini-halos with this observational strategy. Pixel lensing is a unique tool for the study of dark matter objects in form of MACHOs up to distant galaxies as M31. More than 20 pixel lensing events towards M31 have been reported so far from several different campaigns, but no firm conclusions on the MACHO issue have been reached yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Calchi Novati, 2010)</ref>. A fundamental problem in the analysis is the difficulty to disentangle microlensing signal due to dark matter MACHOs from "self lensing", microlensing signal due to lenses belonging to known luminous populations. This is complicated first by the additional degeneracy in the microlensing event parameter space characteristics of pixel lensing, where one studies flux variations of unresolved objects. Second, by the rather large expected self-lensing signal, as compared to the MACHO lensing one, at least in the inner M31 region, where in any case most of the events, either MACHO or self lensing, are expected. In this respect, as for many others, M31 pixel lensing is peculiar with respect to microlensing towards the Magellanic Clouds, LMC and SMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Moniez, 2010)</ref>. Still, besides the underlying technique, also the fundamental physical issue one addresses to, that of MACHOs, is the same. The recent analyses of OGLE-II/SMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wyrzykowski et al., 2010)</ref> and OGLE-III/LMC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wyrzykowski et al., 2010</ref>) both indicates that the observed rate of events is compatible with the expected self-lensing signal. This is in agreement with the previous OGLE-II/LMC ( ) and the EROS results ( ). On the other hand, the MACHO collaboration claimed for a MACHO signal of about 0.5 M ⊙ for a mass halo fraction in form of MACHO f ∼ 20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Alcock et al., 2000</ref>), a result more recently confirmed by the further analyses of . To address the issue of MACHOs along a different line of sight is therefore important. Besides, looking towards M31 one can map its own full dark matter halo, which is not possible for the Galaxy one. To explore the MACHO versus self-lensing issue, and more in general to address the problem of the nature of the observed events, the careful and through analysis of single events have shown to be a very efficient tool even if it can only give partial indications. Relevant results have been reported for the M31 microlensing event PA-N1 Aurì ere et al., <ref type="bibr">2001</ref>), PA-S3/GL1 ( , and by the more recent analysis of OAB-N2 by the PLAN collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Calchi Novati et al., 2010</ref>). Remarkably, though with different level of confidence, all these analyses conclude that MACHO lensing is to be preferred to self lensing for the events studied. This approach runs in parallel with the analysis of full data set completed by a careful comparison of the observed and the expected rate (an approach which still has to deal with the limitation given by the rather small statistics involved). The more relevant results have been reported by the POINT-AGAPE <ref type="bibr">(Calchi Novati et al., 2005</ref>) and the MEGA (de <ref type="bibr">Jong et al., 2006</ref>) collaborations, working on the same data set. POINT-AGAPE claimed for an evidence of a MACHO signal, in the same mass range indicated by the MACHO LMC analysis, whereas MEGA concluded that self lensing was sufficient to explain the detected rate. An extremely promising new project for M31 pixel lensing observation is that of PAndromeda ( <ref type="bibr">Riffeser et al, 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The PLAN project: an update</head><p>Within this still open framework we discuss some of the results we have obtained with the PLAN collaboration which is carrying out a long term monitoring project of M31 (with observational campaigns at the 1.5m OAB telescope from 2006 to 2010 and a pilot campaign at the 2m HCT telescope in October 2010). In Calchi  as a result of a fully automated pipeline we have reported 2 microlensing candidate events out of the 2007 campaign (OAB-N1 and OAB-N2). The observed rate turned out to be relatively large, still, compatible with the expected self-lensing one. The available statistics was however too small to allow us to draw stringent conclusions on the MACHO issue. Since then we have followed both the indicated approaches to address the MACHO versus self-lensing issue.</p><p>First, some additional data made available by the WeCAPP collaboration along the OAB-N2 light curve and a more through analysis of KPNO and HST archive images used to better constrain the possible event source characteristics, have allowed us a much more detailed analysis of OAB-N2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Calchi Novati et al., 2010</ref>). In particular, through a study of the lens proper motion, we have shown that this event is more likely to be attributed to MACHO lensing than to self lensing.</p><p>As for our full data set, more statistics is badly needed. Here we report some preliminary results of the 2008 and 2009 campaigns. As an output, no news microlensing candidate events have been detected. In particular we discuss the crucial role played by the selected bump unicity analysis we carry out on archive POINT-AGAPE light curves. We compare the observed rate to the expected one evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation completed by an analysis of the efficiency of the The MOA-II survey detected beginning of the planetary signal in microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-266, so MOA's prompt anomaly alert led to nearly complete sampling of the planetary anomaly. Good light curve coverage from MOA and a number of the follow-up telescopes after the anomaly enabled the measurement of a strong microlensing parallax signal that allows the mass to be measured.</p><p>MOA-2009-BLG-266 is also the first planetary microlensing event to be observed from a telescope in Heliocentric orbit, as it was observed for ∼ 2 days by the High Resolution Instrument (HRI) of the Deep Impact (DI) spacecraft. The short duration and unfortunate timing of the space-based observations imply that these observations have only a weak constraint on the microlensing parallax measurement. But this data also indicates that future observations with the DI/HRI instrument in 2011-2014 will allow mass measurements of many microlens planets and their host stars, including the first mass measurements of planets in the Galactic bulge.</p></div>

Most microlensing planets have been found in events of high magnification. Events of highest magnification occur when the lens star transits the source star, but these events provide relatively poor sensitivity to planets. Previous research concentrated on highest magnification events, but, on purely geometrical grounds, near-perfect alignement is relatively rare and there must be more events at low magnification than at high magnification. It will be presented in a first part the interest of monitoring events of lower magnification, in order to increase the detection rate of low-mass planets.</p><p>MOA-2006-BLG-130 <ref type="bibr">(OGLE-2006-BLG-437</ref>) is a microlensing event that occurred in August 2006 which exhibited a slight perturbation on the light curve. In a second part, we will present the analysis of this event, in order to see whether or not it is a binary lens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Planetary perturbation detectability and magnification</head><p>Events of lower magnification may be subdivided into two classes : those in which the planet lies closer to the Einstein ring than the length of either Einstein arc (type I), and those in which the planet lies further away (type II), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>. Both type I and type II events enjoy good sensitivity to planets. In type II events, the planet is closer to the lens, and the planetary perturbation is greater when the magnification is higher. In type I events, the Einstein arc is affected by the proximity of the planet, and it will be shown that the sensitivity of these events to low-mass planets is almost independent of magnification. Using simulation programs of the MOA@UoA project <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, producing theoritical light curves, it will be demonstrated that the planetary perturbation is reasonably detectable in type I events, even at low magnification. It follows that monitoring further events of this type could increase the detection rate of low-mass planets. </p></div>

The timescale of this event is fairly long (t E = 32 days) and the span of the 2-body perturbation is &gt; 12 days because the caustic is resonant (the separation between the lens star and its companion in Einstein radii is ∼ 1). Because of the timescales involved we were able to measure both the parallax effect and the orbital motion of the lens. Using information from the parallax and orbital motion effects, we find that the companion is a 7.8 M Jup giant planet orbiting an 0.3 M ⊙ host with a semi-major axis of 2.2 AU.</p><p>We initially fit the data with a static, 2-body lens model including parallax effects but were unable to find a model that satisfactorily data. We are able to fit the data successfully by allowing orbital motion in the 2-body lens. We use two different models: the first uses only the lens velocity projected onto the plane of the sky and the second uses a full Keplerian description for the lens motion. We find that the full Keplerian model is slightly preferred (χ 2 improvement of 10). This preference for full Keplerian motion indicates that we are measuring the curvature of the orbit during the event and allows us to place constraints on most of the orbital parameters.</p><p>The source star in this event is unusually blue compared to the other stars in the field: it is 0.95 mag bluer than the red clump. Given its blue color, one possibility for the source is that it is an A dwarf in the bulge or behind the the bulge in the far disk. An alternative hypothesis is that the source is well in the foreground, in front of most of the dust. In this case, it would be a low mass dwarf that appears blue because it experiences much less reddening than the other stars in the field. Various inconclusive arguments can be made supporting each hypothesis, drawing on the observed relative proper motion, astrometry, source limb-darkening, and arguments about the observed color and magnitude of the source. However, in our analysis of the light curve, we find that in order for the orbit of the lens planet to be bound, the source must be a nearby M dwarf. If the source star is a nearby, metal-poor thick disk star, this explanation accounts for almost all of the information we have on the source. In order to clarify the nature of the source, we have applied for and been granted time on the VLT to Orbit of OGLE-2008-BLG-513/MOA-2008-BLG-401 get a spectrum of the source. Given our orbital motion observations, we predict that the source will be a low-mass star.</p><p>Regardless of the nature of the source, the mass ratio between the companion and the lens star is robust. A mass ratio of 0.027 is very rare among binary/brown dwarf/planetary systems regardless of the specific nature of the companion. If the spectrum confirms our interpretation of the event, this will be yet another example of a massive planet orbiting an M dwarf. Such planets are extremely difficult to form using present theories of planet formation. The core accretion theory predicts that such planets should be extremely rare because M dwarfs have less massive disks and short orbital timescales at the snow line where giant planets should form. The gravitational instability theory is able to form giant planets around M dwarfs but only at much larger distances than we observe in this system. This planet, and others like it, increasingly form a challenge to the accepted theories of planet formation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We present the first example of binary microlensing for which the parameter measurements can be verified (or contradicted) by future Doppler observations. This test is made possible by a confluence of two relatively unusual circumstances. First, the binary lens is bright enough (I = 15.6) to permit Doppler measurements. Second, we measure not only the usual 7 binary-lens parameters, but also the "microlens parallax" (which yields the binary mass) and two components of the instantaneous orbital velocity. Thus we measure, effectively, 6 'Kepler+1' parameters (two instantaneous positions, two instantaneous velocities, the binary total mass, and the mass ratio). Since Doppler observations of the brighter binary component determine 5 Kepler parameters (period, velocity amplitude, eccentricity, phase, and position of periastron), while the same spectroscopy yields the mass of the primary, the combined Doppler + microlensing observations would be overconstrained by 6 + (5 + 1) − (7 + 1) = 4 degrees of freedom. This makes possible an extremely strong test of the microlensing solution.</p><p>We also introduce the uniform microlensing notation for single and binary lenses, define conventions, summarize all known microlensing degeneracies and extend set of parameters to describe full Keplerian motion of the binary lenses (see Appendix A in the main paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Skowron et al. 2011</ref>, in prep.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Observational data</head><p>On 15 February 2009, heliocentric Julian Date (HJD) ∼ 2454878, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) team announced ongoing microlensing event OGLE-2009-BLG-020 detected by Early Warning System (EWS) and observed on the 1.3m Warsaw Telescope in Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The event was also monitored by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) 1.8m telescope on Mt. John in New Zealand. On HJD' ∼ 4915 (HJD ′ = HJD − 2450000) it could be seen that light curve was deviating from the standard Paczy´nskiPaczy´nski model, and follow-up observations by other telescopes began. Intense monitoring of the event was performed until HJD' ∼ 4920. During this period source crossed caustic twice and both crossings where observed.</p><p>In this work, beside the data obtained by survey telescopes, we use follow-up data from 8 additional observatories: the 2.0m Faulkes South (FTN), the 2.0m Faulkes North (FTN), the 36cm telescope at Kumeu Observatory, the 36cm telescope at Bronberg Observatory, the 1m telescope on Mt.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Microlensing fit with full Keplerian orbit</head><p>To find a microlensing model we use the method developed by S. Dong and described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Dong et al. (2006)</ref> and its modification in <ref type="bibr">Dong et al. (2009, Section 3)</ref>. Although we introduce a few changes in parametrization of the model. In order to allow comparison with the radial velocity (RV) measurements it is profitable to use the full Keplerian orbit parametrization. In addition to being more accurate, the additional advantage of this approach is to avoid all unbound orbital solutions (with eccentricity ≥ 1) and to enable introduction of priors on the values of orbital parameters directly into MCMC calculations, if one decides to adopt that approach.</p><p>We describe the orbit of the secondary component relative to the primary by giving 3 cartesian positions and 3 velocities at one arbitrarily chosen time (t 0,kep ). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. Our extended microlensing model (with parallax parameters) carries information about the mass ratio, the total mass of the lens, and the physical scale in the lens plane, so together with the six instantaneous phase-space coordinates it comprises a complete set of system parameters (except systemic radial velocity). This, for example, allows us to calculate the relative RV at any given time. We can use this for comparison with the RV curve from follow-up observations. It is possible to calculate all properties in physical units as well as standard Kepler parameters of the orbit -i.e., eccentricity (e), time of periastron (t peri ), semi-major axis (a) and 3 Euler angles: longitude of ascending node (Ω node ), inclination (i) and argument of periapsis (ω peri ). (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 3</ref> for illustration of the orbital parameters and they relation to the phase-space parameters specified at the fixed time t 0,kep .) The axis z points toward the observer; axes marked with symbols and ⊥ define the plane that is parallel to the plane of the sky and crosses the primary component of the binary. The portions of the line that lie behind the plane are dashed. The base coordinate system is related to the microlensing event such that at the time t 0,kep the first axis coincides with the binary axis projected onto plane of the sky.</p><p>Likelihoods obtained from MCMC procedure suffer from degeneracy between one of the parallax parameters (π E,⊥ -perpendicular to the Earth acceleration) and angular velocity of the lens in the plane of the sky. We break this degeneracy by choosing subset of solutions which yields observed brightness of the lens consistent with the theoretical main-sequence isochrone (we assume that all blended light is coming from the lens, and, with mass ratio q = 0.27, we expect that the secondary component of the lens does not contribute to the light). This leads to estimations of the lens distance and the mass of its primary component:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D l = 1.1 ± 0.1 kpc M 1 = 0.84 ± 0.03 M ⊙<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The observed magnitudes of the blend and the source are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">((V − I), I, (I − H)) b = (1.316 ± 0.01, 15.680 ± 0.01, 1.409 ± 0.05)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>((V − I), I) s = (1.929 ± 0.002, 16.43 ± 0.04)</p></div>

Assuming the observations of the RV curve of the primary are taken, we can assign to every link the likelihood that it is consistent with those data. We derive the radial velocity for any time the data were taken and, allowing for systemic velocity of the center of mass of the binary to vary, we calculate the likelihoods for every point. In this way we construct new set of links weighted by, both, the microlensing light curve and radial velocity curve. This new set of solutions yields new, most probable, values of all lens parameters, which may or may not coincide with the values derived from the microlensing only solution. This would be a test of microlensing solution.</p><p>If new values of parameters will lie outside 3-σ limits of microlensing solution we can say that our method failed. By contrast, if solutions, which are consistent with the RV curve, lie near the best-fit values we obtained from microlensing we can not only believe our solution, but we can also read all parameters of the binary, which are not given by one or the other method alone. For example, radial velocity curve will give us period and systemic radial velocity, which we cannot read from the microlensing light curve alone. However, microlensing will yield the inclination, orientation on the sky and the 2-d velocity of the binary projected on the plane of the sky.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Efficiency and planet population statistics</head><p>Planetary abundance statistics cannot be extracted simply from counting claimed detections. We need to understand what the characteristics of the monitoring campaigns are, which might have changed over time. In fact, the observed sample is a probabilistic realisation of the product of the underlying planet population and the detection efficiency of the experiment(s). This however means that the considered sample and the detection efficiency need to refer to the same detection criterion and monitoring strategy. Not only does the detection efficiency need to be evaluated in a statistical meaningful way, but also do the "detections" need to be counted accordingly <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, not suprisingly, with different approaches being followed by the various surveys and follow-up monitoring campaigns, their detection efficiencies are substantially different functions of the planet mass m p and orbital separation r p . For the most massive planets, there is not much gain with less than daily sampling, so that survey experiments with their larger number of observed events have the largest sensitivity <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13]</ref>, whereas less massive planets with their shorter signals become undetectable by falling into the data gaps. With regular quasi-continuous high-precision round-theclock monitoring, as carried out by PLANET <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, RoboNet <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref>, or MiNDSTEp <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, the planet detection efficiency drops roughly as √ m p , until the finite size of the source stars at a few Earth masses causes a faster drop-off and subsequently undetectability <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>. If, like µFUN, one focuses on highly-magnified peaks, probing the central caustic close to the lens star, the detection efficiency is close to 100 % for a wide range of planetary masses, with just the range of orbital separations shrinking towards lower masses, and it then falls to zero rather suddenly <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. The history of claimed microlensing planet detections seems to follow a pattern that matches the characteristics of the different campaigns: A first super-Jupiter from the OGLE and MOA surveys <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, the 5-Earth-mass planet OGLE-2005-BLG390Lb from PLANET observations <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, and planets from high-magnification peaks monitored by µFUN <ref type="bibr">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">24]</ref>. Moreover, a larger number of detections in the region between Neptune and Saturn <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26]</ref> arose in the more recent years due to increased survey cadence.</p><p>However, rough planet abundance estimates give rather puzzling results. A welldefined sample of events with peak magnifications A 0 ≥ 200, densely covered mostly by µFUN data <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> indicates an abundance for massive gas giants that is about 10 times larger than what one would estimate from PLANET observations and the corresponding detections <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[27]</ref>. Despite the fact that both estimates are statistically compatible within their large uncertainties, these findings are somewhat surprising given that the PLANET observations are more powerful in this mass range, but have provided less detections. In fact, the 4-year µFUN sample contains just 13 events, which means that the adopted strategy is not powerful enough for providing a planetary mass function in foreseeable time; increased efforts of monitoring a larger number of events at more moderate magnifications, as follow-up efforts or high-cadence surveys, are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[27]</ref>. The detection of a planetary signal in event MOA-2009-BLG-266, resembling the path that led to OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, clearly demonstrates the power of the regular follow-up approach (which in fact is just copied by the MOA high-cadence monitoring).</p><p>With the current small number of planetary detections, microlensing observations are still in their very infancy on the path to determining planet abundances, and any kind of planetary mass function is a long way ahead. A particular complication arises from the fact that the planet abundances strongly depend on the properties of the parent star, and microlensing events come with a probabilistic mixture of host stars. Should more massive stars come with more or less planets of a certain kind, what planetary mass function are we talking about? Distinguishing between masses of planet host stars requires a much larger sample for drawing meaningful conclusions. Stellar metallicity is a further relevant parameter that is difficult to control, and the fact that microlensing probes both Galactic disk and bulge stars is a challenge as well as an opportunity.</p><p>While planetary microlensing naturally depends on the dimensionless separation parameter d and the planet-to-star mass ratio q, planet formation does not obey such a scaling law, regardless of whether planet formation theories give us good guidance or not. Moreover, the adoption of any specific functional form, just for its simplicity, that is not clearly supported by the data, may not be adequate to probe certain features. In particular, smooth monotonic functions are ill-suited to describe planetary deserts or cut-offs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Moving forward</head><p>Maximizing the number of detections without adopting well-defined monitoring procedures might lead to further spectacular findings, but will be useless for studying planet populations. High-cadence surveys have already proven their extended sensitivity to planets with smaller masses. In order to obtain meaningful results on planet population statistics, deviations from a deterministic survey programme must be made in a deterministic way only as well. Otherwise, claimed detections cannot be used to gather statistical information. It has also been demonstrated that the automated detection of anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[28]</ref> increases the detection efficiency, and in particular allows for the realistic detection of planets of Earth mass and below, while keeping the deterministic process chain intact. The real-time identification of potential deviations from ordinary light curves is essential for the current ability to push further down in mass, but if we want to determine the abundance of such planets as well, this identification must not be left to human judgement. If planets of Earth mass and below are common, recent survey data give rise to speculating that opportunities have been missed for claiming such a detection. If we want to make an impact now, the real-time provision of photometric data within minutes (not within hours) is likely to make the crucial difference. Beyond that, and in the longer term, precision photometry on fainter stars would allow for far better statistics on low-mass planets.</p><p>[26] N. Miyake et al., Astrophys. J., accepted, preprint arXiv.org:1010.1809 <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[27]</ref>  It was first proposed by <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> that gravitational microlensing could be used to detect extrasolar planets. To date, over 500 have been discovered, with microlensing planets, although relatively few in number, probing a region of the mass versus semi-major axis plane that is currently out of reach of the other methods, with the sensitivity peaking just beyond ∼ 1 AU. Microlensing planets are therefore very useful for placing constraints on planet formation models.</p><p>We simulate light curves for 1000 extrasolar planet systems around host stars of mass 0.25M ⊙ drawn from the Ida &amp; Lin core accretion models of planet formation <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The simulated data is first fitted with a single-lens model. If the fit is poor, combinations of the planets most likely to be causing perturbations are placed around the star and new light curves are generated to attempt to reproduce the original light curve.</p><p>We found that the majority of the light curves were well-fitted by single-lens models. However, 26 were not and hence were determined to contain pertubations due to at least one planet. Of the 26 interesting light curves, it was found that 16 could be explained by single planets. A greater number of planets were necessary to explain the remaining 10 cases. These results place an upper limit on the number of planets that would be deduced by a fitting procedure since it might be possible to produce the original light curve with a fewer number of planets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the latest version of the software we have developed for modelling gravitational microlensing events that involve multiple lensing masses. Of particular interest is the modelling of planetary microlensing events requiring two or more lensing masses.</p><p>The basic thin lens equation relating a point source image position, s, to the positions, r, of the multiple images created by the N lensing masses is simple enough,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">s = r − N j=1 ǫ j</formula><p>r − r j |r − r j | 2 , where r j and ǫ j are the lens positions and mass fractions,</p><p>The positions in this expression are in units of the Einstein ring radius corresponding to the total lens mass. Except for the single lens case, inverting the equation in order to determine each image position directly is not a trivial exercise. In fact, the inversion procedure is relatively complicated for even the two-mass lens and it rapidly becomes unmanageable when the number of lensing massses increases much beyond two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Inverse Ray-tracing</head><p>The above inversion difficulty has led to wide-spread use of the "brute force" approach called inverse ray tracing: "all" potential positions in the image plane are checked in order to determine which ones are consistent with a given source position. Each determination is straight forward since it is clear that a simple substitution of an image position in the above lens equation yields a unique source position origin.</p><p>Due to the potentially large number of calculations required, access to significant computing power makes this technique a practical proposition, but it can also be improved by use of efficient image plane search techniques or better still recording all image plane, source plane correspondences in order to create a so-called magnification map. This map can be used to generate a microlensing light curve, since the source magnification at a given position can be directly estimated from the area density of points (inverse rays) in the source plane relative to the density in the image plane. A particular light curve can be rapidly computed by calculating the changing "ray" density ratio for any chosen source track. This method includes finite source size effects directly along with source limb darkening if required, by weighting ray densities in the source disk. Observer/source parallax effects can also be included via appropriately curved source tracks. However, internal lens configuration changes will alter the magnification map and accuracy depends directly on the density of rays covering the image plane, which of course has computational implications.</p><p>Modelling code using this methodology was developed as part of a PhD programme at VUW <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and it has been used to model a range of planetary microlensing events. Recently, we decided to pursue the approach of directly inverting the lensing equation. One particular motivation for this work was to enable satisfactory modelling of lens motion effects, but the overall approach is also more efficient, at least for systems with no more than four lenses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Polynomial Method</head><p>The algebra is greatly simplified by representing the two dimensional plane positions using complex coordinates as first introduced by Witt <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The lens equation relating source position (s → ω = u + iv) to image positions (r → z = x + iy) for N lenses (r j → z j = x j + iy j ) then becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ω = z − N j=1 ǫ j z − z j or, ω = z − N j=1 ǫ j z − z j (in complex conjugate form)</formula><p>Combining both forms of this lensing equation into one equation for image position z for a two mass lens system produces a complex fifth order polynomial, whose five roots are potential image positions. Back substitution is required in order determine if a root corresponds to a real image position, as there can be three or five images depending on the geometry. In general, the complex fifth order polynomial can only be solved numerically but there are algorithms to accomplish this. We use the method of Jenkins and Traub <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> in combination with root polishing using the Laguerre method <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> to obtain accurate root values.</p><p>Given that the light bending in a gravitational field does not change the intrinsic source brightness, the point source magnification at each image position, z = x + iy, is given by the ratio of the infinitesimal area element δA xy = dxdy in the image plane to the corresponding elemental area δA uv in the source plane at the position w = u + iv. This quantity is given by the determinant of the Jacobian for the transformation of the point z(x, y) in the image plane to the point w(u, v) in the source plane, as governed by the above lensing equation. But, it is the 'Jacobian' (J) of the inverse transformation from the source position to the image position that is readily determined and, given the geometrical nature of the quantity, the absolute value of the inverse provides the value of interest. We have: The point source magnification of each image formed at the position z is therefore 1/|J(z)| and the combined magnification for all unresolved images is simply the sum over these quantities.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">J = ∂u</formula><p>The critical curves (and the corresponding caustics) are the locii of points where the point source magnification formally diverges and are thus determined from the requirement that this inverse Jacobian is zero; this leads to a set of fourth order complex polynomials for the two mass lens system.</p><p>Assembling the expressions that give the coefficients of the complex polynomials is rather tedious <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and a symbolic algebra computer package such as Maple is of considerable assistance. However, we have found that (substantial) further manual manipulation can lead to more compact and efficient expressions. This is particularly the case for lensing systems with three and even four masses. And, we have included both these cases in our code. The three-mass case yields a complex 10 th order polynomial <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, while the four-mass system leads to a 17 th order polynomial requiring the determination of no less than 18 complex coefficients. The critical curve polynomials for these systems are of 6 th and 8 th order respectively.</p><p>Finite source effects become important when the source disk is near a caustic curve and are important in planetary events. We have included these in the software package by using a combination of two methods: a hexadecapole expansion and a numerical integration procedure we call the polygon method. The hexadecapole expansion method <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> employs multiple point source magnification values to estimate the magnification resulting from a finite source, including limb darkening effects if required. The polygon method is based on the work of Gould and Gaucherel <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and uses polygons to represent the source disk and image figures and thereby estimate the areas. Limb darkening effects are included in this method by using a network of "concentric" polygons.</p><p>A method promoted by Bennett <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> for finite source effects first employs the polynomial approach to locate the image centres and then adopts the inverse ray-tracing method in the vicinity of each image to estimate the limb-darkening integrals over the images. We are looking at implementing this approach as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In spite of the expression complexity in calculating the lensing polynomial coefficients, we have found our new code to be competitive speed-wise with the inverse ray-tracing approach. The rapidly rising level of complexity and the large numbers of terms in the coefficient expressions makes the polynomial method impractical for more than four lensing masses. For n lenses the order of the polynomial is n 2 +1, so for n = 5 lenses we have 27 coefficients to determine. Furthermore, we need to employ numerical methods to extract 26 complex root values from the 26 th order polynomial and determine which ones correspond to real image positions. It is reasonably clear that the inverse raytracing approach will be more efficient for these cases, at least for examples with no lens motion.</p><p>When lens motion is involved, the polynomial method is both more efficient and faster than inverse ray tracing. A three-mass lensing system consisting of a star and two planets has already been discovered and successfully modelled <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, and it could be the case that a system of a star and three planets is found and usefully modelled. But it is probably the case that endeavouring to model a microlensing light curve with five lensing masses or more (and perhaps even four) is very unlikely to produce useful physical information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Due to the continuously improving computer power available in dedicated hardware, clusters and computing grids, real-time binary modeling is now being tested and used by different microlensing groups. In addition to CPU-based computing, one can exploit the possibility of speeding-up calculations using graphic cards which are available at reasonable prices and have a reduced carbon footprint. These Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) offer a increased capability concerning the number of floating point operations per second but at the cost of careful flow control management. Naturally, these GPUs are well suited for ray-tracing but in this work a pointwise approach for simulating lightcurves on the basis of contouring techniques is also possible, despite some system dependent drawbacks concerning the accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">GPU-contouring</head><p>The use of GPUs for gravitational microlensing simulations seems natural as their design is driven by the needs of intensive ray-tracing computer games applications. The advantages and disadvantages when used for scientific ray-tracing have been shown, e.g. by <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. One bottle-neck for a fast fitting environment is the limited data transfer capacity between CPU and GPU. In order to ease the burden of transfer back and forth to the GPU a large fraction of the analysis must be executed on the GPU and needs to be optimized for these machines, since they offer the highest performance for standard single-precision floating point numbers.</p><p>As an alternative, we have implemented the contouring technique on GPUs aiming to preserve the pointwise calculation of lightcurves by parallelizing the root-finding and subsequent integration of the image contours as by <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the technical limitations of a computing system with many processing units, the number of required computations and variables has to be kept low. This comes at the price of careful flow control management. For this purpose, the squared deviation between lens and source position as introduced by <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> has been used. A point-wise parallelisation of the root-finding was achieved by solving the lens equation on a polar grid (cf. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>), where the radial search for potential roots was carried out as one thread, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 1</ref>. Afterwards, the elements are integrated with a simple Gaussian quadrature. This approach is particularly efficient for planetary events with modest angular separations and source positions |β| &lt; 1.5 θ E . A test implementation on a system with 240 streaming processors 1 is able to simulate a lightcurve consisting of 1000 points in one second. Root-finding threads cannot communicate in this approach and thus it would be more difficult to implement a hierarchical approach as by <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to existing CPU-based solutions, the demanded accuracy cannot always be achieved, as most commonly used GPUs exclusively compute with singleprecision 2 floating numbers or require a substantial overhead for operating at doubleprecision. On single-precision machines the root-finding accuracy is limited by 5 · 10 −7 θ E in the radial direction, which directly affects the maximal achievable accuracy and accessible sources star radii r ⋆ . Estimating the magnification as an integration of evenly sized squares in 128 2 search directions per grid gives at zeroth order an uncertainty of</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">σ µ ≈ 10 −6 r −1 ⋆ .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>1 NVIDIA R Tesla TM C1060 2 IEEE 754 single-precision (32 bits) Models for ground-based microlensing lightcurves require a model accuracy of better than 10 −3 and thus the applicability of the model is limited to source star radii ≥ 10 −3 θ E . Beyond that limit, only relative precision can be guaranteed. The effect of missing solutions at the edges is ∝ 1/N and thus the aforementioned number of 128 2 elements is a compromise between runtime, single-precision round-off error, and numerical uncertainty of the integration. The benefits of refining the grids for keeping the requested accuracy is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. Comparing current simulations with magnification maps <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, indicate that the numerical accuracy stays below 10 −3 at one sigma level as demanded. </p></div>

For example, in the last years, the possibility to investigate the distribution of exo-planetary systems by means of the microlensing has been pointed out to the scientific community. The advantages for using it are huge and span from the high sensitivity to relatively low mass planets and large observer-lens distances to the unique possibility of detecting free-floating planets. Gravitational microlensing surveys may also give the possibility of a planetary census throughout the Galaxy <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Another technique used to search for exo-planets is that of detecting transit events by means of the differential photometry analysis of the sources.</p><p>Both transits and microlensing techniques are very close from the observational point of view, since both are photometric-based and the observer has to search for deviations from the baseline flux. In the transit case one seeks for a decrease in the signal flux while for microlensing events an amplification is present. In both cases, the analysis is to be made on light curves.</p><p>To this aim, we decided to study and characterize the noise (typically red or pink noise which could mimic a microlensing feature) of a sample of light curves from a space-based experiment. In this prospective we have considered a sample of light curves taken from the CoRoT 1 satellite, a space-based experiment projected by the "Centre National d'Etudes Spatials" (CNES) in collaboration with the French </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>David Heyrovsk´yHeyrovsk´y Institute of Theoretical Physics, Charles University in Prague Czech Republic</head><p>During the analysis of caustic-crossing microlensing events the source star is typically modeled by analytical limb-darkening laws -most often linear, in a few cases higher-order laws (square-root, quadratic). An alternative option is to use a nonanalytical limb-darkening model based on principal component analysis of model atmospheres <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>, which gives a more accurate description of the source-star intensity profile <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. To guide the choice of limb-darkening model during event analysis we need to know the photometric error introduced by assuming a particular model. In order to answer this question, we compute single-lens caustic-crossing light curves for stellar model atmospheres from Kurucz's ATLAS9 grid in a representative set of photometric bands, and compare them with light curves of sources with different approximations of the underlying limb darkening. We demonstrate both the amplitude of the introduced photometric error and the corresponding residual pattern. We discuss the implications of our results for the analysis of single and two-point-mass caustic-crossing events. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Stars with masses greater than ∼ 20 M ⊙ are thought to end their lives as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Fryer &amp; Kalogera 2001</ref>). Yet, there has never been an unambiguous detection of an isolated black hole, since they emit no radiation. The only detected BHs to date are through their X-ray emissions in binary systems, where their masses have been measured through radial velocity measurements. Solitary BHs are detectable with current microlensing searches like OGLE and MOA. These campaigns have already detected several BH candidates.  have described two events: MACHO 96-BLG-5 and MACHO 98-BLG-6, with mass estimates of &gt; 6 solar mass.  concluded that MACHO 99-BLG-22 is a BH candidate with a minimum mass of 10.5 M ⊙ . However, all these claims are statistical in nature, since determination of the lens mass from the microlensing light curve alone suffers from a degeneracy between the distance to the lens, the mass of the lens, and the source-lens relative proper motion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Black Hole Detections through Microlensing</head><p>Microlensing survey programs typically detect &gt; 1000 microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge per year. A few of them have long durations, and these longduration events (t E &gt; 150 days) could potentially be arising from lenses with masses larger than 10 M ⊙ . For most of them, the light from the lens itself is negligible. So it has been suggested that a majority of them are due to massive, non-luminous stellar remnants. However, a long-duration microlensing event can be also by a low-mass lens passing in front of the source with a small relative motion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Astrometry Resolves the Degeneracy</head><p>Microlensing not only causes a photometric amplification, but it also causes a small astrometric shift in the position of the source (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 1 for illustrations)</ref>. This astrometric shift is generally undetectable from ground-based observations. But, for lenses with masses of ∼ 5 M ⊙ , the astrometric shift is expected to be ∼ 1.4 mas, which is easily detectable with HST. This astrometric shift, coupled with the parallax effect generally observed for the long-duration events, allows a determination of the mass of the lens unambiguously, thus resolving the degeneracy between the low-mass and the high-mass lenses <ref type="bibr">(Sahu &amp; Dominik 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Mass Determinations of the BH Candidates and Implications</head><p>We expect to achieve an astrometric precision of ∼0.2 mas at each epoch of HST observations. Thus a shift of 1.4 mas as expected from a 5 M ⊙ BH would be detected at 7 sigma. The 0.2 mas error translates to an error of about 0.75 M ⊙ in mass measurement. Thus we can determine masses with about 15% precision at 5 M ⊙ or 8% at 10 M ⊙ .</p><p>Thus our program has the potential of making the first unequivocal detections of isolated black holes, and the first direct mass measurements for isolated stellar-mass BHs through any technique.

Detection of these BHs will provide the very first clues on the frequency of isolated BHs in the Galaxy, which have strong implications on the slope of the IMF at high masses.</p><p>This project uses the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, operated by AURA for NASA. </p></div>

To date, blind searches for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes (NSs and BHs herafter) likely accreting from the interstellar medium (ISM) have failed to reveal any promising candidates.</p><p>Dark compact objects may still manifest themselfs through the effect of their gravitational field on the light of background sources, i.e. as microlensing events, in particular towards the Galactic bulge, where the density sources is larger. The contribution of NSs and BHs to the microlensing rate towards the bulge has been estimated by e.g. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Here we present a quantitative analisys of this contribution, under the hypothesis that both NSs and BHs are born with large kick velocities (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>) and compare this contribution with that of "normal" stars, that is brown dwarfs, main sequence stars and white dwarfs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model and Results</head><p>We built a model of the distribution of normal stars in the bulge and disk of the Galaxy (see <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> for a detailed description of the model and procedure adopted) and followed the orbits of synthetic bulge-born and disk-born isolated compact objects in the Galactic potential. Following <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, the normalization of the phase space distribution of NSs and BHs was estimated from the stellar initial mass function assuming that all stars with initial mass greater than 1 M ⊙ are in the remnant phase. In particular, stars with inital mass between 8 and 40 solar masses are now NSs with M = 1.4 M ⊙ , while stars with mass &gt; 40 M ⊙ are now BHs with M = 10 M ⊙ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sartore &amp; Treves</head><p>The observability of isolated compact remnants with ML Then, we calculated the optical depth and the distribution of event time scales for normal stars, NSs and BHs towards different lines of sight (l.o.s. hereafter). The optical depth obtained was lower than the case in which NSs and BHs are born without kicks. This can be easily explained since objects with large velocity have a larger scale height. Thus, the spatial density along the l.o.s. is lower. On the other hand, a fast moving object is expected to give a higher rate of events with respect to an object with lower velocity. In fact, we found that the fraction of microlensing events due to isolated NSs and BHs is larger than that expected in the case of non kicks. In particular, for events longer than 100 days, we estimated that about 50% of the events are likely due to NSs and BHs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">abstract</head><p>A method to calculate light curves of the gravitational microlensing of the Ellis wormhole is derived in the weak-field limit. In this limit, lensing by the wormhole produces one image outside the Einstein ring and one other image inside. The weak-field hypothesis is a good approximation in Galactic lensing if the throat radius is less than 10 11 km. The light curves calculated have gutters of approximately 4% immediately outside the Einstein ring crossing times. The magnification of the Ellis wormhole lensing is generally less than that of Schwarzschild lensing. The optical depths and event rates are calculated for the Galactic bulge and Large Magellanic Cloud fields according to bound and unbound hypotheses. If the wormholes have throat radii between 100 and 10 7 km, are bound to the galaxy, and have a number density that is approximately that of ordinary stars, detection can be achieved by reanalyzing past data. If the wormholes are unbound, detection using past data is impossible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction</head><p>A solution of the Einstein equation that connects distant points of space-time was introduced by <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. This "Einstein-Rosen bridge" was the first solution to later be referred to as a wormhole. Initially, this type of solution was just a trivial or teaching example of mathematical physics. However, <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> proved that some wormholes are "traversable"; i.e., space and time travel can be achieved by passing through the wormholes. They also showed that the existence of a wormhole requires exotic matter that violates the null energy condition. Although they are very exotic, the existence of wormholes has not been ruled out in theory. Inspired by the Morris-Thorne paper, there have been a number of theoretical works (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref> and references therein) on wormholes. The curious natures of wormholes, such as time travel, energy conditions, space-time foams, and growth of a wormhole in an accelerating universe have been studied. Although there have been enthusiastic theoretical studies, studies searching for real evidence of the existence of wormholes are scarce. Only a few attempts have been made to show the existence or nonexistence of wormholes.</p><p>A possible observational method that has been proposed to detect or exclude the existence of wormholes is the application of optical gravitational lensing. The gravitational lensing of wormholes was pioneered by <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, who inferred that some wormholes show "negative mass" lensing. They showed that the light curve of the negative-mass lensing event of a distant star has singular double peaks. Several authors subsequently conducted theoretical studies on detectability <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">9]</ref>. Another gravitational lensing method employing gamma rays was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[38]</ref>, who postulated that the singular negative-mass lensing of distant active galactic nuclei causes a sharp spike of gamma rays and may be observed as double-peaked gamma-ray bursts. They analyzed BASTE data and set a limit for the density of the negative-mass objects.</p><p>There have been several recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref> on the gravitational lensing of wormholes as structures of space-time. Such studies are expected to unveil lensing properties directly from the space-time structure. One study <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> calculated the deflection angle of light due to the Ellis wormhole, whose asymptotic mass at infinity is zero. The massless wormhole is particularly interesting because it is expected to have unique gravitational lensing effects. The Ellis wormhole is expressed by the line element</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ds 2 = dt 2 − dr 2 − (r 2 + a 2 )(dθ 2 + sin 2 (θ)dφ 2 ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a is the throat radius of the wormhole. This type of wormhole was first introduced by <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> as a massless scalar field. Later, <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> studied this wormhole and proved it to be traversable. The dynamical feature was studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[35]</ref>, who showed that Gaussian perturbation causes either explode to an inflationary universe or collapse to a black hole. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> showed that the tchyon condensate can be a source for the Ellis geometry.</p><p>In this paper, we derive the light curve of lensing by the Ellis wormhole and discuss its detectability. In Section 2, we discuss gravitational lensing by the Ellis wormhole in the weak-field limit. The light curves of wormhole events are discussed in Section 3. The validity of the weak-field limit is discussed in Section 4. The optical depth and event rate are discussed in Section 5. The results are summarized in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Gravitational lensing</head><p>Magnification of the apparent brightness of a distant star by the gravitational lensing effect of another star was predicted by <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. This kind of lensing effect is called "microlensing" because the images produced by the gravitational lensing are very close to each other and are difficult for the observer to resolve. The observable effect is the changing apparent brightness of the source star only. This effect was discovered in 1993 <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref> and has been used to detect astronomical objects that do not emit observable signals (such as visible light, radio waves, and X rays) or are too faint to observe.

The gravitational microlensing of the Schwarzschild metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">27]</ref> has been studied in the weak-field limit. In this section, we simply follow the method used for Schwarzschild lensing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref> shows the relation between the source star, the lens (wormhole), and the observer. The Ellis wormhole is known to be a massless wormhole, which means that the asymptotic mass at infinity is zero. However, this wormhole deflects light by gravitational lensing <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref> because of its curved space-time structure. The deflection angle α(r) of the Ellis wormhole was derived by <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α(r) = π    2(r 2 + a 2 ) 2r 2 + a 2 − 1    ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where r is the closest approach of the light. In the weak-field limit (r → ∞), the deflection angle becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">α(r) → π 4 a 2 r 2 − 5π 32 a 4 r 4 + o a r 6 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The angle between the lens (wormhole) and the source β can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">β = 1 D L b − D LS D S α(r),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where D L , D S , D LS , and b are the distances from the observer to the lens, from the observer to the source, and from the lens to the source, and the impact parameter of the light, respectively. In the asymptotic limit, Schwarzschild lensing and massive Janis-Newman-Winnicour (JNW) wormhole lensing <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> have the same leading term of o (1/r). Therefore, the lensing property of the JNW wormhole is approximately the same as that of Schwarzschild lensing and is difficult to distinguish. As shown in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(3)</ref>, the deflection angle of the Ellis wormhole does not have the term of o (1/r) and starts from o (1/r 2 ). This is due to the massless nature of the Ellis wormhole and indicates the possibility of observational discrimination from the ordinary gravitational lensing effect. In the weak-field limit, b is approximately equal to the closest approach r. For the Ellis wormhole, b = √ r 2 + a 2 → r(r → ∞). We thus obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">β = r D L − π 4 D LS D S a 2 r 2 (r &gt; 0).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The light passing through the other side of the lens may also form images. However, Equation (5) represents deflection in the wrong direction at r &lt; 0. Thus, we must change the sign of the deflection angle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">β = r D L + π 4 D LS D S a 2 r 2 (r &lt; 0).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>It would be useful to note that a single equation is suitable both for r &gt; 0 and r &lt; 0 images in the Schwarzschild lensing. However, such treatment is applicable only when the deflection angle is an odd function of r.</p><p>If the source and lens are completely aligned along the line of sight, the image is expected to be circular (an Einstein ring). The Einstein radius R E , which is defined as the radius of the circular image on the lens plane, is obtained from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">(5)</ref> with β = 0 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">R E = 3 π 4 D L D LS D S a 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The image positions can then be calculated from</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">β = θ − θ 3 E θ 2 (θ &gt; 0)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">β = θ + θ 3 E θ 2 (θ &lt; 0),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where θ = b/D L ≈ r/D L is the angle between the image and lens, and θ E = R E /D L is the angular Einstein radius.

The detection of a lens for which the Einstein radius is smaller than the star radius (≈ 10 6 km) is very difficult because most of the features of the gravitational lensing are smeared out by the finite-source effect. Thus, detecting a wormhole with a throat radius less than 1 km from the Galactic gravitational lensing of a star is very difficult.</p></div>

The light curves obtained from Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(18)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(19)</ref> are shown as thick red lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Figure 4</ref>. The light curves corresponding to Schwarzschild lensing are shown as thin green lines for comparison. The magnifications by the Ellis wormhole are generally less than those of Schwarzschild lensing. The light curve of the Ellis wormhole forˆβ forˆ forˆβ o &lt; 1.0 shows characteristic gutters on both sides of the peak immediately outside the Einstein ring crossing times (t = t 0 ± t E ). The depth of the gutters is about 4% from the baseline. Amazingly, the star becomes fainter than normal in terms of apparent brightness in the gutters. This means that the Ellis wormhole lensing has offcenter divergence. In conventional gravitational lensing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[33]</ref>, the convergence of light is expressed by a convolution of the surface mass density. Thus, we need to introduce negative mass to describe divergent lensing by the Ellis wormhole. However, negative mass is not a physical enitity. As the lensing by the Ellis wormhole is convergent at the center, lensing at some other place must be divergent because the wormhole has zero asymptotic mass. ForˆβForˆ Forˆβ o &gt; 1.0, the light curve of the wormhole has a basin at t 0 and no peak. Using these features, discrimination from Schwarzschild lensing can be achieved. Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">(7)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(20)</ref> indicate that physical parameters (D L , a, and v T ) are degenerate in t E and cannot be derived by fitting the light-curve data. This situation is the same as that for Schwarzschild lensing. To obtain or constrain these values, observations of the finite-source effect <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> or parallax <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> are necessary.</p><p>The detectability of the magnification of the star brightness depends on the timescale. The Einstein radius crossing time t E depends on the transverse velocity v T . There is no reliable estimate of v T for wormholes. Here we assume that the velocity of the wormhole is approximately equal to the rotation velocity of stars (v T = 220 km/s) if it is bound to the Galaxy. If the wormhole is not bound to our Galaxy, the transverse velocity would be much higher. We assume v T = 5000 km/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[32]</ref> for the unbound wormhole. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 2</ref> shows the Einstein radius crossing times of the Ellis wormhole lensings for the Galactic bulge and LMC in both bound and unbound scenarios. As the frequencies of current microlensing observations are limited to once every few hours, an event for which the timescale is less than one day is difficult to detect. To find very long timescale events (t E ≥ 1000 days), long-term monitoring of events is necessary. The realistic period of observation is ≤ 10 years. Thus, the realistic size of the throat that we can search for is limited to 100 km ≤ a ≤ 10 7 km both for the Galactic bulge and LMC if wormholes are bound to our Galaxy. If wormholes are unbound, the detection is limited to 10 5 km ≤ a ≤ 10 9 km.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1/3</head><p>S a 2/3 is derived from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">(7)</ref> for D L ≈ D S /2. This means that R E is much greater than a if a ≪ D S . Thus, the weak-field approximation is suitable if the throat radius is negligibly small compared with the source distance. For the inner image, the higherorder effect is expected to be greater than that for the outer image. However, the contribution of the inner image to the total brightness is small and decreases quickly withˆβwithˆ withˆβ (A 2 /A = 0.034 forˆβforˆ forˆβ = 2 and 0.013 forˆβforˆ forˆβ = 3). On the other hand, the absolute value of the correspondingˆθcorrespondingˆ correspondingˆθ does not decrease as quickly ( ˆ θ = −0.618 for β = 2 and −0.532 for β = 3). Thus the contribution of the higher order effect of the second image to the total brightness is expected to be small.</p><p>Another possibility of deviation from the weak-field approximation is the contribution of relativistic images. Recently, gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[40]</ref> has been studied for lensing by black holes. In this limit, light rays are strongly bent and wound close to the photon sphere. As a result, a number of relativistic images appear around the photon sphere. However, it has been shown that there is no photon sphere <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> in Ellis wormhole lensing. Therefore, there is no contribution of relativistic images to the magnification in Ellis wormhole lensing. We thus conclude that the weak-field hypothesis is a good approximation unless the throat radius is comparable to the galactic distance.</p></div>

Several authors <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref> have speculated that wormholes are very common in the universe, at least as abundant as stars. Even if we accept such speculation, there are still large uncertainties in the value of n because the distribution of wormholes is not specified. Here, we introduce two possibilities. One is that wormholes are bound to the Galaxy and the number density is approximately equal to the local stellar density. The other possibility is that wormholes are not bound to the Galaxy and are approximately uniformly distributed throughout the universe. For the bound hypothesis, we use n = ρ Ls /M star = 0.147 pc −3 , where ρ Ls is the local stellar density in the solar neighborhood, ρ Ls = 0.044 M ⊙ pc −3 , and M star is the average mass of stars. We use M star = 0.3 M ⊙ , a typical mass of an M dwarf; i.e., the dominant stellar component in the Galaxy. For the unbound hypothesis, we assumed that the number density of the wormholes is the same as the average stellar density of the universe. The stellar density of the universe is estimated assuming that the fraction of baryonic matter accounted for by star is the same as that of the solar neighborhood. Then we obtain n = ρ c Ω b ρ Ls /(ρ Lb M star ) = 4.97 × 10 −9 pc −3 , where ρ c = 1.48 × 10 −7 M ⊙ p −3 is the critical density, Ω b = 0.042 is the baryon density of the universe divided by the critical density, and ρ Ls = 0.044 M ⊙ pc −3 and ρ Lb = 0.18 M ⊙ pc −3 are the local star and local baryon densities, respectively.</p><p>Using these values, we calculated the optical depths and event rates for bulge and LMC lensings. <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 3</ref> presents the results for the bulge lensings. In an ordinary Schwarzschild microlensing survey, observations are made of more than 10 million stars. Thus, we can expect approximately 10 7 Γ events in a year. However, the situation is different in a wormhole search. As mentioned previously, the magnification of wormhole lensing is less than that of Schwarzschild lensing, and a remarkable feature of wormhole lensing is the decreasing brightness around the Einstein radius crossing times. Past microlensing surveys have mainly searched for stars that increase in brightness. The stars monitored are those with magnitudes down to the limiting magnitude or less. However, we need to find stars that decrease in brightness in the wormhole search. To do so, we need to watch brighter stars. Therefore, far fewer stars can be monitored than in an ordinary microlensing survey. Furthermore, the detection efficiency of the wormhole is thought to be less than that for Schwarzschild lensing because of the low magnification. Here we assume that the effective number of stars monitored to find a wormhole is 10 6 . To expect more than one event in a survey of several years, Γ must be greater than ∼ 10 −6 . The values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 3</ref> indicate that the detection of wormholes with a &gt; 10 4 km is expected in the microlensing survey of the Galactic bulge in the case of the bound model. The results of the optical depths and the event rates for LMC lensing are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 4</ref>. On the basis of the same discussion for bulge lensing, we expect Γ &gt; 10 −6 to find a wormhole. The event rates expected for LMC lensing are greater than those for bulge lensing. We expect detection of a wormhole event if a &gt; 10 2 km for the bound model. If no candidate is found, we can set upper limits of Γ and/or τ as functions of t E . To convert these values to physical parameters (n and a) requires the distribution of v T . Right now, there is no reliable model of the distribution except for using the bound or unbound hypothesis. On the other hand, the event rates for the unbound model are too small for the events to be detected.</p><p>In past microlensing surveys <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">36]</ref>, large amounts of data have already been collected for both the bulge and LMC fields. Monitoring more than 10 6 stars for about 10 years can be achieved by simply reanalyzing the past data. Thus, discovery of wormholes can be expected if their population density is as high as the local stellar density and 10 2 ≤ a ≤ 10 7 km. Such wormholes of astronomical size are large enough for humans to pass through. Thus, they would be of interest to people discussing the possibility of space-time travel. If no candidate is found, the possibility of a rich population of large-throat wormholes bound to the Galaxy can be ruled out. Such a limit, however, may not affect existing wormhole theories because there is no prediction of the abundance. However, theoretical studies on wormholes are still in progress. The limit imposed by observation is expected to affect future wormhole theories. On the other hand, the discovery of unbound wormholes is very difficult even if their population density is comparable to that of ordinary stars. To discover such wormholes, the monitoring of a much larger number of stars in distant galaxies would be necessary. For example, Γ = 1.7 × 10 −6 and t E ≈ 380 days for the M101 microlensing survey (D S = 7.4 Mpc) if the throat radius is 10 7 km. To carry out such a microlensing survey, observation from space is necessary because the resolving of a large number of stars in a distant galaxy is impossible through ground observations.</p><p>Only the Ellis wormhole has been discussed in this paper. There are several other types of wormholes <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">30]</ref> for which deflection angles have been derived. These wormholes are expected to have different light curves. To detect those wormholes, calculations of their light curves are necessary. The method used in this paper can be employed only when we know the analytic solutions of the image positions. If no analytic solution is found, the calculation must be made numerically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Summary</head><p>The gravitational lensing of the Ellis wormhole is solved in the weak-field limit. The image positions are calculated as real solutions of simple cubic formulas. One image appears on the source star side and outside the Einstein ring. The other image appears on the other side and inside the Einstein ring. A simple estimation shows that the weak-field hypothesis is a good approximation for Galactic microlensing if the throat radius is less than 10 11 km. The light curve derived has characteristic gutters immediately outside the Einstein ring crossing times. Optical depths and event rates for bulge and LMC lensings are calculated for simple bound and unbound hypotheses. The results show that the bound wormholes can be detected by reanalyzing past data if the throat radius is between 10 2 and 10 7 km and the number density is approximately equal to the local stellar density. If the wormholes are unbound and approximately uniformly distributed in the universe with average stellar density, detection of the wormholes is impossible using past microlensing data. To detect unbound wormholes, a microlensing survey of distant galaxies from space is necessary.         </p></div>

The arguments p,q 2 ,-q,p,q 2 are expressed by the following mathematical relations: Most binary lenses detected in microlensing events complete only a small fraction of their orbits during the event, as binaries with shorter period orbits tend not to show detectable binary signatures. However, we show that there exist some lenses (rapidly rotating lenses or RRLs) with detectable binary signatures that can complete several orbits while their binary lens features are detectable, and hence the same features can be seen to repeat in a lightcurve. Using simple analytical constraints we show there exist regions of the total lens mass-semimajor axis plane where repeating features are detectable, and confirm this with numerical calculations and example lightcurves. With a photometric precision of 1 percent, the region of detectability covers total masses ∼ 0.1M ⊙ and above, and semimajor axes ∼ 0.2-2 AU for typical stellar binary lenses. The detectability increases with decreasing lens-source velocities and increasing lens distances. We also present a method of modelling microlensing events with repeating features, by timing the occurrence of lightcurve features, which reduces the need for computationally expensive lightcurve fitting. If fitted successfully, the combination of finite source effects, and the orbital motion of the lens can lead to a mass measurement <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, and possibly a determination of orbital parameters such as inclination and eccentricity.

The prototype of the telescope is under installation at Teide observatory and will have first light mid-2011. Two more nodes are under construction in China and Argentina, and several national applications are in the process for further nodes around the globe. The telescope design has been described in detail recently by <ref type="bibr">Grundahl et al. 2009 [1]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The microlensing observations</head><p>Follow-up microlensing exoplanet observations have until today been performed by networks of existing all-purpose and amateur telescopes. This situation will change in the near future with 3 modern network coming on-line, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, LCOGT (http://lcogt.net/), the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network, KMT-Net, and SONG (http://song.phys.au.dk/). While LCOGT has a broad scientific and educational goal, KMT-Net is focused on microlensing, and has with its 20Kx20K 0.36 ′′ pixel size a large survey capacity together with a high cadence. SONG differs from the two other networks by being designed for highspatial-resolution dedicated high-cadence follow-up microlensing observations. For this purpose, each of the SONG telescopes have two lucky imaging cameras at the Nasmyth focus, with a pixel size of only 0.09 ′′ in order to sample diffraction limited images with two pixels. Experiments with high frame rate techniques (also called frame selection, and including the lucky imaging technique) have demonstrated the ability to obtain near-diffraction limited images from the ground (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Baldwin et al. 2001 [2]</ref> 2008 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> Smith et al. 2009 <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Tokovinin et al. 2010 <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The advantage of the obtainable high spatial resolution is in being able to resolve dimmer source stars in crowded fields. This is the same advantage which has been pointed out in connection with possible space born microlensing missions, but here at a few per cent of the cost of a space mission.</p><p>Our present network, MiNDSTEp (http://www.mindstep-science.org/), was during 2008-2010 operated from the Danish 1.54m telescope (build in 1975) at ESO's La Sila Observatory, and will from 2011 include also the MONET 1.2m telescope in South Africa (http://monet.uni-goettingen.de/foswiki) with further support from the MONET McDonald telescope, the SONG prototype at Tenerife, a Chinese 1.5m telescope and two survey telescopes (VYSOS, http://vysos.ifa.hawaii.edu/) in Chile and at Hawaii. The 1.54m telescope CCD has a pixel size of 0.4 ′′ , and experience with microlensing research near the Galactic centre has shown us that the corresponding resolution of 0.8 ′′ determines a de facto limiting source star magnitude of I∼18. This corresponds to a limiting stellar radius of a typical K-giant source star of 10 R ⊙ at the distance of the Galactic centre. Experiments with a lucky imaging camera mounted at the 1.54m telescope has resulted in 0.35 ′′ resolution. This limit is set by the optics of the telescope, and we expect to routinely reach 0.25 ′′ with the SONG telescopes, which are designed for the higher spatial resolution. This corresponds to collecting 10 times more photons per area of sky per time unit with SONG than with the 1.54m telescope with a conventional CCD, since the higher throughput will compensate for the smaller mirror size. On top of this, the 4 times broader filters, the faster slew time, and the more efficient robotic observing schedule are expected to give us a gain of additional a factor 10 in number of collected photons per time unit, so efficiently 100 times more photons per sky area per time unit. This gain will be divided into observing more targets at lower exposure times. Allowing to go 2.5 magnitudes deeper in the field (a factor 10 in number of collected photons) corresponds to a factor 10 smaller (Θ s ) 2 (with Θ s the angular source radius), and hence a factor 10 smaller reachable (Θ E ) 2 (with Θ E the exoplanetary Einstein radius) from identical photometric accuracy, corresponding to a factor 10 smaller reachable exoplanetary mass. Present surveys with conventional CCDs, like the one at the Danish 1.54m telescope, have allowed detections of exoplanets typically in the mass range 100 to 5 Earth masses, which makes us expect a similar detection efficiency with SONG for 10 Earth masses to planets smaller than Earth. Theoretical models predict 50 times higher abundance for planets in this latter mass range (in the terrestrial zone) than in the mass range which has been accessible with the present microlensing surveys, making the coming years a very promising time for microlensing exoplanetary research.</p><p>The present microlensing campaigns have high sensitivity to Jupiter-Saturn like exoplanets in Jupiter-Saturn like orbits. With the high sensitivity to low-mass exoplanets in terrestrial like orbits expected from coming surveys, and an increasing sensitivity to giant planets in larger orbits, microlensing campaigns in the coming decade will be able to answer the question of how abundant solar system analogues are among the planetary systems in our galaxy. Also the question about the abundance of exoplanets in orbits where life as we know it could exist at the planetary surface is expected to be answered by microlensing in the coming decade(s), and here we expect SONG to play a central role, due to its high sensitivity to low-mass planets in the terrestrial zone (see also <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen 2008 [6]</ref>. In this connection it is important to stress that the habitable zone most often is described as the orbital distances where liquid water can exist at the planetary surface, even when people actually think of the distances where liquid water could exist at the surface if the planet was the size of the Earth, had an Earth-like atmosphere, and rotated as the Earth. In particular the latter point is important, because it implies that a truly habitable zone might only exist around solar type stars. Planets orbiting stars with less than half a solar mass will be tidally locked if they are in the habitable zone distance, and stars above 2 solar masses have a main sequence lifetime short compared to biological timescales. Radial velocity and transit studies are, for technical reasons, biased toward finding smallmass planets around M-dwarfs. Microlensing, on the other hand is not biased toward any particular stellar lens-mass range, and statistically one fourth of the lensing stars will be solar like (i.e. between half and two solar masses). SONG will therefore be highly sensitive toward detecting Earth-mass exoplanets in the (truly) habitable zone</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Current microlensing planet surveys have been based on wide-field, low-cadence, searches for microlensing events toward the bulge of the Galaxy by two main surveys: OGLE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Udalski et al. 2008</ref>) and MOA ( ). These surveys send out public "alerts" when they detect lensing events in which fits to the initial light curve suggest high peak magnifications, of order 100 or more. The high-magnification events constitute about 1 per cent of all lensing events. Events that appear promising to be of high magnification trigger intensive photometric followup efforts by networks of small telescopes (including dedicated amateurs) to obtain coverage, over the peak of the event, that is as continuous as possible. The motivation for this observing strategy has been that, near the peak of a high magnification event, the source star is distorted into a nearly complete Einstein ring that covers a large area in the lens plane. The snow lines of typical lens stars happen to roughly coincide with their Einstein radii. Thus, planets, if they exist around a lens, and if projected in the vicinity of the snow line, will always produce significant perturbations to the light curves of high-magnification lensing events. There are about 700 lensing events per yearly bulge season, and of order 10 are of high magnification. Fair coverage of these events over their peaks by the current generation of followup observations has yielded 2-3 planets per year, suggesting that a fraction of roughly 1/10 to 1/3 of lens stars have planets near their snow lines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Gould et al. 2010;</ref>). But, this low detection rate also explains why the current strategy has, over the past 5 years, produced only about a dozen microlensing planet discoveries, a tiny fraction of the 500 known extrasolar planets.</p><p>As opposed to the current microlensing surveys, which have focused on the rare high-magnification lensing events that probe the "central" caustics of host+planet lenses, "Generation-2" surveys will go after the much more common, low-magnification, events and the perturbations caused by their "planetary" caustics. To harvest this potential new crop of microlensing-discovered planets requires the combination of a wide survey area with dense temporal sampling. This has now become possible with the availability of degree-scale CCD imaging mosaics on several 1m-to 2m-class telescopes. In Generation-2 microlensing, such telescope-camera combinations, situated around the globe, continuously monitor about 10 deg 2 of the Galactic bulge with cadences of less than one hour. A large fraction of the 700 or so lensing events that occur per bulge season are monitored. Among those lenses that host planets, a perturbation, which can last as little as several hours, is detected in the light curve in those events where a lensed image happens to pass close to the planet. Simulations by us (see below) and by others (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Penny et al. 2010)</ref> show that this observing approach should produce dozens of planet discoveries per year. Over several years, the sample of microlensing-discovered planets could then start to be comparable to those from other planet-detection methods, but would probe very different regions of planetary parameter space than those probed by the other methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A Generation-Pilot Survey</head><p>In the summer of 2010, we launched the pilot stage of a Generation-2 microlensing planet survey. During two 3-week periods, we observed the bulge fields having the highest past lensing event rates using a network of four telescopes Up to the unavoidable but moderate weather gaps, we obtained continuous coverage for 81 microlensing events, with full coverage of the event for about 15. We plan to continue and expand this survey in the coming years and to address the following questions: What is the frequency of occurrence of planets and planetary systems around disk and bulge stars in the Milky Way? Are most of the systems Solar analogs, or are they clearly distinct, and in what ways? What is the emerging picture regarding planetary formation and evolution, when combining these results with those from the complementary, ongoing, radial-velocity and transit surveys (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Howard et al. 2010)</ref>?</p><p>The pilot phase took place in June-July 2010 during two 3-week periods (separated by a one-week break around the full moon), when we monitored the 8 deg 2 of the Galactic bulge that have the highest microlensing event rates. We used the 1m-telescope at Wise Observatory in Israel with the LAIWO camera (1 deg 2 field of view). Our observations were coordinated with those of the 1.3m Warsaw University telescope in Chile with the OGLE-IV camera (1.4 deg 2 field of view); the 1.8m MOA-II telescope in New Zealand with the MOA-cam3 camera (2.2 deg 2 field of view); and the Palomar Observatory 1.2m Oschin telescope in California with the PTF camera (7.8 deg 2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Law et al. 2009</ref>; this telescope participated only in the second 3-week run). Observing cadence at each telescope was between 20 and 40 minutes. During each of the 3 weeks, coverage was about 90% of fully continuous. During our pilot, 81 lensing events (identified as such by MOA) were covered or partly covered by our observations. We are performing difference-image analysis (DIA) on the data for these events, to obtain the most accurate photometry for each event. We will show some of the emerging light curves, based on preliminary analysis of the data from Wise, MOA, and PTF (data obtained by OGLE are still being reduced).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Numerical Simulations and Future Prospects</head><p>In parallel, we have carried out numerical ray-tracing simulations, both for planning the experiment and with a view toward analysing the results, whether statistically or in terms of modeling individual events. We begin by producing large numbers of simulated light curves. The physical parameters -lens mass, distance, and the effective lens-source velocities -are drawn from the distributions of those parameters that, when combined with Galactic structure models, reproduce the lens-crossing timescale distributions observed in real lensing events of the past years <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Dominik 2006</ref>). Impact parameters and the magnitudes of the source stars (and hence the photometric errors, see below) are also chosen to reproduce the observed distributions. The interesting but unknown physical parameters -number, orbital separation, and masses of the planets, are input according to various possible prescriptions. For example, one possibility is that some fraction f of all stars hosts planetary systems that mimic the Solar System, but the planets are scaled in mass and orbital radius with the host mass M, according to the snow-line radius, with some power-law of index s, R snow ∝ M s . Thus, for a choice of s and f , we can produce many systems with random orbital phases of their planets and random line-of-sight inclinations of their orbital planes. We then ray trace through them to obtain simulated light curves. The light curves from a particular choice of model parameters are then "observed", in terms of including all the observational effects: we temporally sample the light curves with observing sequences drawn from the real existing observations, and scatter the photometry based on a realistic measurement error distribution, as observed in the real data (and thus including all error types -Poisson, backgrounds from bright stars, outliers due to improperly subtracted DIA residuals). We then search these simulated light curves for planetary deviations. For a given combination of physical parameters, the simulations can give us the probability of the observed lensing statistics, such as number and type of perturbations, and will thus permit to constrain the interesting physical parameter space.</p><p>We will show predictions from our Monte Carlo simulations, in which, for various combinations of planetary population parameters and experiment parameters, a Generation-2 survey is repeated many times. This gives the Monte-Carlo distribution of the number of detected planetary events per season, for a combination of seasonal experiment duration, observing cadence, fraction f of stars hosting Solar-like planetary systems, and power-law index s relating system size to host-star mass. The results of the real experiment, when compared with the distributions from such mock experiments, will permit constraining the physical parameter space. Our current calculations indicate that we can realistically expect to discover up to a few dozen planets per bulge season, and up to the order of 100 planets in the course of several years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>High framerate imaging of astronomical sources offers new possibilities for improved resolution and short timescale photometry. Image motion due to turbulence is the most important contribution to atmospheric seeing. By taking images at a framerate comparable to the dynamic timescale of the atmosphere (10-100Hz), it is possible to "freeze" the motion and correct for it, thereby improving the image quality significantly. One well known variations of this is the lucky imaging method, where only nearly diffraction limited frames are kept and co added. The main obstacle for pursuing this path in astronomy has been read out noise in CCD's. The large number of fames needed to collect appreciable amounts of photons from faint astronomical sources at the required framerates implies that the signal is completely overwhelmed by the read out noise typical of CCD's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The EMCCD</head><p>The invention of the EMCCD (Electron Multiplying CCD) has made read out noise on the sub electron level possible. The read out register of an EMCCD has been extended into a solid state version of a photomultiplier. This makes it possible to amplify a single photoelectron into hundreds of electrons, thereby overcoming the read out noise. But the electron cascades resulting from the amplification are stochastic, and new methods must be employed to reduce the images for extracting photometric information. It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of the final size of the cascades is exponential, with some decay constant called the EM gain. For instance, spurious charge is present but undetectable in all conventional CCDs. It is visible in an EMCCD, making it impossible to estimate the bias from a simple average of bias frames.</p><p>EMCCD's can be operated in two distinct ways: a photon counting mode with only shot noise, but with coincidence losses at high flux levels; or a linear mode with shot noise inflated by a factor of two. At present, we are employing the linear mode. But real photon counting optimal imaging is theoretically possible and a very interesting concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Optimal Imaging Methods</head><p>If a standard Kolmogorov model for atmospheric turbulence is assumed, the six most dominant Zernike terms aberrating an image will be piston, tip and tilt, focus and the two astigmatism terms, listed in descending order of power <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Piston is unimportant for imaging, and tip and tilt result in an overall solid-body translation of the image that can be corrected simply by shifting the images and co-add. This methods colloquially know as shift and add.</p><p>Focus, astigmatism, and higher order terms will blur the images. The amount of blurring in the individual frames will be random; sometimes one will be lucky and obtain an image near the diffraction limit. By collecting only these images, then shifting and co-adding them, nearly diffraction limited images with useful signal to noise ratios can be obtained, hence this method is known as lucky imaging <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>All of the images obtained in a high framerate sequence will contain information, though, and for every combination of target and desired measurement there must exist an optimal weighting scheme for combining the images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Optimal Imaging in Microlensing</head><p>The optimal imaging techniques are highly interesting for gravitational microlensing as it can resolve much of the flux blending in the dense fields where microlenses are most often observed. Furthermore the technique works best on the small size telescopes often used for microlensing followups, and it is relatively inexpensive and straightforward to implement on telescopes.</p><p>From experience we know that with the DFOSC conventional CCD camera, at the Danish 1.54m telescope at the ESO La Silla observatory, we can get useful photometry from stars down to I=18, but not fainter due to crowding. With the improved resolution from the Lucky Imaging we expect to be able to do photometry on stars down to about I=21 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Assuming a constant distance and surface temperature of the source stars, this allows us to track microlensing event in stars with ten times smaller Θ s 2 , where Θ s is the angular source size. Which means that planets with squared Einstein radii ten times smaller will be detectable without being washed out</p></div>

As the Science Center for WFIRST, IPAC will work with the project, the Science Definition Team, and scientific community to develop all three of WFIRST's scientific themes in preparation for a new star later in the decade: Dark Energy, a near-IR survey, and a microlensing survey to conduct a census of planets covering a wide range of masses and orbital periods. In the near-term, NExScI will continue to develop its archive of microlensing events and lightcurves analogous to its archives of transit datasets. In addition, the topic of NExScI's next Sagan Exoplanet Summer Workshop will be planet searches using microlensing (http://nexsci.caltech.edu/workshop/2011/). IPAC will be working with the microlensing community as their science advocate within the WFIRST project, developing relevant archives and tools in the decade leading up to the launch of WFIRST, and ultimately in developing mission products that will take full advantage of WFIRT's remarkable capabilities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Matthew Penny Manchester University UK</head><p>In the last fifteen years, astronomers have found over 500 exoplanets including some in systems that resemble our very own solar system. These discoveries have already challenged and revolutionized our theories of planet formation and dynamical evolution. Several different methods have been used to discover exoplanets, including radial velocity, stellar transits, direct imaging, pulsar timing, astrometry, and gravitational microlensing which is based on Einstein's theory of general relativity. So far 10 exoplanets have been published with this method. While this number is relatively modest compared with that discovered by the radial velocity method, microlensing probes a part of the parameter space (host separation vs. planet mass) not accessible in the medium term to other methods. The mass distribution of microlensing exoplanets has already revealed that cold super-Earths (at or beyond the "snow line" and with a mass of around 5 to 15 Earth mass appear to be common ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Beaulieu et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Gould et al., 2006</ref>) . We detected a scale 1/2 model of our solar system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Gaudi et al., 2008)</ref>, several hot Neptunes/Super Earth, shown that our detection efficiencies extends to 1 Earth mass planets ( <ref type="bibr">Batista et al., 2009)</ref>. We have made the first measurement of the frequency of ice and gas giants beyond the snow line, and have shown that this is about 7 times higher than closer-in systems probed by the Doppler method. This comparison provides strong evidence that most giant planets do not migrate very far ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Gould et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Microlensing is currently capable of detecting cool planets of super-Earth mass from the ground (and on favourable circumstances down to 1 Earth), with a network of wide-field telescopes strategically located around the world, could routinely detect planets with mass as low as the Earth. Old, free-floating planets can also be detected; a significant population of such planets are expected to be ejected during the formation of planetary systems. Microlensing is roughly uniformly sensitive to planets orbiting all types of stars, as well as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, while other method are most sensitive to FGK dwarfs and are now extending</p><p>Beaulieu &amp; Penny EUCLID: From frozen Mars to habitable Earth via microlensing to M dwarfs. It is therefore an independent and complementary detection method for aiding a comprehensive understanding of the planet formation process. Ground-based microlensing mostly probes exoplanets outside the snow line, where the favoured coreaccretion theory of planet formation predicts a larger number of low-mass exoplanets <ref type="bibr">(Ida &amp; Lin 2005</ref>). The statistics provided by microlensing will enable a critical test of the core accretion model. Exoplanets probed by microlensing are much further away than those probed with other methods. They provide an interesting comparison sample with nearby exoplanets, and allow us to study the extrasolar population throughout the Galaxy.</p><p>Ultimately, a comprehensive census of cold planets below Earth masses, and habitable Earth mass planets requires a space-based microlensing survey. The remarkable synergy between Dark Energy probes by Cosmic shear has been realized and implemented in Europe since 2006 with the DUNE proposal, and has been developed in EUCLID. A 3 month microlensing program is part of the additional science of EU-CLID aiming at low mass telluric planets down to the mass of Mars at the snow line and first hint on habitable super Earth (described in the yellow book and in <ref type="bibr">Beaulieu et al. 2010</ref>). There is a proposition for an extension of the initial 3 month "additional science" program by a 9 months "legacy program" with the objective of measuring the abundance of habitable Earth around solar like stars. This legacy program could take place once the Dark Energy objective will have been reached, at the end of the mission. We suggest to have a first survey of 2 months shortly after the launch to guaranty high profiles results (detection of planets down to the mass of Mars) early in the mission. Results with high visibility would be valuable for EUCLID within the first year of operation. It is important to have observations early in the mission life time and after few years to maximize the baseline in order to be able to have better constraints on host masses.</p><p>With the 9 month legacy program in addition to the 3 month that are currently in the additional science of EUCLID we will provide: a) a complete census of planets down to Earth mass with separations exceeding 1 AU b) complementary coverage to Kepler of the planet discovery space c) sensitivity to planets down to 0.1 M ⊙ , including all Solar System analogues except for Mercury d) complete lens solutions for most planet events, allowing direct measurements of the planet and host masses, and distance from the observer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>David P. Bennett University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN USA</head><p>The US Astro2010 Decadal Survey report, "New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics" recommended a new mission called WFIRST as its top ranked large space mission for the next decade. The WFIRST mission is to have two major science programs that will drive the design requirements: a dark energy program and a microlensing planet search program, based on the Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) concept. ESA is considering a similar mission, known as Euclid, which addresses dark energy, but also has a modest microlensing program that could be expanded. Both NASA and ESA have expressed interest in a possible joint program to address both the WFIRST and Euclid science goals, assuming that Euclid is selected. However, there are a number of political and technical issues that would complicate such a joint program.</p><p>I discuss the science justification for the WFIRST microlensing program, and consider a variety of mission designs that might be considered by the WFIRST Science Definition Team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microlensing with Gaia satellite</head><p>Lukasz Wyrzykowski, Vasily Belokurov Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge UK Gaia is an ambitious astrometric survey satellite that will be launched by ESA in 2012/2013. Its unique combination of precise astrometry, photometry and spectroscopy will have a tremendous impact on many fields of astrophysics, from Galaxy structure, stellar models, variable stars to asteroids and extra-solar planets <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Gaia offers a unique contribution to the field of microlensing with its uniform continuous all-sky coverage over 5 years and a superb astrometry as its primary goal. When employed in the microlensing studies it would provide an one-off opportunity for studying microlensing events. Sole ground-based photometric observations only in very special cases allow for solving and working out the combination of parameters of the microlensing event participating objects.</p><p>The astrometric accuracy of a single 1 dimensional measurement in Gaia is about 50 µas at 14 mag and 400 µas at 18 mag. It is enough to detect typical displacement of the centroid of the images of 1 mas. About 15,000 astrometric events are expected to occur over the whole sky during the 5 year of the mission, however only in few percent of them the mass of the lens can be recovered with a reasonable accuracy <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Gaia sparse sampling prevents from obtaining detailed light curves of the events, see example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 1</ref>, hence the characterisation of the events is difficult. Photometric and astrometric microlensing deviations will be detected by the Gaia Science Alerts system, currently being developed and installed in Cambridge. The system will operate in near-real-time, analysing all data incoming from the satellite as soon as they are arrive and are preliminarily processed, usually between couple and 24 hours after observation. It will utilise all Gaia data available at these time-scales, including low-resolution spectroscopy. Thanks to that the classification of the observed deviations will be less affected by false-positives.</p><p>Gaia Science Alerts will therefore release alerts to the community about plausible microlensing photometric and astrometric deviations. However, without wellorganized ground-based all-sky follow-up of the events detected by Gaia it will not be possible to fully exploit the scientific potential of these microlensing events. When Gaia data are supplemented by ground-based observations the number of measured masses increases by several factors.</p><p>Due to characteristic sampling of Gaia vast majority of alerted events will usually have long time-scales. The detection efficiency reaches 100% for events with timescales of around 100 days. These will be mainly caused by relatively nearby disk lenses, exhibiting a parallax effect and allowing for probing the local mass function. Moreover, Gaia will create an opportunity to detect massive stellar remnants, like neutron stars or black-holes, acting as lenses in the detected events.</p><p>Gaia Science Alerts Working Group wiki is available at this address: http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/research/gsawg. This is a platform containing important information about the design and operation of the alerting system. It is also a site where we gather all relevant information about possible triggers of alerts. One can also find there archived talks and presentation from the first Science Alerts workshop held in June 2010 in Cambridge.</p><p>The website also provides information about the forthcoming workshop in June 2011, dedicated to the follow-up and verification of the Gaia Science Alerts. Inspired by the <ref type="bibr">Erdl &amp; Schneider [1]</ref> analysis of the parameter dependence of binary lensing topologies, we extend their approach to special cases of the triple lens. While the binary lens is characterised by two parameters, three more parameters are needed to describe the triple lens. We analysed several two-dimensional cuts through the five-dimensional parameter space, identifying the boundaries of regions with different critical curve topology. For each region we present corresponding critical curves and caustics.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Conclusions and Future Prospects Cosidering the large number of microlensing events observed by several microlensing surveys, our results suggest that a non-negligible fraction of these events is likely related to NSs and BHs, in particular among long duration events. Indeed, an excess of long duration events has been reported in the literature. Thus, microlensing surveys are a suitable tool to probe the statistical properties of old isolated compact remnants. However, the nature of single lenses has to be assessed as further confirmation. We are performing a cross-check of archival X-ray data to find counterparts of long duration events. The detection of X-ray emission would be a strong indication that the lens is a compact object.</note>
