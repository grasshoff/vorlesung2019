			<abstract>
				<p>The interaction of a satellite with a gaseous disk results in the excitation of spiral density waves which remove angular momentum from the orbit. In addition, if the orbit is not copla-nar with the disk, three-dimensional effects will excite bending and eccentricity waves. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to study nonlinear disk-satellite interaction in inviscid protoplanetary disks for a variety of orbital inclinations from 0 • to 180 •. It is well known that three-dimensional effects are important even for zero inclination. In this work we (1) show that for planets with small inclinations (as in the Solar system), effects such as the total torque and migration rate strongly depend on the inclination and are significantly different (about 2.5 times smaller) from the two-dimensional case, (2) give formulae for the migration rate, inclination damping, and precession rate of planets with different inclination angles in disk with different scale heights, and (3) present the observational signatures of a planet on an inclined orbit with respect to the protoplanetary disk. For misaligned planets we find good agreement with linear theory in the limit of small inclinations, and with dynamical friction estimates for intermediate inclinations. We find that in the latter case, the dynamical friction force is not parallel to the relative planetary velocity. Overall, the derived formulae will be important for studying exoplanets with obliquity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The interaction between a gaseous disk and an embedded satellite can have a major effect on the dynamics and structure of the disk. The study of such interaction was pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, 1980</ref>, who found that density waves are excited due to the gravitational forces between the secondary component and the disk. These forces lead to the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the disk and perturber, and thus to the change of the orbital elements of the latter. The linear, twodimensional calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1980)</ref> have been extended in a number of ways, e.g. by considering the asymmetry between inner and outer disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ward 1986)</ref>, and to the case of fully three-dimensional (3D) modes in disks with vertical structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tanaka et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artymowicz 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The non-zero inclinations of planets in the Solar system as well as a growing number of observations of misaligned extrasolar planets motivates further extensions to the theory to take into account a non-zero inclination of the secondary component. It was found that misaligned planets warp the disk and excite bending waves <ref type="bibr">(Papaloizou &amp; Lin 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Masset &amp; Tagger 1996</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">&amp; Ivanov 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lubow &amp; Ogilvie 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fragner &amp; Nelson 2010</ref>). Bending waves also participate in the exchange of angular momentum between the disk and perturber, and make the evolution of the satellite's orbital elements more complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tanaka &amp; Ward (2004)</ref> described the interaction between a disk and an inclined planet in the linear regime and found an exponential damping of inclination on a timescale of ∼ 10 3 years for an Earth-sized planet at 1 AU in the minimum mass solar nebula. However, to be valid the theory formally requires the inclination of the planet ip to be much smaller than the aspect ratio of the disk, that is ip H/r, where H is the thermal scale height in the disk. Numerical studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cresswell et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bitsch &amp; Kley 2011</ref>) have confirmed the exponential damping and extended the applicability range to ip 2H/r. For even larger inclinations, these studies find the damping rate dip/dt ∝ i −2 p . However, the analytic calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rein (2012)</ref>, which include dynamical friction as the dominant mechanism of angular momentum transport, predict a different scaling dip/dt ∝ ∼ i −3 p . The goals of this paper are (1) to verify the results of linear theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tanaka &amp; Ward (2004)</ref> for the case of planets with small inclinations, (2) to investigate the evolution of planets with very large inclinations and to resolve the discrepancy between current numerical and analytic models, and (3) to predict the observational signatures of misaligned planets in gaseous protoplanetary disks.</p><p>Our study uses high resolution 3D numerical simulations of planet-disk interaction for perturbers with small masses Mp/M = 10 −4 (where Mp and M are the masses of the planet and central star respectively). Thus, the amplitude of the perturbations are well within the linear regime. The disk is assumed to be globally isothermal (consistent with the assumptions used in linear theory), while the inclination of the perturber is varied over a wide range 0.25H/r ip π, that is we study the case of satellites on both perpendicular as well as retrograde orbits. To predict the observational signatures, we carry out simulations with a locally isothermal disk and Jupiter-mass planets, and compare the near-IR scattered light images for both coplanar and misaligned planets.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. We start by discussing the setup of our numerical calculations in Section 2. Section 3 reports the result from a sensitive test of the hydrodynamics code used for this study; the propagation of bending waves in the linear regime. We then present results from fully 3D calculations of planets on coplanar orbits in Section 4, including analysis of the torque density compared to previous analytical results. Section 5 describes the evolution of the orbital elements for inclined planets, the main result of this paper. The response of the disk to the planetary potential as well as the observational signatures of inclined planets in scattered light images are discussed in Section 6. Finally, we summarize our results and conclude in Section 7.</p></div>

To test our code, we study the propagation of a linear bending wave with H0/r0 = 0.035 (corresponding to 2 • ), δmax = 0.5H0/r0, and r mid = 5r0 (note that at the location of the center of the warp, H/r = √ 5H0/r0, so the warp amplitude is approximately 1/4 of the disk aspect ratio). The simulation setup used for this test is similar to Section 2, but without planetary potential, and with warped disk midplane. We use an isothermal equation of state (q = 0) so that it is barotropic to enable comparison with the solution of equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> - <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Following Fragner &amp; Nelson (2010)</ref>, we set p = −1.5 (even though their disk was locally isothermal, and the equilibrium solution was different). Our θ-domain spans 10 aspect ratios at the inner boundary in each direction (note, that it corresponds to 10/3 aspect ratios at the outer boundary). We implement outflow boundary condition in θ-direction. We set the warp midpoint to be r mid = 5r0, so the propagation time for bending waves is approximately the same in both directions (linear theory predicts the speed of bending waves to be v bend = cs/2 = const for isothermal disks). Please see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for more details of this simulation.</p><p>When studying the properties of the disk, it is useful to define the inclination and precession angles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Deviations from linear theory</head><p>The test described in the previous section also allows one to investigate the limits in which linear theory is applicable. To study the deviations from linear theory we consider an initially more nonlinear bending wave with initial warp amplitude equal to the aspect ratio of the disk at the inner boundary (and approximately 1/2 of the aspect ratio at warp center), and a thicker disk, for which aspect ratio at the center of the warp approximately equals 0.16. The details for these runs can be found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the inclination angle in one snapshot at t = 0.3t bend for both of these runs. It is clear from the left panel that the increase in wave amplitude does not show much effect on the shape of the curve. The agreement between the numerical results and the analytic estimates still very good. On the other hand, increasing the thickness of the disk (as in the right panel) leads to drastic change in shape of the curve, and to much worse agreement between the numerical and analytic solutions. In this case, the aspect ratio of the disk at the inner boundary is approximately 0.07, while the aspect ratio at the outer boundary is 0.21. The most probable cause of the difference between the numerical solution and analytic estimates are 3D effects due to the vertical structure of the disk.

This case is widely studied in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1980)</ref> decomposed the potential of the planet into Fourier harmonics and obtained rather simple expression for the excitation torque density far from the planet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">∂Tex ∂r = sign(r − rp)Σ G 2 M 2 p (r − rp) 4 κ 2 r 8A 4 CGT80,<label>(42)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">CGT80 = 2Ω κ K0 κ 2|A| + K1 κ 2|A| 2 .</formula><p>Here G is the gravitational constant, Σ is the surface density of the disk, and Ω(r), κ(r) and A(r) = 1 2 r dΩ dr are the angular velocity, epicyclic frequency and Toomre A parameter of the disk at distance r from the primary star respectively. Note that the we define the torque density as an amount of angular momentum excited in form of density waves, which implies that the total torque in the outer disk r &gt; rp is positive, while the total torque in the inner disk r &lt; rp is negative.</p><p>For a Keplerian disk, the expression (42) takes an even simpler</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">form ∂T GT80 ex ∂r = ΣG 2 M 2 p r Ω 2 H 4 p ψGT80 r − rp Hp ,<label>(43)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_45">ψGT80(x) ≡ 32 81 sign(x) x 4 {2K0(2/3) + K1(2/3)} 2 ≈ ≈ 2.5 sign(x) x 4 ,<label>(44)</label></formula><p>with Hp equal to the unperturbed disk thickness near the perturber's orbit. This expression is valid at large separations from the planet |r − rp|/Hp 1. Near the planet the torque cuts off and approaches 0 at r = rp. The excitation of density waves near the planet was studied in detail by  and  who noted the importance of overlapping Linblad resonances near the perturber. Most notably, the solution in the 2D shearing sheet approximation has a negative torque at radial separation |r − rp| ∼ 3hp.</p><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the torque density obtained from 3D isothermal hydrodynamic simulation of planet-disk interactions with Mp = 10 −4 M, and hp = Hp/rp = 0.1. The overall shape of the torque density is in very good agreement with previous numerical calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(D'Angelo &amp; Lubow 2008</ref>). On the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> we compare the torque density with the results of numerical shearing sheet calculations in 2D ) as well as linear 2D predictions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1980)</ref>. One can see that the form of the torque is in good agreement with shearing sheet estimates. The amplitude of the torque is ∼ 2 − 3 times smaller in 3D reflecting the difference between density waves in 2D and 3D (for more details, see Artymowicz 1993).</p><p>At a radial distance of several pressure scale heights from the planet the torque changes sign.  found analytically that the sign alternation occurs at r − rp ∼ 3.2Hp in agreement with a number of numerical studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bate et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">D'Angelo &amp; Lubow 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dong et al. 2011</ref>). The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 3</ref> confirms the negative torque phenomenon. For the inner disk, r &lt; rp, the torque changes sign at |r − rp| ≈ 3.13Hp. On the other hand, in the outer disk r &gt; rp, the sign alternation occurs at |r − rp| ≈ 3.76Hp. Similar differences in the location of the change in sign between the inner and outer disk was also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Duffell &amp; MacFadyen (2012)</ref> in 2D. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> confirms the presence of the negative torque component for the first time in 3D. Note that in 2D torque changes sign only once. Our simulation domain allow us to see four different locations of sign change in the inner disk, and two such locations in the outer disk. This suggests that in a larger disk, there will be many sign changes of the torque. Although this phenomenon is interesting from the theoretical point of view, its contribution to the total torque is small and is unlikely to change the behavior of the disk significantly.</p></div>

Previous studies used a rather small range in values for the inclination, with the largest values used being in the transition region between linear and high-inclinations limits.

However, the results of Rein (2012) are based on the approximations made in Ostriker (1999) where it is assumed that waves propagate through a uniform medium. It is rather surprising that protoplanetary disks can be approximated as uniform medium to such a good accuracy. It is likely that the disagreement between the analytic and numerical estimates at intermediate inclinations ip ∼ π/2 results from the same reason why the best-fit Coulomb logarithm is different for different components of the torque: the protoplanetary disk is anisotropic, and this should be taken into account in dynamical friction calculations. One of the consequences of anisotropy might be the misalignment between the dynamical friction force and relative velocity between the planet and the disk fluid -the assumption usually used in analytical calculations of dynamical friction.</p><p>Perfectly retrograde orbit with ip = π is an unstable equilibrium: the inclination damping rate is exactly zero at ip = π, but it has a finite limit as ip approaches π meaning that the orbit becomes more polar. This property of inclination damping rate is seen from analytical prediction (55) as well as in numerical simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Xiang-Gruess &amp; Papaloizou 2013</ref>) in the context of massive planets. For such large inclination, the dominant force comes from dynamical friction which acts to reduce the misalignment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESPONSE OF THE DISK AND OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES</head><p>The interaction between a disk and an inclined planet induces spiral structure in the disk. In addition, the disk may become warped and develop non-zero inclination. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref> shows the inclination angle of the disk as a function of the inclination of the planet. To compute the former, we first compute the inclination of individual "rings" in the disk (using equation 39), and then average over the disk using the value of the angular momentum in each rings as a weight. It is easy to see that the response of the disk peaks at ip ∼ 3hp.</p><p>To understand the observed spiral pattern and to investigate whether it can be used to constrain the inclination of the planet with respect to the disk, we have carried out two additional simulations: one with a coplanar and one with an inclined planet. From both simulations we have generated near-IR scattered light images, as described below. These two simulations have Hp/rp = 0.1 and T (r) ∝ r −1/2 , values which differ from those used for the global isothermal simulations described above. To mimic radiative cooling processes in the disk we implement simple cooling prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhu et al. (2015)</ref>. As stated in Equation 9 of that paper, the cooling timescale is 10 5 orbital periods at 1 AU and 10 −2 orbital periods at 100 AU. So we choose an intermediate cooling timescale value T cool = 1/Ωp, which is also the value adopted in that paper. The simulation domain is from 0.3rp to 3rp in the r-direction, [0.97,2.17] in the θ-direction, and 2π in the φ-direction with the resolution of 256×125×686. The planet has mass Mp = 10 −3 M and a semi-major axis of rp in both simulations. In the inclined planet case, the planetary orbital plane is inclined at 17 degrees (≈ 3Hp/rp). As shown above, this value is most effective at bending the disk. Note that the mass of the planet used in this section is significantly larger than in previous sections. We use such a heavy planet to enhance the appearance of the spiral arms. However, Mp = 10 −3 M is equal to the thermal mass M th ≡ c 3 s /GΩp = (Hp/rp) 3 M. This make the planet-disk interaction nonlinear, thus strictly speaking the analyses of previous sections does not apply. Such massive planet also starts opening the gap. As we do not have any explicit viscosity, the gap continues to get deeper with time, and it is not fully formed during the time of our simulation. The spiral arms, however, are formed on the sound crossing time, which is much shorter than our simulation time.</p><p>We use RADMC-3D 1 for the 3D radiation transfer calculation. We use a spherical mesh that is the same as in our hydrodynamical simulations. To scale the quantities in our simulations, we assume the length unit is rp = 100 AU, and the disk gas surface density at 100 AU is 1 g cm −2 in the initial condition. The central star is a Herbig Ae star with T eff = 6810 K, R = 1.4R, and <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Polarized intensity images of disk with a coplanar (upper panels) and an inclined planet (lower panels). The images to the left show the inner parts of the disk, while images to the right show the full disk. Note that intensities on the images to the right are scaled to 1/10 of the maximum value to emphasize the outer parts of the disk. The inner disk of the inclined planet shows clear asymmetries caused by the disk warp (indicated by dashed line). The inner disk for coplanar case does not have such asymmetry. The outer disk features asymmetries in both cases due to gap edge vortex. There are also additional spiral arms caused by the vortex. M = 1.7M. We also assume a dust to gas mass ratio of 1/100 with 10% of the dust mass in small grains which scatters the near-IR light (the same procedure as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dong et al. 2015</ref>). The dust opacity is calculated using Mie theory for Magnesium-iron silicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dorschner et al. 1995)</ref>. The size of the small grains is 0.1 micron (the same as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Juhász et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The radiation transfer calculation has two steps. First, the temperature of the dust is determined. Then scattered light images are calculated including the full treatment of polarization. Full Stokes vectors (I, Q, U, V ) have been computed and the polarized intensity ( Q 2 + U 2 ) images are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Images to the left show the intensity maps of the inner disk for coplanar (upper image) and inclined (lower image) planets. Polarized intensity is scaled to its maximum value. The bright region at the inner edge of the simulation domain on both images is due to the spiral arms. The intensity map of very inner disk in inclined case features some asymmetry (which we indicate by dashed line). Such asymmetry is not seen in coplanar case, and it is due to the slight warp of the disk. Images to the right show the full disk. To emphasize the outer parts of the disk, the intensity is scaled to 1/10 of its maximum value. One can see clear asymmetries in the outer disk for both coplanar and inclined cases cause by the gap edge vortex. Although the gap edge vortex has been seen in many previous simulations with a coplanar planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">de Val-Borro et al. 2007</ref>), we have shown that the gap edge vortex also exists even if the planet is on an inclined orbit. Furthermore, outer disk also has other spiral features which are excited by vortex and are connected to it. We suggested that these spiral arms excited by the vortex can also be seen in the near-IR scattered light images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have conducted a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations of disk-satellite interaction. Our standard setup cconsists of a low-mass perturber with Mp/M = 10 −4 and threedimensional isothermal disk with hp = 0.1. Perturbers have inclinations spanning from ip = 0.25hp to very large inclinations and retrograde orbits.</p><p>The study of coplanar planets allowed us to obtain the excitation torque density of the density waves (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). The migration rate from this torque is consistent with the analytic estimate of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref>. We confirm the interesting phenomenon of a negative torque density far from a planet  for the first time in 3D. For the inner disk, the first change in torque sign occurs at |r − rp| ≈ 3.13Hp, while for the outer disk the change in sign happens at |r−rp| ≈ 3.76Hp. Notably, even farther from the perturber, the torque changes sign again. Our simulation domain allows us to see 4 sign alternations suggesting that in a larger disk there will be many sign changes of the torque. These changes, however, do not contribute much to the total torque, and thus do not influence migration rates. Overall, the torque density remains close to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1980)</ref> prediction, although the actual functional form is different at |r − rp| | Hp (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>Simulations of inclined planets revealed the evolution of planetary orbital elements, namely semimajor axis, inclination angle, precession angle, and eccentricity (we consider initially circular orbits, and <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> confirms that significant eccentricity excitation does not occur in the system).</p><p>The evolution of the semimajor axis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>) leads to migration of planets with small inclination, and follows the results of linear calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref> in the limit of small inclinations. For larger inclinations, the migration rate increases significantly, and peaks at inclination of ip ∼ 2hp. The maximum migration rate is roughly 2 times larger that the value at zero inclination. For even larger inclinations, the migration rate drops and approximately follows the expression from Rein (2012) for dynamical friction driven migration. There is a deviation from this expression occurring at inclinations close to π/2, as well as for retrograde orbits, but it holds for all intermediate inclinations ip 1.</p><p>In the limit of small inclinations, the inclination damping rate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>) approximately follows the linear predictions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tanaka &amp; Ward (2004)</ref>. The inclination decays exponentially on a short timescale. For inclinations up to ip ∼ 2hp the damping rate increases, although faster than predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tanaka &amp; Ward (2004)</ref>. The maximum damping rate is roughly 2 times larger than predicted by linear theory. For larger inclinations, the damping rate drops. Again, it approximately follows predictions based on dynamical friction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rein (2012)</ref>, and deviates from these predictions only for very large inclinations and retrograde orbits. Our findings are in contradictions with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cresswell et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Bitsch &amp; Kley (2011)</ref> who predicted ∂tip ∝ i −2 p . For the intermediate inclinations, we found ∂tip ∝ ∼ i −3 p . In our simulations we used a much larger range of initial inclinations than in these previous works. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cresswell et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Bitsch &amp; Kley (2011)</ref> only consider ip &lt; 15 • , and have very few points in the limit ip &gt; 2hp. We note that the numerical setup of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cresswell et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Bitsch &amp; Kley (2011)</ref> is different from the one we use in this paper. They use different disk scale height as well as finite viscosity. These differences may be the reason for contradiction between our studies, and future work with larger parameter study is needed to resolve this disagreement.</p><p>The study of the precession rate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>) confirms the linear theory calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tanaka &amp; Ward 2004</ref>) in the limit of small inclinations, and dynamical friction predictions for intermediate inclinations. However, this statement only applies to the contribution from waves to the precession rate. In fact, there is another much larger contributor, namely the unperturbed disk which is more important than waves on the precession rate for all inclinations except π/2 where the secular effects goes to zero.</p><p>As a result, Figures 4, 5, and 6 provide the evolution of the full set orbital elements as a function of inclination. For small inclinations, the linear theory holds. The torques peak at ip ∼ 2hp with values roughly 2 times larger than linear predictions. For intermediate inclinations, dynamical friction calculations are approximately valid. Notably, the value of the best-fit Coulomb logarithm is different for different components of the torque, as one would expect due to the lack of isotropy in the system. This indicates that in such inhomogeneous systems the dynamical friction is not parallel to the perturber's velocity.</p><p>The interaction between an inclined planet and the disk causes the disk to warp and develop inclination (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8)</ref>. Because of that the scattered light images <ref type="figure">(Figure 9)</ref> show asymmetries in polarized intensity caused by disk warp. The time-dependent planetary potential produces this time-dependent spiral pattern. The period of variations of the pattern is equals to one half of the planetary orbit.</p><p>The inviscid hydrodynamical prescription adopted in this study may be oversimplified for the case of a more realistic protoplanetary disk. However, we do not expect a more realistic, e.g. non-ideal MHD, model of the gas dynamics of the disk to change our results dramatically, since if the planet only interacts with the disk through the gravitational torques the magnetic field will not change the excitation torque density. MHD effects might change the transfer of angular momentum from the waves to the disk, however this is not the focus of our paper.</p><p>Our work is limited only to planets with small masses embedded in a thin disk. We expect our results for Mp/M = 10 −4 to apply for lighter planets. Heavier planets, on the other hand, quickly open a gap, which modifies the excitation of waves significantly. The disk-planet interaction in such systems is different for the inner and outer regions of the disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Matsakos &amp; Königl 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Owen &amp; Lai 2017)</ref>. Although the presence of inclination damping has been found for massive planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bitsch et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sotiriadis et al. 2017</ref>), we do not expect our torque expressions to hold in this regime.</p><p>The full description of planet-disk interaction requires understanding not only the excitation of density and bending waves, but also the mechanism of wave dissipation, and the resulting transfer of angular momentum from the waves to the disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goodman &amp; Rafikov 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rafikov 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rafikov , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ju et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ju et al. , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Arza- masskiy &amp; Rafikov 2017)</ref>. This paper has studied only the excitation and propagation of such waves, not their damping.
