				<p>Thermal emission spectra of exoplanets provide constraints on the chemical compositions , pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles, and energy transport in exoplanetary atmospheres. Accurate inferences of these properties rely on the robustness of the atmospheric retrieval methods employed. While extant retrieval codes have provided significant constraints on molecular abundances and temperature profiles in several ex-oplanetary atmospheres, the constraints on their deviations from thermal and chemical equilibria have yet to be fully explored. Our present work is a step in this direction. We report HyDRA, a disequilibrium retrieval framework for thermal emission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres. The retrieval code uses the standard architecture of a parametric atmospheric model coupled with Bayesian statistical inference using the Nested Sampling algorithm. For a given dataset, the retrieved compositions and P-T profiles are used in tandem with the GENESIS self-consistent atmospheric model to constrain layer-by-layer deviations from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium in the observable atmosphere. We demonstrate HyDRA on the Hot Jupiter WASP-43b with a high-precision emission spectrum. We retrieve an H 2 O mixing ratio of log (H 2 O) = −3.54 +0.82 −0.52 , consistent with previous studies. We detect H 2 O and a combined CO/CO 2 at 8-σ significance. We find the dayside P-T profile to be consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium within the 1-σ limits and with low day-night redistribution, consistent with previous studies. The derived compositions are also consistent with thermochemical equilibrium for the corresponding distribution of P-T profiles. In the era of high precision and high resolution emission spectroscopy, HyDRA provides a path to retrieve disequilibrium phenomena in exoplanetary atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atmospheric studies are at the forefront of exoplanetary research. Recent observational efforts have led to significant advances in our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Madhusudhan et al. 2016</ref>). The transit method has been the most successful to date with spectra of numerous planets observed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deming et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>), but high quality spectra have also been observed using direct imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Konopacky et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Macintosh et al. 2015</ref>) and very high resolution spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Snellen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birkby et al. 2013</ref>). Hot Jupiter atmospheres in particular are prime candidates for atmospheric characterisation, thanks to their extended atmospheres and strong thermal emission, resulting in strong spectral signatures. Spectra of transiting hot giant planets have thus led to significant constraints on the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and E-mail: sng29@ast.cam.ac.uk † E-mail: nmadhu@ast.cam.ac.uk other properties of their atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stevenson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sing et al. 2016</ref>). The compositional estimates are in turn beginning to provide constraints not only on the atmospheric processes but also on their formation processes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Madhusudhan et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lavie et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The transit method, in particular, allows probing of the planetary atmosphere in multiple configurations. A transmission spectrum, obtained when the planet transits in front of the star, probes the atmosphere at the day-night terminator region of the planet. On the other hand, an emission spectrum obtained during secondary eclipse when the planet passes behind the star probes the dayside atmosphere of the planet. While constraints on various atmospheric properties have been placed using both configurations, emission spectra are particularly conducive to place detailed constraints on the composition as well as the temperature structure of the dayside atmosphere. High precision near-infrared emission spectra of transiting exoplanets observed with HST, Spitzer, and ground-based facilities have indeed provided new insights into their temperature structures. The imminent arrival of JWST is expected to further enhance our ability to constrain such physical and chemical properties.</p><p>Atmospheric retrieval involves deriving the atmospheric properties of an exoplanet given an observed spectrum. This involves parameter estimation of a model atmosphere from a spectral dataset using detailed statistical inference methods. Several studies have conducted atmospheric retrieval of thermal emission spectra of transiting exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lee et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Line et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Evans et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Oreshenko et al. 2017</ref>). The methods generally involve a parametric model, with the pressure-temperature (P -T ) profile and abundances of chemical species as free parameters, with no prior assumptions about chemical or radiative equilibrium. The model is coupled to a statistical inference algorithm to explore the model space and estimate the parameters. A variety of statistical methods have been used in the literature with varying levels of sophistication and have resulted in constraints on thermal inversions and chemical abundances in several exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Line et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Haynes et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Evans et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to distinguish the parametric models used in retrieval to self-consistent equilibrium models. The latter models compute the P -T profile, molecular composition, and the spectrum, of an atmosphere ab initio based on assumptions of thermochemical and radiative-convective equilibrium given the macroscopic system parameters (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Madhusudhan et al. 2014a</ref>, for a comparison between retrieval and equilibrium models). Such models are valuable to simulate and investigate physical processes in exoplanetary atmospheres, to predict observables and to define the limits of our theoretical understanding. The complexity of these models varies significantly, ranging from 1-D atmospheres (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Seager et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burrows et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mollì ere et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Malik et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref> to full 3-D general circulation models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kataria et al. 2015</ref>). While such forward models are highly beneficial they are limited in their capability to directly interpret observations. Therefore, both self-consistent models and retrieval methods are important for detailed characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres.</p><p>What is ultimately desirable is a self-consistent equilibrium model that can work in tandem with a retrieval. The primary advantage of retrieval methods is the ability to estimate the composition and the P-T profiles from spectral data without any a priori assumptions, e.g of chemical/radiative equilibrium. Conversely, retrievals can in principle also be used to constrain deviations of the retrieved thermal/chemical properties from equilibrium expectations, thereby allowing constraints on non-equilibrium processes. Some studies in the past have explored this avenue to constrain disequilibrium chemistry in exoplanetary atmospheres. Early retrievals used a chemical parametrisation which directly retrieved deviations from equilibrium chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009)</ref>. More recently, retrievals typically use parametric mixing ratios, assumed to be uniform in the atmosphere, and assess for deviation from chemical equilibrium a posteriori ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stevenson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2011</ref>). On the other hand, some studies have considered enforcing chemical equilibrium to narrow down the solution space in retrievals, referred to as "chemically consistent" retrievals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kreid- berg et al. 2014</ref>). However, statistical constraints on deviations from chemical equilibrium are not a routine feature in most retrievals.</p><p>As for compositional disequilibrium, retrievals in principle should also be able to constrain deviations of the retrieved P-T profiles from radiative-convective equilibrium if any. To date this aspect has not been explored, arguably due to computational challenges in the past. Most notably, selfconsistent versus retrieval modelling codes often employ different frameworks owing to their contrasting functionalities and their development by independent groups. Thusly compatibility between the models is often difficult. The computational time is also a consideration, as self-consistent models are typically significantly slower per model evaluation than parametric models used in retrievals. The current work aims to bring together both forward and retrieval methods into a common framework in order to facilitate simultaneous constraints on chemical and radiative disequilibrium.</p><p>Here we introduce HyDRA, an integrated atmospheric retrieval framework for thermal emission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets. In addition to retrieving chemical compositions and P -T profiles, HyDRA allows constraints on layer-by-layer deviations of the retrieved atmosphere from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium. This is pursued by integrating a custom-built retrieval code with the fully self-consistent equilibrium model GENESIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>. Both the retrieval and equilibrium codes share the same structure, language, and underlying input data (e.g. opacity database, stellar flux, system parameters, etc.). This means that differences between our retrieved parameters and our equilibrium model will be down to the atmospheric processes at play, and not any differences between the modelling schemes. We study the disequilibrium for our test case of WASP-43b, with one of the most precise spectra available to date. We are able to show using Hy-DRA that WASP-43b is consistent with both chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium.</p><p>In what follows, we describe our modelling and retrieval methodology in section 2. We validate the HyDRA retrieval framework using a synthetic data set in section 3. We then use HyDRA to retrieve the dayside atmospheric properties of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b in section 4, followed by a summary and discussion in section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>HyDRA is a custom-built atmospheric retrieval framework for application to emission spectra of exoplanets. The framework comprises of three key components: (1) a parametric atmosphere model, (2) a Bayesian statistical inference algorithm, and (3) a disequilibrium module for constraining deviations as seen from equilibrium. The parametric model computes an atmospheric thermal emission spectrum given the parametric composition and temperature structure. Given a dataset, the Bayesian inference involves estimating the model parameters and detection significances. The disequilibrium module constrains the deviations of the retrieved atmospheric properties from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium. In the following sections, we discuss each of the  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The HyDRA modelling and retrieval framework. The model parameters, discussed in section 2.2, are used to compute the atmospheric structure (see section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2), the opacities (section 2.3) and the emergent spectrum for a model atmosphere (section 2.4 and 2.6). The likelihood is computed using the data and the model spectrum binned to the resolution of the data. The statistical inference, including parameter estimation and model selection, is conducted using the nested sampling algorithm implemented using the MultiNest package, as discussed in section 2.7. Once the retrieval is completed the retrieved P-T profile and chemical compositions are used in tandem with the GENESIS self-consistent equilibrium model to compute deviations from radiative-convective equilibrium and chemical equilibrium, as discussed in section 2.8.</p><p>above aspects of HyDRA. The modelling and retrieval architecture of HyDRA is shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Geometry</head><p>In the present work we focus on emission spectra of transiting exoplanets as observed at secondary eclipse. Immediately prior to secondary eclipse, emission is observed both from the star as well as the dayside of the planet combined. When the planet is in secondary eclipse only the stellar flux is observed, which when subtracted from the combined emission gives the planetary spectrum. Dividing the two quantities yields the planet-star flux ratio that is independent of the distance to the system. The observed planet-star flux ratio can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Fp(ν) Fstar(ν) ≈ R 2 p B(Tp,ν , ν) R 2 star B(Tstar,ν , ν) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, Tp,ν and Tstar,ν refer to the planetary and stellar brightness temperatures at the frequency ν, and Rp and Rstar are their corresponding radii. B(T, ν) is the Planck function corresponding to the brightness temperature T, ν at a frequency ν. Tp,ν is a representative temperature corresponding to the τν ≈ 1 surface (the "photosphere") at frequency ν. The exact calculation of the emergent spectrum from the planetary atmosphere is described in section 2.4. The flux ratio has wavelength dependant emission which occurs from different pressure levels in the atmosphere depending on the opacity and hence atmospheric chemistry. The emission spectrum therefore provides constraints on the temperature profile, chemical composition, and energy transport in the dayside atmosphere. Hot Jupiter atmospheres are particularly conducive to observations of thermal emission due to their large radii and high temperatures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a schematic of the emission occurring from a planet, with the pressure-temperature (henceforth P-T) profile shown. The region of the atmosphere where the optical depth is of order unity is where the emission will occur from. This will also be a function of the wavelength and of the constituent molecular species (i.e their cross-section). Where the emission occurs from cooler parts of the atmosphere, a smaller thermal signal is generated. Absorption features thus result from the temperature decreasing with altitude, and vice versa for thermal inversions (where the temperature increases with height). This allows us to probe the P-T profile of the planet by studying the spectrum and the absorption from spectrally active species. In the retrieval algorithm, we will need to model the atmosphere for a wide range of P-T profiles and chemistry that is possible for such exoplanets to explore the parameter space.</p><p>In our model we take a grid of 4000 evenly spaced wavelength points in the Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 1 and 2 bandpasses between 1 and 5.5µm, and 100 atmospheric layers evenly spaced in log(P) ranging from 10 2 − 10 −5 bar.  The temperature profile is used to determine the density of gas under the ideal gas assumption, taking the atmosphere to be in hydrostatic equilibrium.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">P-T Profile Parametrisation</head><p>Atmospheric temperature profiles can have strong dependence with pressure. Being able to model P -T profiles effectively with a minimal number of free parameters is critical, particularly in emission spectroscopy where the spectrum is quite sensitive to the temperature gradient (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">fig. 7</ref>). We adopt the parametric P -T profile of <ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan &amp; Sea- ger (2009)</ref> which is known to be effective in capturing a wide range of P -T profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mad- husudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burningham et al. 2017</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Line et al. (2013)</ref> explored alternate parametrisation of the P-T profile, either an analytic profile Guillot (2010) for grey atmospheres or a level-by-level approach, where the atmosphere is subdivided into several regions and the temperature in each of these layers left as a retrieval parameter. Retrievals with Hy-DRA were checked with both of these temperature profiles as well to ensure minimal effect of the P-T parametrisation on the derived atmospheric structure, as was seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the profile we use from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009)</ref>, the atmosphere is divided into 3 broad regions with the boundaries between them given by P0 layer 1 &lt; P1, P1 layer 2 &lt; P3 and P3 layer 3. P2 represents the base pressure of the thermal inversion, only present in the atmosphere if P1 &lt; P2. The temperature profile in each layer is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = P0e α 1 (T −T 0 ) β 1 in layer 1,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">P = P2e α 2 (T −T 2 ) β 2 in layer 2,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">T = T3 in layer 3.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with the free parameters α1, α2, β1 and β2 determining the gradient of the P-T profile, and Ti representing the temperature at pressure Pi. We set β1 = β2 = 0.5 as per the reasoning in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009)</ref>, and fix the top of the atmosphere P0 = 10 −5 bar; pressures below this do not significantly affect the observed emission spectrum due to lack of any significant opacity. These conditions, along with the continuity of the temperature between each layer, result in 6 free parameters to fully specify the temperature at any pressure, which for convenience we take to be T0, α1, α2, P1, P2 and P3. The parameters used in the retrieval are shown in table 1. In the retrieval itself, we choose to parametrise the temperature at 100mb pressure T 100mb instead of T0. This is convenient as it offers the value of the temperature near the photosphere, and not simply the top of the model atmosphere which would be quite poorly constrained anyway and dependant on the choice of the model (the lowest pressure modelled). It also provides tighter constraints on the other parameters, given that the spectrum is most sensitive to the temperature at this pressure. The measurement at 0.1 bar can also be more easily compared to the planet's equilibrium temperature, and any conclusions we can draw from the observed temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Chemical Mixing Ratios</head><p>As well as the P-T structure of the atmosphere, we also wish to determine the abundances of the spectroscopically active species. Molecular species have been discovered in both transmission and emission spectroscopy, most notably H2O, in several transiting exoplanets. As typically considered in retrievals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mac- Donald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>) we include molecular species that are expected to be most dominant in H2-rich atmospheres at high temperatures (Madhusudhan 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heng &amp; Lyons 2016</ref>): H2O, CH4, NH3, CO, CO2, HCN and C2H2 (see <ref type="table">table 1</ref>).</p><p>The molecular mixing ratio of species i is given by Xi = ni/ntot, where ni is the number density of the species and ntot is the total number density of all species. The mixing ratio Xi can be left as a free parameter to be retrieved or fixed to a specific value. The helium fraction X he is fixed to be 0.15 (the He:H2 ratio is 0.17), i.e solar composition. The hydrogen mixing ratio is calculated from XH 2 = 1 − <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The set of parameters we choose in order to test our model.

The final six generate the P-T profile described in section 2.2.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Opacities</head><p>Spectroscopically active species present can absorb and emit photons in the atmosphere, dependent on the relevant cross-section. These wavelength dependent molecular absorption bands determine the emergent spectrum. Here we describe how the molecular cross-sections are computed for the gaseous species considered, along with the collisionally induced absorption from the dominant H2 and He gases. The sum of these, the total opacity, is required to calculate the flux ratio from the forward model (section 2.4). The full numerical details of the computation carried out to compute the cross-sections can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan (2017)</ref>.</p><p>In determining the cross-section of each molecule as a function of pressure, temperature and wavelength, we use publicly available molecular ro-vibrational transition line lists for each molecule. In the current version of HyDRA, H2O, CH4, NH3, CO, CO2, HCN and C2H2 molecular absorption is considered. Collisionally induced absorption (CIA) due to H2-H2 and H2-He interactions are also included ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Richard et al. 2012</ref>). H2O, CO and CO2 are computed from the HITEMP database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rothman et al. 2010</ref>), CH4, NH3 and HCN are calculated from the ExoMol database <ref type="bibr">(Ten- nyson et al. 2016</ref>) and C2H2 is taken from HITRAN ( <ref type="bibr">Roth- man et al. 2013</ref>). The strength of each transition in the line list is found on a pre-computed grid of temperatures and broadened (with pressure and temperature broadening) to give the cross-section as a function of frequency. These are then summed together for every line and binned down to a 1cm −1 spacing grid between 0.4µm and 50µm. We use a temperature grid with 16 points ranging from 300-3500K and a pressure grid with 7 points evenly spaced in log(P) ranging from 10 −4 −100 bar to compute the cross-sections. To obtain the cross-section for a general temperature, pressure and wavelength point, interpolation of the pre-computed grid is carried out. We have tested our models and retrievals for a range of spectral resolutions to ensure minimal differences due to the resolution of our cross section grid, as also demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Once the molecular cross section, κi(P, T,ν) is computed for each P-T point of the atmosphere, we simply sum the cross sections of all of the species, weighted by their mixing fractions Xi (see section 2.2.2). This gives the total extinction coefficient χ and the optical depth τ as a function of pressure, temperature and frequency</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">χ(P, T,ν) = i Xin(P, T) κi(P, T,ν) + σH 2 + κCIA,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">dτ (P, T,ν) = χ(P, T,ν)dz,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where σH 2 and αCIA refer to the loss from the beam due to Rayleigh scattering and collisionally induced absorption of molecular hydrogen respectively. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows the molecular cross sections for the 7 molecules considered at 1600K temperature and 0.1 bar pressure, representative of the typical conditions expected in WASP-43b's photosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Radiative Transfer</head><p>Once the total opacity contribution from each species has been summed, we require calculation of the emergent flux out of the model atmosphere. The radiative transfer method to obtain the emergent planetary spectrum is discussed here. We only consider radiative transfer models in the pure absorption limit, where the scattering into the beam of radiation is assumed to be negligible. However, they begin to deviate from the full solution (i.e ones that account for scattering into the beam) once the wavelength is below ∼ 1µm (i.e where scattering can no longer be assumed small). Various methods exist to compute the emergent intensity of radiation, with varying levels of sophistication, but a simple forward model is needed for the retrieval. This is so as to be computationally fast whilst also capturing the relevant physics, as typically retrievals evaluate millions of models to map the parameter space. For this purpose we tested several approaches in order to determine which would be the most favourable in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>Consider a slab of optical thickness τ and temperature T , with a radiation intensity I0 emergent from underneath at an angle θ to the normal, with cos(θ) = µ. The radiation emergent out of the slab as a function of frequency ν and angle cosine µ is given by (Seager 2010)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">I1(ν, µ) = I0(ν, µ)e −τ /µ + B(T, ν)(1 − e −τ /µ ),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>for a Planck function B(T, ν) at temperature T and frequency ν. For a model atmosphere with N D layers, we simply compute the contributions of each slab by integrating upwards through the atmosphere along a ray to find the emergent intensity Itop. The flux exiting the top of the atmosphere is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Ftop(ν) = 2π 0 1 0 µItop(ν, µ)dµdφ = 2π 1 0 µItop(ν, µ)dµ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where the integral over the azimuth φ is assumed to be trivial assuming axial symmetry. If the distance to the system is d, the observed flux at the observer is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Fp(ν) = Ftop(ν) R 2 p,ν d 2 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Here Rp,ν is the radius of the planetary photosphere (where τν = 1) at the frequency ν. The mean radius of the planet, required to calculate the temperature profile, is taken to be the observed radius set at a pressure of 0.1 bar which represents the mean pressure of the τν = 1 surface. Our model computes flux from radiation exiting the atmosphere accounting for the loss from the beam due to absorption and scattering. There are multiple approaches to calculate the flux. We experimented with the case where only one ray was considered for the emergent intensity, at µ = 0 (vertical), to calculate the flux. We found significant differences <ref type="bibr">(&gt; 30ppm</ref>) between this and the 6 angle dependent radiative transfer using the Feautrier method as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan (2017)</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 4</ref>). This single ray approach is the method used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Line et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009)</ref>, and has been reasonable given previous observational data. It is computationally fast, requiring only one ray's exiting radiation field to be calculated. Perhaps a more representative angle could have been used for single ray calculations, e.g µ = 1/ √ 3. However, given the high accuracy on the WASP-43b dataset, we chose to explore other methods in order to calculate the flux to a greater accuracy. This is achieved by integrating over multiple angles. Trapezium rule integration over µ with 6 evenly spaced values of µ ranging between 0 and 1 significantly improves the result, as the variation of the intensity with angle is considered. In this latter case, the difference from the full Feautrier calculation is below 10 ppm as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 4</ref>. However, just two or three angles with Gaussian quadrature provided excellent match to the full solution (see <ref type="table">table.</ref> 2). Increasing the number of angles further did not result in major differences in the spectra, but did increase the computation time significantly (time per model scales with the number of µ values). It is for this reason that we adopt two angles with Gaussian quadrature in our model. For comparison, the precision of the WASP-43b data in secondary eclipse considered here is ∼ 35ppm, and so the present accuracy in our radiative transfer more than suffices for our purpose. In future, however, with higher quality data sets it would be imperative to use as accurate a solution as possible to ensure accurate constraints.</p></div>

If B01 &gt; 1, model M0 is favoured over M1 given the observed data (its Bayesian evidence is greater). This allows us to demonstrate quantitatively whether a more complex model or a simple one is required. For instance, if we wish to calculate the significance of a detection of a molecule, we can find the Bayes factor B01 for a model with the molecule (M0) and one with the same parameters but with this molecule removed (M1). This then establishes the evidence for such a molecule. Bayes factors greater than 3, 12 and 150 are often quoted as weak, moderate and strong detections. The larger the Bayes factor, the more evidence there is to support model M0, i.e the better the explanation of the data with the relevant parameter. This can then also be converted into a detection significance. For further details on Bayesian analysis, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Trotta (2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Constraints on Disequilibrium</head><p>One of the key functionalities of HyDRA is to constrain the deviations of the retrieved compositions and P -T profiles from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium. This is achieved by operating the retrieval code in tandem with our self-consistent equilibrium model for exoplanetary atmospheres GENESIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>. As modules from both the retrieval and equilibrium models are shared, any deviations between retrieved and equilibrium properties are unlikely to be due to the intrinsic model differences but rather to non-equilibrium atmospheric processes at play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.1">Radiative-Convective Disequilibrium</head><p>We constrain radiative-convective disequilibrium by investigating deviations of retrieved P -T profiles from equilibrium P -T profiles with the same retrieved compositions.

The opacity and stellar flux calculations are identical to the retrieval algorithm, and the full radiative transfer scheme shows negligible differences as explored in section 2.4. As we hold the chemistry fixed to a range of the retrieved values, we know that any deviation that arises can be attributed to effects not accounted for. These differences can provide key insights into atmospheric energy transport, and about the validity of 1-D models. It also provides clues to the next steps in our modelling approaches in order to match observations and incorporate new physics, e.g atmospheric dynamics, into 1-D models used in retrievals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.2">Chemical Disequilibrium</head><p>We constrain chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere by considering deviations of the retrieved compositions from those computed assuming chemical equilibrium for the same retrieved P -T profiles. Given the posterior distributions of the retrieved parameters, we choose a representative statistical sample of compositions and their corresponding P -T profiles. These P -T profiles are then used to compute equilibrium abundances of all the chemical species and the corresponding uncertainties. The differences between the retrieved and equilibrium abundance provide constraints on the deviations from chemical equilibrium. The species include H2O, CH4, NH3, CO, HCN, CO2, C2H2, C2H4 and N2. To determine the equilibrium mixing fractions for a species at a given pressure and temperature, we utilise the semianalytic calculations developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heng &amp; Tsai (2016)</ref>.

This is achieved by solving a decic equation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heng &amp; Tsai 2016</ref>) knowing each of the equilibrium constants, which are functions of pressure of temperature. Therefore, for a fixed P-T profile we can determine the mixing ratios for our hydrogen dominated atmosphere. For the purpose of this work, we ignore N2 as it offers no spectral signature, as well as C2H4 as it is present only in very small quantities and thus does not significantly affect the spectra and cannot be retrieved to any certainty for our spectral range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RETRIEVALS WITH SIMULATED DATA</head><p>We now proceed to validate the HyDRA retrieval framework. The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate the effectiveness of HyDRA for atmospheric retrieval with emission spectra and to explore any degeneracies that may be present in the model parameter space given a dataset. We apply the code to synthetic data to demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting parameter values that are known a priori. Each component of HyDRA, i.e the P-T parametrisation, the opacity calculations and the simplified radiative transfer module were also checked against a fully self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 4</ref>) to ensure a common modelling framework.</p><p>We apply HyDRA to a simulated thermal emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. The choice of this system was driven by the quality of data available and its conduciveness for thermal emission observations. WASP-43b is a hot Jupiter with a mass of ∼2 MJ and radius of 0.93 RJ and orbits a K7 dwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hellier et al. 2011</ref>). The relatively small and cool star leads to a high planet-star flux ratio making the planet a prime target for thermal emission observations. Consequently, WASP-43b is the most observed transiting planet in thermal emission with high S/N observations using HST WFC3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stevenson et al. 2014</ref>) and Spitzer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. 2014</ref>). The synthetic emission spectrum was generated using a theoretical spectrum computed using our GENESIS self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>). The compositions for the volatile atmospheric molecules shown in table 1. The model atmosphere is in radiative-convective but not thermochemical equilibrium, to demonstrate the retrieval's ability to constrain the chemical species when they are out of chemical equilibrium. Many of the modules between the models are shared (see section 2.8.1).</p><p>We have performed consistency and sensitivity analyses of our modelling framework over a range of fixed parameters and adopt the most optimal values. The model spectrum is binned to obtain simulated data points with the same precision and resolution as those obtained from real observations in the WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC bandpasses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. 2014</ref>). The parameters of the synthetic model are shown in table 1, with the chemical abundance fixed for all pressures for consistency with the retrieval framework. The uncertainties in the simulated spectrum are taken to be exactly the same as those of the observed spectrum discussed above and added as random gaussian noise on the synthetic model. The parameters in the retrieval include abundances of the seven prominent volatile species expected in hot Jupiters (H2O, CH4, NH3, CO, HCN, CO2 and C2H2) and six parameters that describe the P-T profile. The spectral resolution of the model was set to contain 4000 points uniformly spaced between 1-5.5 µm, for both the self-consistent model as well as retrievals. The retrievals were carried out using the nested sampling algorithm with 4000 live sample points. We have considered a range of spectral resolutions, number of live sample points in nested sampling, variation in pressure grid in the P -T profiles, etc, and have adopted the most conservative values for each. We also tested the radiative transfer with a simple single ray µ = 0 case against integration over multiple angles (see section 2.4) and have adopted the optimal twoangle quadrature. In what follows, we discuss the results of our retrievals with the simulated data, given in table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Retrieved Abundances</head><p>The retrieved abundances show very good agreement with the true abundances of the synthetic model. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the posterior distributions for the retrieved chemical species along with their estimated and true values. We find that the true values lie within the 1-σ uncertainties for all the species. The best retrieved molecule is H2O with the median value only 0.16 dex away from the true value and an average uncertainty of 0.65 dex. Other molecules retrieved at similar precision include CH4 and NH3. The detection significances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 obtained from nested model comparisons are 6.7σ, 5.6σ, and 2.1σ, respectively. The reason behind the well constrained abundances of these three molecules is a combination of their high abundances used in the synthetic model as well as their relatively strong spectral features mainly in the WFC3 bandpass; H2O being the strongest and NH3 the weakest of the three. The lower significance of NH3 is also due to degeneracies with HCN in the WFC3 bandpass as discussed below (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">MacDonald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>. The other molecules only have weak constraints, largely owing to the lack of significant unique features in the observed spectral range. The spectral features of the molecules in the observed wavelength range are shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 3</ref>. HCN has a minor feature at ∼ 1.55µm, mostly overwhelmed by the NH3 and H2O <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(MacDonald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref> and as such allows for only an upper-limit of XHCN &lt; 10 −2.8 that is still consistent with the true value. The C2H2 has very weak features so there is almost no constraint on its abundance XC 2 H 2 &lt; 10 −2 . In principle, CO and CO2 have strong features in the Spitzer 4.5 µm IRAC bandpass but are degenerate with each other for the same reason, as discussed   below. As such their abundances are also relatively unconstrained. Finally, the spectral resolution and precision of the data also limit the capability of the retrieval in constraining the abundances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">CO2 Degeneracy</head><p>As alluded to above we find CO and CO2 to be degenerate given the single IRAC 4.5 µm band with significant features. The CO and CO2 abundances show an "L"-shaped correlation, as also seen in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madhusudhan et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. (2016)</ref>. The absorption in the 4.5 µm band can be explained by either a high CO and low CO2 or vice versa or a combination of both, leading to the L-shaped behaviour. The weak constraints on the species are also contributed by the large uncertainty in the 4.5 µm Spitzer IRAC data point. The detection significance of CO or CO2 individually is weak, but the joint detection significance of having either one of CO or CO2 is over 10σ. With our chemical equilibrium model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref> and full equilibrium calculations for similar planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moses et al. , 2013</ref>, we find that the H2O abundance always exceeds the CO2 abundance, regardless of the C/O ratio and metallicity. Hence, when considering hot Jupiter retrievals, we impose the constraint that the H2O abundance must exceed the CO2 abundance, as suggested in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Madhusudhan 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heng &amp; Lyons 2016)</ref>. This partially breaks the degeneracy and allows for more chemically realistic mixing fractions. It should be noted that this assumption can only be made when considering H2 rich atmospheres. This allows for tighter constraints on the other species, and the temperature can be retrieved more accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Abundance-T 100mb Degeneracy</head><p>The molecular abundances are generally correlated with the retrieved temperature (see <ref type="figure">fig. 5</ref>). A higher abundance raises the opacity, and hence emission is seen to occur from higher in the atmosphere. This increase in the chemical abundance can be compensated by a subsequent alteration in the temperature profile, as long as the temperature at which the emission occurs in the atmosphere remains the same. Given the observational uncertainties in our dataset, we find the abundances and T 100mb to lie on a line of degeneracy (see <ref type="figure">fig. 5</ref>). We see from <ref type="figure">fig. 6</ref> that in the WFC3 bandpass there is no significant deviation between the retrieved and true models. However, as the spectrum proceeds away from the WFC3 spectral range the uncertainty in the retrieved flux ratio increases due to the lack of high precision data. Observations at other wavelengths in future with instruments such as JWST may be able to better constrain the flux ratio and hence the atmospheric properties more effectively. The Spitzer IRAC photometric points at 4.5, 5.8 and 8 µm channels may also be used to address the problem, however, these points often come with larger associated errors and difficult systematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014</ref>) making it difficult to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Retrieved P-T Profile</head><p>Similar to the chemical abundances the parameters of the P -T profile are also retrieved at high accuracy. The retrieved posterior distributions of the parameters and their estimated values are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The true values of all the parameters are recovered to within the 1-σ uncertainties. The retrieved temperature profile along with the confidence limits is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">fig. 7</ref>, and is in agreement with the true profile within 1σ for almost all pressures. The fit is particularly good at 1mbar-1 bar, with an error of only 50 K on average between the median profile and the true value. The photospheric temperature is also well constrained with an average uncertainty on T 100mb to be ∼110 K. The retrieval captures the temperature gradient near the photosphere accurately, unsurprising as this is where the bulk of the spectrum is generated. Naturally, the constraints on the temperature are weaker in the lowest and highest regions of the atmosphere that are inaccessible to the observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Radiative-Convective Disequilibrium</head><p>We now use the retrieved posterior distributions of the P -T profiles to constrain deviations from radiative-convective equilibrium. This is done by considering the chemical compositions corresponding to the retrieved P -T profiles and deriving the corresponding P -T profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium using the GENESIS self-consistent model (see section 2.8.1). This provides a test of our model's ability to infer disequilibrium in the temperature, as the simulated data set used for the retrieval was in thermal equilibrium. The GENESIS model was run for 1000 randomly sampled retrieved chemical abundances from the posterior, and calculating the equilibrium P-T profile this chemistry. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref> shows both the retrieved and the radiativeequilibrium P-T profiles, along with the actual P-T profile of the simulated data. All lie within 1σ of each other, particularly in the vicinity of τν = 1. Hence with the combination of our self-consistent and our retrieval algorithm we can conclude that our simulated planet is in equilibrium at all modelled pressures. This is quite a significant result, as this allows one to investigate whether a retrieved profile is consistent with 1-D radiative-convective equilibrium throughout the atmosphere, and if not, quantify where in the atmosphere the temperature deviates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Chemical Disequilibrium</head><p>The deviation of the retrieved model atmosphere from chemical equilibrium was calculated by holding the temperature profiles fixed from the retrieval, and determining the equilibrium abundances as described in section 2.8.2. Chemical deviation provides a handle on the mixing at play in the atmosphere, e.g. from winds to vertical mixing, and perhaps even the photo-dissociation for some species. 1000 randomly sampled retrieved values were used, and the theoretical equilibrium mixing fractions calculated as a function of the pressure for 100 layers, evenly spaced in log(P) ranging from 100-10 −5 bar. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows the mixing fractions used to generate the spectrum and the retrieved chemical abundances on the simulated data set. We find that all of our retrieved values are consistent with the black line used to generate the model spectrum. The chemical equilibrium values are also shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 9</ref> for the retrieved P-T profiles, and gives us a handle to the disequilibrium present on a planet. We chose our simulated atmosphere to be out of chemical equilibrium (but in radiative equilibrium) given that equilibrium abundances were too low for many of the species in order for them to be constrained effectively. The higher abundances also highlight any degeneracies that may be present between molecules in the retrieval and demonstrate HyDRA's effectiveness in determining chemical disequilibrium. The predicted CH4, NH3</p><p>and HCN abundances decrease with height in the atmosphere, whereas the CO2 mixing fraction remained reasonably constant. It was however at all points less than the H2O abundance, justifying our assumption that the CO2 abundance should not exceed the H2O. We can clearly see from the simulated retrieval that the model planet's spectrum is not in equilibrium.</p></div>

In the present work, we use the observed thermal emission spectra from these previous works and revisit the constraints on the atmospheric properties using HyDRA. In addition to previous constraints we specifically investigate the deviations of the derived compositions and P -T profile from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium. We take the radius of the planet to be 0.93 RJ , with a semi-major axis of 0.014 A.U. and a log(g) = 3.7 (taken from exoplanets.org).</p><p>Following previous works we consider high-precision HST and Spitzer data for the present analysis. The WFC3 data, in the 1.1-1.7 µm range, were obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreidberg et al. (2014)</ref> and two Spitzer IRAC photometric points, at 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm were obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. (2014)</ref>. The model parameters, as described in section 2, include mixing ratios of the prominent chemical species (H2O, CH4, NH3, CO, HCN, CO2 and C2H2) and the parameters of the P -T profile. The retrievals, carried out using the nested sampling algorithm, used 4000 live samples and included over 10 6 model evaluations per retrieval. The detection significances for the chemical species were carried out using nested model comparisons (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">MacDonald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>, resulting in ∼10 7 model evaluations overall. Section 2.7.2 has further information on the Bayesian model comparisons and describes how we evaluated the detection significance of a species given the evidence Z for each model with and without the relevant species. The results of the retrieval are shown in figs. 10 and 11 with deviations from equilibrium given in figs. 12 and 13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Constraints on Chemical Abundances</head><p>We report strong constraints on the abundance of H2O which is detected at 8-σ significance.

This also leads to a degeneracy between the two molecules due to a lack of strong features from either molecule elsewhere in the observed spectral range. The degeneracy is apparent in the "L"-shaped feature in the CO-CO2 correlation plot in <ref type="figure">fig.10</ref>. Neither CO nor CO2 have individual significant detection evidences (1.3 and 2.1 σ, respectively), however we do find that the combined significance CO/CO2 is 7.9σ. This amounts to a strong detection of carbon chemistry in WASP-43b.</p><p>We do not find conclusive evidence for any of the remaining species considered with only upper-limits retrieved. CH4, NH3 and HCN are constrained to be less than ∼ 10 −4 at 2-σ confidence; they are ostensibly present in smaller quantities than can be retrieved with the current data. As discussed below, equilibrium calculations would also predict low abundances of these species given the temperature. Therefore, their non-detections are perhaps unsurprising. No meaningful constraint is obtained for C2H2, as its crosssection is too weak or has very low abundance and hence is dominated by other species in the WFC3 and Spitzer bandpasses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Radiative-Convective Disequilibrium</head><p>Using HyDRA we are able to constrain the layer-by-layer deviation of the temperature profile from radiative equilibrium. For hot Jupiters, the observable atmosphere in equilibrium is dominated by radiative energy transport. However, non-equilibrium processes such as those caused by atmospheric dynamics (e.g. winds) could drive the atmosphere out of radiative equilibrium. As discussed in section 2 one of the primarily capabilities of HyDRA is to constrain the effects of such properties on the layer-by-layer temperature profile. This is achieved by comparing the retrieved distribution of P -T profiles with those obtained in radiativeconvective equilibrium for the same chemical compositions obtained from the retrieval. As discussed in section 2 the self-consistent models are computed using GENESIS code <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>) which has been developed in the same framework as the retrieval code. The constraints on the temperature differentials (∆T) are evaluated based on 1000 randomly sampled points from the posterior distributions of the retrieved P -T profiles and their corresponding compositions.</p><p>We report the dayside atmosphere of WASP-43b to be in radiative equilibrium with low day-night energy redistribution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> shows the constraints on ∆T as a function of pressure and the distributions of both the retrieved and equilibrium P -T profiles showing excellent agreement.

This is also consistent with the inefficient redistribution suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref> based on the large day-night temperature contrast observed with thermal phase curves of the planet. The transition to the isotherm in the lower atmosphere occurs at ∼ 1bar, in agreement with what would be expected in equilibrium. This is the region of the atmosphere where the optical depth exceeds 1 and hence the photons become diffusive, which leads to a profile that does not vary with the pressure. This isothermal structure in the lower atmosphere is consistent with predictions from self-consistent equilibrium models of highly irradiated hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burrows et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fort- ney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>). As shown in these studies, the transition from the isothermal radiative structure to a convective adiabat occurs much deeper in the atmosphere, at pressures of 100 bar, which are well below the observable atmosphere. As such, for our equilibrium model we assumed the internal flux of the planet to be negligible as it only effects the deep adiabat which is not accessible to current observations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">+0</formula><p>Future observations in other spectral regions will be able to further constrain the temperature profile and deviations from radiative equilibrium. We also assume that the sodium/potassium abundance is solar, and that no other visible absorbers are present in any significant quantities. Visible absorbers such as TiO are likely to be present only in small quantities, as otherwise thermal inversions would occur in the photosphere at ∼ 0.1 − 0.01 bar <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>). These models also assume solar composition Na/K, given that the retrieved H2O abundance was consistent with solar. Future compositional estimates on visible absorbers can provide more definitive inputs to the equilibrium models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Chemical Disequilibrium</head><p>Here we investigate the possible deviation of the retrieved chemical abundances from thermochemical equilibrium. To do so, we compare the retrieved distributions of the chemical abundances, with their corresponding P -T profiles, against those obtained assuming chemical equilibrium for the same P -T profiles. The approach is discussed in section 2. The retrieved and equilibrium mixing ratios for the prominent chemical species are shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 13</ref>. The retrieved H2O abundance is consistent with that obtained in thermochemical equilibrium with the assumption of solar composition. It is important to note that even in chemical equilibrium the H2O abundance is expected to be relatively uniform with depth, as assumed in the retrievals, unlike some other species. This is owing to the fact that at high temperatures,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>) in green, with the chemistry fixed to the retrieved values.

Furthermore, with the exception of H2O and CO, the remaining species are also expected to be present in small quantities in equilibrium. For example, the CH4 abundance in equilibrium decreases outward in the atmosphere with decreasing pressure and is well below the observed upper-limit in the photosphere. In principle, strong vertical mixing could dredge up a higher abundance of CH4 from deeper layers of the atmosphere (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moses et al. 2013</ref>). However, out current upper-limit on CH4 suggests that the corresponding quench pressure level from where such dredge up might occur could not be greater than ∼10 bar. Generally, the retrieved CH4 abundance 10 −5 , is in agreement with our chemical equilibrium predictions. Equilibrium chemistry suggests that the NH3 and HCN should be present in significant amounts only in the deeper layers of the atmosphere, greater than 1 bar in the atmosphere, below which the atmosphere is opaque to radiation (τν &gt;&gt; 1). They can also be dredged up from the vertical mixing into the photosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moses et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">MacDonald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref> though no strong evidence for the same is seen here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY</head><p>In this study we introduce HyDRA, a new atmospheric retrieval framework for emission spectroscopy of exoplanets. In addition to the functionalities of existing retrieval codes, Hy-DRA is geared towards constraining deviations of retrieved solutions from chemical and radiative equilibrium. Emission spectroscopy allows probing the temperature structure and chemical composition of the dayside atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. In the present work, we develop a common framework to operate a state-of-the-art retrieval algorithm in tandem with self-consistent equilibrium models of thermal emission from exoplanets.</p><p>We test HyDRA using simulated data of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b and demonstrate accurate retrieval of the abundances and temperature structure, along with deviations from equilibrium. Consistently with previous work in the literature, we find degeneracies between the retrieved abundances of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide given the limited observations currently available. This degeneracy was partially broken by imposing the constraint that the H2O abundance must exceed the CO2 abundance, as this 10 -10 10 -8 10 -6 10 -4 10 -2  <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>. Retrieved chemical abundances and theoretical chemical equilibrium calculations performed with GENESIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017)</ref>. The dark and light purple contours show the 1 and 2σ errors for the retrieval respectively, and the dark and light green the corresponding thermochemical equilibrium mixing fractions with the P-T profile fixed to the retrieved values. Where a molecule was detected using our Bayesian analysis, the median fit value is also plotted in blue, and where there was no significant detection, the 2σ upper bound is shown by an arrow. 1000 randomly sampled retrieval points were used, and 100 layers taken for the model atmosphere. The atomic abundances were kept at solar values for C, O and N during the equilibrium calculations.</p><p>is always the case for H2-rich atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heng &amp; Lyons 2016)</ref>, but the retrieved abundance is still degenerate with CO. We also see a degeneracy between abundances and the photosphere temperature, where we parametrise the temperature as T 100mb . This degeneracy may be broken with sufficient spectral coverage, particularly data in regions where the continuum opacity is probed (e.g 2-2.5µm). With the future development of instruments that do so, this should be resolved to give us the tightest constraints on the chemistry present on exoplanets.</p><p>Whilst previous work has already been done in this field, our model combines several modules from our 1-D self-consistent forward model, GENESIS <ref type="bibr">(Gandhi &amp; Mad- husudhan 2017)</ref>, such as a similar radiative transfer scheme (which has been tested against the self-consistent solution in section 2.4) and identical molecular cross-section calculations. The Kurucz stellar model and the line lists for the opacity calculations are also shared. All of this means that we are able to compare quantitatively the difference between retrieved and equilibrium models for a given data set of a planet, and constrain the chemical and radiative-convective disequilibrium. The latter in particular is novel and allows for the precise determination of the deviation in the temperature profile from what is expected for a 1-D model. This opens up many avenues to expand upon our current understanding, and improve our modelling techniques.</p><p>We demonstrate our retrieval algorithm on the emission spectrum of WASP-43b, with one of the most precise observations of exoplanets under emission to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>), as a demonstration of our code. We find that the temperature structure of WASP-43b shows agreement with our radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium model. By taking the chemistry to be that which was retrieved, we are able to conclude that this planet's temperature profile is consistent with our forward model. In running our model we assume there is little stellar flux redistribution over to the nightside, and find results in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Stevenson et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The volatiles' abundances obtained reveals that the planet is most likely close to solar composition water and provides some constraints on the CO abundance. The C/O ratio is likely to be less than 1, particularly given the high water abundance observed and our chemical equilibrium calculations in section 4. The other species have not been detected to any high significance. The P-T profile indicates that there is no thermal inversion present in the region of τ ∼ 1. The 100mb temperature is constrained to be 1594 +170</p></div>

The chemical equilibrium analysis indicates that the planet is within chemical equilibrium given the retrieved temperature, albeit with large uncertainties on the results, as lower abundances do not significantly affect the spectrum and hence cannot be retrieved.</p><p>There has been some suggestions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) that thermal inversions may be present on hot Jupiters, thanks to strong visible absorption from metallic species such as TiO and VO. We find no such inversions for WASP-43b, as it is most likely too cool for such species to exist in gaseous form. Investigating the spread of thermal inversions on such systems would indirectly tell us about the visible absorption present, and the implications this would mean about their temperature structure.</p><p>Work has already begun looking into phase resolved spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Stevenson et al. 2017)</ref>, combining dayside and nightside retrievals dependant on the observational geometry. Modification of the retrieval to take into account the likely temperature distribution would be prudent, as it may help constrain the abundances and the profile better, and provide evidence for temperature variations across the dayside. The temperature structure of the planet is also sensitive in emission spectroscopy, so a good understanding here is required to get precise planetary properties.</p><p>HyDRA is a new emission spectroscopy retrieval algorithm that utilises the most up to date high temperature molecular data along with the most advanced radiative transfer techniques and the latest statistical methods. There is much excitement over the future of the field with new and upcoming observations with VLT, JWST, E-ELT and many others, and the present work prepares us for this new era of atmospheric observations. This will allow for even deeper insights into the structure and composition of exoplanetary atmospheres. HyDRA used for emission spectroscopy retrieval in conjunction with our self-consistent GENESIS model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi &amp; Madhusudhan 2017</ref>) represents a new development in the field and allows constraints on departures from 1-D equilibrium in exoplanetary atmospheres, a vital step towards detailed characterization of atmospheric processes in exoplanets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
