			<abstract>
				<p>We present the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog of transiting exoplanets based on searching four years of Kepler time series photometry (Data Release 25, Q1-Q17). The catalog contains 8054 KOIs of which 4034 are planet candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 are new and include two in multi-planet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05), and ten high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter which automatically vets the DR25 Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs, Twicken et al. 2016). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discusses the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7% complete and the catalog is 50.5% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Kepler 's mission to measure the frequency of Earthsize planets in the Galaxy is an important step towards understanding the Earth's place in the Universe. Launched in 2009, the Kepler Mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Koch et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki 2016</ref>) stared almost continuously at a single field for four years (or 17, ≈90 day quarters), recording the brightness of ≈200,000 stars (≈160,000 stars at a time) at a cadence of 29.4 minutes over the course of the mission. Kepler detected transiting planets by observing the periodic decrease in the observed brightness of a star when an orbiting planet crossed the line of sight from the telescope to the star. Kepler 's primemission observations concluded in 2013 when it lost a second of four reaction wheels, three of which were required to maintain the stable pointing. From the ashes of Kepler rose the K2 mission which continues to find exoplanets in addition to a whole host of astrophysics enabled by its observations of fields in the ecliptic <ref type="bibr">(How- ell et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Van Cleve et al. 2016b</ref>). While not the first to obtain high-precision, long-baseline photometry to look for transiting exoplanets (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barge et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">O'Donovan et al. 2006</ref>), Kepler and its plethora of planet candidates revolutionized exoplanet science. The large number of Kepler planet detections from the same telescope opened the door for occurrence rate studies and has enabled some of the first measurements of the frequency of planets similar to the Earth in our Galaxy. To further enable those types of studies, we present here the planet catalog that resulted from the final search of the Data Release 25 (DR25) Kepler mission data along with the tools provided to understand the biases inherent in the search and vetting done to create that catalog.</p><p>First, we put this work in context by reviewing some of the scientific achievements accomplished using Kepler data. Prior to Kepler , most exoplanets were discovered by radial velocity methods (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>, which largely resulted in the detection of Neptuneto Jupiter-mass planets in orbital periods of days to months. The high precision photometry and the fouryear baseline of the Kepler data extended the landscape of known exoplanets. To highlight a few examples, <ref type="bibr">Bar- clay et al. (2013)</ref> found evidence for a moon-size terrestrial planet in a 13.3 day period orbit, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Quintana et al. (2014)</ref> found evidence of an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone of the M dwarf <ref type="bibr">Kepler-186, and Jenk- ins et al. (2015)</ref> statistically validated a super-Earth in the habitable zone of a G-dwarf star. Additionally, for several massive planets Kepler data has enabled measurements of planetary mass and atmospheric properties by using the photometric variability along the entire orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shporer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mazeh et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Shporer 2017)</ref>. Kepler data has also revealed hundreds of compact, co-planar, multi-planet systems, e.g., the six planets around <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>), which collectively have told us a great deal about the architecture of planetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Lissauer et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>). Exoplanets have even been found orbiting binary stars, e.g., Kepler-16 (AB) b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Doyle et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Other authors have taken advantage of the long time series, near-continuous data set of 206,150 1 stars to advance our understanding of stellar physics through the use of asteroseismology. Of particular interest to this catalog is the improvement in the determination of stellar radius (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Huber et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017</ref>) which can be one of the most important sources of error when calculating planetary radii. Kepler data was also used to track the evoluation of star-spots created from magnetic activity and thus enabled the measurement of stellar rotation rates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aigrain et al. 2015</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">García et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">McQuillan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Zimmerman et al. 2017</ref>). Studying stars in clusters enabled <ref type="bibr">Mei- bom et al. (2011)</ref> to map out the evolution of stellar rotation as stars age. Kepler also produced light curves of 2876 2 eclipsing binary stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Prša et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kirk et al. 2016</ref>) including unusual binary systems, such as the eccentric, tidally-distorted, Heartbeat stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Welsh et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Thompson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Shporer et al. 2016</ref>) that have opened the doors to understanding the impact of tidal forces on stellar pulsations and evolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hambleton et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fuller et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The wealth of astrophysics, and the size of the Kepler community, is in part due to the rapid release of Kepler data to the NASA Archives: the Exoplanet Archive ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akeson et al. 2013</ref>) and the MAST (Mikulski Archives for Space Telescopes). The Kepler mission released data from every step of the processing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Thompson et al. 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Stumpe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bryson et al. 2010)</ref>, including its planet searches. The results of both the original searches for periodic signals (known as the TCEs or Threshold Crossing Events) and the well-vetted KOIs (Kepler Objects of Interest) were made available for the community. The combined list of Kepler 's planet candidates found from all searches can be found in the cumulative KOI table <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The KOI table we present here is from a single search of the DR25 light curves <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . While the search does not include new observations, it was performed using an improved version of the Kepler Pipeline (version 9.3, Jenkins 2017a). For a high-level summary of the changes to the Kepler Pipeline, see the DR25 data release notes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Thompson et al. 2016b</ref>; Van Cleve et al. 2016a). The Kepler Pipeline has undergone successive improvements since launch as the data characteristics have become better understood.</p><p>The photometric noise at time scales of the transit is what limits Kepler from finding small terrestrial-size planets. Investigations of the noise properties of Kepler exoplanet hosts by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Howell et al. (2016)</ref> showed that those exoplanets around dwarf FGK-type stars with the radii ≤1.2R ⊕ are only found around the brightest, most photometrically quiet stars. As a result, the search for the truly Earth-size planets are limited to a small subset of Kepler 's stellar sample. Analyses by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gilliland et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gilliland et al. ( , 2015</ref> show that the primary source of the observed noise was indeed inherent to the stars, with a smaller contributions coming from imperfections in the instruments and software. Unfortunately, the typical noise level for 12 th magnitude solar-type stars is closer to 30 ppm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gilliland et al. 2015</ref>) than the 20 ppm expected prior to launch </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>, causing</head><p>Kepler to need a longer baseline to find a significant number of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Ultimately, this higher noise level impacts Kepler 's planet yield. And, because different stars have different levels of noise, the transit depth to which the search is sensitive varies across the sample of stars. This bias must be accounted for when calculating occurrence rates, and is explored in-depth for this run of the Kepler Pipeline by the transit injection and recovery studies of <ref type="bibr">Burke &amp; Catanzarite (2017a,b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Christiansen (2017)</ref>.</p><p>To confirm the validity and further characterize identified planet candidates, the Kepler mission benefited from an active, funded, follow-up observing program. This program used ground-based radial velocity measurements to determine the mass of exoplanets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Marcy et al. 2014</ref>) when possible and also ruled out other astrophysical phenomena, like background eclipsing binaries, that can mimic a transit signal. Both funded and unfunded high-resolution imaging studies have covered ≈90% of known KOIs (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Law et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baranec et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Ziegler et al. 2017)</ref> to identify close companions (bound or unbound) that would be included in Kepler 's rather large 3.98 pixels. The extra light from these companions must be accounted for when determining the depth of the transit and the radii of the exoplanet. While the Kepler Pipeline accounts for the stray light from stars in the Kepler Input Catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brown et al. 2011</ref>; and see flux fraction in §2.3.1.2 of the Kepler Archive Manual; <ref type="bibr">Thomp- son et al. 2016a</ref>), the sources identified by these highresolution imaging studies were not included. The resulting DR25 planet catalog also does not include the results of these studies because high resolution imaging is only available for stars with KOIs, and if included, could incorrectly bias occurrence rate measurements. Based on the analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ciardi et al. (2015)</ref>, where they considered the effects of multiplicity, planet radii are underestimated by a factor averaging 1.5 for G dwarfs prior to vetting, or averaging 1.2 for KOIs that have been vetted with high-resolution imaging and Doppler spectroscopy. The effect of unrecognized dilution decreases for planets orbiting the K and M dwarfs, because they have a smaller range of possible stellar companions Even with rigorous vetting and follow-up observations, most planet candidates in the KOI catalogs cannot be directly confirmed as planetary. The stars are too dim and the planets are too small to be able to measure a radial velocity signature for the planet. Statistical methods study the likelihood that the observed transit could be caused by other astrophysical scenarios and have succeeded in validating thousands of Kepler planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Torres et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rowe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Lissauer et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The Q1-Q16 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>) was the first with a long enough baseline to be significantly impacted by another source of false positives, the longperiod false positives created by the instrument itself. In that catalog (and again in this one), the majority of long-period, low SNR TCEs are ascribed to instrumental effects incompletely removed from the data before the TCE search. Kepler has a variety of short timescale (on the order of a day or less), non-Gaussian noise sources including focus changes due to thermal variations, signals imprinted on the data by the detector electronics, noise caused by solar flares, and the pixel sensitivity changing after the impact of a high energy particle (known as a sudden pixel sensitivity drop-out, or SPSD). Because the large number of TCEs associated with these types of errors, and because the catalog was generated to be intentionally inclusive (i.e. high completeness), many of the long-period candidates in the Q1-Q16 KOI catalog are expected to simply be noise. We were faced with a similar problem for the DR25 catalog and spent considerable effort writing software to identify these types of false positives, and for the first time we include an estimate for how often these signals contaminate the catalog.</p><p>The planet candidates found in Kepler data have been used extensively to understand the frequency of different types of planets in the Galaxy. Many studies have shown that small planets (&lt; 4R ⊕ ) in short period orbits are common, with occurrence rates steadily increasing with decreasing radii <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Burke &amp; Seader 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Youdin 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013</ref>, using their own search, confined their analysis to M dwarfs and orbital periods less than 50 d and determined that multi-planet systems are common around these low mass stars. Therefore planets are more common than stars in the Galaxy (due, in part, to the fact that low mass stars are the most common stellar type). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref>, using improved measurements of the stellar properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Petigura et al. 2017a</ref>), looked at small planets with periods of less than 100 d and showed that there is a valley in the occurrence of planets near 1.75R ⊕ . This result improved upon the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Howard et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Lundkvist et al. (2016)</ref> and further verified the evaporation valley predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Owen &amp; Wu (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2013)</ref> for close-in planets.</p><p>Less is known about the occurrence of planets in longer period orbits. Using planet candidates discovered with Kepler , several papers have measured the frequency of small planets in the habitable zone of sunlike stars (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Petigura et al. 2013</ref>) using various methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> used the Q1-Q16 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>) and looked at G and K stars and concluded that 10% (with an allowed range of 1-200%) of solar-type stars host planets with radii and orbital periods within 20% of that of the Earth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> considered various systematic effects and showed that they dominate the uncertainties and concluded that improved measurements of the stellar properties, the detection efficiency of the search, and the reliability of the catalog will have the most impact in narrowing the uncertainties in such studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Design Philosophy of the DR25 catalog</head><p>The DR25 KOI catalog is designed to support rigorous occurrence rate studies. To do that well, it was critical that we not only identify the exoplanet transit signals in the data but also measure the catalog reliability (the fraction of transiting candidates that are not caused by noise), and the completeness of the catalog (the fraction of true transiting planets detected).</p><p>The measurement of the catalog completeness has been split into two parts: the completeness of the TCE list (the transit search performed by the Kepler Pipeline) and the completeness of the KOI catalog (the vetting of the TCEs). The completeness of the Kepler Pipeline and its search for transits has been studied by injecting transit signals into the pixels and examining what fraction are found by the Kepler Pipeline <ref type="bibr">(Christiansen 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Christiansen et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Christiansen et al. , 2013a</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> applied the appropriate detection efficiency contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Christiansen 2015</ref>) to the 50-300 d period planet candidates in the Q1-Q16 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>) in order to measure the occurrence rates of small planets. However, that study was not able to account for those transit signals correctly identified by the Kepler Pipeline but thrown-out by the vetting process. Along with the DR25 KOI catalog, we provide a measure of the completeness of the DR25 vetting process.</p><p>Kepler light curves contain variability that is not due to planet transits or eclipsing binaries. While the reliability of Kepler catalogs against astrophysical false positives is mostly understood (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton et al. 2016</ref>), the reliability against false alarms (a term used in this paper to indicate TCEs caused by intrinsic stellar variability, over-contact binaries, or instrumental noise, i.e., anything that does not look transit-like) has not previously been measured. Instrumental noise, statistical fluctuations, poor detrending, and/or stellar variability can conspire to produce a signal that looks similar to a planet transit. When examining the smallest exoplanets in the longest orbital periods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. (2015)</ref> demonstrated the importance of understanding the reliability of the catalog, showing that the occurrence of small, earth-like-period planets around G dwarf stars changed by a factor of ≈10 depending on the reliability of a few planet candidates. In this catalog we measure the reliability of the reported planet candidates against this instrumental and stellar noise.</p><p>The completeness of the vetting process is measured by vetting thousands of injected transits found by the Kepler Pipeline. Catalog reliability is measured by vetting signals found in scrambled and inverted Kepler light curves and counting the fraction of simulated false alarms that are dispositioned as planet candidates. This desire to vet both the real and simulated TCEs in a reproducible and consistent manner demands an entirely automated method for vetting the TCEs.</p><p>Automated vetting was introduced in the Q1-Q16 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>) with the Centroid Robovetter and was then extended to all aspects of the vetting process for the DR24 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>). Because of this automation, the DR24 catalog was the first with a measure of completeness that extended to all parts of the search, from pixels to planet candidates. Now, with the DR25 KOI catalog and simulated false alarms, we also provide a measure of how effective the vetting techniques are at identifying noise signals and translate that into a measure of the catalog reliability. As a result, the DR25 KOI catalog is the first to explicitly balance the gains in completeness against the loss of reliability, instead of always erring on the side of high completeness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Summary and Outline of the Paper</head><p>The DR25 KOI catalog is a uniformly-vetted list of planet candidates and false positives found by searching the DR25 Kepler light curves and includes a measure of the catalog completeness and reliability. In the brief outline that follows we highlight how the catalog was assembled, how we measure the completeness and reliability, and discuss those aspects of the process that are different from the DR24 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In §2.1 we describe the observed TCEs (obsTCEs) which are the periodic signals found in the actual Kepler light curves. For reference, we also compare them to the DR24 TCEs. To create the simulated data sets necessary to measure the vetting completeness and the catalog reliability, we ran the Kepler Pipeline on light curves that either contained injected transits, were inverted, or were scrambled. This creates injTCEs, invTCEs, and scrTCEs, respectively (see §2.3).</p><p>We then created and tuned a Robovetter to vet all the different sets of TCEs. §3 describes the metrics and the logic used to disposition TCEs into PCs and FPs. Because the DR25 obsTCE population was significantly different than the DR24 obsTCEs, we developed new metrics to separate the PCs from the FPs (see Appendix A for the details on how each metric operates.) Several new metrics examine the individual transits for evidence of instrumental noise (see §A.3.7.) As in the DR24 KOI catalog, we group FPs into four categories ( §4) and provide minor false positive flags (Appendix B) to indicate why the Robovetter decided to pass or fail a TCE. New to this catalog is the addition of a disposition score ( §3.2) that gives users a measure of the Robovetter's confidence in each disposition.</p><p>Unlike previous catalogs, for the DR25 KOI catalog the choice of planet candidate versus false positive is no longer based on the philosophy of "innocent until proven guilty". We accept certain amounts of collateral damage (i.e., exoplanets dispositioned as FP) in order to achieve a catalog that is uniformly vetted and has acceptable levels of both completeness and reliability, especially for the long period and low signal-to-noise PCs. In §5 we discuss how we tuned the Robovetter using the simulated TCEs as populations of true planet candidates and true false alarms. We provide the Robovetter source code and all the Robovetter metrics for all of the sets of TCEs (obsTCEs, injTCEs, invTCEs, and scrTCEs) to enable users to create a catalog tuned for other regions of parameter space if their scientific goals require it.</p><p>We assemble the catalog ( §6) by federating to previously known KOIs before creating new KOIs. Then to provide planet parameters, each KOI is fit with a transit model which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to provide error estimates for each fitted parameter ( §6.3). In §7 we summarize the catalog and discuss the performance of the vetting using the injTCE, invTCE, and scrTCE sets. We show that both decrease significantly with decreasing number of transits and decreasing signal-to-noise. We then discuss how one may use the disposition scores to identify the highest quality candidates, especially at long periods ( §7.3.4.) We conclude that not all declared planet candidates in our catalog are actually astrophysical transits, but we can measure what fraction are caused by stellar and instrumental noise. Because of the interest in terrestrial, temperate planets, we examine the high quality, small candidates in the habitable zone in §7.5. Finally, in §8 we give an overview of what must be considered when using this catalog to measure accurate exoplanet occurrence rates, including what information is available in other Kepler products to do this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE Q1-Q17 DR25 TCES 2.1. Observed TCEs</head><p>As with the previous three <ref type="bibr">Kepler KOI catalogs (Coughlin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. 2015a</ref>), the population of events that were used to create KOIs and planet candidates are known as obsTCEs. These are periodic reductions of flux in the light curve that were found by the TPS module and evaluated by the DV module of the Kepler Pipeline (Jenkins 2017b) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . The DR25 obsTCEs were created by running the SOC 9.3 version of the Kepler Pipeline on the DR25, Q1-Q17 Kepler time-series. For a thorough discussion of the DR25 TCEs and on the pipeline's search see <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Twicken et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>The DR25 obsTCEs, their ephemerides, and the metrics calculated by the pipeline are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akeson et al. 2013</ref>). In this paper we endeavor to disposition these signals into planet candidates and false positives. Because the obsTCEs act as the input to our catalog, we first describe some of their properties as a whole and reflect on how they are different from the obsTCE populations found with previous searches.</p><p>We have plotted the distribution of the 32,534 obsTCEs in terms of period in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Notice that there is an excessive number of short and long period obsTCEs compared to the number of expected transiting planets. Not shown, but worth noting is that the number of obsTCEs increases with decreasing MES.</p><p>As with previous catalogs, the short period (&lt; 10 d) excess is dominated by true variability of stars due to both intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., spots or pulsations) and contact/near-contact eclipsing binaries. The long period excess is dominated by instrumental noise. For example, a decrease in flux following a cosmic ray hit (known as an SPSD; Van Cleve et al. 2016a), can match up with other decrements in flux to produce a TCE.</p><p>Also, image artifacts known as rolling-bands are very strong on some channels (see §6.7 of Van Cleve &amp; Caldwell 2016) and since the spacecraft rolls approximately every 90 d, causing a star to move on/off a Kepler detector with significant rolling band noise, these variations can easily line up to produce TCEs at Kepler 's heliocentric orbital period (≈372 days, 2.57 in log-space). This is the reason for the largest spike in the obsTCE population seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The narrow spike at 459 days (2.66 in log-space) in the DR24 obsTCE distribution is caused by edge-effects near three equally spaced data gaps in the DR24 data processing. The short period spikes in the distribution of both the DR25 and DR24 obsTCEs is caused by contamination by bright variable stars (see §A. <ref type="bibr">6 and Coughlin et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Generally, the excess of long period TCEs is significantly larger than it was in the DR24 TCE catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seader et al. 2015</ref>), also seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Most likely, this is because DR24 implemented an aggressive veto known as the bootstrap metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seader et al. 2015</ref>). For DR25 this metric was calculated, but was not used as a veto. Also, other vetoes were made less strict causing more TCEs across all periods to be created.</p><p>To summarize, for DR25 the number of false signals among the obsTCEs is dramatically larger than in any previous catalog. This was done on purpose in order to increase the Pipeline completeness by allow more transiting exoplanets to be made into obsTCEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Rogue TCEs</head><p>The DR25 TCE table at the NASA Exoplanet Archive contains 32,534 obsTCEs and 1498 rogue TCEs 6 for a total of 34,032. The rogue TCEs are three-transit TCEs that were only created because of a bug in the TPS module of the Kepler Pipeline. This bug prevented certain three-transit events from being vetoed and as a result they were returned as TCEs. This bug was not in place when characterizing the Pipeline using flux-level transit injection (see <ref type="bibr">Burke &amp; Catanzarite 2017b,a)</ref> and because the primary purpose of this catalog is to be able to accurately calculate occurrence rates, we do not use the rogue TCEs in the creation and analysis of the DR25 KOI catalog. Also note that all of the TCE populations (observed, injection, inversion, and scrambling, see the next section) had rogue TCEs that were removed prior to analysis. The creation and analysis of this KOI catalog only rely on the non-rogue TCEs. Although they are not analyzed in this study we encourage the community to examine the designated rogue TCEs as the list does contain some of the longest period events detected by Kepler.  DR25 obsTCE DR24 obsTCE <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Histogram of the period in days of the DR25 obsTCEs (black) using uniform bin space in the base ten logarithm of the period. The DR24 catalog obsTCEs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Seader et al. 2015</ref>) are shown in green for comparison. The number of long-period TCEs is much larger for DR25 and includes a large spike in the number of TCEs at the orbital period of the spacecraft (372 days). The long and short period spikes for both distributions are discussed in §2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Simulated TCEs</head><p>In order to measure the performance of the Robovetter and the Kepler Pipeline, we created simulated transits, simulated false positives, and simulated false alarms. The simulated transits are created by injecting transit signals into the pixels of the original data. The simulated false positives were created by injecting eclipsing binary signals and positionally off-target transit signals into the pixels of the original data (see Coughlin 2017b and Christiansen 2017 for more information). The simulated false alarms were created in two separate ways: by inverting the light curves, and by scrambling the sequence of cadences in the time series. The TCEs that resulted from these simulated data are available at the Exoplanet Archive on the Kepler simulated data page. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">True Transits -Injection</head><p>We empirically measure the completeness of the Kepler Pipeline and the subsequent vetting by injecting a suite of simulated transiting planet signals into the calibrated pixel data and observing their recovery, as was done for previous versions of the Kepler Pipeline ( <ref type="bibr">Chris- tiansen et al. 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Christiansen 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Christiansen et al. 2016</ref>). The full analysis of the DR25 injections are described in detail in <ref type="bibr">Christiansen (2017)</ref>. In order to understand the completeness of the Robovetter, we use the on-target injections (Group 1 in Christiansen 2017); we briefly describe their properties here. For each of the 146,294 targets, we generate a model transit signal using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> formulation, with parameters drawn from the following uniform distributions: orbital periods from 0.5-500 days (0.5-100 days for M dwarf targets), planet radii from 0.25-7 R ⊕ (0.25-4 R ⊕ for M dwarf targets), and impact parameters from 0-1. After some re-distribution in planet radius to ensure sufficient coverage where the Kepler Pipeline is fully incomplete (0% recovery) to fully complete (100% recovery), 50% of the injections have planet radii below 2 R ⊕ and 90% below 40 R ⊕ . The signals are injected into the calibrated pixels, and then processed through the remaining components of the Kepler Pipeline in an identical fashion to the original data. Any detected signals are subjected to the same scrutiny by the Pipeline and the Robovetter as the original data. By measuring the fraction of injections that were successfully recovered by the Pipeline and called a PC by the Robovetter with any given set of parameters (e.g., orbital period and planet radius), we can then correct the number of candidates found with those parameters to the number that are truly present in the data. While the observed population of true transiting planets is heavily concentrated towards short pe-riods, we chose the 0.5-500 day uniform period distribution of injections because more long-period, low signalto-noise transits are both not recovered and not vetted correctly -injecting more of these hard-to-find, longperiod planets ensures that we can measure the Pipeline and Robovetter completeness. In this paper we use the set of on-target, injected planets that were recovered by the Kepler Pipeline (the injTCEs, whose period distribution is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>) to measure the performance of the Robovetter. Accurate measurement of the Robovetter performance is limited to those types of transits injected and recovered.</p><p>It is worth noting that the injections do not completely emulate all astrophysical variations produced by a planet transiting a star. For instance, the injected model includes limb-darkening, but not the occultation of stellar pulsations or granulation, which has been shown to cause a small, but non-negligible, error source on measured transit depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chiavassa et al. 2017</ref>) for high signal-to-noise transits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">False Alarms -Inverted and Scrambled</head><p>To create realistic false alarms that have noise properties similar to our obsTCEs, we inverted the light curves (i.e., multiplied the normalized, zero-mean flux values by negative one) before searching for transit signals. Because the pipeline is only looking for transit-like (negative) dips in the light curve, the true exoplanet transits should no longer be found. However, quasi-sinusoidal signals due to instrumental noise, contact and nearcontact binaries, and stellar variability can still create detections. In order for inversion to exactly reproduce the false alarm population, the false alarms would need to be perfectly symmetric (in shape and frequency) under flux inversion, which is not true. For example, stellar oscillations and star-spots are not sine waves and SPSDs will not appear the same under inversion. However, the rolling band noise that is significant on many of Kepler 's channels is mostly symmetric. The period distribution of these invTCEs is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. The distribution qualitatively emulates those seen in the obsTCEs; however there are only ∼60% as many. This is because the population does not include the exoplanets nor the eclipsing binaries, but it is also because many of the sources of false alarms are not symmetric under inversion. The one-year spike is clearly seen, but is not as large as we might expect, likely because the broad longperiod hump present in the DR25 obsTCE distribution is mostly missing from the invTCE distribution. We explore the similarity of the invTCEs to obsTCEs in more detail in §4.2.</p><p>Another method to create false alarms is to scramble the order of the data. The requirement is to scramble the data enough to lose the coherency of the binary stars and exoplanet transits, but to keep the coherency of the instrumental and stellar noise that plagues the Kepler data set. Our approach was to scramble the data in coherent chunks of one year. The fourth year of data (Q13-Q16) was moved to the start of the light curve, followed by the third year (Q9-Q12), then the second (Q5-Q8), and finally the first (Q1-Q4). Q17 remained at the end. Within each year, the order of the data did not change. Notice that in this configuration each quarter remains in the correct Kepler season preserving the yearly artifacts produced by the spacecraft.</p><p>Two additional scrambling runs of the data, with different scrambling orders than described above, were performed and run through the Kepler pipeline and Robovetter, but are not discussed in this paper, as they were produced after the analysis for this paper was complete. These runs could be very useful in improving the reliability measurements of the DR25 catalog -see Coughlin 2017b for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Cleaning Inversion and Scrambling</head><p>As will be described in §4.1, we want to use the invTCE and scrTCE sets to measure the reliability of the DR25 catalog against instrumental and stellar noise. In order to do that well, we need to remove signals found in these sets that are not typical of those in our obsTCE set. For inversion, there are astrophysical events that look similar to an inverted eclipse, for example the selflensing binary star, KOI 3278.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kruse &amp; Agol 2014)</ref>, and Heartbeat binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Thompson et al. 2012</ref>). With the assistance of published systems and early runs of the Robovetter, we identified any invTCE that could be one of these types of astrophysical events; 54 systems were identified in total. Also, the shoulders of inverted eclipsing binary stars and high signal-to-noise KOIs are found by the Pipeline, but are not the type of false alarm we were trying to reproduce, since they have no corresponding false alarm in the original, un-inverted light curves. We remove any invTCEs that were found on stars that had 1) one of the identified astrophysical events, 2) a detached eclipsing binary listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kirk et al. (2016)</ref> with morphology values larger than 0.6, or 3) a known KOI. After cleaning, we are left with 14953 invTCEs; their distribution is plotted in the top of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>For the scrambled data, we do not have to worry about the astrophysical events that emulate inverted transits, but we do have to worry about triggering on true transits that have been rearranged to line up with noise. For this reason we remove from the scrTCE population all that were found on a star with a known eclipsing binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kirk et al. 2016)</ref>, or on an identified KOI. The result is 13782 scrTCEs; their distribution is plotted in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. This will not remove all possible sources of astrophysical transits. Systems with only two transits (which would not be made into KOIs), or systems with single transits from several orbiting bodies would not be identified in this way. For example, KIC 3542116 was identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rappaport et al. (2017)</ref>  Histogram of the period in days of the cleaned invTCEs (top, red), the cleaned scrTCEs (top, green), and injTCEs (bottom, blue) in uniform, base-ten logarithmic spacing. The middle plot shows the union of the invTCEs and the scrTCEs in magenta. The DR25 obsTCEs are shown for comparison on the top two figures in black. At shorter periods (&lt; 30 days) in the top figure, the difference between the simulated false alarm sets and the observed data represents the number of transit-like KOIs; at longer periods we primarily expect false alarms. Notice that the invTCEs do a better job of reproducing the one-year spike, but the scrTCEs better reproduce the long-period hump. Because the injTCEs are dominated by long-period events (significantly more long-period events were injected), we are better able to measure the Robovetter completeness for long-period planets than short-period planets. as a star with possible exocomets, and it is a scrTCE dispositioned as an FP. We expect the effect of not removing these unusual events to be negligible on our reliability measurements relative to other systematic differences between the obsTCEs and the scrTCEs. After cleaning the invTCEs and scrTCEs, the number of scrTCEs at periods longer than 200 d closely matches the size and shape of the obsTCE distribution, except for the one-year spike. The one-year spike is well represented by the invTCEs. The distribution of the combined invTCE and scrTCE data sets, as shown in the middle plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, qualitatively matches the relative frequency of false alarms present in the DR25 obsTCE population. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1 and 2</ref> lists those invTCEs and scrTCEs that we used when calculating the false alarm effectiveness and false alarm reliability of the PCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">TCE Transit Fits</head><p>The creation of this KOI catalog depends on four different transit fits: 1) the original DV transit fits, 2) the trapezoidal fits performed on the ALT Garcia (2010) detrended light curves, 3) the supplemental DV transit fits, and 4) the MCMC fits (see §6.3). The Kepler Pipeline fits each TCE with a <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> transit model using Claret (2000) limb darkening parameters. After the transit searches were performed for the observed, injected, scrambled, and inverted TCEs, we discovered that the transit fit portion of DV was seeded with a high impact parameter model that caused the final fits to be biased towards large values, causing the planet radii to be systematically too large (for further information see <ref type="bibr">Christiansen 2017 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Coughlin 2017b)</ref>.</p><p>Since a consistent set of reliable transit fits are required for all TCEs, we refit the transits. The same DV transit fitting code was corrected for the bug and seeded with the Kepler identification number, period, epoch, and MES of the original detection. These "supplemental" DV fits do not have the same impact parameter bias as the original. Sometimes the DV fitter fails to converge and in these cases we were not able to obtain a supplemental DV transit fit, causing us to fall back on the original DV fit. Also, at times the epoch wanders too far from the original detection; in these cases we do not consider it to be a successful fit and again fall back on the original fit. Because the bug in the transit fits was only discovered after all of the metrics for the Robovetter were run, the original DV and trapezoidal fits were used to disposition all of the sets of TCEs. These are the same fits that are available for the obsTCEs in the DR25 TCE table at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Nearly all of the Robovetter metrics are agnostic to the parameters of the fit, and so the supplemental DV fits would only change a few of the Robovetter decisions, namely the V-shape Metric, as it relies on the radius ratio and impact parameter (see §A.4.3), and the Model-Shift metrics since that test utilizes the transit model fit (see A.3.4). The impact on all the Model-Shift Tests is negligible since they only utilize the general shape of the transit fit, and not the fitted parameters themselves. Note, if the supplemental fits were used for either test, we would have chosen different thresholds for the metrics so as to obtain a very similar catalog. While the Robovetter itself runs in a few minutes, several of the metrics used by the Robovetter (see Appendix A) require weeks to compute, so we chose not to update the metrics in order to achieve a small improvement in the consistency of our products. For all sets of TCEs, the original DV fits are listed in the Robovetter input files 8 . The supplemental fits are used to understand the completeness and reliability of the catalog as a function of fitted parameters (such as planet radii or insolation flux). For all sets of TCEs, the supplemental DV fits are available as part of the Robovetter results tables linked from the TCE documentation page <ref type="bibr">9</ref> for the obsTCEs and from the simulated data page 10 (see Christiansen 2017; Coughlin 2017b) for the injected, inverted, and scrambled TCEs.</p><p>The MCMC fits are only provided for the KOI population and are available in the DR25 KOI table <ref type="bibr">11</ref> at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The MCMC fits have no consistent offset from the supplemental DV fits. To show this, we plot the planet radii derived from the two types of fits for the planet candidates in DR25 and show the distribution of fractional change in planet radii; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. The median value of the fractional change is 0.7% with a standard deviation of 18%. While individual systems disagree, there is no offset in planet radii between the two populations. The supplemental DV fitted radii and MCMC fitted radii agree within 1-sigma of the combined error bar (i.e., the square-root of the sum of the squared errors) for 78% of the KOIs and 93.4% of PCs (only 1.8% of PC's radii differ by more than 3-sigma a non-linear ephemeris in its model when appropriate (i.e., to account for transit-timing variations). Some of the derived parameters from transit fits (e.g., planetary radius and insolation flux) of the TCEs and KOIs rely critically on the accuracy of the stellar properties (e.g., radii, mass, and temperature). For all transit fits used to create this catalog we use the DR25 Q1-Q17 stellar table provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref>, which is based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dotter et al. 2008</ref>). The best-available observational data for each star is used to determine the stellar parameters; e.g., asteroseismic or high-resolution spectroscopic data, when available, is used instead of broad-band photometric measurements. Typical uncertainties in this stellar catalog are ≈27% in radius, ≈17% in mass, and ≈51% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs.</p><p>After completion of the DR25 catalog an error was discovered: the metallicities of 780 KOIs were assigned a fixed erroneous value ([Fe/H] = 0.15 dex). These targets can be identified by selecting those that have the metallicity provenance column set to "SPE90". Since radii are fairly insensitive to metallicity and the average metallicity of Kepler stars is close to solar, the impact of this error on stellar radii is typically less than 10% and does not significantly change the conclusions in this paper. Corrected stellar properties for these stars will be provided in an upcoming erratum to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref>. The KOI catalog vetting and fits rely exclusively on the original DR25 stellar catalog information. Because the stellar parameters will continue to be updated (with data from missions such as Gaia, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016b,a) we perform our vetting and analysis independent of stellar properties where possible and provide the fitted information relative to the stellar properties in the KOI table. A notable exception is the limb darkening values; precise transit models require limb darkening coefficients that depends on the stellar temperature and gravity. However, limb-darkening coefficients are fairly insensitive to the most uncertain stellar parameters in the stellar properties catalog (e.g., surface gravity; Claret 2000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE ROBOVETTER: VETTING METHODS AND METRICS</head><p>The dispositioning of the TCEs as PC and FP is entirely automated and is performed by the Robovetter 12 . This code uses a variety of metrics to evaluate and disposition the TCEs.</p><p>Because the TCE population changed significantly between DR24 and DR25 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), the Robovetter had to be improved in order to obtain acceptable performance. Also, because we now have simulated false alarms (invTCEs and scrTCEs) and true transits (injTCEs), the Robovetter could be tuned to keep the most injTCEs and remove the most invTCEs and scrTCEs. This is a significant change from previous KOI catalogs that prioritized completeness above all else. In order to sufficiently remove the long period excess of false alarms, this Robovetter introduces new metrics that evaluate individual transits (in addition to the phase-folded transits), expanding the work that the code Marshall ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2016</ref>) performed for the DR24 KOI catalog.</p><p>Because most of the Robovetter tests and metrics changed between DR24 and DR25, we fully describe all of the metrics. In this section we summarize the important aspects of the Robovetter logic and only provide a list of each test's purpose. The details of these metrics, and more details on the Robovetter logic, can be found in Appendix A. We close this section by explaining the creation of the "disposition score", a number which conveys the confidence in the Robovetter's disposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Summary of the Robovetter</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> we present a flowchart that outlines our robotic vetting procedure. Each TCE is subjected to a series of "yes" or "no" questions (represented by diamonds) that either disposition it into one or more of the four FP categories, or else disposition it as a PC. Behind each question is a series of more specific questions, each answered by quantitative tests.</p><p>First, if the TCE under investigation is not the first in the system, the Robovetter checks if the TCE corresponds to a secondary eclipse associated with an already examined TCE in that system. If not, the Robovetter then checks if the TCE is transit-like. If it is transitlike, the Robovetter then looks for the presence of a secondary eclipse. In parallel, the Robovetter looks for evidence of a centroid offset, as well as an ephemeris match to other TCEs and variable stars in the Kepler field.</p><p>Similar to previous KOI catalogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. 2015a</ref>), the Robovetter assigns FP TCEs to one or more of the following false positive categories:</p><p>• Not Transit-Like (NT): a TCE whose light curve is not consistent with that of a transiting planet or eclipsing binary. These TCEs are usually caused by instrumental artifacts or non-eclipsing variable stars. If the Robovetter worked perfectly, all false alarms, as we have defined them in this paper, would be marked as FPs with only this Not Transit-Like flag set.</p><p>• Stellar Eclipse (SS): a TCE that is observed to have a significant secondary event, v-shaped transit profile, or out-of-eclipse variability that indicates the transit-like event is very likely caused by an eclipsing binary. Self-luminous, hot Jupiters with a visible secondary eclipse are also in this category, but are still given a disposition of PC. In previous KOI catalogs this flag was known as Significant Secondary.</p><p>• Centroid Offset (CO): a TCE whose signal is observed to originate from a source other than the target star, based on examination of the pixel-level data.</p><p>• Ephemeris Match Indicates Contamination (EC): a TCE that has the same period and epoch as another object, and is not the true source of the signal given the relative magnitudes, locations, and signal amplitudes of the two objects. See Coughlin (2014).</p><p>The specific tests that caused the TCE to fail are specified by minor flags. These flags are described in Appendix B and are available for all FPs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> gives a summary of the specific tests run by the Robovetter when evaluating a TCE. The table lists the false positive category (NT, SS, CO or EC) of the test and also which minor flags are set by that test. Note that there are several informative minor flags, which are listed in Appendix B, but are not listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> because they do not change the disposition of a TCE. Also, Appendix B tabulates how often each minor flag was set to help understand the frequency of each type of FP.</p><p>New to this Robovetter are several tests that look at individual transits. The tests are named after the code that calculates the relevant metric and are called: Rubble, Marshall, Chases, Skye, Zuma, and Tracker. Each metric only identifies which transits can be considered "bad", or not sufficiently transit-like. The Robovetter only fails the TCE if the number of remaining good transits is less than three, or if the recalculated MES, using only the good transits, drops below 7.1.</p><p>Another noteworthy update to the Robovetter in DR25 is the introduction of the v-shape metric, originally introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Batalha et al. (2013)</ref>. The intent is to remove likely eclipsing binaries which do not show significant secondary eclipses by looking at the shape and depth of the transit (see §A.4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Disposition Scores</head><p>We introduce a new feature to this catalog called the Disposition Score. Essentially the disposition score is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence Note-More details about all of these tests and how they are used by the Robovetter can be found in the sections listed in the second column. P C These tests override previous tests and will cause the TCE to become a planet candidate.</p><p>in a disposition provided by the Robovetter. A higher value indicates more confidence that a TCE is a PC, regardless of the disposition it was given. This feature allows one to select the highest quality PCs by ranking KOIs via the disposition score, for both use in selecting samples for occurrence rate calculations and prioritizing individual objects for follow-up. We stress that the disposition score does not map directly to a probability that the signal is a planet. However, in §7.3.4 we discuss how the disposition score can be used to adjust the reliability of a sample. The disposition score was calculated by wrapping the Robovetter in a Monte Carlo routine. In each Monte Carlo iteration, for each TCE, new values are chosen for most of the Robovetter input metrics by drawing from an asymmetric Gaussian distribution 13 centered on the nominal value. The Robovetter then dispositions each TCE given the new values for its metrics. The disposition score is simply the fraction of Monte Carlo iterations that result in a disposition of PC. (We used 10,000 iterations for the results in this catalog.) For example, if a TCE that is initially dispositioned as a PC has several metrics that are just barely on the passing side of their Robovetter thresholds, in many iterations at least one will be perturbed across the threshold. As a result, many of the iterations will produce a false positive and the TCE will be dispositioned as a PC with a low score. Similarly, if a TCE only fails due to a single metric that was barely on the failing side of a threshold, the score may be near 0.5, indicating that it was deemed a PC in half of the iterations. Since a TCE is deemed a FP even if only one metric fails, nearly all FPs have scores less than 0.5, with most very close to 0.0. PCs have a wider distribution of scores from 0.0 to 1.0 depending on how many of their metrics fall near to the various Robovetter thresholds.</p><p>To compute the asymmetric Gaussian distribution for each metric, we examined the metric distributions for the injected on-target planet population on FGK dwarf targets. In a 20 by 20 grid in linear period space (ranging from 0.5 to 500 d) and logarithmic MES space (ranging from 7.1 to 100), we calculated the median absolute deviation (MAD) for those values greater than the median value and separately for those values less than the median value. We chose to use MAD because it is robust to outliers. MES and period were chosen as they are fundamental properties of a TCE that well characterize each metric's variation. The MAD values were then multiplied by a conversion factor of 1.4826 to put the variability on the same scale as a Gaussian standard deviation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hampel 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ruppert 2010)</ref>. A two-dimensional power-law was then fitted to the 20 by 20 grid of stan-dard deviation values, separately for the greater-thanmedian and less-than-median directions. With this analytical approximation for a given metric, an asymmetric Gaussian distribution can be generated for each metric for any TCE given its MES and period.</p><p>An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> for the LPP metric (Locality Preserving Projections, see §A.3.1) using the DV detrending. The top-left plot shows the LPP values of all on-target injected planets on FGK dwarf targets as a function of period, and the top-right shows them as a function of MES. The middle-left plot shows the measured positive 1σ deviation (in the same units as the LPP metric) as a function of MES and period, and the middle-right plot shows the resulting best-fit model. The bottom plots show the same thing but for the negative 1σ deviation. As can be seen, the scatter in the LPP metric has a weak period dependence, but a strong MES dependence, due to the fact it is easier to measure the overall shape of the light curve (LPP's goal) with higher MES (signal-to-noise).</p><p>Most, but not all, of the Robovetter metrics were amenable to this approach. Specifically, the list of metrics that were perturbed in the manner above to generate the score values were: LPP (both DV and ALT), all the Model-shift metrics (MS 1 , MS 2 , MS 3 , and MS Secondary, both DV and ALT), TCE Chases, max-SESto-MES, the two odd/even metrics (both DV and ALT), Ghost Diagnostic, and the recomputed MES using only good transits left after the individual transit metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CALCULATING COMPLETENESS AND RELIABILITY</head><p>We use the injTCE, scrTCE, and invTCE data sets to determine the performance of the Robovetter and to measure the completeness and the reliability of the catalog. As a reminder, the reliability we are attempting to measure is only the reliability of the catalog against false alarms and does not address the astrophysical reliability (see §8). As discussed in §2.1, the long-period obsTCEs are dominated by false alarms and so this measurement is crucial to understand the reliability of some of the most interesting candidates in our catalog.</p><p>Robovetter completeness, C, is the fraction of injected transits detected by the Kepler Pipeline that are passed by the Robovetter as PCs. As long as the injTCEs are representative of the observed PCs, completeness tells us what fraction of the true planets are missing from the final catalog. Completeness is calculated by dividing the number of on-target injTCEs that are dispositioned as PCs (N PCinj ) by the total number of injTCEs (N inj ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C ≈ N PCinj N inj (1)</formula><p>If the parameter space under consideration becomes too large and there are gradients in the actual completeness, differences between the injTCEand the obsTCE populations will prevent the completeness measured with Equa- tion 1 from matching the actual Robovetter completeness. For example, there are more long-period injTCEs than short-period ones, which is not representative of the observed PCs, the true fraction of candidates correctly dispositioned by the Robovetter is not accurately represented by binning over all periods. With this caveat in mind, we use C in this paper to indicate the value we can measure, as shown in Equation 1. The candidate catalog reliability, R, is defined as the ratio of the number of PCs which are truly exoplanets (T PC obs ) to the total number of PCs (N PC obs ) from the obsTCE data set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R = T PC obs N PC obs (2)</formula><p>Calculating the reliability for a portion of the candidate catalog is not straight forward because we do not know which PCs are the true transiting exoplanets and cannot directly determine T PC obs . Instead, we use the simulated false alarm data sets to understand how often false alarms sneak past the Robovetter and contaminate our final catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Reliability Derivation</head><p>To assess the catalog reliability against false alarms, we will assume that the scrTCEs and invTCEs are similar (in frequency and type) to the obsTCEs. One way to calculate the reliability of the catalog from our false alarm sets is to first calculate how often the Robovetter correctly identifies false alarms as FPs, a value we call effectiveness (E). Then, given the number of FPs we identify in the obsTCE set, we determine the reliability of the catalog against the type of false alarms present in the simulated sets (invTCEs and scrTCEs). This method assumes the relative frequency of the different types of false alarms is well emulated by the simulated data sets, but does not require the total number of false alarms to be well emulated.</p><p>Robovetter effectiveness (E) is defined as the fraction of FPs correctly identified as FPs in the obsTCE data set,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E ≡ N FP obs T FP obs (3)</formula><p>where T FP obs is the number of identified FPs which are truly FPs and N FP obs is the total number of measured FPs. Notice we are using N to indicate the measured number, and T to indicate the "True" number. If the simulated (sim) false alarm TCEs accurately reflect the obsTCE false alarms, E can be estimated as the number of simulated false alarm TCEs dispositioned as FPs (N FPsim ) divided by the number of simulated TCEs (N sim ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E ≈ N FPsim N sim (4)</formula><p>For our analysis of the DR25 catalog, we primarily use the union of the invTCEs and the scrTCEs as the population of simulated false alarms when calculating E, see §7.3.</p><p>Recall that the Robovetter makes a binary decision, and TCEs are either PCs or FPs. For this derivation we do not take into consideration the reason the Robovetter calls a TCE an FP (i.e., some false alarms fail because the Robovetter indicates there is a stellar eclipse or centroid offset). For most of parameter space, an overwhelming fraction of FPs are false alarms in the obsTCE data set. Future studies will look into separating out the effectiveness for different types of FPs using the set of injected astrophysical FPs (see §2.3).</p><p>At this point we drop the obs and sim designations in subsequent equations, as the simulated false alarm quantities are all used to calculate E. The N values shown below refer entirely to the number of PCs or FPs in the obsTCE set so that N = N PC + N FP = T PC + T FP . We rewrite the definition for reliability (Eq. 2) in terms of the number of true false alarms in obsTCE,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T FP , R ≡ T PC N PC = 1+ T PC − N PC N PC = 1+ N − T FP − N PC N PC (5)</formula><p>When we substitute N FP = N − N PC in Equation 5 we get another useful way to think about reliability, as one minus the number of unidentified FPs relative to the number of candidates,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R = 1 − T FP − N FP N PC (6)</formula><p>However, the true number of false alarms in the obsTCE data set, T FP , is not known. Using the effectiveness value (Equation 4) and combining it with our definition for effectiveness (Equation 3) we get,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T F P = N FP E<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and substituting into equation 6 we get,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R = 1 − N FP N PC 1 − E E (8)</formula><p>which relies on the approximation of E from Equation 4 and is thus a measure of the catalog reliability using all measurable quantities. This method to calculate reliability depends sensitively on the measured effectiveness which relies on how well the set of known false alarms match the false alarms in the obsTCE data set. For example, a negative reliability can result if the measured effectiveness is lower than the true value. In these cases, it implies that there should be more PCs than exist, i.e., the number of unidentified false alarms is smaller than the number of remaining PCs to draw from.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Similarity of the Simulated False Alarms</head><p>In order to use the scrTCE and invTCE sets to determine the reliability of our catalog we must assume that the properties of these simulated false alarms are similar to those of the false alarms in the obsTCE set. Specifically, these simulated data should mimic the not transit-like obsTCEs, e.g., FPs created by instrumental noise and stellar spots. For instance, our assumptions break down if all of the simulated false alarms were long-duration rolling-band FPs, but only a small fraction of the observed FPs were caused by this mechanism. Stated another way, the method we use to measure reliability, hinges on the assumption that for a certain parameter space the fraction of a particular type of FP TCEs is the same between the simulated and observed data sets. This is the reason we removed the TCEs caused by KOIs and eclipsing binaries in the simulated data sets (see §2.3.3). Inverted eclipsing binaries and transits are not the type of FP found in the obsTCE data set. Since the Robovetter is very good at eliminating inverted transits, if they were included, we would have an inflated value for the effectiveness, and thus incorrectly measure a higher reliability. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> demonstrates that the number of TCEs from inversion and scrambling individually is smaller than the number of obsTCEs. At periods less than ≈100 days this difference is dominated by the lack of planets and eclipsing binaries in the simulated false alarm data sets. At longer periods, where the TCEs appear to be dominated by false alarms, this difference is dominated by the cleaning ( §2.3.3). Effectively, we search a significantly smaller number of stars for instances of false alarms. The deficit is also caused by the fact that all types of false alarms are not accounted for in these simulations. For instance, the invTCE set will not reproduce false alarms caused by sudden dropouts in pixel sensitivity caused by cosmic rays (i.e., SPSDs). The scrTCE set will not reproduce the image artifacts from rolling band because the artifacts are not as likely to line-up at exactly one Kepler -year. However, despite these complications, the period distribution of false alarms in these simulated data sets basically resembles the same period distribution as the obsTCE FP population once the two simulated data sets are combined. And since reliability is calculated using the fraction of false alarms that are identified (effectiveness), the overabundance that results from combining the sets is not a problem.</p><p>Another way to judge how well the simulated data sets match the type of FP in the obsTCEs is to look at some of the Robovetter metrics. Each metric measures some aspect of the TCEs. For example, the LPP Metric measures whether the folded and binned light curves are transit shaped, and Skye measures whether the individual transits are likely due to rolling band noise. If the simulated TCEs can be used to measure reliability in the way described above, then the fraction of false alarms in any period bin caused by any particular metric should match between the two sets. In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> we show that this is basically true for both invTCEs and scrTCEs, especially for periods longer than 100 days or MES less than 15. Keep in mind that more than one metric can fail any particular TCE, so the sum of the fractions across all metrics will be greater than one. The deviations between TCE sets is as large as 40% for certain period ranges and such differences may cause systematic errors in our measurements of reliability. But, since the types of FPs overlap, it is not clear how to propagate this information into a formal systematic error bar on the reliability.</p><p>For our discussion of the reliability estimate, we are cautiously satisfied with this basic agreement. Given that neither of the two sets perform better across all regions of parameter space, and since having more simulated false alarms improves the precision on effectiveness, we have calculated the catalog reliability using a union of the scrTCE and invTCE sets after they have been cleaned as described in §2.3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">TUNING THE ROBOVETTER FOR HIGH COMPLETENESS AND RELIABILITY</head><p>As described in the previous section, the Robovetter makes decisions regarding which TCEs are FPs and PCs based on a collection of metrics and thresholds. For each metric we apply a threshold and if the TCE's metrics' values lies above (or below, depending on the metric) the threshold then the TCE is called a FP. Ideally the Robovetter thresholds would be tuned so that no true PCs are lost and all of the known FPs are removed; however, this is not a realistic goal. Instead we sacrifice a few injTCEs in order to improve our measured reliability.</p><p>How to set these thresholds is not obvious and the best value can vary depending on which population of planets you are studying. We used automated methods to search for those thresholds that passed the most injTCEs and failed the most invTCEs and scrTCEs. However, we only used the thresholds found from this automated optimization to inform how to choose the final set of thresholds. This is because the simulated TCEs do not entirely emulate the observed data and many of the metrics have a period and MES dependence. For example, the injections were heavily weighted towards long periods and low MES so our automated method sacrificed many of the short period candidates in order to keep more of the long period injTCEs. Others may wish to explore similar methods to optimize the thresholds and so we explain our efforts to do this below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Setting Metric Thresholds Through Optimization</head><p>For the first step in Robovetter tuning, we perform an optimization that finds the metric thresholds that OPS NTL SCR INV <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The fraction of not-transit-like FPs failed by a particular Robovetter metric plotted against the logarithm of the period (top two rows) or linear MES (bottom two rows). The fraction is plotted for the obsTCE set in black, the scrTCE set in blue (dashed), and the invTCE set in orange (dot-dashed achieve a balance between maximizing the fraction of TCEs from the injTCE set that are classified as PCs (i.e., completeness) and maximizing the fraction of TCEs from the scrTCE and invTCE sets identified as FPs (i.e. effectiveness.) Optimization varies the thresholds of the subset of the Robovetter metrics described in §3. The set of metrics chosen for the joint optimization, called "optimized metrics" are: LPP ( §A.3.1), the Model-shift uniqueness test metrics (M S 1 , M S 2 , and M S 3 ; §A.3.4), Max SES to MES ( §A.3.5), and TCE Chases ( §A.3.3). Both the DV and ALT versions of these metrics, when applicable, were used in the optimization.</p><p>Metrics not used in the joint optimization are incorporated by classifying TCEs as PCs or FPs using fixed a priori thresholds prior to optimizing the other metrics. After optimization, a TCE is classified as a PC only if it passes both the non-optimized metrics and the optimized metrics. Prior to optimization the fixed thresholds for these non-optimized metrics pass about 80% of the injTCE set, so the final optimized set can have at most 80% completeness. Note, the non-optimized metric thresholds for the DR25 catalog changed after doing these optimizations. The overall effect was that the final measured completeness of the catalog increased (see §7), especially for the low MES TCEs. If the optimization were redone with these new thresholds, then it would find that the non-optimized metrics pass 90% of the injTCEs. We decided this change was not sufficient reason to rerun the optimization since it was only being used to inform and not set the final thresholds.</p><p>Optimization is performed by varying the selected thresholds, determining which TCEs are classified as PCs by both the optimized and non-optimized metrics using the new optimized thresholds, and computing C and 1 − E. Our optimization seeks thresholds that minimize the objective function</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(1 − E) 2 + (C − C 0 ) 2 ,</formula><p>where C 0 is the target completeness, so the optimization tries to get as close as possible to 1 − E = 0 and C = C 0 . We varied C 0 in an effort to increase the effectiveness. The thresholds are varied from random starting seed values, using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm via the MATLAB fminsearch function. This MATLAB function varies the thresholds until the objective function is minimized. There are many local minima, so the optimal thresholds depend sensitively on the random starting threshold values. The optimal thresholds we report are the smallest of 2000 iterations with different random seed values.</p><p>Our final optimal threshold used a target of C 0 = 0.8, which resulted in thresholds that yielded E = 0.9956 and C = 0.799. We experimented with smaller values of C 0 , but these did not significantly increase effectiveness. We also performed an optimization that maximized reliability defined in §4.1 rather than maximizing effectiveness. This yielded similar results. We also explored the dependence of the optimal thresholds on the range of TCE MES and period. We found that the thresholds have a moderate dependence, while the effectiveness and completeness have significant dependence on MES and period range. Exploration of this dependence of Robovetter threshold on MES and period range is a topic for future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Picking the Final Robovetter Metric Thresholds</head><p>The results of this algorithmic optimization were used as a starting point for the final thresholds chosen for the DR25 catalog. We used the Confirmed Planet table and the Certified False Positive Table at the Exoplanet Archive, as well as the results of some prominent KOIs, to manually adjust the thresholds. Because most of the injTCEs, invTCEs, and scrTCEs are at long periods and low MES the automated tuning optimized the completeness and effectiveness for this part of the catalog. However, many of Kepler 's PCs have short periods and high SNR. The final catalog thresholds balanced the needs of the different parts of the catalog and endeavoured to keep the completeness of the long period candidates above 70%.</p><p>For those interested in a certain part of the KOI catalog, it may be better to re-tune the thresholds to optimize for higher reliability or to more aggressively remove certain types of false alarms. The Robovetter code 14 (and the Robovetter input files) are provided with the tunable thresholds listed at the top of the code. As an example, we include <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> as a list of the easily tunable thresholds for the metrics that determine whether an object is not transit-like. The table lists the thresholds we settled on for the DR25 catalog here, but it also provides the metrics for a higher reliability (lower completeness) catalog and a higher completeness (lower reliability) catalog. (These two different sets of thresholds are also included as commented-out lines in the Robovetter code after the set of thresholds used to create the DR25 catalog.) Each metric has its own range of possible values and some are more sensitive to small adjustments than others. Users should use caution when changing the thresholds and should endeavour to understand the different metrics, described in §3 and Appendix A, before doing so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">ASSEMBLING THE DR25 KOI CATALOG</head><p>The KOI catalog contains all the obsTCEs that the Robovetter found to have some chance of being transitshaped, i.e., astrophysically transiting or eclipsing systems. All of the DR25 KOIs are fit with a transit model and uncertainties for each model parameter are calculated with a MCMC algorithm. We describe here how we decide which obsTCEs become KOIs, how we match the obsTCEs with previously known KOIs, and how the transit fits are performed. The KOI catalog is available in its entirety at the NASA Exoplanet Archive as the Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI Table <ref type="bibr">15</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Creating KOIs</head><p>The Robovetter gives every obsTCE a disposition, a reason for the disposition, and a disposition score. However, only those that are transit-like, i.e., have some possibility of being a transiting exoplanet or eclipsing binary system, are intended to be placed in the KOI catalog. For scheduling reasons, we created the majority of KOIs before we completed the Robovetter, so some not transit-like KOIs have been included in the KOI catalog. Using the final set of Robovetter dispositions, we made sure to include the following obsTCEs in the KOI table: 1) those that are "transit-like", i.e., are not marked with the NT-flag, and 2) KOIs that are not transit-like FPs which have a score value larger than 0.1. This last group were included to ensure that obsTCEs that marginally failed one Robovetter metric were easily accessible via the KOI catalog and given full transit fits with MCMC error bars. As in previous catalogs, all DR25 obsTCEs that federate ( §6.2) to a previously identified <ref type="bibr">KOI</ref>  previously identified by the Kepler pipeline. The process has not changed substantially from the DR24 KOI catalog (see §4.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>), so we simply summarize the criteria for a match here. If the TCE orbital period matches within 0.2% of the KOI period then the two are considered federated if at least 25% of the transit events overlap. If the relative period mismatch was more than 0.2%, then 70% of the transit events need to overlap. Also, those that are found at double or half the period are also considered matches (244 KOIs in total). In the cases where the period is double or half, then at least 95% of the expected (every-other) transit cadences need to overlap in order to federate the two.</p><p>In some cases our automated tools want to create a new KOI in a system where one of the other previously known KOIs in the system did not federate to a DR25 TCE. In these cases we inspect the new system by hand and ensure that a new KOI number is truly warranted. If it is, we create a new KOI. If not, we ban the event from the KOI list. For instance, events that are caused by video cross-talk (Van Cleve &amp; Caldwell 2016) can cause short-period transit events to appear in only one quarter each year. As a result, the Kepler Pipeline finds several one-year period events for an astrophysical event that is truly closer to a few days. In these cases we federate the one found that most closely matches the known KOI and we ban any other obsTCEs from creating a new KOI around this star. In <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> we report the entire list of obsTCEs that were not made into KOIs despite being dispositioned as transit-like (or not transit-like with a disposition score ≥ 0.1) and the automated federation telling us that one was appropriate. To identify the TCEs we specify the Kepler Input Catalog number and the planet number given by the Kepler Pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Twicken et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that the removal of the banned TCEs is the one pseudo-manual step that is not repeated for all the simulated TCEs. These banned TCEs effectively disappear when doing statistics on the catalog (i.e., these TCEs do not count as either a PC or an FP.) They are not present in the simulated data sets, nor are we likely to remove good PCs from our sample this way. Most banned TCEs are caused by either a short-period binary whose flux is contaminating our target star (at varying depths through mechanisms such as video cross-talk or reflection), or are systems with strong TTVs (transit timing variations, see §6.3). In both cases, the Pipeline finds several TCEs at various periods, but only one astrophysical system causes the signal. By banning these obsTCEs, we are removing duplicates from the KOI catalog and improving the completeness and reliability statistics reported in §7.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">KOI Transit Model Fits</head><p>Each KOI, whether from a previous catalog or new to the DR25 catalog, was fit with a transit model in a consistent manner. The model fitting was performed in a similar to that described in §5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. (2015a)</ref>. The model fits start by detrending the DR25 Q1-Q17 PDC photometry from MAST 16 using a polynomial filter as described in §4 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rowe et al. (2014)</ref>. A transit model based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> is fit to the photometry using a Levenberg-Marquardt routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(More et al. 1980</ref>) assuming circular orbits and using fixed quadratic limb darkening coefficients <ref type="bibr">(Claret &amp; Bloe- men 2011</ref>) calculated using the DR25 stellar parameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017</ref>). TTVs are included in the model fit when necessary; the calculation of TTVs follows the procedure described in §4.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rowe et al. (2014)</ref>. The 296 KOIs with TTVs and the TTV measurements of each transit are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>. The uncertainties for the fitted parameters were calculated using a Markovchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ford 2005</ref>) with a single chain with a length of 2×10 5 calculated for each fit. In order to calculate the posterior distribution the first 20% of each chain was discarded. The transit model fit parameters were combined with the DR25 stellar parameters and associated errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017</ref>) in order to produce the reported planetary parameters and associated errors. The MCMC chains are all available at the Exoplanet Archive and are documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Hoffman &amp; Rowe (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The listed planet parameters come from the leastsquares (LS) model fits and the associated errors from the MCMC calculations. Note that not all KOIs could be successfully modelled, resulting in three different fit types: LS+MCMC, LS, and none. In the case of LS+MCMC the KOIs were fully modelled with both a least-squares model fit and the MCMC calculations were completed to provide associated errors. In the cases where the MCMC calculations did not converge, but there is a model fit, the least-square parameters are available without uncertainties (LS fit type). In the final case, where a KOI could not be modelled (e.g., cases where the transit event was not found in the detrending used by the MCMC fits) only the period, epoch, and duration of the federated TCE are reported and the fit type is listed as none.</p></div>

Summary of the KOI Catalog</head><p>The final DR25 KOI catalog, available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive, contains all TCEs that pass the not transit-like tests ( §A.3) and those that fail as not transitlike with a disposition score ≥ 0.1. Some overall statistics of the DR25 KOI catalog are as follows:</p><p>• 8054 KOIs</p><p>• 4034 PCs</p><p>• 738 new KOIs</p><p>• 219 new PCs</p><p>• 85.2% of injTCEs are PCs </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">· · · · · · · · · · · ·</formula><p>Note-Column 1, n, is the transit number.

The distribution of the periods and planetary radii of the planet candidates in this catalog is shown along the x-and y-axis. A clear excess of candidates exists with periods near 370 d; this excess disappears if we only consider those with a disposition score &gt; 0.7. While the disposition score provides an easy way to make an additional cut on the PC population at long periods, when discussing the catalog PCs below we are using the pure dispositions of the Robovetter unless otherwise stated. The slight deficit of planets with radii just below 2.0 R ⊕ is consistent with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> where they report a natural gap in the abundance of planets between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes by applying precise stellar parameters to a subset of the Kepler transiting candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Johnson et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Petigura et al. 2017b</ref>). The new KOIs with a disposition of PC are found at all periods, but only ten have MES ≥ 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Comparison of Dispositions to Other Catalogs</head><p>We compare the DR25 KOI catalog to two sets of Kepler exoplanets: the confirmed exoplanets and the certified FPs. In both of these cases, additional observations and careful vetting are used to verify the signal as either a confirmed exoplanet or a certified FP ( . It is worth comparing the Robovetter to these catalogs as a sanity check.</p><p>We use the confirmed exoplanet list from the Exoplanet Archive 17 on 2017-05-24. 2279 confirmed planets are in the DR25 KOI catalog. The DR25 Robovetter fails 44 of these confirmed planets, or less than 2%. Half of these FPs are not transit-like fails, 16 are stellar eclipse fails, six are centroid offsets, and one is an ephemeris match. Twelve fail due to the LPP metric; all of these twelve have periods less than 50 days. The LPP metric threshold was set to improve the reliability of the long period KOIs, an act which sacrificed some of the short period KOIs. The reason the Robovetter failed each confirmed planet is given in the "koi_comment" column at the Exoplanet Archive (see §B).</p><p>For the vast majority of the Robovetter FPs on the confirmed planet list, careful inspection reveals that there is no doubt that the Robovetter disposition is incorrect. As an example, Kepler-10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Batalha et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Fogtmann-Schulz et al. 2014</ref>), a rocky planet in a 0.84 d orbit, was failed due to the LPP metric. This occurred because the detrending algorithm (the harmonic identification and removal algorithm in TPS, see Jenkins 2017b) used by the Kepler Pipeline significantly distorts the shape of the transit, a known problem for strong, short period signals (Christiansen 2015). The LPP metric, which compares the shape of the folded light curve to known transits, then fails the TCE.</p><p>In some cases the Robovetter may be correctly failing the confirmed planet. Many of the confirmed planets are only statistically validated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). In these cases no additional data exists proving the physical existence of a planet outside of the transits observed by Kepler. It is possible that the DR25 light curves and metrics have now revealed evidence that the periodic events are caused by noise or a binary star. It is also worth noting that none of the confirmed circumbinary planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Doyle et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Orosz et al. 2012</ref>) are in the DR25 KOI catalog. However, the eclipsing binary stars that they orbit are listed as FPs. The timing and shape of the circumbinary planet transits vary in a complicated manner, making them unsuitable for detection by the search algorithm used by the Kepler Pipeline to generate the DR25 obsTCE list. As a result, this catalog cannot be used for occurrence rate estimates of circumbinary planets, and their absence in the KOI catalog should not cast doubt on their veracity.</p><p>We use the Certified False Positive table 18 downloaded from the Exoplanet Archive on 2017-07-11 to evaluate the performance of the Robovetter at removing known FPs. This table contains objects known to be FPs based on all available data, including ground-based follow-up information. The Robovetter passes 106 of the 2713 certified FPs known at the time, only 3.9 per cent. Most of those called PCs by the Robovetter are high signal-tonoise and more than half have periods less than 5 days. The most common reason they are certified FPs is that there is evidence they are eclipsing binaries. In some 18 https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/ TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&amp;config=fpwg cases, external information, like radial velocity measurements, provide a mass which determines that the KOI is actually a binary system. The other main reason for the discrepancy between the tables is that the certified FPs often show evidence of significant centroid offsets. In crowded fields the Centroid Robovetter ( §A.5.1) will not fail observed offsets because of the potential for confusion. For the Certified False Positive table, individual cases are examined by a team of scientists who determines when there is sufficient proof that the signal is indeed caused by a background eclipsing binary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Catalog Completeness, Effectiveness, and Reliability</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the Robovetter and to measure the catalog completeness and reliability, we run the Robovetter on the injTCEs, invTCEs, and scrTCEs. As a high level summary, <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> provides the completeness, effectiveness (E), and reliability for a 3 by 3 grid across period and MES. If the same figure is made for only the FGK dwarf type stars (log g ≥ 4.0 and 4000 K ≥ T &lt; 7000 K), the long period, low MES bin improves substantially. Giant stars are inherently noisy on time scales of planet transits (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Chris- tiansen et al. 2012</ref>) causing more FPs and also causing more real transits to be distorted by the noise. For FGK dwarf stars and only considering candidates with periods between 200 d and 500 d and MES &lt; 10, C = 76.7%, 1−E = 1.1%, and R = 50.3%, which is a 13.1 percentage point improvement in reliability and 3 percentage point improvement in completeness compared to all stars in the same period and MES range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1.">Completeness</head><p>The completeness of the vetting is measured as the fraction of injTCEs that are dispositioned as PCs. We discuss here the detection efficiency of the Robovetter, not the Kepler Pipeline (see §8 for a discussion of the Pipeline completeness). Across the entire set of recovered injTCEs which have periods ranging from 0.5-500 d, the Robovetter dispositioned 85.2% as PC. As expected, the vetting completeness is higher for transits at shorter periods and higher MES, and lower for longer periods and lower MES. The right hand column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig- ure 9</ref> shows how the completeness varies with period, expected MES, number of transits, and transit duration. Note that expected MES is the average MES at which the injected transit signal would be measured in the target light curve, given the average photometric noise of that light curve and the depth of the injected transit signal -see Christiansen <ref type="bibr">2017</ref> for more details. The small drop in completeness just short of 90 days is likely caused by the odd-even metric ( §A.4.1.4), which only operates out to 90 days, confusing true transits for binary eclipses.</p><p>Because most planet occurrence rate calculations are performed using period and radius (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burke et al. 2015</ref>), we show the measured completeness binned by period and radius in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. The plot is linear in period and radius in order to emphasize the long period planets. Planetary radius is not a natural unit to understand the performance of the Robovetter since it combines the depth of the transit, the noise level of the light curve, and the stellar radius. At the longest periods the Robovetter is more likely to disposition larger injected planets as FPs than the smaller counterparts, though the trend is reduced when only considering the FGK dwarf stars. The reason for this is that the largest radii planets in the injTCE population are entirely around giant stars; large planets were not injected onto the dwarf stars (Christiansen 2017). The giant stars are notoriously noisy. As a result the largest radii planets in the injTCEs are more likely to be dispositioned incorrectly. Also, even when only considering the dwarf stars, a larger fraction of the big planets will be around larger, more massive stars (in comparison to the small planets which will mostly be found around smaller stars). This  results in a population of planets that produce longer transit durations. The Robovetter performs less well for long transit durations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>). For more figures showing the Robovetter effectiveness across different parameters, see Coughlin (2017b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2.">Effectiveness</head><p>The effectiveness of the Robovetter at identifying instrumental and stellar noise is calculated using the union of the invTCEs and scrTCEs (see §4.1), after removing the TCEs specified in §2.3.3. Across the entire set, the Robovetter dispositions 99.6% of these simulated false alarms as FPs. Only 119 of the 28,735 simulated false alarms are dispositioned as a PC by the Robovetter. Most of these invPCs and scrPCs are at long periods and low MES. However, using the 4544 invTCEs and scrTCEs that have periods between 200 d and 500 d and MES less than 10, the Robovetter's effectiveness is 98.8% (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Unfortunately, because there are so few candidates at these long periods, this translates to a relatively low reliability. For detailed plots showing how effectiveness varies with different parameters see Coughlin (2017b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.3.">Reliability</head><p>The reliability is measured according to the method described in §4.1 using the effectiveness measured from the combined scrTCE and invTCE data sets and the number of observed PCs. If one bins over the entire data set, the overall reliability of the catalog is 97%. However, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref> demonstrates, the reliability for long period, and especially low MES planets, is significantly smaller. For periods longer than 200 d and MES less than 10, the reliability of the catalog is approximately 37%, i.e., 6 out of 10 PCs are caused by noise. As with completeness, we plot the reliability as a function of period and planet radius in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. The least reliable planets are at long periods and have radii less than 4R ⊕ .</p><p>The uncertainty in the reliability is likely dominated by how well the false alarms in the scrTCE and invTCE sets match the false alarms in the obsTCE data set (see §4.2 for further discussion on their similarity). One way to get a handle on the uncertainty on reliability is to calculate the reliability in three different ways for the long period (200-500 d), low MES (&lt; 10) obsTCEs. First, we use only the invTCEs to measure the effectiveness at removing false alarms. This results in a lower reliability, namely R = 24% with E = 98.5%. Second, we use only the scrTCEs to measure the effectiveness. This results in a higher reliability, R = 51% with E = 99.1%. Third, we select, at random, half of the combined population of false alarms (scrTCE and invTCE) and calculate the reliability. After doing this random selection 100 times, we obtained R = 38% with a standard deviation of 8%, and the distribution appears symmetric and basically Gaussian in shape.</p><p>The Robovetter is less effective at removing the false alarms produced by inversion than those by scrambling the data. Inversion finds false alarms with periods near 372 d, which are frequently caused by image artifacts. Scrambling under-populates these types of false alarms, and since they are difficult to eliminate, it is not surprising that the reliability measured by inversion is worse than scrambling. The truth likely lies somewhere in between. We encourage users of these data sets to consider ways to optimize the reliability measurement, and the error budget associated with them, when doing occurrence rate calculations.</p><p>We remind the reader that this analysis only concerns the reliability against the false alarms that are present in the scrTCEs and invTCEs. Previous studies (e.g. Santerne et al. 2012) discuss the reliability of previous KOI catalogs against short-period eclipsing binaries. However, since the Robovetter logic has changed considerably for this catalog (specifically the v-shaped metric was introduced and tuned to account for these false positives), the eclipsing binary false positive rate should be re-evaluated for this DR25 KOI catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.4.">High Reliability Using the Disposition Score</head><p>The disposition scores discussed in §3.2 can be used to select a more reliable, though more incomplete, sample of planet candidates. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 12</ref> we show the distribution of disposition scores for the PCs and FPs from the observed, inverted, scrambled, and on-target planet injection populations. (Note, the inverted and scrambled populations have been cleaned as discussed in §2.3.3). For all populations, the PC distribution tends to cluster near a score of 1.0 with a tail that extends towards lower score values. Lower MES values tend to have a greater proportion of lower score values. Similarly, the vast majority of FPs have a score of 0.0, with only a small fraction extending towards higher score values (note the yaxis for the FPs is logarithmic, while the y-axis for PCs is linear). Comparing the populations, the on-target planet injections have a greater concentration of score values towards 0.5 for both the PCs and FPs than other populations. Both the inverted and scrambled populations have very few PCs near high score values. We can exploit the relative distribution of PC and FP score values for the different populations to select a higher reliability catalog.</p><p>At the top of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 13</ref> we show how the completeness and reliability of the catalog vary for different cuts on the disposition score for MES&lt;10 and periods between 200 and 500 days. The effectiveness of the Robovetter increases as the score threshold is increased. The reliability values also depend on the number of observed PCs that remain, which is why reliability does not change in step with the effectiveness. Selecting the PC sample by choosing those with a disposition score above 0.6 (see the point labeled 0.6 on the top of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 13</ref>) yields an 85% reliability and a completeness that is still above 95% 93% 92% 88% 83% 73% 81% 89% 91% 87% 83% 74% 79% 85% 79% 74% 62% 78% 83% 73% 64% 42% 68% 73% 65% 42% 39% 76% 56% 40% 32% 38% 96% 93% 92% 88% 83% 74% 90% 92% 87% 84% 75% 89% 86% 83% 78% 65% 76% 69% 70% 59% 50%. Doing a score cut in this way not only removes those dispositioned as a PC from the sample, but also causes a few obsTCEs which are formally dispositioned as FPs to now be included in the sample. An FP with a high score occurs when a TCE marginally fails a single metric.</p></div>

One of its primary science goals is to determine the occurrence rate of potentially habitable, terrestrialsize planets -a value often referred to as eta-Earth. Here we use the concept of a habitable zone to select a sample of planet candidates that are the right distance from their host stars and small enough to possibly have a rocky surface. A point that bears repeating is that no claims can be made regarding planetary habitability [Top] The reliability (red) and effectiveness (blue) of the DR25 catalog as a function of Completeness for MES ≤ 10 and periods between 200 and 500 d PCs that result when using different disposition score thresholds (shown as black numbers) to select the PCs.

This sample is, however, of great value to the occurrence rate studies that enable planet yield estimates for various designs of future life-detection missions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Stark et al. 2015</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.1.">Selecting the Eta-Earth Sample</head><p>Before applying thresholds on planet properties, we first select a sample based on disposition score (see §3.2) in order to produce a sample of higher reliability planets orbiting G-type stars. At long orbital period and small radius, we are vulnerable to instrumental false alarms despite the significant improvements afforded us by the latest versions of metrics like Marshall, Skye, Rubble, Chases, and Model-shift. This is evident in the FGK dwarf sample of <ref type="figure">Figures 10 and 11</ref> by comparing the relatively low reliability (45%-74%) and completeness (74% to 88%) measurements in the bottom right boxes to others at shorter period and larger radius. Removing candidates with score &lt; 0.5 results in a significant improvement in the sample reliability with a small degradation in the sample completeness ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 13)</ref>. The candidates reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> are ≈80% reliable for the G-type stars and even higher for the K-and M-type stars. Note, there is only one late F-type star in the sample. Kepler was not designed to find small planets in the habitable zones of F-type stars and those in the DR25 catalog are of low reliability and have disposition scores less than 0.5.</p><p>The DR25 catalog uses the transit depth and period, along with the DR25 stellar table of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref>, to derive the planet radius and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. From these we calculate the insolation flux in units of the Earth's insolation flux,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S p = R 2 · (T /5777) 4 a 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit in AU, T is the host star temperature in Kelvin, 5777 K is the effective temperature of the Sun, R is the radius of the star in units of R , and thus S p is in units relative to the Earth's insolation flux. The errors for both insolation flux and radii include the errors from the DR25 stellar catalog. The habitable zone represents a range of orbits where the flux received by the host star allows for the possibility of surface liquid water on an Earthsize planet. While the insolation limits for the habitable zone depends on the stellar temperature, it roughly falls from 0.2-1.7 S ⊕ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 14)</ref>. We use the empirical (recent Venus/early Mars) habitable zone of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kopparapu et al. (2013)</ref>. To err on the side of inclusiveness, we include candidates whose one sigma error bars on the insolation flux overlap this empirical habitable zone. Finally, we include only those candidates that satisfy the size constraint R p −σ Rp,low &lt; 1.8 R ⊕ . The purpose of the size constraint is to identify candidates likely to have a bulk composition similar to terrestrial planets in the solar system. The 1.8 R ⊕ upper limit is taken from   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 14</ref>. DR25, eta-Earth sample of PCs plotted as stellar effective temperature against insolation flux using the values reported in the DR25 KOI catalog (which uses stellar properties from the DR25 stellar catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017</ref>). The size of the exoplanet is indicated by the size of the circle. The color indicates the disposition score. Only those with disposition score greater than 0.5 are plotted. Only objects whose error bars indicate that they could be in the habitable zone and have a radius less than 1.8 R⊕ are shown. Those with a red ring are new to the DR25 catalog. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> who report a distinct gap in the radius distribution of exoplanets for planets in orbital periods of less than 100 d. The authors argue that the gap is the result of two (possibly overlapping) population distributions: the rocky terrestrials and the miniNeptune size planets characterized by their volatile-rich envelopes. Within this framework, the center of the gap marks a probabilistic boundary between having a higher likelihood of a terrestrial composition versus a higher likelihood of a volatile-rich envelope. However, this boundary was identified using planets in orbital periods of less than 100 days and it may not exist for planets in longer period orbits. Also, it is not entirely clear that planets on the small side of this gap are all terrestrial. Rogers (2015) examined small planets with density measurements with periods less than ≈50 d and showed that less than half of planets with a radii of 1.62 R ⊕ have densities consistent with a body primarily composed of iron and silicates. For our purposes of highlighting the smallest planets in this catalog, we chose to be inclusive and set the threshold at 1.8 R ⊕ .</p><p>To summarize, <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> lists those candidates with scores greater than 0.5 and whose error bars indicate that they could be smaller than 1.8 R ⊕ and lie in the habitable zone. The table also includes KOI 2184.02 because the erratum to <ref type="bibr">Mathur et al. (2017, see §2.</ref>5 of this paper) reduces the stellar and planet radii so that the PC now lies in our sample. Note, the same erratum also reduces the planet radii of KOI 4460.01 and KOI 4550.01 to 2.0 R ⊕ and 1.65 R ⊕ respectively. The values reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> are identical to those in the KOI table at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and do not include the values reported in the erratum to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref>. Also, in order to make <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> complete we include any Kepler terrestrial-size confirmed planet that falls in the habitable zone of its star according to the confirmed planet table at the Exoplanet Archive (downloaded on 2017-05-15). The objects are included, and denoted with footnotes, even if the DR25 catalog dispositions them as FPs, or if the DR25 planetary parameters place them outside the habitable zone. However, note that statistical inferences like occurrence rates should be based on a uniform sample drawn exclusively from the DR25 catalog and its self-consistent completeness and reliability measurements (see §8).</p><p>We plot the eta-Earth sample candidates in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 14</ref>, using only the information in the DR25 KOI catalog. Notice that this final search of the Kepler data not only identified previously discovered candidates around the M dwarf stars, it also yielded a handful of highly reliable candidates around the GK dwarf stars. These GK dwarf candidates have fewer transits and shallower depths, making them much more difficult to find. Despite their lower signal-to-noise, because we provide a measure of the reliability against false alarms (along with the completeness), these candidates are available to further study the occurrence rates of small planets in the habitable zone of GK dwarf stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.2.">Notes on the Eta-Earth Sample</head><p>Forty-seven candidates have a score greater than 0.5 and fall in this eta-Earth sample; 10 of these are new to this catalog (KOI numbers greater than 7621.01 and KOI 238.03). A manual review of the 10 new high-score candidates indicates that they are all low signal-to-noise with very few transits, and show no obvious reason to be called false positives. However, our reliability measurements indicate that ≈20% of these targets are not caused by a transiting/eclipsing system. As an example, the candidate most similar to the size and temperature of the Earth is KOI 7711.01 (KIC 004940203), with four transits that all cleanly pass the individual transit metrics. It orbits a 5734 K star, has an insolation flux slightly less than that of Earth, and is about 30% larger according to its DR25 catalog properties. Plots showing visualizations of the transit data and its quality are available at the Exoplanet Archive for this object <ref type="bibr">19</ref> and for all of the obsTCEs, injTCEs, scrTCEs, and invTCEs.</p><p>Several confirmed planets fall in our eta-Earth sample. Kepler-186f (KOI 571.05), Kepler-439b (KOI 4005.01) and Kepler-1593b (KOI 4356.01) move into the habitable zone according to the confirmed planet properties. They are included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> with a footnote indicating they would not otherwise be listed. <ref type="bibr">Kepler-296d (KOI 1422.02)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-1649b (KOI 3138.01)</ref>, on the other hand, move outside the HZ according to the updated properties and are noted accordingly. Note, the default properties in the confirmed planets table at the Exoplanet Archive are selected for completeness and precision. Additional values may be available from other references that represent the best, current state of our knowledge.</p><p>Kepler-560b (KOI 463.01) is a confirmed planet that is a PC in the DR25 catalog, but failed the score cut; it is included for awareness and annotated accordingly. The low score is caused by the Centroid Robovetter ( §A.5.1) detecting a possible offset from the star's cataloged position, likely due to the star's high proper motion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mann et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Two confirmed planets dispositioned as FPs in the DR25 catalog are included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref>: Kepler-62f (KOI 701.04) and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-283c (KOI 1298.02)</ref>. Kepler62f has only 4 transit events in the time series. The transit observed during Quarter 9 is on the edge of a gap and narrowly fails Rubble. The transit observed during Quarter 12 is flagged by the Skye metric. Taken together, this leaves fewer than three unequivocal transits, the minimum required for the PC disposition.</p><p>Kepler-283c (KOI 1298.02) fails the shape metric. Its phase-folded transit appears v-shaped when TTVs are not included in the modeling. We note that vetting metrics employed by the DR25 Robovetter were computed without consideration of transit timing variations, whereas the transit fits used in the KOI table, described in §6.3, includes the timing variations as measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. (2015a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.">Caveats</head><p>When selecting candidates from the KOI catalog for further study, as we did for the eta-Earth sample ( §7.5), it is important to remember a few caveats. First, even with a high cut on disposition score, the reliability against false alarms is not 100%. Some candidates may still be caused by false alarms, especially those around 19 https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/data/ KeplerData/\penalty\z@004/004940/004940203/tcert/ kplr004940203_q1_q17_dr25_obs_tcert.pdf the larger, hotter stars. Also, this reliability number does not include the astrophysical reliability. Many of our tools to detect astrophysical false positives do not work for long-period, low MES candidates. For example, it is nearly impossible to detect the centroid offset created from a background eclipsing binary and secondary eclipses are not deep enough to detect for these stars.</p><p>Second, the measured radius and semi-major axis of each planet depends on the stellar catalog. As discussed in §2. <ref type="bibr">5 and Mathur et al. (2017)</ref>, the stellar radii and masses are only known to a certain precision and the quality of the data used to derive these stellar properties varies between targets. These unknowns are reflected in the 1-sigma error bars shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 14</ref>  −0.1 R ⊕ in the DR25 catalog. The radii and stellar temperature differ by less than 2-sigma, but those differences change the interpretation of the planet from a super-Earth in the middle of the habitable zone of an early G dwarf host to an Earth-size planet receiving about half the amount of flux from a late K star. As follow-up observations of each candidate star is obtained and errors on the stellar parameters decrease, we expect this population to change in significant ways.</p><p>Third, high-resolution imaging has proven crucial for identifying light from background and bound stars which add flux to the Kepler photometric time series . When this occurs, unaccounted for extra light dilutes the transit, causing the radii to be significantly underestimated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ciardi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Furlan &amp; Howell 2017)</ref>. As a result, we fully expect that once follow-up observations are obtained for these stars, several of the PCs in this catalog, including those listed in the eta-Earth sample, will be found to have radii larger than reported in this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">USING THE DR25 CATALOG FOR OCCURRENCE RATE CALCULATIONS</head><p>The DR25 candidate catalog was designed with the goal of providing a well characterized sample of planetary candidates for use in occurrence rate calculations. For those smallest planets at the longest periods, our vetting is especially prone to miss transits and confuse other signals as transits, and this must be accounted for when doing occurrence rates. However, the completeness and reliability presented in this paper are simply the last two pieces of a much larger puzzle that must be assembled in order to perform occurrence rates with this catalog. In this section we endeavor to make users aware of other issues and biases, as well as all the products available to help interpret this KOI catalog, all of which are hosted at the NASA exoplanet archive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Pipeline Detection Efficiency</head><p>Any measure of the catalog completeness must include the completeness of the Robovetter and the Kepler Pipeline. The Pipeline's detection efficiency has been explored in two ways: using pixel-level transit injection and using flux-level transit injection. In the former, a simulated transiting planet signal is injected into the calibrated pixels of each Kepler target, which are then processed through the pipeline. This experiment provides an estimate of the average detection efficiency over all the stars that were searched. A full description of the signals that were injected and recovered can be found in <ref type="bibr">Christiansen (2017)</ref>. The pixel-level measurements have the advantage of following transit signals through all the processing steps of the Kepler Pipeline, and the recovered signals can be further classified with the Robovetter, as demonstrated in §7.3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 15</ref> shows the average pipeline detection efficiency for a sample of FGK stars: the left panel shows the pipeline detection efficiency, and the right panel shows the combined Pipeline and Robovetter detection efficiency, calculated by taking the injections that were successfully recovered by the pipeline and processing them through the Robovetter. A gamma cumulative distribution function is fit to both (see equation 1 of <ref type="bibr">Christiansen et al. 2016)</ref>. Notice that the detection efficiency decreases by 5-10 percentage points (of the entire set that were injected) for all MES, as expected given the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>Since the pixel-level transit injection includes only one injection per target, it does not examine potential variations in the pipeline completeness for individual targets due to differences in stellar properties or astrophysical variability. To probe these variations, a small number of individual stars had a large number of transiting signals (either several thousand or several hundred thousand, depending on the analysis) injected into the detrended photometry, which was processed only through the transit-search portion of the TPS module. The fluxlevel injections revealed that there are significant targetto-target variations in the detection efficiency. The fluxlevel injections and the resulting detection efficiency is available for the sample of stars that were part of this study. For more information on the flux-level injection study see <ref type="bibr">Burke &amp; Catanzarite (2017c)</ref>. All products associated with the flux-level and pixel-level injections can be found at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. <ref type="bibr">20</ref>  We have described the reliability of the DR25 candidates with regard to the possibility that the observed events are actually caused by stellar or instrumental noise. See §7.3 for how this reliability varies with various measured parameters. However, even if the observed signal is not noise, other astrophysical events can mimic a transit. Some of these other astrophysical events are removed by carefully vetting the KOI with Kepler data alone. Specifically, the Robovetter looks for significant secondary eclipses to rule out eclipsing binaries, and for a significant offset in the location of the in-and out-oftransit centroids to rule-out background eclipsing binaries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton et al. (2016)</ref> developed the vespa tool which considers the likelihood that a transit event is caused by various astrophysical events, including a planet. The False Positive Probabilities (FPP) table <ref type="bibr">21</ref> provides the results of applying this tool to the KOIs in the DR25 catalog. It provides a probability that the observed signal is one of the known types of astrophysical false positives. The FPP table results are only reliable for high signalto-noise (MES10) candidates with no evidence that the transit occurs on a background source. For more information on this table see the associated documentation at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.</p></div>

As part of the pixel-level transit injection efforts, we injected signals that mimic eclipsing binaries and background eclipsing binaries. Those that were recovered by the Kepler Pipeline can be used to measure the effectiveness of the Robovetter at removing this type of FP. A full description of these injections and an analysis of the Robovetter's effectiveness in detecting these signals can be found in Coughlin (2017b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Imperfect Stellar Information</head><p>For those doing occurrence rates, another issue to consider is whether the measured size of the planet is correct. As discussed in §2.5, the stellar catalog (i.e., radii and temperatures) provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref> typ-  ically has errors of 27 percent for the stellar radii. Results from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016a,b) are expected to fix many of the shortcomings of this catalog. Also, the dilution from an unaccounted for bound or line-of-sight binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ciardi et al. 2015;</ref>), can cause planet radii to be larger than what is reported in the DR25 catalog. For occurrence rate calculations this dilution also has implications for the stars that have no observed planets because it means the search did not extend to planet radii that are as small as the stellar catalog indicates. For this reason, any correction to the occurrence rates that might be applied needs to consider the effect on all searched stars, not just the planet hosts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The DR25 KOI catalog has been characterized so that it can serve as the basis for occurrence rate studies of exoplanets with periods as long as 500 days. The detection efficiency of the entire search <ref type="bibr">(Burke &amp; Catan- zarite 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Christiansen 2017)</ref> and of the Robovetter vetting process (Coughlin 2017b) has been calculated by injecting planetary transits into the data and determining which types of planets are found and which are missed. For this DR25 KOI catalog, the vetting completeness has been balanced against the catalog reliability, i.e., how often false alarms are mistakenly classified as PCs. This is the first Kepler exoplanet catalog to be characterized in this way, enabling occurrence rate measurements at the detection limit of the mission. As a result, accurate measurements of the frequency of terrestrial-size planets at orbital periods of hundreds of days is possible.</p><p>The measurement of the reliability using the inverted and scrambled light curves is new to this KOI catalog. We measure how often noise is labeled as a planet candidate and combine that information with the number of false alarms coming from the Kepler Pipeline. Some pure noise signals so closely mimic transiting signals that it is nearly impossible to remove them all. Because of this, it is absolutely imperative that those using this candidate catalog for occurrence rates consider this source of noise. For periods longer than ≈200 days and radii less than ≈4 R ⊕ , these noise events are often labelled as PC and thus the reliability of the catalog is near 50%. Astrophysical reliability is another concern that must be accounted for independently. However, even once it is shown that another astrophysical scenario is unlikely (as was done for the DR24 KOIs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Morton et al. 2016</ref>), the PCs in this catalog cannot be validated without first showing that the candidates have a sufficiently high false alarm reliability.</p><p>We have shown several ways to identify high reliability or high completeness samples. Reliability is a strong function of the MES and the number of observed transits. Also, the FGK dwarf stars are known to be quieter than giant stars and in general the true transits can be more easily separated from the false alarms. We also provide the disposition score, a measure of how robustly a candidate has passed the Robovetter; this can be used to easily find the most reliable candidates. Those doing follow-up observations of KOIs may also use this disposition score to identify the candidates that will optimize ground-based follow-up observations. Also, the catalog contains ten new high-reliability, super-Earth size, habitable zone candidates. Some of the most scrutinized signals in the DR25 KOI catalog will likely be those fifty small, temperate PCs in the etaEarth sample defined in §7.5. These signals, along with their well characterized completeness and reliability, can be used to make an almost direct measurement on the occurrence rate of planets with the size and insolation flux as Earth, especially around GK dwarf stars. While this catalog is an important step forward in measuring this number, it is important to remember a few potential biases inherent to this catalog. Namely, errors in the stellar parameters result in significant errors on the planetary sizes and orbital distances, and unaccounted for background stars make planet radii appear smaller than reality and impact the detection limit of the search for all stars. Also, the Robovetter is not perfect -completeness of the vetting procedures and the reliability of these signals (both astrophysical and false alarm) must be considered in any calculation.</p><p>Ultimately, characterizing this catalog was made possible because of the Robovetter ( §3) and the innovative metrics it uses to vet each TCE. It has improved the uniformity and accuracy of the vetting process and has allowed the entire process to be tested with known transits and known false positives. As a result, the Robovetter could be run many times, each time improving the vetting by changing thresholds or introducing new metrics. We adapted our vetting process as we learned about the data set, ensuring the highest reliability and completeness achievable in the time allowed. The Robovetter metrics and logic may prove useful for future transit missions that will find an unprecedented abundance of signals that will require rapid candidate identification for ground-based follow-up, e.g., <ref type="bibr">K2 (Howell et al. 2014</ref>), TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>), and PLATO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Rauer et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>The authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for providing comments that improved the clarity and accuracy of this manuscript.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Two Robovetter Detrendings</head><p>As mentioned in §1.2, for all of the Robovetter tests that require a phased light curve and model fit, we utilize two different detrendings and model fits (named ALT and DV). Both were also used by the DR24 Robovetter. Every test that is applied to the DV phased light curves is also applied to the ALT detrending, albeit with different thresholds for failure. Failing a test using either detrending results in the TCE being classified as an FP.</p><p>In the Kepler Pipeline, the DV module produces a harmonic-removed, median-detrended, phased flux light curve, along with a transit model fit (Jenkins 2017b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wu et al. 2010</ref>). However, the harmonic removal software is known to suppress or distort short-period ( 3 days) signals causing short-period eclipsing binaries with visible secondaries to appear as transiting planets with no visible secondaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Christiansen et al. 2013b</ref>). It can also make variable stars with semi-coherent variability, such as star spots or pulsations, appear as transit-like signals. As an alternative, we implement the ALT detrending method that utilizes the pre-search data conditioned (PDC) time-series light curves and the nonparametric penalized least-squares detrending method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Garcia (2010)</ref> which includes only the out-of-transit points when computing the filter. This ALT detrending technique is effective at accurately detrending shortperiod eclipsing binaries and variable stars, i.e., preserving their astrophysical signal. These ALT detrended light curves are phased and fit with a simple trapezoidal transit model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. The TCE is the Secondary of an Eclipsing Binary</head><p>If a TCE under examination is not the first one in a system, the Robovetter checks if there exists a previous TCE with a similar period that was designated as an FP due to a stellar eclipse (see §A.4). (Note, TCEs for a given system are ordered from highest MES to lowest MES, and the Robovetter runs on them in this order.) To compute whether two TCEs have the same period within a given statistical threshold, we employ the period matching criteria of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Coughlin et al. (2014,</ref> see equations 1-3), σ P , where higher values of σ P indicate more significant period matches. We re-state the equations here as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∆P = P A − P B P A (A1) ∆P = abs(∆P − rint(∆P ))<label>(A2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">σ P = √ 2 · erfcinv(∆P )<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>where P A is the period of the shorter-period TCE, P B is the period of the longer-period TCE, rint() rounds a number to the nearest integer, abs() yields the absolute value, and erfcinv() is the inverse complementary error function. We consider any value of σ P &gt; 3.5 to indicate significantly similar periods. If the current TCE is (1) in a system that has a previous TCE dispositioned as an FP due to a stellar eclipse, (2) matches the previous TCE's period with σ P &gt; 3.5, and (3) is separated in phase from the previous TCE by at least 2.5 times the transit duration, then the current TCE is considered to be a secondary eclipse. In this case, it is designated as an FP and is classified into both the not transit-like and stellar eclipse FP categoriesa unique combination that can be used to identify secondary eclipses while still ensuring they are not assigned Kepler Object of Interest numbers (see §6). Note that since the Kepler Pipeline generally identifies TCEs in order of their signal-to-noise, from high to low, sometimes a TCE identified as a secondary can have a deeper depth than the primary, depending on their relative durations and shapes. Also note that it is possible that the periods of two TCEs will meet the period matching criteria, but be different enough to have their relative phases shift significantly over the ≈4 year mission duration. Thus, the potential secondary TCE is actually required to be separated in phase by at least 2.5 times the previous TCE's transit duration over the entire mission time frame in order to be labeled as a secondary. Also, the Kepler Pipeline will occasionally detect the secondary eclipse of an eclipsing binary at a half, third, or some smaller integer fraction of the orbital period of the system, such that the epoch of the detected secondary coincides with that of the primary. Thus, when a non-1:1 period ratio is detected, we do not impose criteria (3), the phase separation requirement. Note, equations A1-A3 allow for integer period ratios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Not Transit-Like</head><p>A very large fraction of false positive TCEs have light curves that do not resemble a detached transiting or eclipsing object. These include quasi-sinusoidal light curves from pulsating stars, star spots, and contact binaries, as well as more sporadic light curves due to instrumental artifacts. The first step in the catalog process is to determine whether each TCE is not transit-like. All transit-like obsTCEs are given Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) numbers, which are used to keep track of transit-like systems over multiple Kepler Pipeline runs. We employ a series of algorithmic tests to reliably identify these not transit-like FP TCEs, as shown by the flowchart in <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>. The not transit-like flowchart of the Robovetter. Diamonds represent "yes" or "no" decisions that are made with quantitative metrics. If a TCE fails any test (via a "yes" response to any decision) then it is dispositioned as a not transit-like FP. If a TCE passes all tests (via a "no" response to all decisions), then it is given a KOI number and passed to the stellar eclipse module (see §A.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 21</ref>). The section numbers on each decision diamond correspond to the sections in this paper where these tests are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.1. The LPP Metric</head><p>Many short-period FPs are due to variable stars that exhibit a quasi-sinusoidal phased light curve. We implement the LPP transit-like metric described by <ref type="bibr">Thomp- son et al. (2015a)</ref> to separate those TCEs that show a transit shape from those that do not. This technique bins the TCE's folded light curve and then applies a dimensionality reduction algorithm called Locality Preserving Projections (LPP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">He &amp; Niyogi 2004</ref>). It then measures the average Euclidean distance in these reduced dimensions to the nearest known transit-like TCEs to yield a single number that represents the similarity of a TCE's shape to that of known transits.</p><p>For the DR25 KOI catalog, we deviated slightly from the method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Thompson et al. (2015a)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">23</ref> . The DR24 LPP metric algorithm, when applied to DR25, produced LPP values that were systematically higher for short-period, low-MES TCEs. The transit duration of short period TCEs can be a significant fraction of the orbital period, so when folded and binned these transits have a noticeably different shape. And since we use injTCEs as our training set, which has very few short-period examples, there are very few known transits for the algorithm to match to, causing large measured distances for these transit event. The trend <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The code is available here https://sourceforge.net/p/lpptransitlikemetric/ with MES is rooted in the fact that when the binned light curve has a lower signal-to-noise, it is less likely for two folded light curves to be similar to each other, creating more scatter in the reduced dimensions, and thus increasing the measured distance to known transits in those dimensions.</p><p>We reduced these dependencies by altering how we calculate the LPP metric for the DR25 KOI catalog. For our set of known transit-like TCEs, we now use the union of the set of recovered injTCEs and the set of PCs from the DR24 KOI catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>) that were re-found as obsTCEs in DR25. Including these PCs provides more examples at short period. We also changed how the folded light curve was binned. TCEs with lower MES are given wider bins for those cadences near the transit center, while keeping the total number of bins fixed (99 bins total including 41 for the in-transit portion). Finally, we divide these raw LPP values by the 75 th percentile of the raw LPP values for the 100 TCEs that are closest in period. In this way we reduce the period dependence in the LPP metric. Generally, the resulting LPP metric values lie near to a value of one, and values greater than ≈ 2 appear to be not-transit shaped. To create the DR25 catalog the Robovetter adopted a threshold of 2.2 for the DV detrending and 3.2 for the ALT detrending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.2. Sine Wave Event Evaluation Test</head><p>On occasion, a variable star's variability will have been mostly removed by both the DV and ALT detrendings and will thus appear transit-like. To identify these cases we developed the Sine Wave Event Evaluation Test (SWEET) to examine the PDC data and look for a strong sinusoidal signal at the TCE's period.</p><p>SWEET begins with the PDC data and normalizes each quarter by dividing the time series by the median flux value and subtracting 1.0. Outliers are robustly removed by utilizing a criterion based on the median absolute deviation (MAD) -specifically, outliers are identified as any point that lies more than √ 2·erfcinv(1/N dat )σ from the median, where N dat is the number of data points, erfcinv is the inverse complementary error function, and 1σ=1.4826·MAD (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hampel 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ruppert 2010)</ref>. Three different sine curves are fitted to the resulting data, with their periods fixed to half, exactly, and twice the TCE period, with their phase, amplitude, and offset allowed to vary. Of the three fits, the one with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the amplitude divided by its error, is chosen as the strongest fit. If a TCE has a SWEET signal-to-noise ratio greater than 50, an amplitude greater than the TCE transit depth in both the DV and ALT detrendings, and has a period less than 5.0 days, it fails as not transit-like.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.3. TCE Chases</head><p>In §A.3.7.3 we describe an individual transit metric called Chases that assesses the detection strength of individual transit events relative to other signals nearby in time. TCE Chases takes the median value of these individual transit measurements. When the median value is less than 0.8 the TCE fails as not-transit-like. As with the individual Chases metric, TCE Chases is only calculated when the TCE has five or fewer transit events contributing to the signal. With more than five transit events, the individual transit events are not expected to be statistically significant, and the assumptions of the Chases metric no longer apply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.4. The Model-Shift Uniqueness Test</head><p>If a TCE under investigation is truly a PC, there should not be any other transit-like events in the folded light curve with a depth, duration, and period similar to the primary signal, in either the positive or negative flux directions, i.e., the transit event should be unique in the phased light curve. Many FPs are due to noisy, quasi-periodic signals (see §2) and thus are not unique in the phased light curve. In order to identify these cases, we developed a "model-shift uniqueness test" and used it extensively for identifying false positives in the Q1-Q12 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. 2015b</ref>), Q1-Q16 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015</ref>), and DR24 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>) planet candidate catalogs.</p><p>See §3.2.2 of Rowe et al. (2015b) and page 23 of Coughlin (2017a) for figures and a detailed explanation of the "model-shift uniqueness test", as well as the publicly available code 24 .. Briefly, after removing outliers, the best-fit model of the primary transit is used as a template to measure the best-fit depth at all other phases. The deepest event aside from the primary (pri) transit event is labeled as the secondary (sec) event, the nextdeepest event is labeled as the tertiary (ter) event, and the most positive (pos) flux event (i.e., shows a flux brightening) is labeled as the positive event. The significances of these events (σ Pri , σ Sec , σ Ter , and σ Pos ) are computed assuming white noise as determined by the standard deviation of the light curve residuals. Also, the ratio of the red noise (at the timescale of the transit duration) to the white noise (F Red ) is computed by examining the standard deviation of the best-fit depths at phases outside of the primary and secondary events.</p><p>When examining all events among all TCEs, assuming Gaussian noise, the minimum threshold for an event to be considered statistically significant is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">F A 1 = √ 2 · erfcinv T dur P · N TCEs (A4)</formula><p>where T dur is the transit duration, P is the period, and N TCEs is the number of TCEs examined. (The quantity P /T dur represents the number of independent statistical tests for a single target.) When comparing two events from the same TCE, the minimum difference in their significances in order to be considered distinctly different is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F A 2 = √ 2 · erfcinv T dur P (A5)</formula><p>We compute the following quantities to use as decision metrics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">M S 1 = F A 1 − σ Pri /F Red (A6) M S 2 = F A 2 − (σ Pri − σ Ter ) (A7) M S 3 = F A 2 − (σ Pri − σ Pos )<label>(A8)</label></formula><p>In the Robovetter, we disposition a TCE as a not transit-like FP if either M S 1 &gt; 1.0, M S 2 &gt; 2.0, or M S 3 &gt; 4.0 in the DV detrending, or if either M S 1 &gt; -3.0, M S 2 &gt; 1.0, or M S 3 &gt; 1.0 in the ALT detrending. These criteria ensure that the primary event is statistically significant when compared to the systematic noise level of the light curve, the tertiary event, and the positive event, respectively. We also fail TCEs as not transitlike if σ Pri exactly equals zero in both the DV and ALT detrendings. A value of zero indicates that the fit failed for both detrendings, and suggests that something is fundamentally flawed with the TCE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.5. Dominated by Single Event</head><p>The depths of individual transits of planet candidates should be equal to each other, and thus assuming constant noise levels, the SNR of individual transits should be nearly equivalent as well. In contrast, most of the long-period FPs that result from three or more equidistant systematic events are dominated in SNR by one event. The Kepler Pipeline measures detection significance via the Multiple Event Statistic (MES), which is calculated by combining the Single Event Statistic (SES) of all the individual events that comprise the TCEboth the MES and SES are measures of SNR. Assuming all individual events have equal SES values,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">MES = N Trans · SES (A9)</formula><p>where N Trans is the number of transit events that comprise the TCE. Thus, SES/MES = 0.577 for a TCE with three transits, and less for a greater number of transits. If the largest SES value of a TCE's transit events, SES Max , divided by the MES is much larger than 0.577 (regardless of the number of transits), this indicates that one of the individual events dominates when calculating the SNR.</p><p>In the Robovetter, for TCEs with periods greater than 90 days, if SES Max /MES &gt; 0.8 it is dispositioned as a not transit-like FP. The period cutoff of 90 days is applied because short-period TCEs can have a large number of individual transit events, which dramatically increases the chance of one event coinciding with a large systematic feature, thus producing a large SES Max /MES value despite being a valid planetary signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.6. Previous TCE With Same Period</head><p>Most quasi-sinusoidal FPs produce multiple TCEs at the same period, or at integer ratios of each other. If a TCE in a system has been declared as not transitlike due to another test, it is logical that all subsequent TCEs in that system at the same period, or ratios thereof, should also be dispositioned not transit-like. Thus, we match the period of a given TCE to all previous not transit-like FPs via equations A1-A3. If the current TCE has a period match with σ P &gt; 3.25 to a prior not transit-like FP, it is also dispositioned as a not transit-like FP.</p><p>Similarly, some TCEs are produced that correspond to the edge of a previously identified transit-like TCE in the system. This often results when the previous TCE corresponding to a transit or eclipse is not completely removed prior to searching the light curve for another TCE. Thus, we match the period of a given TCE to all previous transit-like TCEs via equations A1-A3. If the current TCE has a period match with σ P &gt; 3.25 to a prior transit-like FP, and the two epochs are separated in phase by less than 2.5 transit durations, the current TCE is dispositioned as a not transit-like FP. For clarity, we note that it is sometimes possible that the periods of two TCEs will meet the period matching criteria, but be different enough to have their epochs shift significantly in phase over the ∼4 year mission duration. Thus, if they are separated in phase by less than 2.5 transit durations at any point in the mission time frame, the current TCE is dispositioned as a not transit-like FP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.7. Individual Transit Metrics</head><p>A new approach implemented in DR25 is to examine individual transit events for each TCE and determine if they are transit-like. After rejecting these "bad" transit events, we check if either</p><p>• There are less than 3 "good" events left</p><p>• The re-computed MES using only 'good' events is &lt; 7.1</p><p>If either of these conditions are met, then the TCE is failed as not transit-like. This is in line with the Kepler mission requirement of at least three valid transit events with a MES ≥ 7.1 in order to generate a TCE. In the following subsections we list the various tests we apply to each individual transit event.</p><p>A.3.7.1. Rubble -Missing Data -A number of TCEs from the Kepler Pipeline are based on transit events that are missing a significant amount of data either in-transit or just before and/or after. These tend to be false positives that are triggering on edges of gaps, or cases were a large amount of data has been removed and a TCE is being created from the residuals of previous TCEs in the system. We thus devised the Rubble metric to clean-up these fragments from the TCE list. showed that Marshall was 95% complete for TCEs with periods &gt; 150 days and correctly rejected 66% of simulated artifact events. The limit on Marshall's effectiveness at eliminating false alarms was that it used a parabola to describe the out-of-transit flux, which failed to capture much of the real observed stellar variability.</p><p>To ensure high completeness, Marshall was tuned to prevent a variable continuum from causing true transits to be rejected, at the cost of a lower effectiveness. For the DR25 KOI catalog, we use a Gaussian Process approach <ref type="bibr">(GP, Rasmussen &amp; Williams 2006</ref>) to provide an improved continuum model and increase our effectiveness, while maintaining our high completeness. Briefly, our approach aims to model the covariance in the light curve to better fit the trends in our data. A similar approach was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Foreman-Mackey et al. (2016)</ref> to model single transits due to very long period planets (P &gt; 1000 days).</p><p>Our procedure is as follows. For each individual proposed transit event, we select a snippet of PDC data 30 times the reported transit duration centered on the event. Where the event happens near the start (or end) of a quarter, we take a snippet of similar length anchored at the start (or end) of the quarter. We use the George package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ambikasaran et al. 2014</ref>) to fit the covariance of the out-of-transit flux with an exponential squared function, Cov(δt) = A exp (δt//) 2 , where A and are tunable parameters.</p><p>We next fit four models to the entire snippet.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">G(t|A, ,) + y 0 G(t|A, ,) + y 0 + S(t) G(t|A, ,) + y 0 + S(t)(1 − exp βt) G(t|A, ,) + y 0 + S(t − τ /2) − S(t + τ /2) (A10)</formula><p>where G is the Gaussian Process model with the tunable parameters held fixed to those found earlier, and y 0 is a constant offset. S(t) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">S(t) = d 1 + e −γ(t−t0) (A11)</formula><p>where d and t 0 are tunable parameters and γ is a positive constant. This function, known as a sigmoid (or logistic) function, has asymptotes of 0 for t &lt;&lt; t 0 , and d for t &gt;&gt; t 0 . The function transitions quickly, but smoothly, between the two states near t = t 0 , where it takes on a value of d/2. By using a sigmoid and avoiding the discontinuities present in the models used by the original Marshall algorithm ) we can use the L-BFGS-B algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Byrd et al. 1995</ref>) available in the Scipy package 25 instead of the less robust Nelder-Mead.</p><p>The second function in equation A10 models a discrete jump in the data. We fit this model seeded with a negative-going dip at the predicted time of ingress, and also with a positive-going spike at the predicted egress, as we see both types of features in Kepler data. The third model fits a Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Drop (SPSD) <ref type="bibr">25</ref> www.scipy.org event, probably caused by a cosmic ray hit on the detector. The last model approximates a box transit. By varying the parameter γ we could in principle model transit ingress and egress, but find that extra degree of freedom is not necessary to fit the low signal-to-noise events of most concern.</p><p>For each transit the Marshall method returns the BIC score, the preferred model, and the difference between the BIC scores of the preferred model and the sigmoid box fit. A transit is considered sufficiently bad when this difference (also known as the Marshall score) exceeds a particular threshold, as with the original Marshall algorithm. However, in a few cases the Gaussian process fails and yields extremely large, unbelievable BIC values. In these cases the transit is set to always pass. Also, for low MES transits, the expected SES of a transit is sufficiently low that Marshall will be unable to distinguish between the "no transit" model and a low signal-to-noise transit. Because of this the Robovetter declares a specific transit is not valid if all of the following criteria are met:</p><p>• The BIC score of the best-fitting non-transit model is at least 10 lower than the BIC of the transitmodel</p><p>• The BIC score of the best-fitting non-transit model is less than 1.0E6</p><p>• Either MES/ √ N RealTrans &gt; 4.0 or the lowest BIC model is for the constant offset model, Note, N RealTrans is the total number of observed transit events for the TCE. The Marshall code used for the DR25 KOI catalog is available on sourceforge 26 .</p><p>A.3.7.3. Chases -SES artifacts -The Chases metric was developed to chase-down non-transit like events on long period, low MES TCEs. Qualitatively, the metric mimics the human vetting preference to classify a TCE as a PC when individual transit events "stand-out" as a unique, transit-like signal from a visual inspection of the Kepler flux time-series data. In order to quantify this human vetting preference, we developed the the Chases algorithm. Chases uses the SES time series generated by the TPS module of the Kepler Pipeline (Jenkins 2017b). The SES time series measures the significance of a transit signal centered on every cadence. Details of calculating the SES time series is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Jenkins et al. (2002)</ref> and illustrative examples are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Tenenbaum et al. (2012)</ref>. A transit produces a peak in the SES time series (as do systematic signals). TPS searches the SES time series for equally spaced peaks indicative of a series of transits. The series of individual peaks in the SES time series are combined to form the MES employed as the primary threshold for detecting a transit signal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Jenkins et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Twicken et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenkins 2017b</ref>).</p><p>The Chases metric quantifies how well the SES peaks contributing to a TCE approximate the expected shape and significance (relative to neighboring data) of a bona fide transit signal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 17</ref>  The Chases metric for an individual transit event is formulated by identifying the maximum SES value for cadences in transit, SES max (in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 17</ref>, SES max ≈ 20). Next, excluding cadences within 1.5τ dur of mid transit (to avoid the symmetric side troughs), where τ dur is the detected transit duration, the SES time series is searched for ∆ t , the temporally closest feature to mid transit in the absolute value of the SES time series, |SES|. A feature is defined as when |SES| &gt; f SES max , where f represents a tunable fraction of the peak in the SES time series. Finally, we define a maximum window ∆ tmax = P orb /10 with which to search for a comparable peak in |SES|, and form the final Chases metric for an individual transit event as C i = min(∆ t , ∆ tmax )/∆ tmax .</p><p>A value of C i = 1 indicates that there is no comparable peak/trough in the SES time series within f of SES max over the interval ∆ tmax of the transit signal. Thus, Ch i = 1 is consistent with a unique, transit-like signal. A value of Ch i ≈ 0 indicates that a comparable strength feature is present in the SES time series temporally close to the transit event, and is consistent with the human vetting tendency to dismiss such signals as spurious. <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref> shows an example of a spurious TCE detection on the target KIC 11449918. The target is on a detector suffering from elevated levels of the "rolling-band" image artifacts as described in §A.3.7.4. The neighboring peak of comparable strength in the SES time series would result in Ch i ≈ 0 for this individual transit event. The Chases metric is also sensitive to the shape of the transit signal as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 19</ref>. The SPSD shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 19</ref> is a spurious instrumental signal with an asymmetric shape. Because Chases uses the absolute value of the SES, Ch i ≈ 0 for these types of events.</p><p>For each TCE with five or fewer transit events contributing to the signal, Ch i is calculated for every transit event. With more than five transit events, the individual transit events are not expected to be statistically significant, and the assumptions of the Chases metric no longer apply. The individual transit event Ch i values were used to recalculate the MES (see §A.3.7). Transit events with Ch i &lt; 0.01 were excluded from the Robovetter's MES calculation. ure 20 for an example of the anomalous peaks seen in some skygroups when the data is binned in this way.</p><p>To determine which events are anomalous, for each skygroup, we compute the average rate (R) of transits, by dividing the overall number of individual transit events in the skygroup by the number of 1.0 d bins. Assuming the majority of transits are randomly distributed in time, and utilizing Poisson counting statistics, any peaks greater than:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">threshold = R + N · √ R (A12)</formula><p>are statistically significant and indicative of temporal clustering, given a chosen value for N . We choose a value of N = 3.0, and robustly determine the rate for each skygroup by first computing the threshold using all the bins, then iteratively rejecting all bins with a height greater than threshold and re-computing threshold until it converges and does not change with further iterations.</p><p>For each skygroup and its threshold, we identify the individual times-of-transit for TCEs belonging to the skygroup that fall in bins that are above the threshold. We assign Skye a value of 1.0 to these individual transits to indicate they are bad transits. The Skye value for all other transit times are set to zero. The Skye code is publicly available on github 27 .</p><p>A.3.7.5. Zuma -Negative Significance -A valid transitlike TCE should be comprised of individual events that correspond to flux decrements. If any event instead shows an increase of flux then that event is suspect. We thus designate any individual transit event with SES &lt; 0 as "bad".</p><p>A.3.7.6. Tracker -Ephemeris Slip -After the TPS module of the Kepler Pipeline detects a TCE, it is sent to DV to be fit with a full transit model. DV allows the period and epoch to vary when fitting in order to provide as accurate a fit as possible. Sometimes the TPS ephemeris and DV ephemeris can end up significantly different. When this occurs it indicates that the underlying data is not transit-like and the TCE is likely due to quasi-sinusoidal systematics, which cause the ephemeris to wander when fitting.</p><p>Tracker measures (i.e., keeps track of) the time difference between the TPS and DV linear ephemerides in units of the TCE's duration for each transit. When has a strong clustering of transit events at times that correspond to the ∼372 day orbital period of the spacecraft, as the stars belonging to skygroup 58 fall on CCD channels with strong rolling-band signal. In contrast, skygroup 55 is nearly uniform. Individual transits that occur in a one-day time bin with a number of transit events above the threshold (shown by the blue horizontal line; see Equation A12) are flagged as bad transits due to the Skye metric.</p><p>Tracker is greater than 0.5 T dur for any transit we designate the transit as bad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.8. Fraction of Gapped Events</head><p>Due to the method of data gapping employed in TPS, sometimes the Kepler Pipeline can create a TCE that has a majority of its individual events occur where there is no actual in-transit data. This tends to happen particularly in multi-TCE systems, because once the Kepler Pipeline detects a TCE in a given system, it removes the data corresponding to the in-transit cadences of that TCE, and re-searches the light curve.</p><p>We thus measure the number of individual transit events that actually contain data. Specifically, we compute the fraction of individual events with either SES = 0 or Rubble &gt; 0.75, which indicate there is sufficient in-cadence data present. If the fraction of transits meeting these criteria is ≤ 0.5, we fail the TCE as not transit-like and give it the flag TRANS_GAPPED.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.9. No Data Available</head><p>In a very small number of cases, neither the DV nor the ALT detrending produces a light curve and model fit for a TCE. This happens when the TCE is extremely not transit-like, usually due to a combination of severe systematics and a lack of substantial in-transit data. As a result, if no data from either detrending is available, the Robovetter fails a TCE as not transit-like.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4. Stellar Eclipse</head><p>If a TCE is deemed transit-like by passing all of the tests presented in §A.3 on both detrendings, it is given a KOI number (see flowchart in <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref>). However, many of these KOIs are FPs due to eclipsing binaries and contamination from nearby variable stars. We employ a series of robotic tests to detect systems that are due to stellar companions, as shown by the flowchart in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 21</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4.1. Secondary Eclipse</head><p>One of the most common methods to detect a stellar system is the presence of a significant secondary in the light curve. With the exception of some hot Jupiter type planets (e.g., HAT-P-7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2009</ref>), the visibility of a secondary eclipse in Kepler data is a telltale sign of a stellar eclipsing binary.</p><p>A.4.1.1. Subsequent TCE With Same Period -Once the Kepler Pipeline detects a TCE in a given system, it removes the data corresponding to this event and researches the light curve. It is thus able to detect the secondary eclipse of an eclipsing binary as a subsequent TCE, which will have the same period, but different epoch, as the primary TCE. Thus, using equations A1-A3, the Robovetter dispositions a TCE as a stellar system FP if its period matches a subsequent TCE within the specified tolerance (σ P &gt; 3.25) and they are separated in phase by at least 2.5 times the transit duration. For clarity, we note again that it is sometimes possible that the periods of two TCEs will meet the period matching criteria, but be different enough to have their epochs shift significantly in phase over the ∼4 year mission duration. The phase separation requirement must <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 21</ref>. Flowchart describing the stellar eclipse tests of the Robovetter. Diamonds represent "yes" or "no" decisions that are made with quantitative metrics. The multiple arrows originating from "Start" represent decisions that are made in parallel.</p><p>be upheld over the entire mission duration in order to disposition the TCE as an FP due to a stellar eclipse.</p><p>Occasionally the Kepler Pipeline will detect the secondary eclipse of an eclipsing binary at half, third, or some smaller integer fraction of the orbital period of the system. In these cases, the epoch of the TCE corresponding to the secondary will overlap with that of the primary. These cases are accounted for by not requiring a phase separation of at least 2.5 transit durations when a period ratio other than unity is detected. (Note that equations A1-A3 allow for integer period ratios.) While this approach will likely classify any multi-planet system in an exact 2:1 orbital resonance as an FP due to a stellar eclipse, in practice this is non-existent. Exact 2:1 orbital resonances, where "exact" means the period ratio is close enough to 2.0 over the ∼4 year mission duration to avoid any drift in relative epoch, appear to be extremely rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fabrycky et al. 2014</ref>). Also, they might produce strong transit timing variations, which would likely preclude their detection. The Kepler Pipeline employs a strictly linear ephemeris when searching for TCEs, and thus while planets with mild transit timing variations (TTVs), e.g., deviations from a linear ephemeris less than the transit duration, are often detected, planets with strong TTVs, e.g., deviations from a linear ephemeris greater than the transit duration, are often not detected.</p><p>A.4.1.2. Secondary Detected in Light Curve -There are many cases when a secondary eclipse does not produce its own TCE, most often when its MES is below the Kepler Pipeline detection threshold of 7.1. The modelshift uniqueness test, discussed in §A.3.4, is well-suited to automatically detect secondary eclipses in the phased light curve, as it searches for the next two deepest events aside from the primary event. It is thus able to detect the best-candidate secondary eclipse in the light curve and assess its significance. We compute the following quantities to use as secondary detection metrics</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">M S 4 = σ Sec /F Red − F A 1 (A13) M S 5 = (σ Sec − σ Ter ) − F A 2 (A14) M S 6 = (σ Sec − σ Pos ) − F A 2 (A15)</formula><p>Recall that σ indicates a significance and was defined in §A.3.4. If M S 4 &gt;1, M S 5 &gt;0, and M S 6 &gt;0, in either the DV or alternate detrendings, the Robovetter dispositions the TCE as a stellar system FP. These criteria ensure that the secondary event is statistically significant when compared to the systematic noise level of the light curve, the tertiary event, and the positive event, respectively.</p><p>A.4.1.3. Candidates with Stellar Eclipses -There are two exceptions when the above-mentioned conditions are met, but the Robovetter does not designate the TCE as an FP. First, if the primary and secondary widths and depths are statistically indistinguishable, and the secondary is located at phase 0.5, then it is possible that the TCE is a PC that has been detected at twice the true orbital period. Thus, the Robovetter labels a TCE with a stellar eclipse as a PC when σ Pri − σ Sec &lt; F A 2 and the phase of the secondary is within 1/4 of the primary transit's duration of phase 0.5. Second, hot Jupiter PCs can have detectable secondary eclipses due to planetary occultations via reflected light and thermal emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Coughlin &amp; López-Morales 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Christiansen et al. 2010</ref>). Thus, a TCE with a detected stellar eclipse is labeled as a PC with the stellar eclipse flag (in order to facilitate the identification of hot Jupiter occultations) when the geometric albedo required to produce the observed secondary eclipse is less than 1.0, the planetary radius is less than 30 R ⊕ , the depth of the secondary is less than 10% of the primary, and the impact parameter is less than 0.95. The additional criteria beyond the albedo criterion are needed to ensure that this test is only applied to potentially valid planets and not grazing eclipsing binaries. We calculate the geometric albedo by using the stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature from the DR25 stellar catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017)</ref>, and the values of the period and radius ratio from the original DV fits.</p><p>A.4.1.4. Odd/Even Depth Difference -If the primary and secondary eclipses of eclipsing binaries are similar in depth, and the secondary is located near phase 0.5, the Kepler Pipeline may detect them as a single TCE at half the true orbital period of the eclipsing binary. In these cases, if the primary and secondary depths are dissimilar enough, it is possible to detect it as an FP by comparing the depths of the odd-and even-numbered transit events and their associated uncertainties, via the following statistic,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">σ OE = abs (d odd − d even ) σ 2 odd + σ 2 even (A16)</formula><p>where d odd is the measured depth using the oddnumbered transits, with associated uncertainty σ odd , d even is the measured depth using the even-numbered transits, with associated uncertainty σ even , and abs() returns the absolute value. We use two different methods to compute d odd , σ odd , d even , σ even , and thus σ OE , for both for the DV and ALT detrending. For the first method, the depths are computed by taking the median of all the points near the center of all transits, and the uncertainty is the standard deviation of those points, both using only the odd-or even-numbered transits. For the ALT detrending with a trapezoidal fit, we use all points that lie within ±30 minutes of the central time of transit, as well as any other points within the in-transit flat portion of the trapezoidal fit. For the DV detrending, we use all points within ±30 minutes of the central time of transit. (This threshold corresponds to the long-cadence integration time of the Kepler spacecraft. Including points farther away from the central time of transit degrades the accuracy and precision of the test.) If σ OE &gt; 1.1 for either the DV or ALT detrending then the TCE is labeled as an FP due to a secondary eclipse and given the DEPTH_ODDEVEN_DV and/or DEPTH_ ODDEVEN_ALT flag(s). The value of 1.1 was empirically derived using manual checks and transit injection. This method is very robust to outliers and systematics, but not extremely sensitive as it does not take into account the full transit shape to measure the depth.</p><p>The second method measures the depths and uncertainties by running the model-shift test separately on the portions of the light curve within half a phase of the odd-and even-numbered transits. Model-shift measures the depths and associated uncertainties using the entire transit model and taking into account the measured noise level of the entire light curve. This method is more sensitive to small odd/even differences, but also more sensitive to outliers and light curve systematics compared to the above method. If σ OE &gt; 11.2 for the DV detrending, or &gt; 19.8 for the ALT detrending, then the TCE is labeled as an FP due to a stellar eclipse and given the MOD_ODDEVEN_DV and/or MOD_ ODDEVEN_ALT flag(s). The thresholds of 11.2 and 19.8 were empirically derived using manual checks and transit injection. This method is susceptible to outliers and systematics (and why the thresholds are set fairly high), but can also detect small, yet significant odd/even differences that the other method listed above cannot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4.2. Out of Eclipse Variability</head><p>Short-period eclipsing binaries will often show out-ofeclipse variability due to tidal forces that deform the star from a perfect spheroid. The variability manifests as quasi-sinusoidal variations at either the period, or half the period, of the binary.</p><p>We use the information from SWEET (see §A.3.2) to detect these cases. If a transit-like TCE has a SWEET SNR greater than 50, an amplitude less than the TCE transit depth in either the DV and ALT detrendings, an amplitude greater than 5,000 ppm, and a period less than 10 days, we fail it as a stellar system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4.3. V-Shape Metric</head><p>There are cases of eclipsing binaries that do not show a secondary eclipse, either due to the secondary star being too low luminosity for the eclipse to be detectable, or the binary has significant eccentricity and a longitude of periastron such that geometrically no eclipse occurs. Also, most detached eclipsing binaries will not exhibit detectable out-of-eclipse variability. In these cases, the only remaining way to infer that the signal is due to a stellar system and not a planet is to utilize the shape and depth of the transit.</p><p>In previous catalogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rowe et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Mullally et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016</ref>) TCEs were not failed based on their inferred radii alone. This was deliberate as the catalogs attempted to be as agnostic to stellar parameters as possible, such that dispositions would remain applicable if and when better stellar parameters were obtained, e.g., by GAIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cacciari 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Mignard 2005)</ref>. This resulted in some PC KOIs with large depths that were known to very likely be eclipsing binaries, and in fact were later confirmed as such by follow-up observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santerne et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this catalog, we attempt to strike a balance between identifying these binary systems, while still remaining agnostic to stellar parameters. We adapted a simple shape parameter, originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Batalha et al. (2013)</ref>, and express it as the sum of the modeled radius ratio and the impact parameter. This metric reliably identifies eclipsing binaries both due to being too deep (large R p /R ) and due to grazing eclipses (large impact parameter, b). Specifically we fail a transit-like TCE as a stellar system if R p /R + b &gt; 1.04.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5. Centroid Offset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5.1. Centroid Robovetter</head><p>The Robovetter relies on a piece of code called the Centroid Robovetter 28 (Mullally 2017) to detect when a transit signal originates from a background or nearby star instead of from the target star. The Centroid Robovetter has not changed since its implementation for the DR24 KOI catalog; we summarize it below for completeness.</p><p>Given that Kepler 's pixels are 3.98 square ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Koch et al. 2010)</ref>, and the typical photometric aperture has a radius of 4-7 pixels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bryson et al. 2010)</ref>, it is quite common for a given target star to be contaminated by light from another star. If that other star is variable, then that variability will be visible in the target aperture at a reduced amplitude. If the variability due to contamination results in a TCE, then it is a false positive, whether 28 https://sourceforge.net/projects/ keplercentroidrobovetter/ the contaminator is an eclipsing binary, planet, or other type of variable star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>). For example, if a transit or an eclipse occurs on a bright star, a shallower event may be observed on a nearby, fainter star. Similarly, a star can be mistakenly identified as experiencing a shallow transit if a deep eclipse occurs on a fainter, nearby source.</p><p>The DV module of the Kepler Pipeline produces difference images for each quarter, which are made by subtracting the average flux in each pixel during each transit from the flux in each pixel just before, and after, each transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>). If the resulting difference image shows significant flux at a location (centroid) other than the target, then the TCE is likely an FP due to a centroid offset.</p><p>In our robotic procedure to detect FPs due to centroid offsets, we first check that the difference image for each quarter contains a discernible stellar image and is not dominated by background noise. This is done by searching for at least 3 pixels that are adjacent to each other and brighter than a given threshold, which is set by the noise properties of the image. We use an iterative sigma clipping approach to eliminate bright pixels when calculating the background noise, as the star often dominates the flux budget of a substantial number of pixels in the aperture.</p><p>For the difference images that are determined to contain a discernible stellar image, we first search for evidence of contamination from sources that are resolved from the target. Since resolved sources near the edge of the image may not be fully captured, attempts to fit models of the stellar profile often fail to converge. Instead, we check if the location of the brightest pixel in the difference image is more than 1.5 pixels from the location of the target star. If at least two-thirds of the quarterly difference images show evidence of an offset by this criterion, we disposition the TCE as an FP due to a centroid offset.</p><p>If no centroid offset is identified by the previous method, we then look for contamination from sources that are unresolved from the target. We fit a model of the pixel response function (PRF) to the difference images and search for statistically significant shifts in the centroid with respect to the PRF centroid of the outof-transit images, or the catalog position of the source. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bryson et al. (2013)</ref>, a TCE is marked as an FP due to a centroid offset if there are at least three difference images with a discernible stellar image, and a 3σ significant offset larger than 2 , or a 4σ offset larger than 1 is measured.</p><p>The Centroid Robovetter gives the Kepler Robovetter several flags to indicate whether a centroid offset was detected and whether that detection can be trusted. The names of those flags have been changed for DR25 to be consistent with our minor flag naming scheme. A list of the minor flags are available in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5.2. Ghost Diagnostic</head><p>The last method we use to detect a centroid offset is the ghost diagnostic, which was added to the DR25 Kepler Pipeline (see § 11.3.7 of Jenkins 2017b). It determines whether a transit signal is likely contamination from a ghost image of a star located away from the target star in the focal plane. Ghost reflections occur when light from a bright star is reflected off the CCD and again from the field flattener plate and back onto the CCD. It appears as a diffuse, out-of-focus image of the pupil of the telescope. A similar type of false positive results from direct PRF (Pixel Response Function) contamination, when flux from the broad wings of a bright star near the target star on the CCD overlaps the target star's PRF. If a ghost reflection (or the PRF of a nearby star) containing a transit-like signature (e.g. an eclipsing binary signal) overlaps the PRF of the target star, then the contaminating transit signal will be equally strong in the periphery and the core of the target.</p><p>To detect this type of false alarm, the ghost diagnostic essentially measures the strength of the TCE signal in two separate light curves -one created using the average of the pixels inside the target's optimal aperture minus the average of the pixels in an annulus surrounding the target aperture (core aperture correlation statistic), and the other using the average of the pixels in the annulus surrounding the target aperture (halo aperture correlation statistic). If the ratio of the halo aperture to core aperture statistic is greater than 4.0, the TCE is marked as an FP with the major flag set to Centroid Offset. This ghost diagnostic is not available to vet the scrTCEs and thus the reliability measured with that set of TCEs will be too small by an insignificant amount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.6. Ephemeris Matching</head><p>Another method for detecting FPs due to contamination is to compare the ephemerides (periods and epochs) of TCEs to each other, as well as other known variable sources in the Kepler field. If two targets have the same ephemeris within a specified tolerance, then at least one of them is an FP due to contamination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> used Q1-Q12 data to compare the ephemerides of KOIs to each other and eclipsing binaries known from both Kepler -and ground-based observations. They identified over 600 FPs via ephemeris matching, of which over 100 were not known as FPs via other methods. They also identified four main mechanisms of contamination. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> were incorporated in <ref type="bibr">Rowe et al. (2015b, see §3.</ref>3), and with some small modifications to <ref type="bibr">Mullally et al. (2015, see §5.</ref>3) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>We modified the matching criteria used in previous catalogs to improve performance. We use the results of the transit injection run ( §2.3) to measure the ability of the original DV fits by the Kepler Pipeline to recover period and epoch as a function of period. (Note that while the DV fits do produce an error on the measured period, it is not a robustly measured error, and thus not sufficient for our purposes.) In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 22</ref> we show, in the top two panels, the difference in the injected and recovered period and epoch, as a function of the injected period. The bottom panels show the measured standard deviation of the difference as a function of period, in linear and logarithmic space respectively. The red line is the result of a best-fit power law.</p><p>When comparing two objects, A and B, where A is defined to have the shorter period, the new matching metrics we use, S P and S T for period and epoch respectively, are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">S P = |P r · P A − P B | √ 2 · σ P (P A ) (A17) S T = |T A − T B − T r · P A | √ 2 · σ T (P A )<label>(A18)</label></formula><p>where P A and P B are the periods of objects A and B, T A and T B are similarly the epochs of objects A and B, σ P (P A ) and σ T (P A ) are the errors in period and epoch, given period P A , derived from the best-fit power law to the standard deviation of the injected versus recovered periods and epochs, respectively. The period ratio, P r , and epoch ratio, T r , are defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P r = rint P B P A (A19) T r = rint T A − T B P A (A20)</formula><p>where rint() rounds a number to the nearest integer. Thus, a perfect match has S P = 0 and S T = 0, with worse matches having increasingly larger values of S P and S T . We consider matches with S P &lt; 5 and S T &lt; 5, with period ratios of 50 or less (P r &lt; 50), to be statistically significant enough to constitute a match. We also require:</p><p>1. The two objects do not have the same KIC ID, 2. The two objects satisfy at least one of the following conditions:</p><p>(a) A separation distance less than d max arcseconds, where d max ( ) = 55 · 10 6 · 10 −0.4·m kep + 1 (A21) with the Kepler magnitude of the brighter source being used for m kep , (b) Located on opposite sides of the field-of-view center, but equidistant from the center to within a 100 (25 pixel) tolerance. (c) Located on the same CCD module and within 5 pixels of the same column value in any of the 4 quarters.</p><p>(d) Located on the same CCD module and within 5 pixels of the same row and column value in any of the 4 quarters.</p><p>Criterion 1 ensures that no star is ever matched to itself. Criterion 2a is a semi-empirically determined formula derived to account for direct PRF contamination and reflection off the field flattener lens, assuming the average wings of a Kepler PSF can be approximated by a Lorentzian distribution. The formula allows for any two stars to match within a generous 55 range, but allows for bright stars to match to larger distances, e.g., a 10 th mag star could match up to 550 away, and a 5th mag star could match up to 5500 away. Criterion 2b accounts for antipodal reflection off the Schmidt Corrector. Criterion 2c accounts for the column anomaly (see §3.5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Coughlin et al. 2016)</ref>, and criterion 2d accounts for video crosstalk.

The Kepler magnitude of each star is shown via a scaled point size. Most parent-child pairs are so close together that the line connecting them is not easily visible on the scale of the plot.</p><p>Since Kepler does not observe every star in its field of view, it can often be the case that a match is found between two objects, but given their relative magnitude, distance, and depths it is clear that neither is the parent of the other, so these are classified as "bastards" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Coughlin et al. 2014</ref>). To identify the bastards due to direct PRF contamination, we performed a robust fit of the Kepler PRF model described by equations 9 and 10 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> to the depth ratio, magnitude difference, and distance between each object identified as due to direct PRF contamination and its most likely parent. After iteratively rejecting outliers greater than 4.0 times the standard deviation, the fit converged with values of α = 6.93 and γ = 0.358 . Outliers greater <ref type="bibr">29</ref> https://github.com/JeffLCoughlin/EphemMatch than 4.0 times the standard deviation of the final iteration, with these resulting fit parameters, were labeled as bastards. For the mechanism of column anomaly and reflection, if the depth ratio of the two objects is between 0.01 and 100, then it is labeled as a bastard, as these mechanisms should produce depth ratios of at least 1E-3 or 1E3. All bastards are identified with a flag of 1 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 8</ref>. Additionally, it can sometimes be the case that objects are matched via the column anomaly, but are on different outputs of the same module -these cases likely involve the column anomaly working in conjunction with cross-talk, and thus are complicated, and given a flag of 2 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 8</ref>. Finally, a flag of 3 indicates a combination of flags 1 and 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.7. Informational Only Tests</head><p>There are a couple tests that the Robovetter performs that do not influence the disposition of a TCE. While failing one of these tests indicates a likely FP, it is not reliable enough to declare a TCE an FP. Instead, TCEs that fail these tests are given information only flags (see §B) as a way to notify users that a manual inspection of the TCE and the Robovetter results is likely warranted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.7.1. Planet In Star</head><p>In some cases, the DV fit returns a semi-major axis of the planetary orbit that is smaller than the radius of the host star. Such a fit is unphysical, as the planet would be orbiting inside the star; this is usually indicative of an FP. However, since many of the stellar parameters have large errors and their accuracy can vary, this situation does not guarantee the TCE is an FP. Thus, if a TCE is dispositioned as transit-like (the NT flag is not set), and if the semi-major axis from the DV fit is less than the stellar radius from the DR25 stellar properties catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mathur et al. 2017)</ref>, the TCE is flagged as PLANET_ IN_STAR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.7.2. Seasonal Depth Differences</head><p>Due to the Kepler spacecraft's rotation every ≈90 days, each target and the surrounding stars will fall on a new CCD every quarter, and return to the same CCD once every four quarters. All of the quarters that correspond to the same CCD are labeled as being in a given season (e.g., Q2, Q6, Q10, and Q14 belong to Season 0, Q3, Q7, Q11, and Q15 belong to Season 1, etc., <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Thompson et al. 2016a</ref>). The shape and size of the optimal aperture for a given star is seasonally dependant and can change significantly season-to-season. As a result, a target will have differing amounts of third light in its optimal aperture from nearby stars. If the source of the signal that triggers a TCE is not from the target star, but rather from another source (as just discussed in §A.5 and §A.6), the level of contamination, and thus observed depth of the TCE, will have significant seasonal variation. Observation of seasonal depth differences is usually a good </p><formula xml:id="formula_24">· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·</formula><p>Note-A suffix of "pri" in the parent name indicates the object is an eclipsing binary known from the ground, and the child TCE matches to its primary. Similarly a suffix of "sec" indicates the child TCE matches the secondary of a ground-based EB. Parent names are listed, in priority order when available, by (1) their Bayer designation (e.g., RR-Lyr-pri), (2) their EBWG (Eclipsing Binary Working Group; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kirk et al. 2016</ref>) designation (e.g., 002449084-pri), (3) their KOI number (e.g., 3924.01), and (4) their TCE number (e.g., 001724968-01). A flag of 1 indicates that the TCE is a bastard, which are cases where two or more TCEs match each other via the Direct-PRF contamination mechanism, but neither can physically be the parent of the other via their magnitudes, depths, and distances, and thus the true parent has not been identified. A flag of 2 indicates cases of column anomalies that occur on different outputs of the same module. These cases likely involve cross-talk to carry the signal from one output to another. TCEs due to the common systematic do not have information listed for a parent source, as they are not caused by a single parent.

However, depth differences can also arise when the signal is truly coming from the target, but significant third light exists in the aperture and the seasonal variations are not sufficiently corrected. In order to automatically detect seasonal depth differences, if a TCE has been dispositioned as transit-like (the NT flag is not set), we measure the depth and associated error of the primary event in each season utilizing the first method described in the second paragraph of §A.4.1.4, i.e., we compute the median and standard deviation of all the points within ±15 minutes of the center of transit. We then obtain an average depth over all seasons, D a , by computing the mean of the depths of all four seasons.</p><p>The significance of the seasonal depth differences, S Diff , is then computed via,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">S Diff = 3 n=0 |D n − D a | 3 n=0 σ 2 n + N · σ 2 a (A22)</formula><p>where n denotes a particular season (0, 1, 2, or 3), N is the total number of seasons with a measured depth and uncertainty, D n is the measured depth in a given season, σ n is the measured error on the depth in a given season, D a is the measured averaged depth, and σ a is the measured error of the average depth, given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">σ a = 3 n=0 σ 2 n N (A23)</formula><p>For either the DV or ALT detrending, if S Diff &gt; 3.6 then the TCE is flagged as having significant seasonal depth differences via the flag SEASONAL_DEPTH_ (ALT|DV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.7.3. Period Aliasing</head><p>In some cases, the Kepler Pipeline detects a signal (and produces a TCE) that is at an integer multiple of the signal's true period. In most cases, this is due to the presence of seasonal depth differences, as the Pipeline ends up only locking onto events in the quarters with the strongest (deepest) signal. While this usually indicates an FP due to a centroid offset, as discussed in A.7.2, it is not a definitive measure. Also, the Pipeline will detect real planets with significant TTVs at longer (near integer multiple) periods.</p><p>In order to detect a period alias, we utilize the Modelshift results -if the TCE's period is an integer multiple of the signal's true period, then several, equally spaced events should be visible in the phased light curve. If the TCE has been dispositioned as transit-like (the NT flag is not set), the Robovetter first checks if Model-shift detected significant secondary and tertiary events, by ensuring that σ Sec /F Red &gt; F A 1 and σ Ter /F Red &gt; F A 1 . If so, the phases of the secondary and tertiary events, φ Sec and φ Ter , are then expressed as the absolute value of the their distance in phase from the primary event, i.e., constrained to be between 0.0 and 0.5. (For example, if secondary and tertiary events were initially detected at phases of 0.1 and 0.7, then φ Sec = 0.1 and φ Ter = 0.3.) If period aliasing is present, then φ Sec and φ Ter should Ground-Based EB <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 23</ref>. Distribution of ephemeris matches on the focal plane. Symbol size scales with magnitude, while color represents the catalog in which the contaminating source was found. Blue indicates that the true transit is from a variable star only known as a result of ground-based observations. Red circles are stars listed in the Kepler EBWG catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kirk et al. 2016</ref>, http://keplerebs.villanova.edu/), green are KOIs, and black are TCEs. Black lines connect false positive matches with the most likely contaminating parent. In most cases parent and child are so close that the connecting line is invisible. a possible period alias is seen at a ratio of N :1, where N is an integer of 3 or greater. This indicates the TCE has likely been detected at a period that is N times longer than the true orbital period. This flag is currently informational only and not used to declare any TCE an FP. See §A.7.3.</p><p>PLANET_IN_STAR: The original DV planet fits indicate that the fitted semi-major axis of the planet is smaller than the stellar radius. As it is possible that the stellar data is not accurate, this flag is currently informational only and not used to declare any TCE an FP. See §A.7.1.</p><p>PLANET_OCCULT_(ALT|DV): A significant secondary eclipse was detected in the ALT or DV detrending, but it was determined to possibly be due to planetary reflection and/or thermal emission. While the stellar eclipse major flag remains set, the TCE is dispositioned as a PC. See §A.4.1.3. PLANET_PERIOD_IS_HALF_(ALT|DV): A significant secondary eclipse was detected in the ALT or DV detrending, but it was determined to be the same depth as the primary within the uncertainties. Thus, the TCE is possibly a PC that was detected at twice the true orbital period. When this flag is set, it acts as an override to other flags such that the stellar eclipse major flag is not set, and thus the TCE is dispositioned as a PC if no other major flags are set. See §A.4.1.3.</p><p>RESIDUAL_TCE: The TCE has the same period and epoch as a previous transit-like TCE. This indicates the current TCE is simply a residual artifact of the previous TCE that was not completely removed from the light curve. Thus, the current TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.6. SAME_NTL_PERIOD: The current TCE has the same period as a previous TCE that was dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. This indicates that the current TCE is due to the same not transit-like signal. Thus, the current TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.6. SEASONAL_DEPTH_(ALT|DV): There appears to be a significant difference in the computed TCE depth from different seasons using the ALT or DV detrending. This indicates significant light contamination, usually due to a bright star at the edge of the aperture, which may or may not be the origin of the transit-like event. As it is impossible to determine whether or not the TCE is on-target from this flag alone, it is currently informational only and not used to declare any TCE an FP. See §A.7.2.</p><p>SWEET_EB: The sine wave event evaluation test (SWEET) is above threshold, the detected signal has an amplitude less than the TCE's depth, and the TCE period is less than 5 days. This flag indicates that there is a significant sinusoidal variability in the PDC data at the same period as the TCE due to out-of-eclipse EB variability. The transit-like TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.2.</p><p>SWEET_NTL: The sine wave event evaluation test (SWEET) is above threshold, the detected signal has an amplitude greater than the TCE's depth, and the TCE period is less than 5 days. This flag indicates that there is a significant sinusoidal variability in the PDC data at the same period as the TCE, and the detected event is due to stellar variability and not a transit. The TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.2.</p><p>TRANS_GAPPED: The fraction of gapped transit events is above threshold. This flag indicates that a large number of observable transits had insufficient in-cadence data. The TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set.

(2014) argues that almost all multi- planet, transit systems are real. Forty-seven, or 21%, of the new DR25 PCs are associated with targets with multiple PCs. One of the new PCs, KOI 82.06, is part of a six candidate system around the star Kepler -102. Five candidates have previously been confirmed (Marcy et al. 2014; Rowe et al. 2014) in this system. The new candidate is the largest radius confirmed planet in the system. It also lies a bit outside the 4:3 resonance; pos- sibly adding to the excess of planets found just wide of such first-order resonances (Lissauer et al. 2011a). If verified, this would be only the 3rd system with six or more planets found by Kepler. The other new candidate within a high multiplicity system is KOI 2926.05. The other four candidates in this system around Kepler -1388 have been validated by</figDesc><table></table></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. MINOR FALSE POSITIVE FLAG DEFINITIONS</head><p>The Robovetter produces a flag each time it gives a disposition of FP, and sometimes when it gives a disposition of PC. Here we give a definition for each flag. Table reft:minorstats shows the number and percentage of obsTCEs (not including rogue and banned) that were flagged with each minor flag. These flags are available for the KOIs through the comment column in the KOI table at the Exoplanet Archive. See the Robovetter output files <ref type="bibr">30</ref> for the flags for all the obsTCEs, injTCEs, invTCEs, scrTCEs. A summary of the Robovetter metrics is given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>ALL_TRANS_CHASES: This flag is set when the per TCE Chases metric is above threshold. This indicates that the shapes of the individual transits are generally not reliable and the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.3.</p><p>CENT_CROWDED: This flag is set as a warning that more than one potential stellar image was found in the difference image, and thus a reliable centroid measurement cannot be obtained. See §A.5.1. CENT_FEW_DIFFS: Fewer than 3 difference images of sufficiently high SNR are available, and thus very few tests in the pipeline's centroid module are applica- <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The Robovetter output files have the format kplr_dr25_ XXX_robovetter_output.txt (XXX represents the data set name) and can be found in the Robovetter github repository, https: //github.com/nasa/kepler-robovetter ble to the TCE. If this flag is set in conjunction with the CENT_RESOLVED_OFFSET flag, it serves as a warning that the source of the transit may be on a star clearly resolved from the target. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_FEW_MEAS: The PRF centroid fit used by the pipeline's centroid module does not always converge, even in high SNR difference images. This flag is set as a warning if centroid offsets are recorded for fewer than 3 high SNR difference images. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_INVERT_DIFF: One or more difference images were inverted, meaning the difference image claims the star got brighter during transit. This is usually due to variability of the target star and suggests the difference image should not be trusted. When this flag is set, it is a warning that the TCE requires further scrutiny, but the TCE is not marked as an FP due to a centroid offset. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_KIC_POS: This measured offset distance is relative to the star's recorded position in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), not the out of transit centroid. Both are useful, since the KIC position is less accurate in sparse fields, but more accurate in crowded fields. If this is the only flag set, there is no reason to believe a statistically significant centroid shift is present. See §A.5.1. CENT_NOFITS: The transit was not fit by a model in DV and thus no difference images were created for use by the pipeline's centroid module, so this flag is set as a warning that the TCE cannot be evaluated. This flag is typically set for very deep transits due to eclipsing binaries. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_RESOLVED_OFFSET: The TCE has a significant centroid offset because the transit occurs on a star that is spatially resolved from the target. The TCE is marked as an FP with the centroid offset flag set unless one of the other Centroid Robovetter flags is also set, casting doubt on the measurement. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_SATURATED: The star is saturated, so the Robovetter's centroiding assumptions break down. This flag is set as a warning, indicating that the TCE cannot be reliably evaluated. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_UNCERTAIN: The significance of the centroid offset cannot be measured to high enough precision, so this flag is set as a warning that the TCE cannot be confidently dispositioned as an FP. This is typically due to having only a very small number (i.e., 3 or 4) of offset measurements, all with low SNR. See §A.5.1.</p><p>CENT_UNRESOLVED_OFFSET: There is a statistically significant shift in the centroid during transit. This indicates the is not on the target star. Thus, the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the centroid offset major flag set, unless another Centroid Robovetter flag is also set, casting doubt on the measurement. See §A.5.1. DEEP_V_SHAPED: The V-shape metric is above threshold. This metric uses the fitted DV radius ratio and impact parameter to determine whether the event is likely to be caused by a stellar eclipse. When the flag is set, the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.3.</p><p>DEPTH_ODDEVEN_(ALT|DV): The TCE failed the odd-even depth test using the ALT or DV detrending. This determines whether the difference in the depths of the odd and even transits is greater than the standard deviation of the measured depths. The transit-like TCE is marked as an FP with a stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.1.4.</p><p>EPHEM_MATCH: The TCE has been identified as an FP due to an ephemeris match with a source that could plausibly induce the observed variability on the target. See §A.6 and <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> for the contaminating source.</p><p>HALO_GHOST: The ghost diagnostic value is too high. This diagnostic measures the transit strength for the out-and in-aperture pixels and determines if the transit is localized on the target star, or if it is due to contamination from a distant source. The TCE is an FP and the centroid offset major flag is set. See §A.5.2.</p><p>HAS_SEC_TCE: Another TCE on the same target with a higher planet number has the same period as the current transit-like TCE, but a significantly different epoch. This indicates that the current TCE is an eclipsing binary with the other TCE representing the secondary eclipse. If the PLANET_OCCULT_DV and PLANET_OCCULT_ALT flags are not set, the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with a stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.1.1.</p><p>INCONSISTENT_TRANS: The ratio of the maximum SES value to the MES value is above threshold and the TCE has a period greater than 90 days. This flag indicates that the TCE has only a few transits and the MES is dominated by a single large event. Thus, the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.5.</p><p>INDI_TRANS_(CHASES|MARSHALL| SKYE|ZUMA|TRACKER|RUBBLE): One or more of the individual transit metrics (Chases, Marshall, Skye, Zuma, Tracker, or Rubble) removed a transit causing the TCE's recalculated MES to drop below threshold, or the number of transits to drop below 3. The TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transitlike major flag set. See §A.3.7.</p><p>IS_SEC_TCE: The TCE has the same period, but a different epoch, as a previous transit-like TCE on the same target. This indicates that the current TCE corresponds to the secondary eclipse of an eclipsing binary (or a planet if the PLANET_OCCULT_DV or PLANET_ OCCULT_ALT flags are set). Thus, the current TCE is dispositioned as an FP with both the not transit-like and stellar eclipse major flags set. See §A.2.</p><p>LPP_(ALT|DV): The Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) <ref type="bibr">valueThompson et al. (2015a)</ref>, as computed using the ALT or DV detrending, is above threshold. This indicates that the TCE is not transit-shaped, and thus is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.1.</p><p>MOD_NONUNIQ_(ALT|DV): The Model-shift 1 test, performed with the ALT or DV detrending, is below threshold. This test calculates the significance of the primary event, taking into account red noise, and compares it to the false alarm threshold. This flag indicates the primary event is not significant compared to the amount of systematic noise in the light curve, and thus the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.4.</p><p>MOD_ODDEVEN_(ALT|DV): The odd/even statistic from the Model-shift test is calculated with the ALT or DV detrending. This statistic compares the best-fit transit model to the odd and even transits separately and determines that the difference in the resulting significance values is above threshold. When set, the transit-like TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.1.4.</p><p>MOD_POS_(ALT|DV): The Model-shift 3 test, performed with the ALT or DV detrending, is below threshold. This test compares the significance of the primary and positive-going events in the phased light curve to help determine whether the primary event is unique. This flag indicates that the TCE is likely noise and thus is dispositioned as an FP with the not transitlike major flag set. See §A.3.4.</p><p>MOD_SEC_(ALT|DV): The Model-shift 4, 5, and 6 values, calculated using the ALT or DV detrending, are above threshold. This test calculates the significance of the secondary event divided by F red , the ratio of red noise to white noise in the light curve. The same calculation is done for the difference between the secondary and tertiary event significance values, and the difference between the secondary and positive event significance values. They indicate that there is a unique and significant secondary event in the light curve (i.e., a secondary eclipse). Thus, assuming the PLANET_ OCCUL_(ALT|DV) flag is not set, the TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the stellar eclipse major flag set. See §A.4.1.2.</p><p>MOD_TER_(ALT|DV): The Model-shift 2 test, performed with the ALT or DV detrending, is below threshold. This test calculates the difference between the primary and tertiary event significance values. This flag indicates that the primary event is not unique in the phased light curve, and thus the TCE is likely noise and dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.4.</p><p>NO_FITS: Both the trapezoidal and the original DV transit fits failed to converge. This indicates the signal is not sufficiently transit-shaped in either detrending to be fit by a transit model. The TCE is dispositioned as an FP with the not transit-like major flag set. See §A.3.9.</p><p>PERIOD_ALIAS_(ALT|DV): Using the phases of the primary, secondary, and tertiary events from the Model-shift test run on the ALT or DV detrended data, Note-For these statistics the obsTCE set does not include the rogue or banned TCEs. Most obsTCEs fail more than one test, so the percentages are not expected to add up to 100%.</p></div>			</div>
