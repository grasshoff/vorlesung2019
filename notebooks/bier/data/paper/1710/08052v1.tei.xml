				<p>Variations in the axial tilt, or obliquity, of terrestrial planets can affect their climates and therefore their habitability. Kepler-62f is a 1.4 R ⊕ planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its K2 dwarf host star (Borucki et al. 2013). We perform N-body simulations that monitor the evolution of obliquity of Kepler-62f for 10 million year timescales to explore the effects on model assumptions, such as the masses of the Kepler-62 planets and the possibility of outer bodies. Significant obliquity variation occurs when the rotational precession frequency overlaps with one or more of the secular orbital frequencies, but most variations are limited to 10 •. Moderate variations (∼10 • − 20 •) can occur over a broader range of initial obliquities when the relative nodal longitude (∆Ω) overlaps with the frequency and phase of a given secular mode. However, we find that adding outer gas giants on long period orbits (1000 days) can produce large (∼60 •) variations in obliquity if Kepler-62f has a very rapid (4 hr) rotation period.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler mission has discovered more than 1000 extrasolar planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>) that represent a broad spectrum of possible worlds. The Kepler planets represent a reservoir of outcomes from planet formation. From this, researchers can explore and test our models of how planets behave. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of a planet's axial tilt, or obliquity, which can be modified by the neighboring planets within a system through the gravitational torque that they exert on its equatorial bulge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">henceforth BAF13</ref>) announced the discovery of a five planet system orbiting a K2 dwarf, which is a star slightly smaller in mass and radius than our Sun. Interestingly, the outer two planets in this system <ref type="bibr">(Kepler-62e &amp; Kepler-62f</ref>) may reside within a region of space where liquid water could exist on their surfaces given favorable conditions, otherwise known as the habitable zone. This star, Kepler-62, and its planets, Kepler-62b -Kepler-62f, occupy a region of parameter space that is exciting to explore and can have astrobiological implications.</p><p>Among the parameters that govern a planet's astrobiological potential is the obliquity, or axis tilt, ψ. Our Earth with a middling ψ ⊕ = 23.44 • enjoys moderate seasonal weather variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Williams &amp; Kasting 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>). If a planet's obliquity gets too low, then a lack of illumination at high latitudes can lead to billylquarles@gmail.com polar glaciations. Planets with obliquities above ψ ≈ 56 • would experience severe seasons, alternately baking and freezing their poles while their equators receive the least annual illumination on the planet. That high-obliquity regime applies to both the present-day Pluto ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">White et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Howard et al. 2017</ref>) and Mars in the geologic past <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(M` ege &amp; Bourgeois 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Head &amp; Weiss 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lissauer et al. (2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">henceforth LBC12)</ref> showed that the obliquity of a hypothetical Earth in the absence of a large Moon typically varies by ∼ ±10 • , in contrast to (albeit not in conflict with) prior calculations showing an allowed range of 0 • &lt; ψ ⊕ &lt; 85 • <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2016)</ref> analyzed the possible obliquity variations of early Venus in part as a possible analog for habitable exoplanets, but direct studies of exoplanet obliquity variations have been lacking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shields et al. (2016)</ref> performed a limited dynamical study of Kepler62f starting the interior planets from circular orbits while allowing Kepler-62f to begin with a moderate eccentricity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shields et al. (2016)</ref> used their dynamical model in 3D climate simulations to estimate potential climates for the planet. However, these results are depend on the model assumptions assumed in the dynamical simulations, where the orbital architecture of the system is largely incomplete.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the potential obliquity variability of Kepler-62f under a range of model assumptions, including the possible existence of outer bodies and two different mass-radius relations to determine the planetary masses. Our numerical method builds upon the work of LBC12 and is described in Section 2, where our model assumptions concerning the initial orbital architectures of our realizations are also presented. Section 3 details the results of our simulations and discusses interesting facets from within the possible outcomes. Section 4 presents the general conclusions that we may draw from this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Estimating the Masses of the Observed Planets</head><p>Many parameters within Kepler-62 are well characterized by BAF13, including the orbital periods and planetary radii, but they were not able to determine masses for any of the five planets. They performed an analysis focused on transit timing measurements within the data that yielded upper limits on the masses, but these upper limits do not exclude any physically plausible compositions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bolmont et al. (2015)</ref> have performed calculations for Kepler-62 and they make the assumption that all five planets are rocky in order to prescribe masses. They give caution to their study especially considering the effects of tides and rotational flattening that are sensitive to the assumed composition. In this work, we assume the smallest 3 or 4 of the planets to be rocky and the largest planet(s) to be more massive but less dense than the rocky planets.</p><p>Besides the deficit of knowledge of mass in the known planetary bodies, there is also an incomplete knowledge of the full architecture of this system. The Kepler mission provided nearly four years of continuous monitoring, but other planetary bodies may exist in the Kepler-62 system with larger orbital periods. Moreover, planets can also escape detection through a small misalignment of inclination relative to our line of sight. We thus perform many possible realizations in the rotational state of Kepler-62f in order to identify the sensitivity of the obliquity evolution on our model assumptions.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lissauer &amp; de Pater (2013)</ref>, we estimate the masses of the planets using a mass-radius relation in the form of a piecewise power law,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M p /M ⊕ = ξ(R p /R ⊕ ) ,</formula><p>where M p is the mass of the planet, R p is the radius of the planet, ξ is a scale factor, and is the power. This power law is divided into three regimes as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M p M ⊕ = ξ R p R ⊕    ξ = 1, , = 1 0.3 ; R p &lt; 1 R ⊕ ξ = 1, , = 1 0.27 ; 1 R ⊕ ≤ R p ≤ β R ⊕ ξ = β 1 0.27 −1 , , = 1; R p &gt; β R ⊕ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the last regime uses a parameter β that defines the assumed transition point between "rocky" and volatilerich planets and an assumed slope in the volatile-rich regime that is within the range of those derived from fits to measured values for exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wolfgang et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen &amp; Kipping 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The obliquity evolution of a planet is only of astrobiological interest if it is rocky. Planets in the habitable zone with R p = 1.41 R ⊕ may well be rocky, while those with R p = 1.61R ⊕ are probably not <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rogers 2015)</ref>. For most of our simulations, we assume β = 1.41 (Case A) where we consider Kepler-62e to be volatile rich and β = 1.61 (Case B) that allows Kepler-62e to be rocky. Note. -Assumed masses for the planets considering Kepler-62e to be either volatile-rich (Case A) or "rocky" (Case B). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the nominal values in the planet radius from BAF13 and the masses for each planet for each assumed composition of Kepler-62e. Kepler-62d is considered to be volatile-rich in both cases, but using a different transition approximately doubles its mass. However, this will likely only modify slightly the perturbations on Kepler-62f because its semimajor axis is ∼5x greater.</p><p>2.2. Orbital Solution from Observations BAF13 provided orbital parameters derived from a statistical analysis using a transit model to compare with the observational data. Using the results of BAF13, we define or derive all the orbital elements to uniquely prescribe a starting orbit and list those parameters in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref>. Using the observed orbital period ratios, we prescribe for each planet a semimajor axis (a) assuming that the mass of the host star is 0.69 M . We also use the prescribed masses in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for this calculation, but their inclusion are largely negligible and augment the semimajor axes of the outer two planets by ∼10 −4 AU.</p><p>The results of BAF13 provide the components of the eccentricity vector (e cos ω, e sin ω), which we convert to the dynamicist convention through a sign change in ω. BAF13 also acknowledge that the nominal values provided result in an unstable configuration leading to the ejection of Kepler-62c, the Mars-sized planet. Most of our planets are assigned an eccentricity using the nominal values of the eccentricity vectors given in BAF13. But, we start our simulations choosing the 1σ upper bound value of e sin ω component for Kepler-62c (-0.07 rather than the nominal value of -0.18) and use the nominal values for e cos ω. By choosing the eccentricity of Kepler62c in this way, we found that the orbits in the Kepler-62 system to be dynamically stable up to 100 Myr.</p><p>Also in the dynamicist convention, we measure orbital inclination relative to the line of sight (90 • from the sky plane) and define the ascending node (Ω) to be 90 • during the time of transit. The observations tell us that all five planets will have nearly identical values of ascending node by the virtue that they all transit. But we don't know precisely what the values are and we assume them to be within a degree of the node defining the line of sight. To define this numerically, we add randomly generated values between 0 • -0.5 • to the line of sight value (90 • ). After defining the ascending node for each planet, we determine the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight through the spherical law of cosines. From the parameters defined thus far, we determine the mean anomaly (M ) of each planet at the epoch of central transit as given by the data and then find the mean anomalies relative to a common epoch. Note. -Initial values of the orbital elements used in our simulations for the Kepler-62 system. The radiative equilibrium temperature, Teq, is also provided to delineate each planet relative to its potential habitability. See BAF13 for the true uncertainties in these parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Possible Outer Bodies</head><p>Our best current methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets is inherently biased towards bodies with relatively short orbital periods, but more planets may exist at longer periods. The existence of these bodies could have an astrobiological impact on exoplanets within the habitable zone without rendering the overall system unstable. In order to determine the impact on obliquity, we include 2 sets of analogs to the giant planets, where one is similar to those in the Solar System (SS) and another is drawn from a large number of stability simulations of 2 planet pairs of Jupiter-and Saturn-mass planets. These analogs are identical in mass to their Solar System giant namesakes. The set that follows the orbital elements of the Solar System giants (See appendix A Murray &amp; Dermott 2000) are scaled in semimajor axis by their orbital period (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>) due to the less massive host star.</p><p>Jupiter's orbital period (∼4300 days) is quite large and its perturbations on the inner system may not produce the largest possible effect on the inner 5 planet system. Thus, we perform a suite of ∼15,000 simulations of using a pair of gas giants (Jupiter-and Saturn-mass) and evaluate whether the system can remain stable for 10 Myr given random initial conditions for the pair of gas giants. In these simulations, we use the masses of the inner planets from Case A.</p><p>The initial conditions for the Jupiter mass planet are drawn from a uniform distribution in period ranging from 300 -1600 days, Rayleigh distributions in the eccentricity (σ e = 0.05) and inclination (σ i = 1 • ), a uniform distribution in the ascending node ranging from 85 • -95 • , and uniform distributions for the argument of periastron and mean anomaly ranging from 0 • -360 • . The initial conditions for the Saturn mass planet are chosen in a similar fashion for most of the orbital elements. Instead of drawing from a distribution in period, we use a uniform distribution ranging from 10 -20 R H , where R H = a J (M J /(3M * )) 1/3 represents the Hill Radius, to ensure the stability of the pair of gas giants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gladman 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chambers et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>From these simulations, we find that systems are stable when we choose a Jupiter analog with an orbital period 1000 days with a corresponding Saturn analog outside of mean motion resonance. Thus, we choose 1 JupiterSaturn pair to include in our exploration of obliquity with a Jupiter analog (orbital period ∼1084 days) and a Saturn-analog separated by ∼11 R H , which is wide of the 5:2 mean motion resonance. By choosing our setup in this manner, we will have a giant planet architecture that will substantially perturb the inner system without causing a global instability and provide a much larger perturbation to the possible obliquity of Kepler-62f. The initial orbital elements of these gas giants are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Numerical Setup for Obliquity Evolution</head><p>To evaluate the obliquity evolution, we use a modified version of the smercury integration package (LBC12) that has been optimized for determining the extrema in obliquity evolution up to a given integration step. We define the obliquity as the mutual inclination, through the spherical law of cosines, between the spin axis (i s , Ω s ) and orbital axis (i, Ω). The nodal difference, ∆Ω = Ω s − Ω, is set to 0 • in a majority of our simulations, where a subset of our 5 planet systems using the Case B masses begin with ∆Ω = 90 • .</p><p>The short orbital period of Kepler-62b (∼5.715 days) poses a numerical challenge for evaluating a broad and deep range of parameters. As a result, we limit our simulations to 10 Myr using a timestep (0.286 days) that is 5% of the orbital period of Kepler-62b. One avenue that could be employed to reach longer times is to remove the inner two planets <ref type="bibr">(Kepler-62b and Kepler-62c</ref>), where they are added to the mass of the host star effectively increasing the J 2 of the host star. This would allow a larger timestep to be chosen relative to the orbital period of Kepler-62d. However, much of our discussion on the variation of obliquity depends on the secular frequencies of the system and removing the inner planets would shift the relevant frequencies. Our numerical code, smercury, does not include possible tidal interactions and thus keeps the rotation period constant throughout the simulation. This is justified because our simulations do not reach the timescales (∼ 1 Gyr) necessary for tides to be important for Kepler-62f.</p><p>We note that our setup is different than other studies that rely on the secular solution for obliquity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li &amp; Batygin 2014a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shan &amp; Li 2017</ref>). However, we can make comparisons based upon relevant precession frequencies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Laskar &amp; Robutel (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shan &amp; Li (2017)</ref>, and others use the 'precession' constant α measured in arcseconds per year, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">α = 3n 2 2ν C − A C ≈ 3n 2 2ν J 2 ¯ C ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where n represents the mean motion, ν denotes the rotational frequency, ¯ C relates to the moment of Inertia, and J 2 is the zonal harmonic related to the flattening due the rotation. The moment of Inertia and J 2 are presently unknown, so we use the values assumed in LBC12, where Note. -Initial values of the orbital elements used in our simulations using the gas giants of the Solar System (SS) and a selected stable configuration of randomly drawn gas giant pairs (RG). The subscripts denote the mass of each planet by the respective analog within the Solar System (Jupiter -Neptune). Note. -Initial values for rotation period (Prot), equatorial radius (Req), zonal harmonic (J 2 ), and precession constant (α) for Kepler-62f determined from LBC12. These values are the same for both Case A and Case B as the mass of Kepler-62f is unchanged between the two cases. J 2 is derived using the Darwin-Radau Relation (see Appendix A <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> shows how our assumptions on the planet masses in Case A relate to the equatorial radius (R eq ), the derived zonal harmonic (J 2 ), and the approximate value of the precession constant, α, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> provides specific values for select rotation periods. We note that <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1 (bottom panel)</ref> shows the precession constant for Kepler-62e (red dashed line) to very high (&gt; 60 /yr), even for slow rotation periods (P rot &gt; 40 hr). As a result, the obliquity variations of the planet will likely be small for the rotational parameters that we consider and instead focus on the possible obliquity variations of Kepler-62f.</p><p>Significant variation of retrograde obliquities (ψ o &gt; 90 • ) takes a long-time to develop computationally and dynamically, even in under less computationally demanding conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. 2016</ref>), so this work will focus mainly on the obliquity evolution of prograde (ψ o ≤ 90 • ) rotators. Another unknown parameter is the rotation period of the planets, where we explore a wide range (4 -24 hours) for the runs considering the 5 planet system, Kepler-62b -Kepler-62f. We extend this range to 48 hours for the cases including the outer bodies because longer orbital periods can introduce lower frequencies that can potentially overlap. By taking steps in the rotation period rather than precession frequency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993)</ref>, we seek to identify the larger structures with the parameter space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>Our simulations investigate the obliquity evolution of Kepler-62f for a 10 Myr timescale. We examine two different assumptions on the mass, and thereby compositions, of the 5 known (transiting) planets, Case A and Case B. Planets on long-period orbits have a low transit probability. Therefore, hypothetical outer planets are also included in many of our simulations. In some cases, we add to the transiting planets a set of giant planet analogs drawn from the Solar System (SS) and scaled by period are also included. In others, randomly determined giant planets (RG) are also used with initial conditions drawn from the results of our stability simulations (see Section 2.3).</p><p>The inclusion of giant planets alters the eccentricity and inclination of Kepler-62f over time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref> shows these effects using the 5 planet system (black), the 9 planet system with the scaled Solar System giants (blue), and the 7 planet system with the randomly drawn giant planet pair (red). Much of our analysis relates to overlap between axial precession frequencies and the secular orbital frequencies. Sections 3.1, and 3.2 identifies where certain frequencies are important in relation to our initial rotational states and Section 3.3 focuses more on why those frequencies (and other factors) are important. Given the our broad range of rotation periods, the range in the respective precession constant will also be large and our figures account for this by using a base-10 logarithmic scale for the precession constant. We highlight the areas where select frequencies may overlap by black curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figs. 3, 5, 6</ref>, and 9 using the f j values given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Variations Due to the Transiting Planets</head><p>The Kepler-62 system consists of 5 transiting planets, all of whose orbital periods are shorter than the Earth's, and 3 of the planets have periods shorter than Mercury's. As a result the orbits are relatively close together and can produce perturbations on neighboring planets that in turn influence the evolution of obliquity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bolmont et al. (2015)</ref>, using a tidal model and incorporating General Relativity effects over Gyr timescales, showed that the rotation periods of the planets interior to Kepler-62f can be substantially slowed leading to a state near ψ = 0 • . However, the changes to Kepler-62f under the same model experiences much smaller changes to its obliquity and rotation period. Thus, we examine a broad range of initial rotation periods (4 -24 hr) for a prograde Kepler-62f using both of our assumptions for the masses of the planets (Case A and Case B) on a 10 Myr timescale. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the results of these simulations for nominal values of the planetary masses (Case A). By using the range of obliquity variation, ∆ψ ≡ |ψ max − ψ min |, we estimate the most likely values of obliquity variation and how they depend on the initial rotation state of Kepler-62f. The most common ∆ψ values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref> are less than ∼3 • , which is roughly similar to the amount of variation for the present-day Earth with the Moon (∼2.4 • ). There are distinct regions where ∆ψ 1 • (light gray) is more prevalent than those &gt; 1 • , but</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">&lt; 3 • (red).</formula><p>The largest ∆ψ values occur at ψ o = 0 • with a 10 hr rotation period (purple) and corresponds to a precession constant ∼60 /yr (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). This amounts to an instantaneous precession period of ∼22,000 years, which is less than the present-day Earth's. For the 10 hr rotation period, ∆ψ decreases as the initial obliquity, ψ o , increases until ∼16 • . The formula for the expected axial precession, ˙ Ω s , is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">˙ Ω s = −f j = α cos ψ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where f j denotes the modal frequency (see Sec. 3.3). Using Eq. 3, the precession frequency is ∼62.5 /yr for ψ = 16 • and α ≈ 60 /yr. Thus, the decline in obliquity variation depends on the proximity to the expected precession frequency. We show the evolution of obliquity in a representation similar to a phase portrait in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  4</ref>, where a fixed point appears ψ∼16 • . When Kepler62f begins with a 9 hr rotation period (α ∼ 67.7 /yr), the highest variation appears at ψ o = 28 • , where using Equation 3 we find ˙ Ω s ≈ 60 /yr and the width around this peak in ∆ψ is smaller. This trend continues for faster (decreasing) rotation periods over the range that we simulated. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates a similar exploration, but considers a different set of masses for the two largest transiting planets, Kepler-62d and Kepler-62e (Case B). Since the mass of Kepler-62f remains unchanged, the values for the zonal harmonic, J 2 , and the precession constant, α, also remain unchanged. Naively, we would expect to see the same result as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref>. The overall features in <ref type="figure">Fig.  5</ref> are similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref>, but the largest variation appears at a shorter rotation period (8 hr), where we would expect -73 /yr to be the significant frequency due to the larger masses. This is likely caused by an induced precession from the increased mass for Kepler-62e (see Section 3.3). Kepler-62d nearly doubles in mass between the two cases, but it is much farther away from Kepler-62f than is Kepler-62e (∼40% mass increase in Case B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effects of Outer Giant Planets</head><p>The full architecture of the Kepler-62 systems (i.e., number of planets and masses) is largely unknown, so outer perturbers could introduce other precession frequencies. We explore three scenarios where outer giant planets may exist: (1) a scaled version of the Solar System giant planets, (2) the scaled Solar System giant planets with their orbital inclinations doubled, and (3) a Jupiter-Saturn pair of planets drawn from stability simulations (see Section 2.3). All three scenarios are performed using the masses from Case A, but only the first scenario is performed using the masses from Case B. Also, we include rotation periods beyond 24 hr to show the expected variations at lower frequencies (∼20 /yr). The precession frequencies when adding the Solar System giant planets differ from those in the Solar System because we did not scale masses of the giant planets and the relative semimajor axis between Kepler-62f and the giant planets is substantially different <ref type="bibr">(Murray &amp; Der- mott 2000, Chap. 7)</ref>.</p><p>Including a scaled version of the Solar System giant planets (using the Case A masses) introduces more variation, ∆ψ, at higher initial obliquities and longer rotation periods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> demonstrates this result; note that the color scale has been adjusted in response. The most common values of ∆ψ are ∼3 • -5 • (red), which is a little higher than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>. The location of the largest variation also changes in response to the perturbations of the outer planets on the orbit of Kepler-62f. The regions of large variation (∆ψ &gt; 5 • ) typically occupy regions of the parameter space with a short rotation period or high (&gt; 45 • ) initial obliquity. However, there are regions with larger variations for rotation periods longer than 24 hr. In the second and third scenarios, the differences in large scale structure is the most interesting, where we use the masses from Case A. Thus, we evaluate only the even rotation periods for the full range from 4 -48 hr. Doubling the inclination of the Solar System giant planets increases the overall variation, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  8</ref>, where the largest variation increases to ∼42 • . This occurs in the low initial obliquity range, but for slower rotation periods (&gt;36 hr). One may expect that doubling the inclinations would also increase the potential for large variations in retrograde (ψ o &gt; 90 • ). We perform a set of runs exploring initially retrograde obliquities for this scenario and find that for ψ o ≥ 95 • , the obliquity varies up to 5 • , which is similar to our prograde (ψ o ≤ 90 • ) results (i.e., red points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>). When ψ o starts in the 91 • -94 • range, more substantial variations (∆ψ∼26 • ) can occur, but they quickly decrease with increasing initial obliquity. In the third scenario, the lowest variation in obliquity is ∼3 • and the most common value is ∼10 • , as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>. For a very fast rotator (P rot = 4 hr), the obliquity variation can be quite large, up to ∼65 • even on the relatively short timescale (10 Myr) of our simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Effects From Overlapping Frequencies</head><p>Our simulations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figs. 3 -9)</ref> show that particular regions of parameter space are more likely to exhibit larger variations of obliquity, ∆ψ, relative to other regions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig-ure 3</ref> indicates that 60 /yr is a particularly important frequency given that the largest variation occurred for ψ 0 = 0 • , which corresponds to the the case ˙ Ω s = α (Eq. 3). In order to identify the frequencies more precisely, we apply a fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the inclination vector of Kepler-62f using a 10 Myr dataset with samples every 1000 yr. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 10</ref> illustrates the resulting Fourier spectra considering four of our assumed architectures: (1) the 5 planet system with masses from Case A, (2) the 5 planet system with masses from Case B, (3) the 9 planet system with the Solar System giants (Case A + SS), and (4) the 7 planet system with our Jupiter-Saturn pair (Case A + RG). There are several active peaks (power larger than -11, log scale) in each spectrum. We note that the highest peak at 0 /yr has been removed from each spectrum. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> shows the top 10 frequencies (f j ) identified in the time series using Frequency Modified Fourier Transform 1 ( ˇ Sidlichovsk´ySidlichovsk´y &amp; Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 1996). The rows of Table 5 are ordered by the amplitude of each mode, where the index j refers to the counting of the modes and does not correspond to a particular body. We list for each scenario the frequency (f j in /yr), the amplitude (B in degrees), and the phase of the mode (γ j in degrees). The highest amplitude frequency (j 1 ) occurs at 0 /yr, which arises from a degeneracy in inclination vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shan &amp; Li (2017)</ref> performed an analytical analysis of Kepler-62f using the Lagrange-Laplace method and found similar frequencies present. Also, the instantaneous precession period can be determined using these frequencies, where the high frequency terms produce precession periods much faster than the present day Earth. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows large variations near 60 /yr, and from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> we expect this to occur most strongly at 59.73 /yr. Another region of obliquity variation, although much smaller, occurs at α ≈ 25 /yr and ψ o ≈ 62 • . At this location, we find that ˙ Ω s = 11.7 /yr, which is approximately equal to the f 3 frequency for Case A. In Section 3.1, we found that the region of largest variation changed for Case B <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5</ref> shifting to higher frequencies. When looking at the Fourier spectra <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 10)</ref> and the associated frequencies <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>), it is apparent that a shift to higher frequencies has occurred and explains the large scale differences between our results in Figs. 3 and 5.</p><p>Adding the Solar System giants to Case A (Case A + SS) produces much larger variations in obliquity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6</ref>) in the low frequency regime. The region of largest variation (long rotation period, low initial obliquity) can be associated with the f 3 frequency, where the high obliquity regions is associated with the f 2 frequency. The associated frequencies for the scenario where we double the Solar System giants' inclination is very similar, where the amplitudes (B) are approximately double. However, f 10 is different with values of -2.57 /yr, 0.00824 • , and 70.0 • for f 10 , B, and γ 10 , respectively. This distinction is important because <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>  The obliquity evolution over the first 1 Myr for a Earthlike (ψ o = 23.44 • &amp; P rot = 23.934 hr) Kepler-62f is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 11</ref> for both a prograde (top) and retrograde (bottom) rotator. The evolution of the 5 planet system (Case A, black) displays very small variations, where those with the Solar System giants added (Case A + SS, blue) are more substantial. The evolution, when including our Jupiter-Saturn pair, is much larger (∼5 • ) in both prograde and retrograde. We note that the frequency of variation between the prograde and retrograde rotators (Case A + RG, red) is slightly different, where this is due to the overlap of slightly different positive and negative orbital frequencies (f 5 &amp; f 7 , <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>).</p><p>The orbital obliquity can change depending on the assumed masses (Case A or Case B), the outer bodies (possible giant planets), and the assumed longitude of the spin node (Ω s ), where ∆Ω = Ω s − Ω, the difference between the spin node and the orbital node, is the more important quantity. In almost all of our simulations, we have assumed that ∆Ω = 0 • based upon our previous results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes et al. (2016)</ref>. Our previous finding showed little change because the phase of the secular frequencies (γ j ) in the Solar System were not near the values of ∆Ω that we simulated. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>, we can see that the strongest non-zero frequency (j 2 ) has a phase angle near 90 • . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We explore possible dynamical states of the Kepler-62 system focusing on the variation of obliquity for the outermost planet, Kepler-62f, due to its high astrobiological interest. The possible obliquity variations of Kepler-62f depend on many unknowns including the masses of the five known planets, the possible presence of outer bodies, the direction of the spin, and the relative nodal angle, ∆Ω. Each of these assumptions can introduce variations larger than the present day Earth (including the stabilizing effects of the Moon) on 10 Myr timescales, where the largest contributor is the presence of gas giants with larger orbital periods and inclinations that could have escaped detection. We determine the magnitude of these variations using N-body simulations and their relation to the assumed rotation parameters using frequency analysis.</p><p>Regions of significant variation in obliquity differ based upon our initial assumptions of the masses (and compositions) of the Kepler-62 planets. Considering a 0 • ini-  tial obliquity and a 10 hr rotation period for Kepler-62f (Case A) produces a ∼20 • difference between the highest and lowest attained obliquity, while most other choices for initial obliquity and rotation period are limited to variations less than 3 • . A similar range of variation in Case B occurs at a higher initial obliquity (ψ o ∼ 17 • ), but requires a faster rotation (8 hr period) due to an induced precession from Kepler-62e. The range in initial obliquity that produces moderate variations (&gt; 10 • ) can broaden due to overlap between a secular mode and the relative nodal longitude, ∆Ω.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( /yr) B (deg.) γ j (deg.) f j ( /yr) B (deg.) γ j (deg.) f j ( /yr) B (deg.) γ j (deg.) f j ( /yr) B (deg.) γ j (deg.</formula><p>Including a set of giant planets similar to Solar System to either case (Case A or Case B) increases the overall obliquity variation, but not substantially for most cases. In order for strong variations (&gt; 25 • ) to occur, the rotation period of Kepler-62f needs to be longer than 24 hr and this also depends on the initial obliquity. Solar System-like giant planets with double their orbital inclinations produce much broader regions of moderate obliquity variation, where strong variations (∆ψ ≈ 42 • ) can occur for specific initial parameters. Retrograde obliquities (ψ o &gt; 90 • ) for the double inclination scenario (which exhibits the largest variations for large prograde obliquities) are large for initial obliquity in the range 95 • &gt; ψ o &gt; 90 • , but typically produce relatively low obliquity variations (∆ψ &lt; 5 • ) for obliquity above 95 • .</p><p>Our 7 planet systems that include pair of gas giants on close-in (1.8 -3.5 AU) orbits could induce high variations of obliquity (∼66 • ), but this requires Kepler-62f to be a relatively rapid (&lt; 8 hr) rotator. The most common obliquity variation is larger than the present day EarthMoon system, but not extremely high (∆ψ &lt; 10 • ).</p><p>Obliquity variation can have an impact on the potential climates of exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Williams &amp; Kasting 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Spiegel et al. 2009)</ref>, where some climate model calculations have been performed specifically for the Kepler-62 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bolmont et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shields et al. 2016</ref>). Although we do not include a climate model in our analysis, we find that the obliquity evolution can differ substantially when additional planets on long period orbits are considered. The amount of variation, ∆ψ, can increase substantially and potentially affect the broader conclusions drawn about climates on Kepler-62f. Moreover, we find that higher precession frequencies tend to dominate and this could result in more turbulent changes in climate on shorter timescales for particular choices of initial obliquity.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> overlap with the precession constant.     <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> overlap with the precession constant. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 10</ref>.
