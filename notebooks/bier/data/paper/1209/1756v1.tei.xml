			<abstract>
				<p>We present empirical relations for determining the amount by which the effective temperatures and radii-and therefore the estimated masses-of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are altered due to chromospheric activity. Our relations are based on a large set of well studied low-mass stars in the field and on a set of benchmark low-mass eclipsing binaries. The relations link the amount by which an active object&apos;s temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of its Hα emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535−05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535−05 after accounting for the Hα emission; 2M0535−05 would be in precise agreement with theoretical isochrones were it inactive. The relations that we present are applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 M⊙ and for which the activity, as measured by Hα, is in the range −4.6 &lt; log LHα/L bol &lt; −3.3. We expect these relations to be most useful for correcting radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over their active lifetimes (few Gyr). We also discuss the implications of this work for determinations of young cluster IMFs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Observational evidence strongly indicates that the fundamental properties of low-mass stars can be altered in the presence of strong magnetic activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morales et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">López-Morales 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ribas 2006</ref>). In particular, observations of active, low-mass eclipsing binary (EB) stars have found the empirically measured stellar radii (R) to be inflated by ≈10%, and the empirically measured stellar effective temperatures (T eff ) to be suppressed by ≈5%, relative to the predictions of standard theoretical stellar evolution models, which better match the properties of inactive objects (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coughlin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kraus et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morales et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Stassun et al. 2009</ref>, and references therein). Resolving these discrepancies will be critical to the ongoing development of accurate theoretical stellar models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stassun et al. 2010</ref>). Accurate estimates of stellar radii are especially important in the context of searches for transiting exoplanets, which rely upon the assumed stellar radius/density to infer the planet radius/density.</p><p>Activity effects also lead to errors in object masses (M ) when these are derived from T eff . A particularly salient example is 2M0535−05, an EB in the Orion Nebula Cluster (age ∼1 Myr) comprising two brown dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stassun et al. 2006</ref>. The primary and secondary brown dwarf ⋆ Corresponding author. e-mail: keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu (BD) components of 2M0535−05 have dynamically measured masses of 60±3 and 39±2 M Jup , respectively, and T eff ratio of T 1 /T 2 = 0.952 ± 0.004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gómez Maqueo Chew et al. 2009</ref>). That is, the system exhibits a reversal of the usual M -T eff relation, such that the primary component is cooler than its companion. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the 2M0535−05 system on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. The secondary BD's T eff and bolometric luminosity (L bol , calculated directly from the empirically measured T eff and R) place it at a position that is consistent with that predicted by the model isochrone. In contrast, the primary is far displaced from its expected position, and so appears to have a mass of only ∼25 M Jup -more than a factor of 2 lower than its true mass-on the basis of its low T eff . <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Reiners et al. (2007)</ref> used spectrally resolved Hα measurements to show that, whereas the secondary BD in 2M0535−05 is chromospherically quiet, the primary BD is highly chromospherically active, perhaps a consequence of its rapid rotation.</p><p>Since magnetic activity seems to alter the fundamental properties of both stars and BDs, it would be valuable to have an easily observable metric with which to quantitatively assess the degree to which a given object's T eff has been suppressed and its radius inflated. Here we present such an empirical metric by relating the degree of T eff suppression and radius inflation to the strength of Hα emission, a commonly used and readily observable tracer of chromospheric activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Scholz et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berger 2006</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref>. The measured L Hα /L bol for the two components are indicated next to the blue symbols. The active primary appears far cooler than expected, and therefore appears to be much younger than the secondary and to have a mass of only ≈27 M Jup based on its observed T eff , a factor of 2 lower than its true mass. Shifting the position of the active primary (arrow) using our empirically calibrated Hα-based relations brings the primary into much closer agreement with its theoretically expected position in the HR diagram (black symbol); this is where the active primary would be if it were not active.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods and Data Used</head><p>We use two different samples and approaches to empirically determine a relationship between T eff suppression, R inflation, and the level of activity as measured from Hα.</p><p>First we use the large set of nearby field M dwarfs with well measured spectral types and Hα equivalent widths (EWs) from the PMSU catalog ( <ref type="bibr">Reid et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hawley et al. 1996)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morales et al. (2008)</ref>, we restrict ourselves to the sample of 746 stars with distances determined directly from trigonometric parallaxes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> shows the estimated T eff and R of the PMSU sample stars as a function of M . Strongly chromospherically active stars-defined as those with Hα in emission-show a clear displacement to lower T eff and to larger R relative to both the theoretical isochrone and to the non-active stars, whereas non-active stars more closely track the isochrone. From these T eff and R offsets, and the observed Hα emission, we derive linear relationships between ∆T eff , ∆R, and log L Hα /L bol (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). The relationships are statistically significant with &gt;90% confidence. T eff vs. Mass (top) and Radius vs. Mass (bottom) for M-dwarfs with trigonometric distances and Hα measurements from the PMSU catalog. Active objects (Hα in emission) are filled symbols. Solid curve is a 3 Gyr isochrone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baraffe et al. 1998</ref>). Dashed curve is a polynomial fit to the non-active objects. Hα-active dwarfs are significantly displaced to lower T eff and larger radii compared to both the isochrone and to the non-active dwarfs.</p><p>The second approach uses the much smaller sample of stars in EBs that have directly measured masses, radii, and reliable T eff , but for which we must use X-ray flux as a proxy for Hα. We use the small set of low-mass EBs with accurately measured M , R, T eff , and X-ray luminosities (L X ) from López-Morales (2007). The sample includes 11 individual stars in 7 EB systems spanning the range T eff =3125-5300 K and M =0.21-0.96 M ⊙ . We begin with the correlation of ∆R vs. L X /L bol already demonstrated in that work, which we rederived using the fundamental stellar data compiled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">López-Morales (2007)</ref> and the same 3 Gyr isochrone of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>) are statistically significant with &gt;95% confidence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Empirical Relations Linking Radius Inflation and T eff Suppression to Hα Emission</head><p>Combining the results from the field M dwarfs and EBs, we obtain the following final relations (in percent units):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆T eff T eff = (−4.71±2.33)×(log L Hα /L bol +4)+(−4.4±0.6) ∆R R = (15.37 ± 2.91) × (log L Hα /L bol + 4) + (7.1 ± 0.6).</formula><p>As an example of how the apparent mass of an object can be altered by activity, we calculate how the observed H-R diagram positions of the two BDs in 2M0535−05 are altered by the above relations. In effect, we are seeing how the 2M0535−05 system would appear in the H-R diagram were the system completely inactive. We use the L Hα /L bol measurements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Reiners et al. (2007)</ref> shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. We find that the primary BD has been displaced by ∆T eff = −6.9 ± 1.4% and ∆R = 15.2 ± 1.7%, and the secondary BD by at most ∆T eff = −3.0 ± 0.9% and ∆R &lt; 2.5 ± 1.1% (implying nearly constant L bol for both). Shifting the position of the primary BD accordingly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref> shows that, if it were inactive, it would be in excellent agreement with the theoretically expected position for its known mass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Impact on Inferred Initial Mass Functions</head><p>The vast majority of masses for stars and BDs in young clusters can only be determined by comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks in H-R diagrams, using either L bol or T eff or both (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Scholz et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, if there is indeed a relation between magnetic activity and R inflation / T eff suppression, this will also affect estimates of stellar and substellar masses derived from T eff , especially at young ages when activity levels are high. Here we examine the two ways of estimating masses-T eff and L bol -that are commonly used in the literature and investigate the impact of magnetic activity on the derived masses.</p><p>First we use T eff to estimate masses from model isochrones at 1 Myr. At each model mass, we consider a range of activity levels and apply offsets to the model T eff based on our empirical relations above. We then use these suppressed T eff values to estimate the masses that would be inferred from the isochrone. As expected, this procedure leads to a systematic underestimation of the masses. At high levels of activity, the effect can be substantial. For log L Hα /L bol = −3.3, which corresponds to the saturation limit in young low-mass stars and in young associations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Scholz et al. 2007</ref>), the mass estimates are a factor of ∼ 2 lower than for objects with low levels of magnetic activity (log L Hα /L bol &lt; −4.5). Note that because the mass-T eff relationship is less steep at older ages, the underestimation of mass is less severe at older ages (&gt;100 Myr).</p><p>In the second test case, we use L bol derived from Kband absolute magnitudes to derive masses. In this case the influence of magnetic activity is introduced by the T eff dependence of the bolometric correction, since L bol is (as discussed above) practically not affected. We compute spectral types from the suppressed values of T eff , and then compute K-band bolometric corrections from the spectral types, and we combine these with the model K-band absolute magnitudes to find L bol . Finally, we estimated masses from the model isochrone and L bol . This second method still leads to an underestimate of the masses, but the effect is much smaller than when directly estimating masses from T eff . The change of the bolometric corrections with increasing magnetic activity is quite small (at most 10%), resulting in relatively minor changes of a few percent in the mass estimate. An important application of T eff -based mass estimates is the determination of initial mass functions (IMFs) for young clusters. M-dwarfs with ages from 10 to 100 Myr exhibit Hα emission in the range log L Hα /L bol = −4.2 to −3.3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Scholz et al. 2007</ref>). Thus, our analysis implies that objects inferred to be BDs from T eff -based (or spectral type based) mass estimates could actually be low-mass stars since masses will be underestimated by up to a factor of 2.</p><p>We further evaluated the impact of this effect on measurements of the slope of the IMF, α (in dN/dM ∝ M −α ). For this purpose, we assume a measured slope of α = 0.6 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Scholz et al. 2012</ref>), calculate the IMF based on that slope for M &lt; 0.6 M ⊙ , correct the masses for a given level of Hα emission using our relations above, and redetermine the slope α. If we start with log L Hα /L bol = −4.0 for BDs and −3.5 for low-mass stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barrado et al. 2003)</ref>, the masses have to be corrected by factors of 1.3-1.7 for BDs, and by 2.2-2.5 for low-mass stars. As a result, the slope changes from α = 0.6 to α = 0.5. In general, we expect that α will be underestimated by &gt; ∼ 0.1, if the masses are estimated from T eff and activity is not taken into account. In addition, the peak mass of the IMF would be underestimated by up to a factor of 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>It remains unclear what is the underlying physical mechanism driving the correlations between ∆T eff , ∆R, and L Hα . <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chabrier et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">MacDonald &amp; Mullan (2009)</ref> have suggested that a sufficiently strong field could suppress convection, inhibit heat transfer, and thus inflate (and cool) the stellar surface. Since such a field would also likely result in chromospheric activity, one might therefore expect the correlations with Hα emission that we have derived. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Browning (2008)</ref> has shown in global numerical models that fully convective stars can host large kG strength fields. However, such fields alone appear to be too weak to produce the radius inflation and T eff suppression observed in 2M0535−05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(MacDonald &amp; Mullan 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chabrier et al. (2007)</ref> also suggest that fully convective objects should be less affected by the same convective inefficiencies invoked to explain radius discrepancies at higher masses. It is possible that a combination of rotation and magnetic activity contribute to both inflation/suppression and Hα emission in such a way as to produce our empirical relation without a causal correspondence between Hα and the magnetic field.</p><p>An alternative explanation for T eff suppression is a spot covered surface. Since spot coverage is also controlled by magnetic fields, a correlation with Hα might still exist. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mohanty et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mohanty &amp; Stassun (2012)</ref> have now shown from a spectral fine-analysis of the 2M0535−05 system, observed at high resolving power during both primary and secondary eclipses, that such a largespot scenario is strongly disfavored as an explanation for the T eff suppression of the primary BD in 2M0535−05. Thus, while the T eff suppression mechanism produces a clear correlation with chromospheric Hα activity as we have shown here, it evidently does not in all cases effect this correlation directly through surface spots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have shown that there exists a correlation between the strength of Hα emission in active M-dwarfs, and the degree to which their T eff are suppressed and radii inflated compared with inactive objects and theoretical evolutionary models. Our relationships above should prove directly useful for a variety of applications in which accurate estimates of masses and radii are needed for low-mass stars and BDs, and should assist in correcting inferred initial mass functions at young ages.</p><p>While promising, the correlations we have derived contain significant scatter, and they are currently limited by the lack of a single sample of stars with both Hα and direct radius measurements. We therefore encourage researchers to publish Hα measurements, as this is usually available from the spectra used to determine EB radial velocities.</p><p>Finally, the relations we have determined already indicate quite clearly that the radius inflation and temperature suppression mechanism operates in such a way that the temperature suppression and radius inflation almost exactly cancel in terms of their effect on the bolometric luminosity. Moreover, the relations between activity, T eff suppression, and radius inflation do not appear to manifest any obvious discontinuity across the fully convective transition (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stassun et al. 2010</ref>). These are important, fundamental clues to the physical nature of these effects, and should help to constrain theoretical models that are being developed to explain these phenomena (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chabrier et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">MacDon- ald &amp; Mullan 2009</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 H-R diagram for the primary and secondary BD components of the EB 2M0535−05 in the ∼1-Myr Orion Nebula Cluster (Stassun et al. 2006, 2007).
