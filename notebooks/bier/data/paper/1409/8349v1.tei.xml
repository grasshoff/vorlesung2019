				<p>Transmission spectroscopy to date has detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-­-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-­-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra 1,2,3,4. From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain high mean molecular weights, opaque clouds, or scattering hazes in their atmospheres, obscuring our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres 1,2,3,4,5. Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of HAT-­-P-­-11b (~4 Earth radii) from the optical to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at 1.4 micrometre wavelength. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts-­-per-­-million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to ~1 mbar, and sufficiently hydrogen-­-rich to exhibit a large scale height. The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere with an upper limit of ~700 times the abundance of heavy elements relative to solar. This is in good agreement with the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which gas giant planets acquire their atmospheres by directly accreting hydrogen-­-rich gas from the protoplanetary nebulae onto a large rocky or icy core 6. We observed transits of HAT-­-P-­-11b 7 (Mp = 25.8 ± 2.9 M⊕; Rp = 4.37 ± 0.08 R⊕; Teq = 878 ± 50 K) in a joint Hubble-­-Spitzer program. Our Hubble observations comprised 1.1-­-1.7 micrometre grism spectroscopy using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in spatial scanning mode. We also integrated these data over wavelength to produce WFC3 photometry 1,2,3,4,8. Our Spitzer observations comprised photometry during two transits per 3.6 &amp; 4.5 micrometre band of the IRAC instrument 9. Because the planet lies in the Kepler field 10 , precision optical photometry (~642nm) was obtained simultaneously with our Spitzer observations, although not simultaneously with our Hubble observations. Table 1 summarizes specific details of our observations and Figure 1a shows our transit photometry and model fits. Because HAT-­-P-­-11 is an active planet-­-hosting star 11,12,13 , we show that starspots on</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observations</head><p>We observed two transits of HAT-­-P-­-11b using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectroscopy near 1.4 microns, and we obtained photometry for two transits at 3.6 microns, and two at 4.5 microns, using warm Spitzer. We also analysed 208 archival Kepler transits, to assess the effect of starspots and update the optical transit depth <ref type="bibr">12</ref> ; Kepler observed HAT-­-P-­-11 during our Spitzer, but not HST, observations. Hubble WFC3 Spectroscopy and White Light Photometry We observed HAT-­-P-­-11 using the HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in spatial scan mode <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. We used the G141 grism, with a binned 4-­-column spectral resolution from 60-89 over the wavelength range 1.1-­-1.7 microns. Gaps in the HST observations (see Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) occur every ~45 minutes during occultations of the Earth. We scanned the spectrum in the cross-­-dispersion direction to maximise efficiency <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">32</ref> . Each scan covered 135 pixels in 44 seconds (~0.3981"/second), yielding ~45,000 electrons per pixel (~70% of saturation). The average photon-­-limited signal-­-to-­-noise ratio (SNR) is ~220 per pixel, integrating to a SNR~2500 per column, for 113 spectral images in transit 1. We were unable to use the second transit because HST's fine guidance sensors lost positional stability, not uncommon in this observing mode <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> . This also occurred 8 times during transit 1. We further removed the entire first orbit and the first image of each orbit-a common practice to ameliorate instrumental effects <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">33</ref> , yielding 72 images for photometric and spectroscopic measurement. Warm Spitzer IRAC Spitzer transits were critical to establish that starspots on HAT-­-P-­-11 are not sufficiently cool to exhibit water absorption masquerading as planetary. Spitzer also provided a long wavelength baseline for the planet's radius, minimising the effect of Rayleigh scattering while remaining sensitive to absorption from carbon-­-containing molecules such as methane and carbon monoxide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kepler Archival Transits</head><p>We used all 208 archival transits of HAT-­-P-­-11 that Kepler observed at ~0.6 microns. The out-­-of-­-transit photometry yielded constraints on the disk-­-integrated activity of the host star (see below). We re-­-fit the phased &amp; binned Kepler light curve that was analysed previously 12,13 , using 4th order limb darkening coefficients to improve the optical radius and geometric parameters of the system. The occurrence of 298 starspot crossings allowed us to characterise the amplitude distribution of spots crossed by HAT-­-P-­-11b during transit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis Limb Darkening Coefficients</head><p>We used a single set of planetary orbital parameters for all analyses, and wavelength-­-dependent 4-­-parameter, non-­-linear limb darkening coefficients 36 (LDCs). For the Kepler, WFC3 band-­-integrated, and Spitzer bandpasses, we computed the LDCs by integrating stellar model intensities over each instruments' response function. For the 128 individual wavelengths from the WFC3 grism, we used the intersection of the WFC3 response function and a 1-­-column (4.71 nm) square window centered at each wavelength. We held the computed LDCs constant during subsequent analyses. We represented HAT-­-P-­-11 using an ATLAS model <ref type="bibr">21</ref> (http://kurucz.harvard.edu/grids.html) having Teff = 4750 K 7 ; [M/H]=+0.3; and log(g) = 4.5. To ensure that our exoplanet spectrum is not sensitive to the stellar parameters, we also derived it using LDCs with Teff = 4500 K and Teff = 5000 K. Both the exoplanet spectrum and the white-­-light (band-­-integrated) transit depth varied negligibly (~1 and ~5 ppm, respectively) between the three stellar models. Repeating our analysis with both quadratic and three-­-parameter limb-­-darkening laws, we found similarly negligible effects (~1 and ~10 ppm). Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 Each WFC3 spatial scan comprised 7 non-­-destructive reads, with 7.35 seconds of exposure per read. We combined them by subtracting each read from the previous read, applying a spatial mask to the difference, and adding all of the masked differences to an initially blank image to create the spectral frame 1,2,3,8 . We used both edge detection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">37</ref> to determine the edges of each difference image in the scanning direction. We masked all pixels within 20 pixels of this edge in the scanning direction, to keep sky background and other noise from accumulating in the final spectral image. We identified bad pixels in the spectral images using a median filter with a 4-­-σ threshold, over a 7-­-pixel window, and assigned bad pixel values to the median of the window. Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a spectral frame from the first visit, displaying the spectral (dispersion) and spatial (cross-­-dispersion) dimensions. The curves in Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref> show the averaged, column-­-integrated spectral template (red), before (top) and after (bottom) being fit to the example spectrum (blue) for both the wavelength solution and the white-­-light photometry as a function of time. We calculated the wavelength flat field calibration using standard procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">31</ref> . We fit a 2D Gaussian to the spectral images, and found that the spectra shifted by at most 1.12 pixels in the wavelength direction; we corrected this shift during the template fitting described below. The final, column integrated spectra were derived by dividing each raw spectral image by its corresponding flat-­-field and subtracting the per-­-column background values, then summing the detector in the cross-­-dispersion direction (down the columns). The sky background was calculated per-­-column as the median of the portion of the spectral image not scanned by the instrument. In Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref>, this corresponds to the blue regions above and below the red/orange spectral information. The background values varied &lt; 3% from 1.1 to 1.7 microns, but were uncorrelated 37 with the resultant planetary spectrum. To derive the WFC3 spectrum for HAT-­-P-­-11b, we used the established technique <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">33</ref> of spectral template fitting. We formed the spectral template by averaging the out-­-of-­-transit spectra, and fit it to individual grism spectra in both wavelength and amplitude 37 , using both Levenberg-­-Marquardt and spline interpolation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">37</ref> . The fitted amplitudes as a function of time yield the band-­-integrated white light curve (WLC) (see Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The WLC defines the average transit depth over the total WFC3 bandpass. WFC3 Exponential and Linear Baselines: The raw WLC contained both the transit and instrument effects in the form of exponential ramps 1,2,8,15 over each orbit, and a linear trend over each visit. We simultaneously fit for exponential parameters as a function of HST's orbital phase, ER(θ;A,S), a linear trend as a function of time, L(t;m,b), an additive offset for the second half of the in-­-transit data O(ti;θ,Oo) (see below), with an analytic transit light curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">38</ref> , MA(t; p, Tc, P, b, a, u1, u2): ER(θ; A, S) = 1 + A * exp{ S * (θi -θmin)} .</p><p>(2a) O(ti, θ; Oo ) = Oo* δ(θi-­-θ2) * χ(ti) . (2c) Model = MA(t; p, Tc, P, b, a, u1, u2)* ER(θ; Ao, So)* L(t; m,b) + O(ti; θ, Oo ) (2d) where θ represents HST's orbital phase, {A, S} are the exponential amplitude and scale factor, and {m, b} are the slope and intercept of the linear function. O(ti; θ, Oo) is a small (~100 ± 50 ppm) step function, χ(ti), correcting an unexplained offset in the band-­-integrated photometry (see Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> between phase ~0.2-0.7). The offset is likely related to a small shift in the position of the spectrum that does not occur in other HST orbits. Including the offset in our model improved the WLC fits significantly, without degrading the Bayesian Information Criterion 39,40 (BIC), or altering the significance of the water detection. We tested four different models for WFC3's WLC exponential baseline <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">39</ref> , and selected among them based on the BIC. The BIC for our adopted model differed only slightly from optimum (ΔBIC &lt;&lt; 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">40</ref> , but the transit depth was more physically realistic compared to atmospheric models. WFC3 WLCs are known to have noticeable red noise 8,33,1 , so we also implemented a wavelet analysis to include both the white noise (σw = 12.81ppm) and the red noise (σr = 61.89 ppm) components of the residuals into our final uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">41</ref> . We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure <ref type="bibr">18</ref> to simultaneously fit the transit and instrument parameters, thereby incorporating correlations between parameters into our reported uncertainties. Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> compares the posteriors graphically. The Pearson correlation coefficient over the each parameter found the correlations to be insignificant (maxi,j(P) &lt; ±0.10 ∀ i,j ∈ {fitted parameters}). HST WFC3 Exoplanet Spectrum Derivation: We calculated the planetary spectrum differentially relative to the WLC, by dividing the spectral template, ST(λ), into each individual spectrum S(λ, ti), allowing for small wavelength shifts (&lt; 1.12 pixels). The planetary spectrum, P(λ), is derived from the normalised residuals, or differential light curves:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DLC(λ, ti) = ( S(λ, ti) -­-ST(λ, ti) ) / ST(λ, ti). (3)</formula><p>We fit the DLC(λ,ti), with differential analytic light curves, DALC(λ, ti), by renormalising the analytic WLCs 38 , MA(ti): DALC(λ, ti) = ( MA(ti) -maxt{MA(ti)} )/( maxt{MA(ti)} -mint{MA(ti)} ) + maxt{MA(ti)} <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> We fit the normalisation amplitude, P(λ), of the DALC's, simultaneously with wavelength-­-dependent linear trends, using linear matrix inversion DLC(λ, ti) = P(λ) * DALC(λ, ti) + mλ *(ti -tmin) + bλ (5) where the minima and maxima are taken over the time domain. Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows all 32 DLCs (blue-­-to-­-red) and DALCs (black) ranging from 1.167 to 1.675 microns with 18nm spacing in wavelength. We used the linear matrix fits as initial conditions for MCMCs to probe posterior distributions per wavelength, forming the final planetary spectrum P(λ) shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>. The DALCs were modified to include wavelength-­-dependent limb darkening described above. Our analysis also included smoothing in wavelength with a triangle function to reduce the effect of known, spectral undersampling with WFC3 data 1,3,8 . The full width half maximum of the smoothing triangle was 4 columns, resulting in 32 DLCs at a spectral resolution of R~75. Warm Spitzer IRAC We performed aperture photometry on the Spitzer images <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, after subtracting a background value determined as a median of the pixel values well away from the stellar image. We applied a newly developed base vector analysis to the subsequent photometry in order to decorrelate the well-­-known Spitzer intrapixel effect <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">44</ref> . We tested this decorrelation method on both published and unpublished Spitzer exoplanet eclipses, and found that it consistently reduces both the BIC and red-­-noise compared to previous methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">44</ref> . Our base vector algorithm fits linear coefficients to the 9 pixel values centered at and surrounding the stellar PSF 16 over time:</p><p>Flux(t) = a -­-1 (t) ∑ n an * pixeln(t); n = {1,…,9}, (6) where a(t) is the normalisation for each 3x3-­-pixel box as a function of time. Our Spitzer fitting simultaneously solved for the transit depth and amplitudes of starspot crossings, by scaling the more precise (and strictly simultaneous) Kepler spot crossings as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kepler Archival Transits</head><p>We used the Kepler data for two completely independent purposes. The first purpose was to derive an improved optical transit depth and geometric parameters. The second purpose was to characterize the nature of starspots on HAT-­-P-­-11. Improving the Optical Transit Depth To improve the optical transit depth, we improved on the previous analysis <ref type="bibr">12</ref> , using all 4 years of Kepler data Q0-­-Q16, incorporating 4 th -­-order limb darkening in the analysis. We detrended the stellar variations by fitting a straight line to the data within one transit duration of 1st and 4th contacts. After dividing by these straight lines, we phase folded all 208 short cadence Kepler archival transits into a single, very high precision transit having 60 second time resolution. We fit an analytic transit model 38 to this phase folded light curve, including the LDCs described above, and geometric parameters from radial-­-velocity measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">45</ref> . This determined both the transit depth and the geometric parameters (e.g., impact parameter) to high precision. All of the values were within 1-­-σ of the original analysis 12 , but now followed the same limb darkening model as all of our data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Nature of Starspots on HAT-­-P-­-11</head><p>Our second analysis of the Kepler data characterized the nature of starspots that occur on the disk of HAT-­-P-­-11. We use the properties of spots crossed by the planet during transit to verify that un-­-crossed spots cannot mimic water absorption in the planetary spectrum. This involves determining the relative temperature (spot vs. photosphere) of the spots crossed during the Spitzer transits, and also demonstrating that those spots are representative of the uncrossed spots. To determine the relative amplitude <ref type="bibr">(Spitzer vs. Kepler)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20</ref> to the Spitzer transits, fitting the spot crossing amplitude simultaneously with the transit parameters. Negative ratios are statistically possible here because of the low SNR of the spot crossing profiles. We allowed our MCMC chains to probe these unphysically negative values of spot crossing amplitudes. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>, the grey region represents the noise-­-dominated regime and the white region represents the physically relevant regime. Because the spot area crossed by the planet is the same for the simultaneous Spitzer and Kepler transits, the relative amplitudes can be converted to relative temperatures in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>. To establish that the crossed spots are typical of the uncrossed ones, we fit a Gaussian profile to each of the 298 Kepler starspot crossing profiles-­--­-during the 208 Kepler transits observed over 4 years-­--­-to determine the full distribution of the spot crossing amplitudes (see Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constraining the Significance of Water Vapour in Starspots</head><p>The amplitude of the starspot effect that mimics exoplanetary absorption is given as fεδ 8 , where f is the fractional coverage of spots on the stellar disk, ε is the depth of the transit, and δ is the water vapor absorption line depths (relative to the spectral continuum) in the spatially-­-resolved starspot spectrum, at the observed spectral resolution. Because the planet's orbit is not synchronous with the star's rotation, spot crossings in the Kepler data were used to estimate a flux deficit of 0.0179 <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Accounting for the (small) optical intensity of dark starspots lead to f=0.02. ε=0.0036 is measured directly by our WFC3 photometry <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. Since we cannot obtain spatially resolved spectra of the starspots on HAT-­-P-­-11, we here estimate δ from Phoenix model stellar atmospheres <ref type="bibr">22</ref> , using a relative temperature constraint for the starspots based on <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>. To establish that the spots occulted in our simultaneous Kepler and Spitzer photometry are typical of HAT-­-P-­-11, we plot the distribution of spot crossing amplitudes (Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 5)</ref> over the entire set of Kepler photometry for HAT-­-P-­-11 (Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Spots that cover the disk of the star cause a brightness variation as the star rotates. This variation has an approximately 2% peak-­-to-­-peak modulation, consistent with the spot coverage inferred from our previous Kepler study <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . The times of our Spitzer and WFC3 observations are indicated on Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> by blue and red lines, respectively. Similarly, the spot crossing amplitudes during our Spitzer observations are identified on Extended <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> as the colored, dashed lines. From this we concluded that the total effect of spots on the disk of HAT-­-P-­-11 is approximately the same during our observations as during other times, and that spots crossed during our Spitzer observations are typical of the unocculted spots during our WFC3 observations. parameter space. The active samples then iteratively migrate towards the regions of high likelihood by replacing the active sample with the lowest likelihood, i.e. the worst fit to the observations, by a new better fitting random sample <ref type="bibr">24</ref> . Convergence is obtained once the logarithm of the Bayesian evidence, Z, computed from the active sample no longer changes by more than ∆ log í µí± =0.0001. The algorithm is robust to multimodal posterior distributions and highly elongated curving degeneracies frequently encountered in exoplanet atmospheric retrieval studies <ref type="bibr">24</ref> .
