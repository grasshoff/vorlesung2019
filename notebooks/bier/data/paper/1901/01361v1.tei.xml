				<p>The fine precision of photometric data available from missions like Kepler provide researchers with the ability to measure changes in light on the order of tens of parts per million (ppm). This level of precision allows researchers to measure the loss of light due to exoplanet transits as well as the light emitted by an exoplanet, or planetary photometric emissions. The planetary photometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and reflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar light may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets the finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the plane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident stellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as opposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three zones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The existence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will be at least partially illuminated by the host star. In this work we will present a complete derivation of the reflective luminosity of the fully illuminated zone. In addition, we will present an outline for the derivation of the reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone. Within this work we will also derive a new expression for the thermal luminosity of an exoplanet by treating each of the three zones as a blackbody emitting at a constant temperature. Finally, it will be shown that an estimation of the radius of the exoplanet requires proper accounting of light from the penumbral zone during the primary transit. Not doing so risks underestimating the radius of the exoplanet and an overestimation of its geometric albedo and nightside temperature. iii</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, researchers have sought to characterize their properties and attempted to determine the distribution of exoplanet types in the universe.</p><p>To that end, evermore precise tools have been created to detect exoplanets. The two most successful methods of detection thus far have been the radial velocity, or RV, and transit method of detection, c.f. the The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The radial velocity method of exoplanet detection takes advantage of the fact that an exoplanet and its host star will orbit their common center of mass. If the orbit is correctly aligned, the host star will have a velocity along our line of sight allowing researchers to measure the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the star to infer the presence of the exoplanet, c.f. Perryman's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, the transit method of detection infers the presence of an exoplanet by observing the small dips in photometric light as the exoplanet passes in front of its host star along our line of sight, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In 2009, the Kepler space telescope was launched with the goal to discover earth-like exoplanets orbiting sun like stars using the transit detection method. To meet this goal, the telescope observed over 100,000 stars for a period of just over four years at very high precision.</p><p>The Kepler space telescope was capable of detecting changes in light of 29 parts per million (ppm) on a magnitude 12 star with a 6.5 hour integration time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As researchers began to characterize the exoplanets detected by Kepler they found it necessary to develop more precise models to describe the wide variety of exoplanets. Transits alone provide information about the radius and orbital parameters of an exoplanet, but other photometric variations may provide information about the mass, reflectivity, and temperature, c.f. Placek, Knuth and Angerhausen <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>The photometric variations within a light curve may be split into two main categories: stellar photometric variations and planetary photometric variations. The stellar variations, which are induced by the presence of the exoplanet, include boosted light and ellipsoidal variations. The boosted light is due to the relativistic effects of the star moving along our line of sight, similar to the effects used in the RV method of exoplanet detection. The ellipsoidal variations are due to tidal interactions between the exoplanet and the host star.</p><p>The gravity produced by an orbiting exoplanet will pull on the surface of the host star resulting in the star being non-spherical; therefore, its observed cross-sectional area will change throughout the orbit, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>.</p><p>The planetary photometric variations arise from light emitted by the planet itself, which comes in two forms: reflected light and thermal light, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>. The main topic of this work will be the determination of the reflected luminosity of extremely close-in exoplanets, or ECIE's, as a function of phase angle. Generally speaking, it is appropriate to approximate the nature of the incident stellar radiation received by an exoplanet as being plane parallel rays such that half of the exoplanet is fully illuminated and half is completely un-illuminated, c.f. Seager's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. This approximation holds for large star-planet separations, but as the separation approaches a few stellar radii one must consider the finite angular size of the host star to accurately describe the incident stellar radiation. This results in an exoplanet whose surface experiences three distinct types of illumination as opposed to the two produced by the plane parallel ray approximation, as described by Kopal in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>. The first is the fully illuminated zone in which the entirety of the apparent disk of the host star is visible. Second, is the un-illuminated zone which receives no radiation from the host star. Finally, between the two zones lies the penumbral zone, which exists in twilight because it receives light from only part of the host star.</p><p>Following is a summary of the contents of this work and an outline of its contributions to the field of exoplanet research by chapter. To begin, Chapter 2 we will review orbital mechanics and provide a set of parameters required to describe the characteristics of exoplanet orbits and light curves. In addition, a brief discussion of the current state of the RV method of exoplanet detection will be presented. Chapter 3 presents a description of transit light for both a uniformly emitting star and one that exhibits limb-darkening as described by Mandel and Agol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Next, Chapter 4 provides a description of the photometric variations of the host star from previous works.</p><p>The bulk of this work is contained within Chapters 5 and 6, in which a description of the reflected light for both plane parallel ray incident stellar radiation, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, and the incident radiation experienced by extremely close-in exoplanets will be presented. The new approach to modeling the reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone described in Chapter 5 was developed because it was discovered that the methods described in Kopal's work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, produces negative luminosity, see Chapter 6. It will also be shown that the penumbral zone itself may be split into two penumbral zones. In addition, a problem was found in which the equations presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> for the fully illuminated zone also produced negative luminosity.</p><p>A new analysis of the luminosity of the fully illuminated zone is presented in Chapter 6 in addition to an overview of the previous work describing the reflected luminosity of exoplanets.</p><p>As part of the process we provide to the community an analysis of the required integrals in Appendix B.</p><p>In Chapter 7 we will describe the time dependent thermal variations of an exoplanet with a range of thermal zones, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, as applicable to exoplanets in general and for ECIE's in particular. Specifically, a new analysis of the thermal radiation will be presented which uses the four zones described in Chapter 5 as opposed to the two zones used in previous work.</p><p>Finally, Chapter 8 describes the method used to add up the photometric variations, c.f.</p><p>Placek's description in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. A comparison will be made between the photometric variations described with plane parallel incident radiation and with the finite angular size of the host star taken into consideration and the ability to distinguish the two models will be discussed.</p><p>Finally, a discussion of conclusions and future work will be presented in Chapter 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 2: Orbital Mechanics</head><p>To properly describe the relationship between the light curve of a star-planet system and the parameters describing that system one must first have an understanding of orbital mechanics.</p><p>As such, we will present in this chapter the derivation of the equations that govern the position of an exoplanet as a function of time. First, we will consider the motion about its host star using the Lagrangian for two masses under the influence of gravity, c.f. Landau's textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Next, we will consider Kepler's problem to describe the star-planet separation as a function of the orbital anomalies. Third, we will discuss the Euler angles used to characterize the orientation of an exoplanet's orbit along a line of sight. Finally, we will present the derivation for the equation describing the radial velocity of an exoplanet, c.f.</p><p>Perryman's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Equations of Motion</head><p>To begin, consider two masses, m 1 and m 2 , at positions r 1 and r 2 respectively. The Lagrangian for the masses is given by The variable ˙ R, is the velocity of the center of mass of the system and r = | r 1 − r 2 | is the relative position of the two masses, c.f. Landau's textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Finally, the potential energy of the system is given by the function V ( r). We will consider the case in which the center of mass remains stationary, i.e. ˙ R = 0, and the potential depends only on the distance between the two particles, or r = | r| 2 , we may write,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L = 1 2 M total ˙ R 2 + 1 2 µ ˙ r 2 − V ( r),<label>(2.</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = 1 2 µ ˙ r 2 − V (r) = 1 2 µ( ˙ r 2 + r 2 ˙ θ 2 ) − V (r).</formula><p>(2.1.3)</p><p>Note that the motion of the two particles is such that the two are moving in a plane; therefore, we have chosen to write the Lagrangian in Equation (2.1.3) using the polar coordinates of a single mass, µ, under the influence of the potential V (r), where θ is the angular coordinate of the mass. where f (r) = −∂V /∂r, is the force due to V (r) acting on the particle. To determine the radial position of the single mass in terms of θ, one must solve Equation (2.1.5), which can be re-written by substituting Equation (2.1.4) into Equation (2.1.5) to find µ¨rµ¨r = 2 µr 3 + f (r).</p><p>(2.1.6) Equation (2.1.6) is a re-statement of Newton's second law and shows that the force directed along the radial coordinate is the sum of the pseudo-force 2 /(µr 3 ), i.e. the centrifugal force, and f (r), the force resulting from the potential V (r).</p><p>Our goal is to describe the trajectory of µ under the influence of a gravitational potential;</p><p>therefore, we will consider the solution to Equation (2.1.6) for a central potential. Which can be substituted into Equation (2.1.6) to reveal</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u = −u + µk 2 . (2.1.9)</formula><p>where u indicates the second derivative of u with respect to θ. .</p><p>(2.1.12) Equation (2.1.12) may be re-written in terms of eccentricity, e, and the semi-major axis, a, by first considering the Cartesian coordinates of the orbit given by r = x 2 + y 2 x = r cos ν y = r sin ν.</p><p>(2.1.13)</p><p>In Equation (2.1.13) we have used the fact that θ 0 is normally taken to be zero because it corresponds to an arbitrary starting point in the orbit, and θ corresponds to the true anomaly of the orbit and will now be referred to as ν to coincide with the notation often used in exoplanet research. In celestial mechanics the angles used to describe the location of a point in an elliptical orbit are referred to as orbital anomalies in reference to the anomalous motion of planets in the sky. Next, we shall rearrange Equation (2.1.12) as r + r cos ν = C and substitute Equation (2.1.13). Solving for r 2 = x 2 + y 2 reveals x 2 + y 2 = (C − x) 2 .</p><p>(2.1.14)</p><p>Rearranging the previous equation produces where b = C/ √ 1 − 2 = a √ 1 − 2 , a = C/(1 − 2 ), and d = aa. Equation (2.1.16) is the Cartesian equation of an ellipse and allows us to identify C as the semilatus rectum C = 2 /(kµ) = AA and as the eccentricity, e of an ellipse. We may then write the radial equation for the two body problem as r(ν) = a(1 − e 2 ) 1 + e cos ν , (2.1.17)</p><p>where r is the radial separation between the two bodies. To determine the separation as a function of time, r(t), one need only determine ν as a function of time. Equation (2.1.17) is a statement of Kepler's first law, namely that the orbits of planets follow an ellipse, where r is the separation between the centers of the two bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Orbital Anomalies</head><p>To determine the true anomaly as a function of time we will make use of two other angles, the mean anomaly, M , and the eccentric anomaly, E; the relationship between the three angles is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>.2.1. The point of closest approach of the exoplanet to the star is called periastron and is marked by the point X. The mean anomaly is named as such because it describes the mean motion of the exoplanet about its host star, i.e. M is the angular distance between the exoplanet's current position and periastron if it was moving in a circular orbit with constant angular velocity. The radius of the circular orbit used to calculate the mean anomaly is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet, a. In addition, the value of M is such that the area of the triangle CY X is the same as SP X. The eccentric anomaly is the angular distance between the exoplanet projected onto an auxiliary circle of radius equal to the semi-major axis and periastron. Both M and E are measured relative to the geometric center of the orbit at point C. The host star is located at one of the foci of the ellipse at point S in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>.2.1. The true anomaly, ν, is the angular distance between the exoplanet and periastron measured using the host star as the vertex of the angle. 1: Illustration of the relationship between the three orbital anomalies; M , the mean anomaly, E, the eccentric anomaly and ν, the true anomaly. The geometric center of the orbit is at point C and the star is located at point S. The orbit of the exoplanet is represented by the solid line. The dashed line represents the auxiliary circle of radius equal to the semiminor axis of the exoplanet's orbit, b. The dotted line represents a second auxiliary circle of radius equal to the semi-major axis of the exoplanet's orbit, a. The exoplanet is located at point P on the ellipse and point P marks the projection of P onto the auxiliary circle of radius a.</p><p>To calculate the mean anomaly we make use of its definition given previously. For a complete orbit the exoplanet travels through 2π radians in a time equal to its period, T ; therefore, the exoplanet has transversed 2πt/T radians in time t. The mean anomaly is then given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M (t) = M 0 + 2πt T = 2π T (t − t p ), (2.2.1)</formula><p>where M 0 is the initial mean anomaly of the orbit and t p is the the time since periastron as measured at the start of observation.</p><p>The ratio of the areas of the triangles SP X and SP X in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>.2.1 can be used to determine the relationship between the mean anomaly and the eccentric anomaly as follows.</p><p>We begin by considering Kepler's second law, which states that the area swept out by a line joining any planet to the focus of its orbit is equal for equal time intervals, in other words the time derivative of the area is constant. The differential area swept out by a planet is given by  therefore, in time t − t p a fraction of (t − t p )/T of the ellipse must be swept out. The area of the second triangle may be determined via subtraction as follows:</p><p>|SP X| = |CP X| − |CP S| = 1 2 a 2 E − 1 2 ea 2 sin E = 1 2 a 2 (E − e sin E) .</p><p>(2.2.7)</p><p>The ratio of the area of an ellipse to that of a circle with radius equal to the semi-major axis of the ellipse is given by A ellipse A circle = πab πa 2 = b a .</p><p>(2.2.8)</p><p>Kepler's second law requires that this also hold for the areas of the triangles SP X and SP X; therefore, division of Equations (2.2.6) and (2.2.7) reveals the relationship between the eccentric and mean anomalies to be E(t) = M (t) + e sin E(t).</p><p>(2.2.9) Equation (2.2.9) is a transcendental equation and can be solved numerically.</p><p>Finally, we may determine the true anomaly from the eccentric anomaly. To do so, consider the two methods to describe the x and y coordinates of the exoplanet as measured from the star: x = a(cos E − e) = r cos ν and y = b sin E = r sin ν. The ratio b : a = √ 1 − e 2 follows from the equation of an ellipse. These three equations can be used to reveal that, cos ν = cos E − 2 1 − e cos E . To determine ν, one may first determine the eccentric anomaly by solving Equation (2.2.9)</p><p>numerically and then using Equation (2.2.12) to determine the true anomaly. The true anomaly would then be used in Equation (2.1.17) to determine the star-planet separation.</p><p>Alternatively, one can determine a relationship between r and E by considering the equation for r, as measured from the star, in Cartesian coordinates: r = a(cos E − e) ˆ i + b sin E ˆ j, <ref type="bibr">(2.2.13)</ref> and taking the dot product r 2 = r · r to reveal that r(t) = a(1 − e cos(E(t))) = a(1 − e 2 ) 1 + e cos(ν(t)) .</p><p>(2.2.14)</p><p>The second line follows from a rearrangement of Equation (2.2.12), and shows that Equation (2.1.17) and the first line of Equation (2.2.14) are equivalent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Euler Angles</head><p>In the foregoing sections we were only concerned with the radial separation between two bodies in planar motion, a one-dimensional problem. To describe the motion of exoplanets within the plane of the sky we require a way to describe the 3-dimensional coordinates of an exoplanet. To do so we will use the Euler angles φ, θ, ψ as described by Euler, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. To transform some vector r to r one must first rotate about the Z-axis by angle φ, i.e. rotate using the matrix R(φ). The second rotation, R(θ), moves through angle θ about the new X-axis. The final rotation is R(ψ) and rotates about the previous Y-axis by angle ψ. The rotations are described by r(t) = R(ψ)R(θ)R(φ) r (t).</p><p>(2.3.1)</p><p>The three Euler angles are defined using the orbital elements such that (φ, θ, ψ) = (i, ω + ν, Ω), where i is the inclination of the orbit, ω is the argument of periastron, and Ω is the longitude of the ascending node, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>.3.1. The inclination, i, is the angle between the reference plane, which we take to be the plane of the sky, and the orbital <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>.3.1: A figure illustrating the relationship between a reference plane, shown as the dotted line, and the orbital plane in grey. The orbital plane is projected onto to the reference plane, which is the plane of the sky. The ascending node, , marks one of the intersections of the orbital plane and the reference plane and is the point of reference for ω, the argument of periastron. The longitude of the ascending node is marked as Ω, and the true anomaly as ν.</p><p>The inclination of the orbit, i, is measured from Z and we have labeled the angle between the reference and orbital planes as 90° − i.</p><p>plane, such that i = 90° indicates an edge-on orbit. The argument of periastron is the angle between the point of closest approach of the exoplanet to its host star and the point at which the orbital plane and reference plane intersect, called the ascending node, . Typically, Ω is set to zero because one cannot determine its value without an image of the system and doing so does not affect the description of the total light received from the starplanet system. To see this consider Figure 2.3.2, which shows the projection of three orbits on the plane of the sky. The value of Ω simply rotates the orbit about the line of sight, but has no effect on the total light received as a function of time; therefore, it cannot be measured using photometric measurements. Setting Ω to zero in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_75">(</ref> as our description of the three-dimensional location of the exoplanet projected onto the plane of the sky with the star at the center of the coordinate system. The final angle to consider is the phase angle, , which is the angle between the vectorˆrvectorˆ vectorˆr pointing from the center of the host star to the center of the exoplanet and the line of sight which we will set to + ˆ Z. The phase angle can be calculated using the dot product of these two vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">cos (t) = ˆ r(t) · ˆ Z = Z(t) r(t) = sin(ω + ν(t)) sin i. (2.3.4)</formula><p>This expression for the phase angle will be useful in determining the flux due to different photometric effects as a function of phase or of time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2.</ref>3.3 illustrates the relationship between the line of sight and the phase angle. Note that a primary transit, when light is lost due to the exoplanet blocking the host star's light, occurs when Z(t) &lt; 0 because the line of sight points from the observer to the exoplanet. At full phase, or = 0, the exoplanet is behind the host star along our line of sight and a secondary transit occurs due to loss of planetary photometric emissions. Both of these types of transits will be described in greater detail in Chapter 3.

This shift occurs due to the Doppler effect, which is the shift in wavelength of emitted star light as the star orbits the star-exoplanet center of mass. The shift in lines is determined by comparing the observed spectra to the expected absorption lines of the host star based on its spectral class.</p><p>Suppose the emitted wavelength is λ emit and the observed wavelength is λ obs , the two are related to each other by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">λ obs = λ emit 1 + β r 1 − β r , (2.4.11)</formula><p>where β r is the velocity along the line of sight normalized to c, the speed of light, c.f.</p><p>Perryman's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

From Equation (2.4.7), we see that a measure of the red shift as a function of time provides information about the period, eccentricity and minimum exoplanet mass, M p sin i, in addition to inferring the existence of the exoplanet.  The plot applies to a Jupiter mass exoplanet orbiting a 1 solar mass star with a period of 1 day. For each case the plot begins at = 0, or full phase, when the exoplanet is behind the host star. The inclination of each orbit is 90°.</p><p>The radial velocity, or RV, method has been one of the most successful exoplanetary detection methods to date. As of July 2018, 757 exoplanets in 560 planetary systems with 136 multiple planet systems have been detected using this method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.

It is possible to break the degeneracy between the planetary mass and the inclination by using a second detection method in conjunction with the RV method. For example, the transit method can be used to set limits on the inclination of the system, see Equation (3.3.2) in Chapter 3.</p><p>The previous chapter presented the equations used to describe the orbits of exoplanets.</p><p>In addition, we reviewed the relationship between radial velocity measurements and the orbital parameters of exoplanets, as well as the mass of the host star and exoplanet.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 3: Transits</head><p>In this chapter we will discuss the most prominent feature of a light curve, a transit, which occurs when an exoplanet passes in front of its host star along an observer's line of sight (LOS). The effect is a temporary decrease in the amount of light observed when the exoplanet blocks out some of its star's light. We will review the relationship between transits and exoplanet characteristics as described previously by <ref type="bibr">Mandel and Agol, [8]</ref>, such as the relative size of the exoplanet to the host star, and the period of the orbit. A transit is a rare occurrence, as it requires that the observed system be aligned properly along an observer's line of sight. The ideal situation is the case in which the exoplanet's inclination is 90°, or edge-on, because such configurations maximize the probability of a transit being observable and we will review the derivation for the probability of a transit.</p></div>

The probability of such an event, the extremes of which are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 3</ref>.4.1, was first derived by Borucki and Summer in their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> for circular orbits and was found to be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">P (transit|circular, I) = R s a , (3.4.1)</formula><p>where a is the radius of the orbit, and I symbolizes all prior information, such as the model being used to describe the orientation of the exoplanet along the line of sight. Equation (3.4.1) shows that the probability of a transit increases for larger stars and decreases as the exoplanet's orbital radius increases. This is because the transit probability can be related to the shadow swept out by the exoplanet which will be less for greater orbital radius, as will now be shown. Following, is a derivation for the transit probability for eccentric orbits using the geometry shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 3</ref>.4.1 and following the work of Barnes and of Knuth et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23]</ref>, with modifications for the coordinate system used in this work. To begin, we assume that there is no preferred orbital orientation for exoplanets. The three parameters of interest are the starplanet separation, r, the orbital inclination, i, and the true anomaly, ν, where r is related to ν via Equation (2.2.14). Their joint probability is given by P (ν, i|I) = 1/C, where C is a constant that can be calculated by normalizing P (ν, i|I):</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">1 = 2π 0 π 0 P (ν, i|I) sin i di dν = 2π 0 π 0 1 C sin i di dν (3.4.2)</formula><p>Solving for C gives the normalization constant</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">C = 2π 0 π 0 sin i di dν = 4π, (3.4.3)</formula><p>which shows that the joint probability of ν and i is P (ν, i|I) = 1/(4π), i.e. the joint prior of ν and i is the inverse of the solid angle of a sphere. The result in Equation (3.4.3) holds true for both eccentric and circular orbits as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_47">P (transit|I) = P i min ≤ i ≤ π 2 OR i max ≥ i ≥ π 2 |I = P i min ≤ i ≤ π 2 |I + P i max ≥ i ≥ π 2 |I = 1 4π 2π 0 π/2 i min sin i di dν + 2π 0 imax π/2 sin i di dν = 1 4π 2π 0 (cos i min − cos i max ) dν = 1 2π 2π 0 R s r(ν) dν, (3.4.4)</formula><p>where we have normalized the transit probability to the probability of any given orbital inclination and true anomaly using Equation (3.4.3). In the second line of Equation (3.4.4)</p><p>we have applied the exclusive OR rule for probability, i.e. P (A OR B|I) = P (A|I)+P (B|I).</p><p>Substituting Equation (2.2.14) for r(ν) in Equation (3.4.4) produces</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">P (transit|I) = R s 2π 2π 0 1 + e cos ν a(1 − e 2 ) dν = R s a(1 − e 2 ) , (3.4.5)</formula><p>which reduces to P (transit|I) = R s /a for zero eccentricity as derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> and expected from Equation (3.4.1).</p><p>Equation (3.4.5) was first derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> and includes grazing orbits for which the impact parameter, b, is less than or equal to one. The exclusion of grazing orbits requires the replacement of the numerator in Equation (3.4.5) with R s − R p . To include all transits, even those in which less than half of the disk of the exoplanet occults the stellar disk, replace the numerator with R s + R p .</p><p>We may assume that e ≤ 1 for orbits of interest in exoplanet research; therefore, Equation (3.4.5) shows that an eccentric orbit is more likely than circular orbit of radius equal to the semi-major axis, a, to result in a transit. Yet, this fact may not mean an increase in detections. The star-planet separation, r, and hence ω, controls the transit time and shorter transits are more difficult to detect than longer transits. As a result, transits that occur near apoastron will be easier to detect than those near periastron. This may also be thought of as a consequence of Kepler's second law; an exoplanet sweeping out a smaller area in a given time period, i.e. near periastron, will be harder to detect than one sweeping out a larger area, i.e. near apoastron.</p><p>Also of interest is the possibility of detecting exoplanets with only a secondary transit due being in a highly inclined and eccentric orbit. Such an occurrence requires that the exoplanet have strong planetary photometric emissions and will likely orbit closely to its host star. Finally, Equation (3.4.5) implies that a bias to detect eccentric exoplanets will exist within transit data. Such a bias could be taken into account by using an informative prior for eccentricity, as described in Kipping's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>.</p><p>In the foregoing chapter, we reviewed the relationship between the transit depth, its shape, and important exoplanet characteristics, such as the exoplanet's radius. In addition, we explored the difference between a transit of a uniform source versus a transit of a source that exhibits quadratic limb darkening, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. We then explored the relationship between the separation of the primary and secondary transits and exoplanet orbital parameters such as the eccentricity and argument of periastron, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>. We also explored the relationship between said parameters and the transit duration, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19]</ref>. Finally, we concluded with a discussion of the probability that an exoplanet will transit along and observer's line of sight, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>. The second effect is the ellipsoidal variation which is the result of tidal forces acting on the surface of the the host star. Four models for the ellipsoidal variation will be outlined, three of which are trigonometric and one is implemented by modeling the deviation of the host star's shape from spherical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Doppler Boosting or Beaming</head><p>The Boosted light is the result of the radial velocity of the host star along our line of sight as described in Section 2.4. As the star moves toward an observer the aberration of light creates a beaming effect in which the light rays exhibit a decrease in angle and an increase in emission rate in the frame of a stationary observer. As the star moves away there will be a decrease in the observed emission rate. Thus, the Boosted light is characterized by an increase and decrease in flux over the course of one period. Note that the effect is only sinusoidal for circular orbits. The following will derive the equation for this effect for the non-relativistic limit as laid out by Rybicki and Lightman <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</p><p>First, we must transform the four-vector, k µ = (ω, k), describing the emitted electromagnetic wave from rest frame S to frame S moving relative to S .

The star's motion will be along our line of sight, or along the x-axis.

The exoplanet reaches full phase at approximately 0.25 days and we observe zero boosted light, then the star begins to move toward the observer as the exoplanet moves away toward the secondary transit. The maximum variation occurs during the secondary transit at 0.50 days. The boosted light may be used to determine the minimum mass of the exoplanet because Equation (4.1.16) is proportional to V r , which in turn in proportional to M p sin i, the minimum mass, see Equation (2.4.7). A detection of the boosted variation allows exoplanet researchers to obtain a mass measurement using only photometric data; however, the variation is only detectable for high mass exoplanets. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>, Loeb and Gaudi suggest that Kepler would be capable of detecting the boosted light of exoplanets with minimum mass 5M J and periods 7 days for main-sequence stars. If the boosted light variation is accompanied by a transit, then it is possible that the transit could provide a measure of the inclination via transit-timing, see Equation (3.3.2). With the inclination set, the true mass of the exoplanet could then be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Ellipsoidal Variations</head><p>The ellipsoidal variations of the host star are induced by the gravitational pull of an exoplanet and depend on the extent to which the star deviates from spherical. First, we will consider To estimate the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations, consider the tidal acceleration acting on a small section of stellar surface at a distance from the center of exoplanet of</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">r − R s a T = GM p 1 (r − R s ) 2 − 1 r 2 = GM p r 2 1 (1 − R s /r) 2 − 1 ≈ 2GM p R s r 3 (4.2.1)</formula><p>The last line of Equation (4.2.1) follows from keeping the first order terms of R s /r. The ratio of the tidal acceleration to that of the surface gravity on the host star,</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">a g = GM s /R 2 s ,</formula><p>gives us an approximation of the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">a T a g ∝ M p M s R s r 3 . (4.2.2)</formula><p>The amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations will also depend on the spectral characteristics of the host star and is given by Loeb and Gaudi in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">A ellip = β M p M s R s a 3 , (4.2.3)</formula><p>where β is the gravity-darkening exponent. The value of β can be determined in multiple ways. In this work β depends on the linear gravity-darkening coefficient, g, and the linear limb-darkening coefficient, u, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref> by Morris:</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">β = 0.15 (15 + u)(1 + g) 3 − u . (4.2.4)</formula><p>The amplitude of the effect in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>, shown in Equation (4.2.3), was determined for circular orbits with radius a. Here we will make the substitution of a = r to account for eccentric orbits, where r is given by Equation (2. <ref type="bibr">2.14)</ref>. The values of g and u can be determined from the spectral characteristics of the star, c.f. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> by Claret and Bloemen. For solar-type</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">stars β ≈ 0.45.</formula><p>The ellipsoidal variations arise due to the deviation of stellar shape from spherical. The variation will be at a maximum when the largest face of the star is facing the observer, at = π/2, and will be at a minimum during full and new phase when = 0 or π. As such, the variation should occur out of phase from the planetary photometric emissions, which peak during the full phase which will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7, and will go through two cycles per orbit. Three trigonometric methods have been used to describe this behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>, and a fourth method seeks to determine the deviation at each point of a projected stellar grid, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>. To begin, we will consider the three trigonometric methods.</p><p>The first trigonometric method, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref> by Faigler and Mazeh, is used in the BEaming, Ellipsoidal and Reflection (BEER) method of modeling photometric light curves of large, short period exoplanets. In the BEER method, the time dependent nature of the variation is taken into account through physical arguments, e.g. it should be out of phase from the reflected light and peak twice per orbit. To account for inclination, the authors include a sin 2 i term, giving:</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">Φ ellip,BEER ≈ −A ellip sin 2 i cos 2π T /2 t . (4.2.5)</formula><p>The minus sign reflects the fact that the ellipsoidal variations are out of phase from the planetary photometric emissions from Chapters 6 and 7 and the T /2 term reflects the fact that the effect peaks twice per orbit. For circular orbits the phase angle, , is equal to 2πt/T , but this does not hold true for highly eccentric orbits, see Section 2.2. As an approximation, we may re-write Equation (4.2.5) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">Φ ellip,BEER ≈ −β M p M s R s r 3 sin 2 i cos(2). (4.2.6)</formula><p>The next trigonometric method of estimating the fractional change in flux due to the ellipsoidal variations was proposed by Kane and Gelino in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref> and considers the unit separation of centers along our line of sight:</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">R(t) r(t) = X(t) 2 + Y (t) 2 r(t) = cos 2 (ω + ν(t)) + sin 2 (ω + ν(t)) cos 2 i, (4.2.7)</formula><p>where X and Y are given in Equation (2.3.3). One may then write the time dependent variations as </p><formula xml:id="formula_75">F ellip,KG F s = Φ ellip,KG ≈ A ellip cos 2 (ω + ν) + sin 2 (ω + ν) cos 2 i.<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_76">Φ ellip,KG ≈ β M p M s R s r 3 sin . (4.2.9)</formula><p>As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 4</ref>.2.1, Equation (4.2.9) is discontinuous in the first derivative at its minima when = 0 or π.</p><p>A slight modification can be made to Equation (4.2.9) to be rid of the discontinuity as described by Placek et. al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Rather than considering the separation of the stellar disk center from the exoplanet disk center along our line of sight, we instead consider the square separation, producing</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">F ellip,mod F s = Φ ellip,mod ≈ β M p M s R s r 3 sin 2 . (4.2.10)</formula><p>The three trigonometric models are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Figure 4</ref>.2.1. In each case the maxima occur at the same phase and have the same value; however, the minima, though occurring at the same phase, differ. Both of the models that use the unit separation of centers along our line of sight share a minimum value of zero, but the BEER method has a negative value at this point. In effect, the BEER method has twice the amplitude of the other two models; therefore, an exoplanet with half the mass could produce an equal amplitude as documented by <ref type="bibr">Gai and Knuth in [32]</ref>. The behavior of the BEER method implies that it</p><p>is not an accurate description of the ellipsoidal variations of stars induced by the presence of an exoplanet.</p><p>Finally, a brief look at the fourth method of modeling the ellipsoidal variation, known as</p><p>Ellipsoidal Variations Induced by a Low-Mass Companion (EVIL-MC), developed by Jackson et. al. and described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref> in IDL for circular orbits and adapted to Matlab and eccentric orbits by Gai, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>. EVIL-MC determines the shape of the star and determines its deviation from spherical for each point on a projected stellar grid. This deviation is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">δR = q z 2 − 2z cos ψ + 1 −1/2 − z 2 + 1 −1/2 − cos ψ z 2 − ω 2 2z 3 cos 2 λ, (4.2.11)</formula><p>where q = M p /M s is the mass ratio of the exoplanet and the star, z is the star-planet separation normalized to the stellar radius (z = r(t)/R s ), cos ψ = ˆ R s · ˆ r (wherê R s is the direction of a point on the stellar surface), ω is the stellar rotation rate and cos λ = ˆ R s · ˆ ω.</p><p>The observed ellipsoidal variation is determined by summing the blackbody flux over the observed area of the star and is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">F ellip F s = Φ ellip = 1 − φ sphere φ star , (4.2.12)</formula><p>Figure 4.2.1: Depiction of the three trigonometric versions of the ellipsoidal variation for an exoplanet with M p sin i = 5 M J orbiting a solar mass star with a one day period. The solid black line shows the BEER version described by Equation (4.2.6), the solid grey line that of Kane and Gelino from Equation (4.2.9) and the dashed-black line the modified Kane and Gelino variation of Equation (4.2.10). Note that the minimum value for the BEER version is negative rather than zero. This negative minimum may result in an underestimation for the exoplanetary mass because it takes half the mass to produce the same amplitude effect.</p><p>where φ sphere is the flux from a spherical star of equal mass and φ star is the flux from the ellipsoidal star.</p><p>Because the star is more of a tear drop than an ellipsoid, the fractional change in flux is greater (i.e. a lower local minimum value) when the exoplanet is at new phase than at full phase because the exoplanet pulls the stellar surface more strongly toward the observer during the primary transit, or new phase at = π. As the stellar surface is pulled away from its center, the effective temperature observed decreases, thus lowering the observed flux, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Due to its computational complexity, the EVIL-MC model will not be considered in this work. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>, it was shown that the modified Kane and Gelino model described in Equation (4.2.10) most closely represents the EVIL-MC model, which was determined to be the preferred model for the Kepler-13 system. For this reason, it will be the one considered when modeling the light curve of an exoplanetary system in this work.</p><p>The ellipsoidal variation provides researchers with another tool to determine the mass of an exoplanet, so long as the stellar parameters are known. Its unique dependence on inclination allows one to calculate the true mass of an exoplanetary companion should the minimum mass (M p sin i) or the inclination be determined from another variation, e.g. the boosted light or the radial velocity method. Should the radius of the exoplanet be determined, e.g.</p><p>from the transit depth, researchers may then determine the density of the exoplanet and gain valuable insight into its possible composition. The density sets limits on the rocky or gaseous nature of an exoplanet.</p><p>To conclude, in this chapter we explored the relationship between exoplanet characteristics and photometric variations of the host star induced by the presence of an exoplanet.</p><p>First, we reviewed the physics behind Doppler Boosting and saw that a detection of this effects can provide information about the mass of an exoplanet in the absence of spectroscopic data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>. In addition, the ellipsoidal variations due to the non-spheroidal shape of the host star created by tidal effects between the host star in exoplanet also provides information about the mass of the exoplanet, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>.</p></div>

We will begin by considering the intensity distribution of the reflected light, J ref l , first for the plane parallel case, in which the incident flux of the host star reaches the exoplanet as plane parallel rays, and then for Extremely</p><p>Close-in Exoplanets (ECIE's), for which the normalized star-planet separation, a/R s , is on the order of one and the finite angular size of the host star must be considered. We will see that for ECIE's, the intensity distribution of the reflected light must be split into two illuminated zones, one of which is fully illuminated and the other is partially illuminated.</p><p>Finally, the reflected luminosity as a function of phase, L ref l (), will be determined for the plane parallel ray case as well as for ECIE's.</p><p>To calculate the reflected luminosity of an exoplanet, L p,ref l , as a function of phase, , one must integrate the reflected intensity distribution, J ref l , over the area of the exoplanet visible along an observer's line of sight that is illuminated, C, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref>.  The geometry of a point, P , on the exoplanet surface is described by the polar angle, η, and azimuthal angle, φ. The phase angle, , is the angle between the substellar point S and the sub-planetary point, E. The line of sight, or LOS, passes through the center of the exoplanet, O p , and the sub-planetary point. The portions of the exoplanet that are visible to an observer is determined by the phase angle. The angle γ describes the angle between the substellar point and the point P and corresponds to the angle of incidence for plane parallel ray illumination. The angle of foreshortening, γ, is also called the angle of reflection and is the angle between a point P and the sub-planetary point.

The azimuthal angle used here will therefore differ by π/2 from those works that set the x-axis as passing through the sub-stellar point. The coordinate system shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">Figure 5</ref>.1.1 is preferable for ECIE's because it will provide additional symmetries to simplify the integration of the reflected intensity distribution over the surface area of the exoplanet.

The star subtends an angle of 48° and would cover around 10% of the exoplanet's sky; furthermore, the authors calculate that approximately 70% of the exoplanet's surface would be illuminated by its host star. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>, Guillot points out that the use of the plane-parallel approximation, which ignores the spherical geometry of the host star, will generally overestimate the magnitude of the difference between the temperatures of the day and night sides of an exoplanet whose orbit is at a low inclination. Kepler-91b has an estimated inclination of 68.5 +1.0 −1.63 ° and may exhibit this overestimation of temperature differences. In addition, it was noted by Robinson in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> that the analysis of the light scattered by close-in exoplanets would be influenced by the finite angular size of the host star and would allow one to probe information at different optical depth of the atmosphere.</p><p>Another exploration of the Kepler-91 system by Placek, Knuth, Angerhausen and Jenkins in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>, analyzes the Kepler-91 system with the inclusion of a Trojan companion to <ref type="bibr">Kepler- 91b</ref>. Although the Bayesian evidence weighed in favor of a Trojan partner to Kepler-91b, the authors were led to believe that the Trojan partner was a false positive because the estimated planetary temperatures were too great to be physically realistic. The dayside temperature of the Trojan candidate was estimated to be 5184.6 ± 531.5 K, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>; whereas, the host star has an estimated effective temperature of 4550 ± 75 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>. It is possible that the low inclination and extremely close-in orbit of Kepler-91b and its hypothetical Trojan partner are contributing to this overestimation of the dayside temperature as suggested in <ref type="bibr">Knuth et al., 2017 [23]</ref>. In this work, we will use Kepler-91b as a model to illustrate the effects of extremely close-in orbits on the photometric emissions of an exoplanet; If an exoplanet exhibits a large penumbral zone, i.e. a small un-illuminated zone, the apparent loss of light during the primary transit will be reduced because the exoplanet will be reflecting light along the line of sight. In effect, the estimation of the radius of the exoplanet will be smaller than its true radius. As will be described in Section 6.1, an underestimation of the radius of the exoplanet will result in an overestimation of the reflectivity of the exoplanet and its night side temperature. </p><formula xml:id="formula_95">Geometric Albedo (A g ) 0.39 ± 0.15 Single Scattering Albedo ( 0 ) 0.58 ± 0.09</formula><p>Following is a description of the geometry of ECIE's and the approach taken to derive the intensity distribution of reflected light for such exoplanets.</p></div>

If the radius of the exoplanet may be determined, e.g. by the transit method, then the geometric albedo may also be calculated. It should also be noted that the geometric albedo is often wavelength dependent, as described in Leigh et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[43]</ref>; therefore, the minimum radius measured will also be wavelength dependent. In order to properly characterize the radius and reflective properties of an exoplanet it is best to take measurements at multiple wavelengths, producing a light curve for each wavelength. Finally, it is worth noting that if the transit method is used to determine the true radius of an extremely close-in exoplanet one must take into account the light originating from the penumbral zone or risk underestimating the true radius of the exoplanet. Such an underestimation in the true radius will result in an over estimation of the geometric albedo and the night side temperature. as follows.

From the definition of 0 , we see that the geometric albedo of a lossless Lambertian sphere is 2/3. In addition, the spherical albedo is unity as expected from its definition as the ratio of the power reflected to that intercepted by an exoplanet.

The relationship of the polar and azimuthal angles is described by the base of the cone defined by the tangents between the star and exoplanet. The cone's base forms a circle of radius R = R p cos η zone where the y-axis defines the axis of the cone and points from the center of the exoplanet to that of the host star. The Cartesian coordinates for a point on the exoplanet's surface obey Equation (5.1.2); therefore, a point along the base of the cone lies on the planet's surface such that its Cartesian coordinates obey x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = R 2 p and x 2 + z 2 = R 2 . Combining these two relationships permits a determination of η in terms of φ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_209">R 2 p = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = y 2 + R 2 = R 2 p sin 2 η sin 2 φ + R 2 p cos 2 η zone .</formula><p>(6.2.1) Equation (6.2.1) may be solved for η as follows: 1 = sin 2 η sin 2 φ + cos 2 η zone 1 − cos 2 η zone = sin 2 η sin 2 φ sin 2 η zone = sin 2 η sin 2 φ sin 2 η = sin 2 η zone csc 2 φ sin η = ± sin η zone csc φ.

The location of the terminator is no longer π as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.1.1, but is now determined by the azimuthal angle of the un-illuminated zone at the intensity equator.

We may again use Equation (6.2.1), but now we will consider y = R p sin φ zone where we have set η = π/2 so that we are considering points on the intensity equator.

(6.2.7)</formula><p>Equation (6.2.6) reveals that the azimuthal angles of the zones have the potential to include the entire exoplanet surface. In addition, Equation (6.2.5) indicates that as we approach the plane parallel ray case, in which both η 1 and η 2 approach zero, the fully illuminated will extend from zero to π and the un-illuminated zone from π to 2π. In such a situation the penumbral zone will not exist.</p><p>JLC clarif y , Let us now consider the conditions under which a given zone is visible to an observer. A zone is completely visible if φ zone,i and φ zone,f are both between φ limb,i and φ limb,f ; therefore, the fully illuminated zone is completely visible for phases between zero and φ f ull,i = η 1 and the un-illuminated zone is completely visible for phases between π − η 2 and π. A zone will be partially visible if either its lower or upper limit is beyond one of the limbs of the exoplanet.

We begin by considering an analog to Kepler-91b, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.3 is a plot of the fractional luminosity from the fully illuminated zone using the parameters given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 where we have changed the inclination to 90° for illustrative purposes. The true inclination of Kepler-91b is such that no portion of its phase is within Cases 1 or 7. The plot is much the same as that of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.2.5a because very little has changed between the two plots. For the fully illuminated zone we can consider Cases 1-3</p><p>in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.3 to be equivalent to Cases 1 and 2 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.2.5a. Furthermore, Case 4</p><p>corresponds to Case 3 of Section 6.2. Finally, Cases 5-6 are equivalent to Cases 4 and 5 of the previous analysis.</p><p>Let us now consider the extent of Case 4 for multiple values of η 1 as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.4</p><p>where we have plotted the first term of Equation (6.2.11) multiplied by πr 2 /(L s 0 R 2 p ) to provide a unitless quantity.

Furthermore, we see that as the value of η 1 increases the extent of Case 4 decreases. In addition, the magnitude of the reflected luminosity decreases because the size of the fully illuminated zone decreases more quickly than the increase in incident radiation from the host star due to the decrease in the star-planet separation. Finally, we note here that of the confirmed exoplanets listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.2, none exhibit a value of η 1 greater than 41.0°. Curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.4 for which η 1 is greater than 40° are presented for illustrative purposes and to check for the existence For each case the range of phase angles for which it applies is listed. The total reflected luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the fully illuminated and penumbral zones, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.3: Shown is a plot comparing the fractional flux of a Kepler-91b analog using the parameters given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 with the exception that we now have set the inclination to 90°.

It is likely that for other exoplanets we will find that the luminosity of the fully illuminated zone quickly approaches that given by the plane parallel ray approximation for star-planet separations greater than about 3 stellar radii.</p><p>We note that for Kepler-91b the difference between the incident stellar radiation modeled </p><formula xml:id="formula_244">(sin η 1 , [, η 1 ]) {µ} /R 2</formula><p>p as a function of the phase angle for multiple values of η 1 for Case 4. Here we see that the extent of this case decreases as η 1 increases. In addition, we find that for η 1 = 0 the function is equal to H Lambert () for a lossless Lambertian sphere as expected. Finally, we note that as η 1 increases the size of the fully illuminated zone decreases such that the overall luminosity decreases in magnitude. It is worth noting that the exoplanets in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.2 do not contain values of η 1 greater than 41.0°.</p><p>as plane parallel rays as described in Section 5.2 and that modeled using the finite angular size of the host star as described in Section 5.3 is not detectable using current technology. Should future missions be capable of detecting changes in flux on the order of a few parts per million one would be able to detect the influence of the finite angular size of the host star on the luminosity of the exoplanet.</p><p>Finally, let us consider the possible contributions of the penumbral zones to the overall reflected luminosity of an exoplanet by considering the difference between the luminosity of a lossless Lambertian sphere and the fully illuminated zone. Because the penumbral zones receive less incident stellar radiation than the fully illuminated zone one should expect that the inclusion of the zones would not increase the total luminosity of the exoplanet beyond that of a lossless Lambertian sphere for Cases 1-3. For such cases the maximum difference is 14.2 ppm, or about 17.9% of the luminosity of the fully illuminated zone during the secondary eclipse, for the Kepler91-b analog plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">Figure 6</ref>.3.3. Thus, the increase in the luminosity one may expect from the inclusion of the penumbral zones for cases near the new phase of the exoplanet, i.e. Cases 5-7 for which the exoplanet is near the primary transit, will likely be of a similar magnitude. Again, changes in luminosity of this order are not yet detectable with current instruments, but maybe so in the future. For example, PLATO is a planned ESA mission intended to provide up to 2% precision in the determination of planet radii, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[44]</ref>.</p></div>

The geometry of the system adds corrective terms to the expected geometric albedo of 2 0 /3 for a Lambertian sphere of the form (R p,s /r) n where n is odd. Finally, we see that as the star-planet separation, r, increases the geometric albedo quickly approaches that of a Lambertian sphere.</p><p>In Section 6.1 we saw that both the geometric and spherical albedos played an important role in characterizing the reflective properties of exoplanets. For the plane parallel ray modeling of incident stellar radiation the two variables depended only on the directional scattering properties of the exoplanets surface or atmosphere. We see here that when the finite angular size of the host star is considered, as is necessary for ECIE's, that the albedo of an exoplanet cannot be separated from geometrical properties of the star-planet system.</p><p>This fact was hinted at in Section 6.1 when we stated that the parameter A g (R p ), or the minimum radius, was the only one that could be determined from the reflected luminosity, Equation (6.1.13), alone. The parameter of interest now has shifted from the geometric albedo to the single scattering albedo 0 .</p><p>Within the previous chapter we have outlined the relationship between the reflected intensity distribution and the reflected luminosity of an exoplanet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. In addition, we have reviewed the luminosity as a function of phase in the case of plane parallel ray illumination, c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34]</ref>. We then turned the luminosity for the fully illuminated zone of an exoplanet in which we have taken the finite angular size of the host star into account when describing the illumination. We saw that the equations given in previous work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, produced nonphysical luminosity in that it exhibited negative luminosity. New to this work is a correction to that error as described in Section 6.3. We also compared the reflected luminosity using this new model and the plane parallel ray model and found that the two differ by no more than 5.09 ppm for the case of Kepler-91b, which is not detectable within the Kepler data set. We concluded with a discussion of the effect of this model on the determination of the geometric albedo of exoplanets. We will now shift our attention to the determination of the luminosity due to thermal radiation of an exoplanet.</p></div>

Given that Equation (7.2.8) from Case 2 describes the un-illuminated zone we see that its limiting behavior does in fact match that of the night side of the exoplanet given in Equation (7.1.8).

From these plots we see that with current technology one would not be able to distinguish the two models for the thermal radiation of the exoplanet. For exoplanets with greater temperature differences it may be possible to distinguish the two models. In future work, we will explore the possibility further.</p><p>Let us now take a deeper look at the plot shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1. First, note that the fractional luminosity of the fully illuminated zone is always less than that produced by the day side of the exoplanet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1b because the fractional area of the fully illuminated zone is always less than that of a half hemisphere. The same is true of the fractional luminosity of the un-illuminated zone as compared to the night side of the exoplanet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1c. We note here that neither the fractional flux due to the day side or the night side of the exoplanet are zero at any point in the exoplanet's orbit because the inclination of Kepler-91b is such that the half hemisphere of either side is never outside of the line of sight. This is not the case for either the fully illuminated or un-illuminated zones.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1d, we see that the fractional flux due to the thermal radiation of the penumbral zone is never zero because some portion of the penumbral zone is always visible.</p><p>In addition, we see that it's maximum occurs twice per orbit during phases within Case 3.</p><p>We note here that the fractional flux due to the reflected light of the penumbral zone will likely follow a similarly shaped curve. Here we see that the difference between modeling the thermal radiation with three zones and modeling it as a dayside and night side decreases quickly as the normalized semi-major axis increases. In addition, we see that both the fractional flux due to the fully illuminated and un-illuminated zones increases with increasing star-planet separation. This is because the fractional area of each zone increases and approaches one half with increasing star-planet separation. Likewise, we see that the fractional flux due to thermal radiation within the penumbral zone decreases because the size of the penumbral zone decreases with increasing star-planet separation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Four Zones</head><p>The principles discussed in Section 7.2.1 still apply now that we are considering four zones, for example, each of the two penumbral zones still vanish as the star-planet separation increases.

We are considering an edge-on orbit for illustrative purposes because the inclination of Kepler-91b is such that phase angles within Case 1 and Case 7 are not present. The first plot compares all seven cases to that of the fractional luminosity produced by an exoplanet experiencing Lambertian plane parallel incident radiation as in Equation (7.1.9). In the second plot we have also varied the star-planet separation.</p><p>Here we have not considered how the star-planet separation may influence the exoplanet's temperature; therefore, we see very little difference between the curves shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.3.</p><p>The primary reason behind the differences between each curve is the influence the star-planet separation has on the size of each of the four zones.

In contrast, Penumbral</p><p>Zone Two is at a minimum and approaches zero during Case 1 rather than Case 7. Like Penumbral Zone One, Penumbral Zone Two is at a maximum sometime during Case 3.</p><p>Finally, let us consider the effect of star-planet separation on the fractional flux due to thermal radiation from the four zones as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.5. As was the case in Section 7.2.1, the fractional flux from the fully illuminated and un-illuminated zones increases with star-planet separation because the size of each zone increases with increasing star-planet separation and we have not taken into account the influence of star-planet separation on the temperature of each zone. The opposite is true of the two penumbral zones and we find that as star-planet separation increases the thermal radiation from these two zones decreases.</p><p>As was the case for the three zone model described in Section 7.2.1 the four zone model described here is not distinguishable from the day/night side model described in Section 7.1</p><p>for Kepler-91b with current technology. For exoplanets with greater temperature gradients it may be possible to distinguish between the two models and to characterize the change in temperature over multiple zones.  2.1a shows a comparison between the total fractional flux due to thermal radiation from all three zones as a function of phase. Also plotted is the fractional flux due to thermal radiation assuming Lambertian plane parallel ray illumination such that the thermal radiation may be described by Equation (7.1.9). The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1a shows the difference between the fractional flux of the plane parallel ray model and that of the three zone model. Next, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1b we have plotted a comparison between the fractional flux due to the fully illuminated zone and that of the dayside of the exoplanet if we were to assume a plane parallel ray model described by Equation (7.1.6). Similarly, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1c we have a comparison between the fractional flux due to the un-illuminated zone and the night side of an exoplanet described by Equation (7.1.8). Finally, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1d is a plot of the fractional flux due to the penumbral zone. To produce the above plots we used the parameters given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 with the exception of exoplanet temperature. The day side temperature of the fully illuminated zone temperature are both 2441.7 K, and the un-illuminated zone and night side temperatures are both 2348.2 K, <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[46]</ref>. Finally, the penumbral zone temperature is the average of the day side and night side temperatures reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 and for the same temperatures as those used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.1 where we have varied the normalized semi-major axis, a/R s . Here we see that the fractional flux emitted by the penumbral zone decreases as the star-planet separation increases because the size of the zone is inversely proportional to the star-planet separation. Furthermore, note that the opposite is true for both the fully illuminated and un-illuminated zones.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 with the exception that the inclination is now 90°. For the Lambertian curve the two zone model described in Section 7.1 was used with a day side temperature of 2441.7 K and night size temperature of 2348.2 K,   : Each of the above plots shows the fractional flux due to thermal radiation from one of the four zones described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">Table 7</ref>.2.2 using the parameters given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>.3.1 with the exceptions noted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_86">Figure 7</ref>.2.3.

Note that the fractional flux emitted by the fully illuminated and un-illuminated zones always remain less than that emitted by the day side or nightside of an exoplanet with equivalents parameters, but neglecting the finite angular size of the host star. In addition, we see that the maximum amount of flux from either penumbral zone occurs during Case 4 of the orbit.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">Table 7</ref>.2.2 where we have varied the star-planet separation by varying the normalized semi-major axis, a/R s .

The amount of thermal radiation received from both penumbral zones decreases as the star planet separation increases, but the amount from both the fully illuminated and un-illuminated zones increases.</p></div>

The symmetric nature of this model will result in fewer cases that will need to be evaluated. For example, for N = 4 only five cases are required to describe the exoplanet's orbit as opposed to the seven cases required to describe the asymmetric situation in Section 7.2.2.</p><p>One advantage of modeling the temperature gradient of an exoplanet in this manner is the fact that it offers an analytical approach to the problem.

In the second to repurchase we treated the exoplanet as having either three or four temperature zones in which each zone was delimited according to how much of the host star is visible within the zone. A comparison between the two models reveals that they differ by less than 1 ppm for Kepler-91b, which is not detectable within the Kepler dataset; however, the difference may be detectable for exoplanets that exhibit a greater temperature gradient. We concluded this chapter with an outline of future work in which an exoplanet's temperature gradient may be modeled as having N equally spaced temperature zones.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Determination of Stellar Radius</head><p>The determination of the planetary radius from transit depth requires that the stellar radius be well known, see Equation (3.1.1  <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[50]</ref> to improve stellar radius estimations of Kepler stars using Gaia photometry and parallax measurements. These efforts produced a median uncertainty in stellar radius of 8%, which corresponds to an improvement of about a factor of 4-5 in the determination of stellar radii. It may also be possible to use photometric variations to estimate stellar radius by including it in the set of model parameters used in EXONEST and modeling for it directly.</p><p>In the absence of spectroscopic data one may be able to disentangle the planetary and stellar radii by considering the transit duration as described in Section 3.3 and the photometric variations described in Chapters 4, 6 and 7 because there are unique dependences of the planetary photometric emissions on the two radii. To begin, the transit depth and the thermal variation depend on the planetary and stellar radius according to R p /R s as described by Equations (3.1.1), (7.1.6) and (7.1.7). The transit separation, as described by Equation (3.3.2), depends on the stellar radius and the semi-major axis in the form of R s /a, as do the ellipsoidal variations via Equation (4.2.3). In addition, the plane parallel ray model for reflected light includes a factor of R p /r, see Equation (6.1.18). If some of these photometric variations are detectable along with the transit depth it is possible to disentangle the stellar radius from the planetary radius by determining the star-planet separation from the period of the orbit if the mass of the star is well known. The stellar mass may be determined via a combination of the boosted light and ellipsoidal variations if they are detectable.</p><p>If the planetary photometric emissions are modeled by taking into account the finite angular size of the host star we find a new dependence on stellar radius, star-planet separation, and planetary radius. According to the equations described in Section B.3, the terms of R p /R s and R s /r now appear as part of inverse trigonometric function. Finally, from Equation (6.4.6) we see that the reflected light now has unique dependencies on combinations of R s,p /r. Thus, the inclusion of the finite size of the host star in light curve models provides new relationships between stellar, planetary and orbital radius will grant researchers a new tool to determining stellar and exoplanetary characteristics for ECIE's.</p><p>To summarize the foregoing chapter, we have described the relationship between total light curves and the photometric variations of an exoplanetary system. First, the predicted light curve is a summation of the primary and secondary transit, and the photometric variations. Next, the measures data is normalized to the observed mean flux and it is assumed that this is approximately equal to the stellar flux. Typically, the data is phase folded over the period of the orbit. We concluded the chapter with a comparison between the predicted light curves using the plane parallel ray approximation of incident stellar radiation and those predicted by taking into account the finite angular size of the host star. We saw that the two differ the most just before and after the secondary transit and that the difference is only a few parts per million for Kepler-91b. This difference will be greater for exoplanets with larger penumbral zones or temperature gradients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 9: Conclusion</head><p>In the foregoing chapters we have explored the nature of photometric light curves produced by exoplanetary systems. We have connected the orbital and physical parameters of exoplanets to their signatures on the transit and photometric light variations. Most notably we have addressed the problem of analyzing planetary photometric emissions for extremely closein exoplanets, ECIE's, for which the plane parallel ray model of incident stellar radiation breaks down. For such exoplanets the finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account so that the relationship between the radius of the exoplanet and its temperature and reflectivity is properly model.</p><p>The work of Kopal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, which was concerned with modeling the reflection effect for binary stars, was used as a template to determine the reflected luminosity as a function of phase for ECIE's. It was discovered that his analysis of the fully illuminated zone, for example [6, Eq's (62)-(69)], actually produces negative luminosity near the full phase of an exoplanet. A reevaluation of the integrals described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 6</ref>.2.2 was presented and shown to produce luminosity that is never negative and always less than that of the Lambertian phase function given in Equation (6.1.13).</p><p>In addition, a more complete analysis of the reflected luminosity of the penumbral zone was presented as an improvement to the approximations used to produce [6, Eq's (86) and (90)]; however, it was found that such an analysis produces negative luminosity within the penumbral zone. Possible reasons for this phenomenon include the poor approximations described in Equation (5.3.52), but more likely is the fact that part of the integration used to produce the reflected intensity distribution within the penumbral zone is imaginary. Efforts to correct these errors led to the discovery that the exoplanet may be more accurately described using two penumbral zones as opposed to the single penumbral zone presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we have presented an analysis of the thermal emissions of an exoplanet if one models it as four zones each with their own effective temperature as opposed to the two zone model used if one considers the exoplanet as having only a day side and nightside. One can consider the four zone model as being one that roughly accounts for the temperature gradient of an exoplanet produced by accounting for the finite angular size of the host star. We have also shown that the difference between modeling the exoplanet using the plane parallel ray approximation and properly accounting for the finite angular size of the host star is only on the order of a few parts per million and is not detectable using current technology. Future instruments, such as PLATO, may be capable of distinguishing the two models.</p><p>In future work we will complete the analysis of the luminosity of the two penumbral zones and extend the analysis to linear limb darkening. Once completed, we will add the model to the EXONESTsoftware package's suite of plug-and-play models of photometric effects to determine if any exoplanets have light curves that support modeling their reflected light and thermal emissions using the four zones described in this work.</p><p>Also of interest is the improvement of the analysis of the secondary eclipse. Within this work we have used the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> and treated the occultation of the exoplanet by the host star like that of a planet transiting a uniform star. The luminosity of an exoplanet is not uniform even for the plane parallel ray approximation, but rather falls with the cosine of the angle from the sub-planetary point, cos γ. For ECIE's, the luminosity of the exoplanet near the secondary transit will also vary between the fully illuminated and penumbral zones.</p><p>Properly accounting for the portion of each of the zones visible during the ingress and egress of the secondary transit may require the techniques presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, in future work we will develop a method of modeling the temperature gradient of an exoplanet as a set of concentric rings centered about the line connecting the center of the exoplanet to the sub-stellar point. Such a model will add an analytical approach to efforts to produce heat maps of exoplanets such as those described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[47]</ref>.</p></div>

Second, for positive values of α less than half of the apparent disk of host star would be visible. Figure 5.3.4 depicts a situation in which more than half of the apparent stellar disc is visible.

Cowan and Fujii's work [47], using a variety of methods including mapping the temperature of an exoplanet's atmosphere as a function of longitude and latitude. In a future work, we will seek to model an exoplanet's temperature variations by treating it as a series of rings centered along the line connecting the center of the exoplanet to the sub-stellar point. Each of these rings would be treated as a blackbody with constant temperature. The temperature would be greatest at the sub-stellar point at φ = π/2 and decrease to a minimum on the other side of the exoplanet at φ = 3π/2. The temperature would be constant within each ring which will be evenly spaced according to the polar angle delimiting each zone. An example is shown in Figure 7.3.1 for the case of eight zones.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_100"><head>Figure 8 .</head><label>8</label><figDesc>Figure 8.2.1 compares the photometric emissions for Kepler-91b assuming either a circular or eccentric orbit and a single scattering albedo of 0.585. Assuming a precision of about 29 ppm we see that both the reflected light and the ellipsoidal variations are detectable from Kepler light curves. Notice that the reflected light, boosted light, and thermal radiation have a period equal to the orbital period of the exoplanet, but the ellipsoidal variation has a period half that of the orbital period. As a result, the sum of the photometric variations has two peaks which are equal in height for circular orbits, but unequal for eccentric orbits for certain values of the argument of periastron. The difference in height for eccentric orbits is due to the misalignment of the ellipsoidal variation to that of the other three photometric variations for eccentric orbits. Illustrated in Figure 8.2.2 are the photometric variations assuming that the reflected light is produced using the model described in Section 6.3 where we have only plotted the fractional flux of the fully illuminated zone and leave a fuller description that includes the penumbral zones for a later work. In addition, the thermal radiation was determined from Equation (7.2.20). The general features of the two plots do not differ significantly from Figure 8.2.1, but there is a slight difference noticeable near a fractional period of 0.6 in</figDesc></figure>

The curve labeled as "Original" assumes that the planetary photometric emissions were produced by an exoplanet that is illuminated by plane parallel rays so that the reflected light is given by Equation (6.1.18) and the thermal radiation by Equation (7.1.9). The curve labeled as "New" was produced by accounting for the finite angular size of the host star. Only the reflected light of the fully illuminated zone, Equation (6.2.12), is included in these plots, but all four zones are included within the thermal radiation, Equation (7.2.20).
