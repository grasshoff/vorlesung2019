				<p>Context. Seasonal variations and climate stability of a planet are very sensitive to the planet obliquity and its evolution. This is of particular interest for the emergence and sustainability of land-based life, but orbital and rotational parameters of exoplanets are still poorly constrained. Numerical explorations usually realised in this situation are thus in heavy contrast with the uncertain nature of the available data. Aims. We aim to provide an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis dynamics of exoplanets, linking it directly to physical and dynamical parameters, but still giving precise quantitative results if the parameters are well known. Together with bounds for the poorly constrained parameters of exoplanets, this analysis is designed to allow a quick and straightforward exploration of the spin-axis dynamics. Methods. The long-term orbital solution is decomposed in quasi-periodic series and the spin-axis Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of eccentricity and inclination. Chaotic zones are measured by the resonance overlap criterion. Bounds for the poorly known parameters of exoplanets are obtained from physical grounds (rotational breakup) and dynamical considerations (equipartition of AMD). Results. This method gives accurate results when the orbital evolution is well known. The chaotic zones for planets of the Solar System can be retrieved in details from simple analytical formulas. For less constrained planetary systems, the maximal extent of the chaotic regions can be computed, requiring only the mass, the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of the planets present in the system. Additionally, some estimated bounds of the precession constant allow to classify which observed exoplanets are necessarily out of major spin-orbit secular resonances (unless the precession rate is affected by the presence of massive satellites).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>From the works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Laskar &amp; Robutel (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laskar et al. (1993b)</ref>, we know that the long-term dynamics of the terrestrial planets of the Solar System feature wide chaotic regions allowing large variations of their obliquity. In particular, Mars is currently in a chaotic region extending from 0 o to 60 o obliquity, whereas the Earth is located in a stable region thanks to the presence of the Moon, resulting in obliquity variations of only a few degrees. Subsequent studies detailed both the past and future spin-axis evolution the Earth (Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Laskar et al. 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Li &amp; Batygin 2014b</ref>), Venus ( ) and Mars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Laskar et al. 2004a</ref>). On the other hand, paleorecords on Earth show that even the very slight variations of its orbit and obliquity led to major climate changes (e.g. Weertman 1976; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hays et al. 1976)</ref>. This implies that life on Earth would be very different to what it is now if the Earth had evolved in a large chaotic zone, as it would have without the stabilising effect of the Moon. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that highobliquity planets undergo severe seasonal variations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>) even for a stable obliquity (but conditions suitable for the very emergence of life could still be achieved: in some extreme cases, the amount of liquid water on the surface may even be favoured by large obliquity variations, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armstrong et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>As the formation of the Moon is thought to have resulted from an accidental collision event (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hartmann &amp; Davis 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Canup &amp; Asphaug 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lock et al. 2018</ref>), a "moonless" Earth was a possible (or even likely) outcome of the planetary formation process. In the broader context of exoplanets, the dynamics of such a moonless Earth is thus more than of academic interest. This motivated further works about the structure of the chaotic region (Li &amp; Batygin 2014a) and some additional numerical studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>When it comes to exoplanets, we must face the problem of the incomplete and imprecise nature of both dynamical and physical data. Except from very favourable cases, like a fast precession and an important flattening inducing detectable transit depth modulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carter &amp; Winn 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Correia 2014</ref>), the spin orientation and the flattening of exoplanets are far from being reachable by observations. They must therefore be taken as completely free parameters, in the spirit of the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993</ref> for the Solar System planets. Moreover, the orbital properties of exoplanets are not well known either, especially the respective orientations of the orbits (including the mutual inclinations, which play a crucial role in the spin-axis dynamics). Several authors tackled this problem already (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brasser et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deitrick et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shan &amp; Li 2018)</ref>: they used numerical integrations of the planetary system in order to build the time-dependent perturbation of the spin axis. Applied to extrasolar planets, this method requires to choose a nominal value for both the rotational parameters and the unknown orbital elements. The parameter space to be explored is thus very wide, so that even elaborate numerical explorations require some degree of arbitrariness. Consequently, the use of numerical integrations at this stage could appear a bit in contradiction with the very incomplete nature of the data. However, the secular problem (averaged over rotational and orbital motions) is not as complex as it could appear. Some hints about a possible analytical treatment were actually given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Laskar (1996)</ref> and partially exploited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Li &amp; Batygin (2014a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shan &amp; Li (2018)</ref>. In the exoplanetary case, a refined analytical theory would be very convenient, since it would give in a direct way the sensibility of the spin-axis dynamics to the various known and unknown parameters, instead of giving a list of possible outcomes. Associated with some bounds for the unknown parameters, such a theory would give a clear range for these possible outcomes.</p><p>This was the approach used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. (2004)</ref>, with the aim of finding the probability of small obliquity variations for hypothetical terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of known exoplanetary systems. Their analytical developments, though, were limited to the lowest-order approximations (their parameter space was indeed enormous since, in this case, the planet itself was hypothetical). The recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shan &amp; Li (2018)</ref> also contains an analytical part applied to the particular case of exoplanets <ref type="bibr">Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f</ref>. This time, their calculations were mostly designed to precise and explain numerical results, so they did not try to bring any substantial improvement to the theory by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. (2004)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, the goal of this article is twofold: i) provide a general analytical formalism for studying the longterm spin-axis dynamics of (exo)planets and ii) clarify what kind of information about the spin can be obtained from typical observed exoplanetary systems, that is, with numerous unknown physical and dynamical parameters. In particular, it is crucial for future studies to have a simple way to classify the observed exoplanets according to the characteristics of their spin dynamics. This would allow to determine which exoplanets are worth to be studied in more details (in particular if a complex chaotic spin dynamics is expected) and which ones have necessarily a very simple spin dynamics, making unnecessary any further numerical or analytical study. Such a general analysis will give both a qualitative view of the system if it is poorly known (in the continuation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. 2004</ref>), and a quantitative description of the dynamics if it is well known (as an analytical counterpart of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993)</ref>.</p><p>This article is organised as follows: Sect. 2 recalls the Hamiltonian of the secular spin-axis dynamics and shows how it can be expanded in terms of the orbital motion parameters. The secular resonances at all orders can then be isolated and used to delimit the chaotic regions. Then, Sect. 3 shows how an incomplete set of orbital elements can still be used to constrain the orbital solution of an exoplanet. Combined with the rotational breakup limit, it allows to make a preliminary classification of the "nonresonant" exoplanets, for which no chaos can appear and the obliquity variations are constrained by an analytical bound.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Development of the Hamiltonian</head><p>Let us consider a system composed of a star and several planets. We study the rotational dynamics of one planet among them. For now, we consider that this planet is far from any spin-orbit resonance. Considering only the lowestorder term of the torque from the star expanded in Legendre polynomials, the Hamiltonian of rotation averaged over orbital and rotational motions is given for instance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Laskar &amp; Robutel (1993)</ref> and detailed by Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar (1997)</ref>. It can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(X, −ψ, t) = − α 2 X 2 1 − e(t) 2 3/2 − 1 − X 2 A(t) sin ψ + B(t) cos ψ + 2XC(t),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the conjugate coordinates are X (cosine of obliquity) and −ψ (minus the precession angle). The quantity α is called the "precession constant" (contrary to previous studies, we prefer to exclude here the eccentricity e appearing in denominator from the definition of α). Following the derivation proposed by Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar (1997)</ref>, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α = 3 Gm 0 2 ωa 3 2C − A − B 2C .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In this expression, G is the gravitational constant; m 0 is the mass of the star; a is the semi-major axis of the planet in orbit around the star; ω is its spin angular velocity, and A B C are its momenta of inertia. The Hamiltonian (1) depends explicitly on time t through the eccentricity e and the functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">         A(t) = 2 ˙ q + p C(t) 1 − p 2 − q 2 B(t) = 2 ˙ p − q C(t) 1 − p 2 − q 2 , C(t) = q ˙ p − p ˙ q,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>in which q = sin(I/2) cos Ω and p = sin(I/2) sin Ω, where I and Ω are respectively the orbital inclination and the longitude of ascending node of the planet. In the following, we will write η ≡ sin(I/2). One can note that if there is only one planet in the system (two-body problem), the obliquity is constant and the precession angle circulates with constant angular velocity αX/(1 − e 2 ) 3/2 . Let us suppose that the eccentricity and the inclination of the planet are small, such that we can develop the Hamiltonian in series of e and η. In the following, we present the terms up to order 3, but the method presented here can be generalised to any order (as we will see, the third order is the first one at which the eccentricity begins to play a substantial role). Using the fact that C = η 2 ˙ Ω = O(η 2 ), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A = (2 + p 2 + q 2 ) ˙ q + 2p C + O(η 4 ) B = (2 + p 2 + q 2 ) ˙ p − 2q C + O(η 4 ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Let us now suppose that the secular orbital dynamics of the planet, resulting from the perturbations by the other planets, is quasi-periodic. This amounts to considering that the chaos present in the orbital secular system acts on a much larger timescale than the spin dynamics under study. As we will see below, this holds very well for the Solar System (this methodology was first proposed by Laskar 1996; it is Article number, page 2 of 23 M. Saillenfest et al.: Secular spin-axis dynamics of exoplanets used for instance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Li &amp; Batygin 2014a)</ref>. In this case, we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">e exp(ii) = N j=1 E j exp(iθ j ) η exp(iΩ) = M j=1 S j exp(iφ j ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where is the longitude of pericentre of the planet in orbit around the star. The angles θ j and φ j evolve linearly with frequencies µ j and ν j , that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ j (t) = µ j t + θ (0) j and φ j (t) = ν j t + φ (0) j ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>whereas the amplitudes E j and S j are real constants of order e and η or smaller. Such series can be obtained either from analytical theories or from frequency analysis of numerical solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Laskar 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Laskar , 1990</ref>. In a general integrable case, µ j and ν j are integer combinations of the fundamental frequencies of the orbital dynamics (usually noted g k and s k ), and the series contain an infinite number of terms. Arranging the terms by decreasing amplitude, we consider here a truncation with N terms for the eccentricity and M terms for the inclination. We get then</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">e 2 = N j=1 E 2 j + 2 N</formula><p>We note that there can be no resonance among the angles φ j and θ j because they come from the quasi-periodic solution of the orbital dynamics. By definition, they are thus already "integrated".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">One perturbing term: Colombo's top</head><p>From (11-12), we conclude that at lowest-order to the perturbation, resonant angles can only be of the form σ = φ j + ψ. Let us consider a single resonance with the term j = p. We introduce the resonant canonical coordinates by the linear transformation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">σ = ψ + φ p ξ = −φ p and Σ = −X Ξ = −X − Φ p .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Assuming that the system is far from any other resonance, the long-term dynamics at first order to the perturbation is given by averaging the Hamiltonian over all angles but σ. Dropping the constant terms, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F(Σ, σ) = − 1 2 a α Σ 2 + b Σ + c 1 − Σ 2 cos σ ,<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">with a = 1 + 3 2 N j=1 E 2 j b = ν p − 2 M j=1 ν j S 2 j c = −2 ν p S p − ν p S 3 p + 2S p M j=1 ν j S 2 j .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Article number, page 3 of 23 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. secularspin</p><p>As shown in Appendix A, the Hamiltonian has the same form in the case of a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, with though a slightly different expression of the coefficients. This would thus only shift a bit the position of the secular resonances considered here. In this case, the tidal damping (responsible for this capture in spin-orbit resonance) is supposed to act on a much larger timescale than the spin dynamics studied here, such that our approach still holds. Finally, applying the modified time dτ = a α dt to (16), we obtain the following Hamiltonian (that we still denote F):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F(Σ, σ) = − 1 2 Σ 2 + γΣ + β 1 − Σ 2 cos σ ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">γ = b a α and β = c a α .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>The dynamical system with Hamiltonian function <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> is well known. It was thoroughly studied by <ref type="bibr">Henrard &amp; Muri- gande (1987)</ref>, who called it "Colombo's top" in memory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Colombo (1966)</ref>. In the following, we detail its characteristics of interest here, in terms of the two constant parameters γ and β. First of all, it is enough to study the case γ 0 and β 0 since we get the negative cases by the transformations Σ → −Σ and σ → σ + π, respectively. When studying the equilibrium points of the system <ref type="bibr">(Henrard &amp; Murigande 1987, or Appendix B.1 and B.2)</ref>, we find that the phase space can have two different geometries according to the value of γ and β (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> for the phase portraits). The boundary between these two regions of the parameter space is the curve</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C 1 = γ, β 0 : γ 2/3 + β 2/3 = 1 .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Below C 1 (regions A,B,C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>), the dynamical system (18) has four equilibrium points, that we denote (a, b, c, d). The equilibrium points c and d merge along the curve C 1 , and disappear above it (region D of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Their respective positions are</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">       Σ a ∈ [0, +1] , σ a = 0 → elliptic (A,B,C,D) Σ b ∈ [−1, 0] , σ b = π → elliptic (A,B,C,D) Σ c ∈ [0, +1] , σ c = π → hyperbolic (A,B,C) Σ d ∈ [0, +1] , σ d = π → elliptic (A,B,C) .<label>(21)</label></formula><p>The values Σ a,b,c,d have explicit expressions in terms of γ and β, as given in Appendix B.1 (they correspond to the different roots of a quartic equation). Since the resonant angle ψ + φ p is equal to 0 or π for each of these equilibrium points, they all correspond to configurations where the spin axis, the normal to the orbit (reduced to its pth harmonic) and the normal to the reference plane are in the same plane. As such, they are commonly called "Cassini's states" and labelled (1, 2, 3, 4) after Peale (1969), corresponding to the equilibrium points (c, a, b, d).</p><p>We note the limiting cases for β 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">   lim γ→0 Σ a = lim γ→0 Σ c = 0 lim γ→0 Σ d = − lim γ→0 Σ b = 1 − β 2 for β 1 : lim γ→0 Σ a = lim γ→0 Σ b = 0 ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>and for γ 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">   lim β→0 Σ a = lim β→0 Σ c = γ lim β→0 Σ d = − lim β→0 Σ b = 1 for γ 1; lim β→0 Σ a = − lim β→0 Σ b = 1 .<label>(23)</label></formula><p>We are now interested in the width of the resonance, that is the interval of Σ enclosed in the separatrix emerging from the hyperbolic fixed point c and containing the fixed point a. A pendulum approximation can be obtained for small values of β (as used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">or Li &amp; Batygin 2014a</ref>, but this approximation is no longer valid when β grows. Since an analytical expression can be derived even in the general case, we will use it here. The computations <ref type="bibr">(Appendix B.5</ref>) lead to the following extreme values of Σ spanned by the resonance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Σ ± = 2γ − Σ c ± 2 −β 2 + β 1 − Σ 2 c .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>They are defined whenever Σ c itself is defined (regions A,B,C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). At this point, it is important to note that the coordinates (Σ, σ) are singular at Σ = ±1 since the problem actually takes place on the sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Henrard &amp; Murigande 1987)</ref>. We must thus study carefully the meaning of the limits (24) when one of them crosses ±1. This leads to two other limits in the parameter space, as the curves</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">C 2 = γ, β 0 : 8 β 2 = 1 − 20γ − 8γ 2 + (1 + 8γ) 3/2 C 3 = 0 γ 1/8 , β 0 : 8 β 2 = 1 + 20γ − 8γ 2 + (1 − 8γ) 3/2<label>(25)</label></formula><p>(see Appendix B.3-B.4), delimiting the regions A-B and B-C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, respectively. We note that C 1 and C 2 intersect at (γ; β) = (1 ; 0), C 1 and C 3 intersect at (1/8 ; 3 √ 3/8), and C 2 and C 3 intersect at (0 ; 1/2). Contrary to C 1 , the boundaries C 2 and C 3 do not correspond to actual bifurcations of the dynamical system, but only to the limits where the resonant island contains the north pole of the sphere (region B) and both poles of the sphere (region C). Hence, the resonance lies in [Σ − ; Σ + ] in region A; in [Σ − ; +1] in region B; and in <ref type="bibr">[−1; +1]</ref> in region C (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). In region D, there is no more resonance (the separatrix disappears), but the obliquity can still vary substantially. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, the colour shades in region D show the oscillation amplitude of the obliquity as the trajectory passes through Σ = 1.</p><p>When β → 0, the width of the island tends to 0 and all the level curves in the (σ, Σ) plane tend to be horizontal. In this limit, the resonance width is small and almost independent of γ (pendulum approximation). When γ → 0, the phase portrait in the (σ, Σ) plane tends to be symmetric with respect to the line Σ = 0.</p><p>From <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>, we note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">γ = ν p α + O(ε 2 ) and β = −2S p γ + O(ε 2 ) .<label>(26)</label></formula><p>Remembering that S p is the amplitude of a given term in the inclination series (5), this means that the parameter   region above the line β = 2γ in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> (that is, |S p | = 1) cannot be reached in this problem.</p><p>As a simple rule of thumb, one can consider that β controls the resonance width, and that γ controls the location of the resonance centre (see the Hamiltonian at Eq. 18). From Eq. (26), we know that β is proportional to the amplitude S p . Therefore, the resonance widths are larger in hot planetary systems, for which the mutual inclinations are large. This was exploited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boué &amp; Laskar (2010)</ref> in their scenario for tilting the spin-axis of Uranus. On the contrary, the secular system cannot produce any obliquity variation if the mutual inclinations are exactly zero. One must keep in mind that β depends on the precession constant α (Eq. 2) as well, so that "small" mutual inclinations do not guarantee that the resonances are thin. For the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, some values of α produce first-order resonances larger than 70 o , even if the mutual orbital inclinations are modest (see Sect. 2.3).</p><p>Contrary to β, the magnitude of γ cannot be easily traced back from the planetary architecture: the first-order secular spin-orbit resonances of any planet can be located anywhere between 0 o and 180 o of obliquity. The large majority of them actually lie in [0 o ; 90 o ] because most of the frequencies ν p are negative (the explanation for this property is given in Sect. 3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Overlap of first-order resonances</head><p>Going back to the full Hamiltonian (10), the main chaotic regions of the system can be estimated as the overlap of the first-order resonances taken separately (Chirikov's criterion). With the analytical expression of their respective Article number, page 5 of 23 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. secularspin widths given in Sect. 2.2, the computation of the overlapping regions is straightforward for any quasi-periodic representation (5) of the orbital motion.</p><p>When comparing two secular terms, we note that no chaotic zone can form if at least one of them is in region D, because there is no separatrix in D. This is well verified by Poincaré sections. A direct consequence of this property is that if all the terms of the quasi-periodic series are in region D, the secular dynamics of the obliquity cannot be chaotic at first order. Moreover, if all the S i coefficients are small (low inclination regime), so are the corresponding β coefficients, resulting in virtually no secular variation of the obliquity (see the shades of grey in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Actually, a nochaos criterion can be obtained even if the amplitudes S i are not known: we just have to check that γ i ≈ ν i /α &gt; 1 ∀ i = 1...M . On the contrary, if γ i &lt; 1 for at least two i, the existence of a chaotic region is possible, but not guaranteed. These properties will be discussed further in Sect. 3.4.</p><p>This method can be easily checked in the case of the Solar System, since the secular spin dynamics of all planets have been studied in the literature. Moreover, a very accurate quasi-periodic approximation of the orbital dynamics can be obtained, since the properties and initial conditions of the planets are very well known. As an example, the upper row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows the widths and overlaps of first-order resonances for the terrestrial planets (light and dark-red regions). This figure was produced by applying the previous analytical formulas to the orbital series of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Laskar (1990)</ref>, containing more than 50 terms in both eccentricity and inclination (see Appendix F). We note that most of the first-order resonances overlap (there are almost no light-red regions). This results in wide chaotic zones even if the individual amplitudes S i are small. However, the full extent of the chaotic regions given by the frequency analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3</ref>, second and third rows) cannot be retrieved by only considering first-order resonances. The following section is thus dedicated to second and third-order resonances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Higher-order resonances</head><p>Outside of first-order resonances, we can use a canonical change of coordinates close to identity in order to suppress the angular dependency at first order (as already used in a similar context by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Li &amp; Batygin 2014a</ref>).

The only possible resonant angles at second order have the form σ = φ j + φ k + 2ψ. The width of second and higher order resonances is quite small, so that their separatrices can be computed assuming that X is near the exact resonance (pendulum approximation). Accordingly, the centre and half width of the second-order resonances are computed in Appendix C and given in the first line of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Outside of both first-order and second-order resonances, the same method can be used to compute the location and width of third-order resonances. An intermediary Hamiltonian of the form X = εX 1 + ε 2 X 2 is used, in which X 2 must satisfy a second homological equation (see Appendix D). The possible resonant angles, as well as the centre and half width of all the third-order resonances are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. As before, the same method can be used in the case of synchronous rotation, by adding the term −α r (1 + X) 2 /2 to H 0 (Appendix A). This would only slightly shift the resonances.</p><p>With these values, it is straightforward to compute the overlap regions of every possible second and third-order resonances. Resonances of order 2 or 3 with a centre located inside a resonance of lower order are not considered (in other words, low-order resonances are supposed unaffected by higher-order ones). The result is shown in the top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> for the inner Solar System (blue and green zones). We obtain a much better match with the frequency map analysis, showing the importance of high-order resonances in this context. Indeed, numerous frequencies of the quasi-periodic representation are quite close to each other, which implies that the corresponding resonances overlap massively. Hence, even if the second and third-order resonances are thin, most of them are all located one after another, resulting in large chaotic zones. The chaotic diffusion is though slower for higher-order resonances. In the real Solar System, in which the secular orbital frequencies are actually not fixed but vary slowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Laskar 1990</ref>), the diffusion of the obliquity will besides be facilitated by small modulations of the resonances locations.</p><p>We note that third-order resonances include terms mixing both eccentricity and inclination (last line of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The existence of these terms shows that the s 6 + g 5 − g 6 resonance, which is known to play an important role in the future obliquity evolution of the Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Laskar et al. 1993a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Laskar et al. , 2004b</ref>, has two different origins: one is a first-order resonance with ν 23 , and the other is a third-order resonance As a comparison, the system given by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is integrated numerically with the same orbital model (quasi-periodic decomposition of Laskar 1990), and a frequency map analysis is performed to locate the chaotic zones. The colour scale goes from black (no chaos), to red (strong chaos). Third row: Same maps obtained from a more detailed model in which the orbital evolution is directly taken from a numerical integration (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993</ref>). In the weakly chaotic zones, the dots are shifted vertically according to the level of chaos; in the strongly chaotic zones, they are plotted in boldface. Bottom row: Same as top row, but the long-term orbital evolution of each planet is approximated by the Lagrange-Laplace system (Sect. 3.1).

The amplitude of the first resonance, which is the one emphasised in the literature, is larger by a factor thirty. This resonance is present in the synthetic representation used in this paper (see the term with frequency −50.30212 /yr in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables F.1</ref> to F.4). In the top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, it appears as a thin isolated resonance (upper-left corner of the graphs). Finally, since tidal dissipations are much more efficient in decreasing the eccentricity than the inclination, one can imagine a planet with an initially chaotic obliquity wandering in a mixed-type-resonance overlap region, becoming frozen out of resonance when the amplitudes E i decrease due to tidal dissipation. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Laskar et al. 2012</ref>, the eccentricity amplitudes of all the planetary system can be damped even if only one planet dissipates energy with the star. Hence the eccentricity modes of an external planet can be damped even if it is not itself subject to tidal dissipation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Application to exoplanetary systems</head><p>In the previous sections, we saw that in the low-eccentricity and low-inclination regime, the long-term rotational dynamics of planets can be studied very efficiently by a simple analytical model. However, even if numerous exoplanetary systems are known nowadays, most of the information required to characterise the rotation of their planets remains poorly constrained. This information can be split into two groups: i) the orbital dynamics (amplitudes and frequencies of the quasi-periodic representation) and ii) the rotation parameters (α coefficient). In this section, we will see how these quantities can be estimated from physical and dynamical arguments, even with scarce data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Lagrange-Laplace system</head><p>Regarding the long-term orbital dynamics, one can use nominal orbital elements (either best-fit or assumed ones) and integrate numerically the equations of motion.

The differences of oscillation amplitude that they observe are a natural consequence of the initial position of the planet with respect to the resonance centre (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). This shows that the Lagrange-Laplace system, associated with the development of the Hamiltonian (Sect. 2), is enough to obtain the level of detail required for studying the long-term rotation of exoplanets up to moderate eccentricities and inclinations.

From now on, we suppose that only the masses, the semi-major axes and the eccentricities are known for all planets of the system. In this case, the Lagrange-Laplace matrices A and B can still be computed since they only depend on the masses and the semi-major axes. We thus obtain the two sets of frequencies µ j and ν j . Because the initial conditions z i (0) and ζ i (0) appearing in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref> are not fully known, the goal here is to obtain the maximum possible value of the amplitudes E k and S k according to the available data.</p><p>For the eccentricity, it amounts to maximise the modulus of a sum of complex numbers with unknown phase.

The problem is more complex for the inclinations, since both the amplitudes and the phases of the initial conditions ζ i (0) are unknown. It is thus necessary to introduce additional arguments, either from physical or from dynamical grounds. Guided by statistics on the orbital excitation due to close encounters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atobe et al. (2004)</ref>, while dealing mostly with systems with a single observed planet, imposed I = e/2 for each of them. This law is also in agreement with statistical distributions of observed exoplanetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xie et al. 2016</ref>). In our case, though, the application of this statistical result as a strict rule for each planet of a multiplanet system seems a bit simplistic. We will opt here for the hypothesis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Laskar &amp; Petit (2017)</ref> of equipartition of the Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD) among the secular degrees of freedom.

In contrast to these simple and ordered dynamics, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> shows as an illustration the maximised chaotic regions for the GJ 3293 system. The available orbital elements are taken from Astudillo- <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Defru et al. (2017)</ref>, who pointed out that GJ 3293 d is in the habitable zone. In the spin-down process toward synchronous rotation due to tidal dissipative effects from the star (thus decreasing the precession constant), planet d is the most likely to suffer from large obliquity changes. One must remember, though, that the chaotic zones are here maximised according to the available orbital data. We also predict a rich obliquity dynamics for the Trappist-1 planets, but due to the confirmed strong effects of mean-motion resonances (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Quarles et al. 2017)</ref>, the use of the Lagrange-Laplace model is probably inadequate in this case. Building an orbital theory specific to this system would be out the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Maximisation of α</head><p>In Sects. 3.1 and 3.2, we saw how to obtain a quasi-periodic approximation of the long-term orbital motion of a planet, and how to estimate bounds for its coefficients if all the orbital parameters are not known. However, in order to study its long-term spin dynamics, we still lack an estimate of its precession constant α. Even in the Solar System, the precession constants of the planets are not very well known. The estimate of α for an extrasolar planet would require observations that are very hard to obtain (its rotation period and a model of interior), and which would be specific to one exoplanet. In order to keep the study as general as possible, we will not try here to obtain a single value for the precession constant: instead, we will look for an upper bound of it from general physical considerations.</p><p>After the sphere, the simplest shape model for a rotating planet is given by the Maclaurin ellipsoid <ref type="bibr">(Chan- drasekhar 1969)</ref>. It describes the equilibrium shape of a self-gravitating homogeneous body in rotation with constant angular velocity. The rotational symmetry is imposed (circular equator), leading to the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">ω 2 2πGρ = √ 1 − 2 3 (3 − 2 2 ) arcsin − 3 1 − 2 ,<label>(51)</label></formula><p>where ω and ρ are the rotation velocity and the density of the body and is the eccentricity of its ellipsoidal figure (in any plane containing the rotation axis). Studying f = ω 2 /(2πGρ) as a function of the ellipsoid eccentricity, f is zero for = 0 and = 1, and it has one maximum at 0 ≈ 0.929956 with value f 0 ≈ 0.224666. This implies that there is no such equilibrium figure possible for rotation velocities larger than</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">ω max = 2πGρf 0 .<label>(52)</label></formula><p>Converting the ellipsoid eccentricity in terms of momenta of inertia, we obtain the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">2C − A − B 2C = 1 2 2 .<label>(53)</label></formula><p>Injecting it into the expression of the precession constant (2), we obtain the maximum value</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">α max = 3Gm 0 4a 3 2 0 √ 2πGρf 0 .<label>(54)</label></formula><p>For rotation velocities close to ω max , it is known that there exist equilibrium ellipsoidal figures with three unequal axes that have a lower total energy, called Jacobi ellipsoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chandrasekhar 1969</ref>). However, we only need an order of magnitude for α max and the homogeneous approximation is anyway quite crude, allowing us to stick to the expression (54). Planets are expected to spin much more slowly than ω max (Eq. 52), including giant gaseous planets (Batygin 2018). In the remaining part of the article, we allow us to abusively refer to the "rotational breakup" velocity. Using the average density of the Earth, we obtain a minimum rotation period of about 2.4 hours, leading to a maximum precession constant of about 230 /yr. The true value for the Earth is 20 /yr, or 50 /yr if we include the additional effects of the Moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993)</ref>. This remains well below our bound, but the difference with this "effective" precession constant due to the presence of satellites actually constitutes the largest source of uncertainty. Close satellites increase the effective flattening of the planet, whereas far satellites increase the effective torque from the star <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boué &amp; Laskar 2006</ref>). In both cases, this increases the precession constant to be used in our model. This effect is particularly problematic for Saturn, because our upper bound gives α max ≈ 0.75 /yr, while the true value is 0.20 /yr, but it increases to 0.83 /yr if we take the satellites into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ward &amp; Hamilton 2004</ref>). Hence, the introduction of Saturn's satellites makes the precession constant exceed our upper bound. This problem is unavoidable for exoplanets, because the observation of satellite systems is hard and none has been observed so far. When using our model to study the spin dynamics of exoplanets, we must  thus always keep in mind that the presence of numerous or massive satellites could modify our conclusions for borderline cases like Saturn. Moreover, we must assume a density ρ for the exoplanets if their radius has not been measured, which adds even more uncertainty. If the radius is unknown, an order of magnitude of the density can be estimated through an empirical law adjusted to the observed mass-radius distribution (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>). The density is anyway not the major source of uncertainty of our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Classification of non-resonant exoplanets</head><p>In Sect. 2.3, we saw that the overlap of first-order secular resonances, leading to the largest chaotic zones of the spin dynamics, can be produced only if the ratio ν i /α is smaller than 1 at least for two frequencies ν i of the inclination quasi-periodic representation. Assuming that α is bounded by α max , we can deduce that there can be no substantial chaotic zone if ν i /α max &gt; 1 whatever the frequency ν i . Moreover, if the mutual inclinations are small (as we assume they are), this implies that the obliquity is almost constant. Our bound for α (Eq. 54) can thus be used for a preliminary classification of the exoplanets, while the bounds for the amplitudes (Eqs. 38,50) are required for a more specific application to one exoplanet (they allow to constrain both γ and β, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the 94 planets classified strictly nonresonant with this criterion, using the Lagrange-Laplace matrix to estimate the frequencies (Sect. 3.1) and Eq. (54) as a bound of α. All the exoplanets from http://exoplanet.eu with known mass, semi-major axis and eccentricity were analysed (taking m sin I instead of the mass if a real-mass estimate was unavailable). At date 2018-03-07, this represents 143 systems with more than one planet, which contain 353 planets in total (plus the Solar System). For some of them, the frequency ratios are so far from 1 that their classification is quite safe, even when considering the numerous sources of error inherent to our method, and in particular, the possible presence of satellites. This mostly concerns planets that are far from their star, like Uranus and Neptune, and no terrestrial exoplanet has been observed yet is in this category. Such large semimajor axes (third column of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) imply that most of the planets listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> are also unaffected by orbital and rotational tidal dissipation resulting from the interaction with their central star.</p><p>Most of the exoplanetary systems known so far contain only two planets. In this case, there can be no chaotic region anyway coming from the overlap of first-order resonances (Sect. 2.3) because there is only one forced frequency in inclination (Sect. 3.1). However, this single term allows to go one step further and compute the variation range of the obliquity at first order. This is obtained by looking at the interval of parameters γ and β <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref> allowed for the exoplanet. A very simple formula can be derived if the inclination amplitude S 1 (which is the only amplitude of the decomposition) is small. Indeed, this implies that β is small as well (Eq. 26), resulting in quite flat level curves for Colombo's top Hamiltonian (18). The maximum obliquity variations are achieved around Σ = 0, and at leading order,</p><note type="other">Article number, page 12 of 23 M. Saillenfest et al.: Secular spin-axis dynamics of exoplanets they are equal to</note><formula xml:id="formula_51">∆X ≈ 2β γ ≈ 4S 1 .<label>(55)</label></formula><p>This approximation holds very well for small values of S 1 . For the exoplanet WASP-81 c, which has the lowest bound for S 1 in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we obtain a maximum obliquity excursion of 0.5 o . This limit is very close to what is obtained by plotting the level curves of the Hamiltonian <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref>, and it holds as long as α and S 1 are below their estimated bounds. Such a good constraint cannot be achieved for every planet in twoplanet systems, though, since our bound on S 1 from the AMD is sometimes not very informative. It is even dramatic for planets perturbed by a very massive companion: for example the maximum inclination amplitude of HD 92788 c is higher than 1, indicating that all inclinations are possible.</p><p>The maximum excursion of the obliquity is harder to obtain if there are more than two planets in the system, since the dynamics is ruled by the superposition of several forcing terms. However, if the maximum maximised amplitude is small (last column of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), the superposition of all the terms is unlikely to bring the obliquity over the limit given at Eq. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The spin-axis dynamics of a planet plays a major role in its climate setting, and, by extension, in its suitability for life. However, the rotation properties of exoplanets are still very poorly constrained. In this paper, we presented an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis dynamics of a planet, allowing to link known and unknown parameters to its obliquity evolution and to provide a global picture of the dynamics in a straightforward way.</p><p>At first, the orbital solution is modelled by quasiperiodic series. This method is thus valid as long as the orbital chaos, if any, takes place on a much larger timescale than the spin-axis evolution. The spin-axis Hamiltonian is then expanded in powers of the eccentricity and inclination amplitudes of the orbital series. We provided all terms up to order 3 but the development can be conducted to higher orders.</p><p>A clear picture of the phase space structure is given by the obliquity ranges associated to the various resonant regions. The resonant dynamics at order 1 can be characterised analytically in terms of two parameters, which are linked to the precession constant α (gathering the physical characteristics of the planet under study) and to the quasiperiodic representation of the orbit. The pendulum approximation is only used at order 2 and beyond, for which the resonances are thin enough. The regions of resonance overlap at all orders are identified as chaotic. In some cases (as for the terrestrial planets of the Solar System), these chaotic regions allow wide excursions of the obliquity. The method presented here allows to retrieve analytically the previous numerical results with a good precision. Numerical integrations prove thus to be necessary only if detailed statistics on the obliquity evolution are required. This is very informative for Solar System planets (as shown by Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Laskar et al. 2004a)</ref> but not yet for exoplanets because their initial conditions and physical parameters are still poorly known. Hence, the uncertainty of our results remains largely dominated by our lack of knowledge of the exoplanetary systems rather than by the approximations inherent to our method. This allows to stick to the simple analytical formulas presented here.</p><p>At this level of uncertainty, the Lagrange-Laplace system provides a good-enough representation of the orbital motions (excepted for exoplanetary systems featuring highly excited orbits or strong effects of mean-motion resonances). The formulas obtained allow to set an upper bound for the amplitude of the eccentricity and inclination terms if the mutual orientations of the orbits are unknown. On the other hand, the AMD equipartition hypothesis can be used, if required, to place a bound on the inclination from the eccentricity values. Through our analytical model of the spin-axis dynamics, these maximum amplitudes provide the maximum extent of the chaotic zones. For example, a large chaotic region is expected for exoplanet GJ 3293 d for rotational velocities above the synchronous rotation. Systems very affected by mean-motion resonances (like Trappist-1) can still be studied using the method described here, but with the prior construction of a synthetic representation for the orbital motion, written in the form of a quasi-periodic series.</p><p>However, this method does not allow to consider tidal dissipations (playing an important role for exoplanets close to their star), which could be modelled as an adiabatic process acting on a much longer timescale than the obliquity variations (see Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997)</ref>. This amounts to make the precession constant α and/or the amplitudes of the orbital series gradually vary. This method does not include either the effects of libration around spinorbit resonances, even if a trick allows to take into account a possible locking in synchronous rotation (Appendix A).</p><p>Finally, under the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium, we can set a bound to the precession constant α. This bound is obtained from the flattening of the planet corresponding to its rotational breakup velocity. Since α governs the width and location of the resonances, this allows to classify the exoplanets that cannot be subject to first-order secular spin-orbit resonances. Among the sufficiently known systems with more than one planet, we found 94 planets in this category (26% of our sample). If they belong to exoplanetary systems with low mutual inclinations (as it is expected in most cases for orbital stability), this implies that their obliquity is almost constant. This bound for α is though invalidated by the possible presence of massive satellites (as our Moon), but some exoplanets are so far from resonance that their classification is quite safe. This is the case of Uranus and Neptune.</p><p>Considering the high efficiency of the analytical method proposed here, an obliquity stability map could be designed easily in the future for each new exoplanet discovered, and in particular for those classified as "habitable". However, such a stability map should always be computed again if any additional planet is found in the system. Indeed, it would shift the existing frequencies (especially if the new planet is massive), and add one frequency in both the inclination and eccentricity series, multiplying the possibilities of resonance. On the other hand, the total AMD of the system would increase, resulting in wider maximised chaotic zones.</p><p>Article number, page 13 of 23 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. secularspin <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.

In this section, we show that if the librations around the synchronous rotation are much faster than the secular spin-axis dynamics, we can retrieve Colombo's top Hamiltonian (Sect. 2.2), allowing to use the same approach as in the non-resonant case. As before, though, we will not consider the effect of the tidal dissipation on the obliquity. This is thus only valid for systems for which the tidal damping of the obliquity acts on a larger timescale than the spin-axis dynamics. We will use the same method as . Let us write λ the mean longitude of the planet in orbit around the star, and its rotation angle. The mean longitude λ is measured from the equinox at a reference epoch (for instance J2000), whereas the rotation angle is measured from the equinox of the date up to a fixed point of the equator (principal axis A). If we keep the angles of the form − λ during the average over the mean longitude and the fast rotation angles (see Néron <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997)</ref>, the corresponding "semi-averaged" Hamiltonian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">H(L, Λ, Y, ,, M, −ψ, t) = L 2 2C + nΛ − α 2 Y 2 L 1 − e(t) 2 3/2 − α r 2L (L + Y ) 2 cos 2( − λ − ψ) − L 2 − Y 2 A(t) sin ψ + B(t) cos ψ + 2Y C(t) , (A.1)</formula><p>where we neglected terms of order e(B − A)/C.

Top row: Estimate of the chaotic regions of the spin dynamics as the superposition of secular spin-orbit resonances. The orbital evolution of each planet is approximated by the synthetic representation of Laskar (1990), as detailed in Appendix F. Light-red and dark-red regions represent the first-order resonances and their overlaps, respectively (Colombo's top Hamiltonian, Sect. 2.2); light-blue and dark-blue regions represent the second-order resonances and their overlap (Sect. 2.4); and green regions represent the overlap of third-order resonances. The non-overlapping third-order resonances are not indicated because they are very thin and thus unimportant for a global picture of the dynamics. Second row: As a comparison, the system given by Eq. (1) is integrated numerically with the same orbital model (quasi-periodic decomposition of Laskar 1990), and a frequency map analysis is performed to locate the chaotic zones. The colour scale goes from black (no chaos), to red (strong chaos). Third row: Same maps obtained from a more detailed model in which the orbital evolution is directly taken from a numerical integration (adapted from Laskar &amp; Robutel 1993). In the weakly chaotic zones, the dots are shifted vertically according to the level of chaos; in the strongly chaotic zones, they are plotted in boldface. Bottom row: Same as top row, but the long-term orbital evolution of each planet is approximated by the Lagrange-Laplace system (Sect. 3.1). The eight planets of the Solar System are included, with the initial conditions of Bretagnon (1982). Article number, page 7 of 23</figDesc></figure>
