			<abstract>
				<p>We present new observations of a transit of the 111.4-day-period exoplanet HD 80606b. Due to this long orbital period and to the orientation of the eccentric orbit (e = 0.9), the HD 80606b&apos;s transits last for about 12 hours. This makes practically impossible the observation of a full transit from a given ground-based observatory. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope and its IRAC camera on the post-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation of HD 80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 January 2010 as well as off-transit references immediately before and after the event. We complement this photometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously performed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory. This provides radial velocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously uncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this singular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R * = 0.1001 ± 0.0006 that is more accurate but slightly lower than the one measured from previous ground observations in the optical. We found no astrophysical interpretations able to explain such a difference between optical and infrared radii; we rather favor underestimated systematic uncertainties, maybe in the ground-based composite light curve. We detected a feature in the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. We also found a transit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; this could be caused by actual transit timing variations due to an additional body in the system, or again by underestimated systematic uncertainties. The actual angle between the spin-axis of HD 80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to be near 40 • thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly, with a sky-projected value λ = 42 • ± 8 •. This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively rejected. Over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, a few of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two different evolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if they experienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. As in the case of HD 80606, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet are tilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario for massive planets in comparison with Jupiter-mass planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Among the more than 400 extrasolar planets that have been found so far, the giant planet orbiting the G5 star HD 80606 is certainly a unique case. Its eccentricity is particularly high: e = 0.93. Only one known planet possibly has a higher eccentricity, namely HD 20782b; however its high e-value is still to ⋆ Based on observations collected with the SOPHIE spectrograph on the 1.93-m telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France, and with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.</p><p>be confirmed as it stands on one measurement only (O' <ref type="bibr">Toole et al. 2009</ref>). The comet-like orbit of HD 80606b was well established in its discovery paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Naef et al. (2001)</ref> and has been largely confirmed by subsequent observations. Together with its 111.4-day period, the high eccentricity of HD 80606b put it on an extreme orbit: during its revolution, the planet experiences the strongly irradiated regime of a "hot Jupiter" at periastron (0.03 AU), and milder conditions at apoastron (0.87 AU), around which it spends most of its time, and where the planet approaches the inner boundary of the habitable zone (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>As long as the inclination i of the orbit with the line of sight was unknown, those parameters originally implied a probabil- ity of 1% for the planet to be transiting. In spite of this tenuous probability, an amazing chance makes the planet HD 80606b actually transits its parent star, as seen from Earth, each 111.4 days. This is particularly advantageous as numerous crucial studies can be performed using photometry or spectroscopy when a planet passes in front its parent star (planetary transits) or behind it (planetary eclipses), especially in this case where the host star is bright (V = 9.1) and nearby (d = 60 pc). The fortunate transiting nature of HD 80606b was established in February 2009 from the detection of a transit reported from ground observations, independently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> from photometric and spectroscopic data, and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Garcia-Melendo &amp; McCullough (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fossey et al. (2009)</ref> from photometric measurements. Additional observations of transits were later reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hidas et al. (2010)</ref>. The February 2009 observations followed the planetary eclipse discovery reported a few months earlier by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> from Spitzer photometric observations at 8 µm during a 30-hour interval around the periastron. Among the known transiting planets, HD 80606b has the longest period and the most eccentric orbit. The second most extreme transiting planet is HD 17156b (P = 21.2 days and e = 0.67). Furthermore, HD 80606b is also the most distant planet from its parent stars when it transits: 0.3 AU, against 0.05 AU or less for all other known cases <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . In addition to the photometric detection of the HD 80606b's transit, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> presented its spectroscopic detection using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, from radial velocities measured with the SOPHIE spectrograph at Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP), France. The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is an apparent distortion of the stellar lines profile due to the transit of the planet in front of the rotating star. From the SOPHIE measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> have shown the first evidence for a spin-orbit misalignment, i.e. the orbital plane of the planet HD 80606b is not perpendicular to the spin-axis of its host star. Using additional photometric data of the February 2009 event allowing a better constraint on the transit duration together with a combined analysis of the whole data set, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pont et al. (2009)</ref> refined the parameters of the system. They confirmed the spin-orbit misalignment from the Rossiter-McLaughlin distortion detected with SOPHIE and provided a measurement of the sky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis: λ ∼ 50 • , with the confidence interval <ref type="bibr">[14 • − 111 • ]</ref> -see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gillon (2009a)</ref>. Thanks to new photometric and spectroscopic observations of the June 2009 transit, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> See also the 95-day-period transiting exoplanet CoRoT-9b announced after the submission of the present paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deeg et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> thereafter reduced even more the confidence interval to <ref type="bibr">[32 • − 87 • ]</ref>. Thus, the spin-orbit misalignment of the HD 80606 system is now well established. HD 80606 is the component of a wide binary with HD 80607; the projected separation of the system is about 1000 AU. The peculiar orbit of HD 80606b could thus result from Kozai mechanism and tidal dissipation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wu &amp; Murray 2003)</ref>, which can pump the eccentricity and the inclination.</p><p>Due to the long orbital period and to the orientation of the eccentric orbit, the duration of the transit of HD 80606b is about 12-hour long. This should be compared to the transit duration of other known transiting exoplanets, which typically lasts less than five hours. The transit duration of HD 80606b is even longer than transits of Mercury or Venus through the Solar disk as seen from the Earth. It is thus practically impossible that a full transit of HD 80606b matches the duration of an observation night from ground. In addition, data secured before and after the transit are mandatory to obtain an accurate transit light curve, so the full sequence for HD 80606 lasts longer than a night for ground observations. Observing an entire transit of this exoplanet is thereby challenging and only portions of a transit could be observed from a given ground-based telescope. This was the case of all the observation campaigns reported above which covered only fractions of transits. These fragmented observations induce significant uncertainties in the parameters derived from their fit.</p><p>We present here the first full photometric observation of a transit of HD 80606b. We secured it on 13-14 January 2010 with the Spitzer space observatory using the IRAC camera at 4.5 µm in post-cryogenic mission. Thanks to its Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Scoupe et al. 2006</ref>), Spitzer allowed us to continuously observe during 19 hours, enabling the coverage of the whole 12-hour-long transit, as well as off-transit references immediately before and after the event. We complement this photometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously performed with SOPHIE at OHP. This provides radial velocity measurements of the first half of the transit, a part that was up to now uncovered with spectroscopy. Indeed, observing the full 12-hour-long transit is even more difficult in spectroscopy than in photometry, as the amplitude of the Rossiter-McLaughlin for HD 80606 is about 10 m s −1 whereas Northern instruments able to measure radial velocities with the required accuracy are sparse. We also performed a ground-based photometric monitoring of HD 80606 during January 2010. All together, the data of this observational campaign allows the parameters of this planetary system to be additionally refined.</p><p>The observations and data reduction are presented in Sect. 2 and 3 for Spitzer and SOPHIE respectively. The ground-based photometry in presented in Sect. 4. The analyses and the results are presented in Sect. 5, before discussion and conclusion in Sect. 6 and 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Observations</head><p>We obtained Spitzer Director's Discretionary Time (DDT program #540) to observe the January 2010 transit of HD 80606b. This transit was the first observable with Spitzer since the discovery of the transiting nature of HD 80606b in February 2009. As Spitzer has exhausted its cryogen of liquid coolant on 15 May 2009, our observations were performed during the first months of the Spitzer's warm mission. Only the two first infrared channels of the IRAC camera ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fazio et al. 2004</ref>) are available in the post-cryogenic Spitzer. They are centered at 3.6 and 4.5 µm and cannot be observed simultaneously. We chose to observe only in one of the two channels in order to avoid repointing the telescope during the transit. This reduces overheads and ensures that the target remains on the same part of the detector during the full observation sequence. We opted for channel 2 at 4.5 µm since it has the lowest noise properties. This wavelength also has a smaller limb-darkening effect for the star. We did not use pointing dithering, here again to maintain the target as much as possible on the same location on the detector in order to reduce systematic effects due to imperfect flat-field corrections and intra-pixel sensitivity variations.</p><p>We used the Subarray mode of IRAC which is well adapted for bright targets. Only a 32×32-pixel part of the detector is used in this mode; this covers a small 38 × 38 arcsec 2 field of view (pixel size of 1.2 arcsec), compared to the IRAC Stellar mode that uses the full 256 × 256-pixel field. As the stellar companion HD 80607 is located only 17 arcsec to the East of HD 80606, putting the two targets on this small field of view would have imply that their point spread functions (PSF) fall near the edges of the detector. Such configuration is risky for accurate photometry. We preferred to let HD 80607 off the field of view in order to maintain HD 80606 on the detector, far from its edges. So we chose to put our target at the default pointing position in the center of the Subarray field of view. This position is not on nor right next to any known hot pixels.</p><p>The observations were secured between 2010 January 13 at 18 h and January 14 at 13 h (UT). We acquired 2488 consecutive images during a total of 19 hours. Each image was split up into 64 frames of 0.36 second exposure each, taken back-to-back. We obtained a total of 159232 frames during 15.9-hours effective integration time with an overhead of 2-second between each images (15 % overheads in total). Such high efficiency is reached thanks to the use of the Subarray mode and could not be achieved in Stellar mode for bright targets requiring short exposure times. With a flux density of ∼ 200 mJy at 4.5 µm for HD 80606, frame exposure time of 0.36 sec clearly avoids saturation of the pixels. The intensities recorded in the brightest central pixel are around 10 000 electrons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data reduction</head><p>We used the BCD files (Basic Calibrated Data) of each of the 159232 frames as they are produced by the Spitzer/IRAC pipeline. It includes corrections for dark current, flat fielding, pixels non-linearity, and conversion to flux units. To extract the light curve, we used tools and methods we developed in <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009, 2010)</ref>. We find the center of the PSF of the star to a precision of 0.01 pixel using the DAOPHOT-type Photometry Procedures, GCNTRD, from the IDL Astronomy Library 2 , which computes the stellar centroid by Gaussian fitting. We used the APER routine to extract the raw flux of HD 80606 on each frame from the computation of a simple aperture photometry using a radius of 4.0 pixels, which optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the transit light curve. The flux integrated on these 50 pixels is ∼ 52 500 electrons. It has been corrected from the background level of 14.40 ± 0.05 electrons/pixel that has been estimated from a sky annulus with radii of 9 to 12 pixels. The centroid of HD 80607 is located outside the field of view but a small contribution of its flux is detected on an edge of the detector. When estimating the background level, we took care to use only pixels where the HD 80607's flux is negligible. It is also negligible by comparison to the background level in the 4-pixel radius we used for the HD 80606 photometry. Finally, the uncertainty in the background level is negligible for all the results presented in this paper.</p><p>The Spitzer/IRAC photometry is known to be systematically affected by the so-called pixel-phase effect. This effect produces an oscillation of the measured raw light curve due to the Spitzer telescope jitter and the intra-pixel sensitivity variations on the IRAC detector (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Charbonneau et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Reach et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Morales-Calderón et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Ehrenreich et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Désert et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, 2010</ref>. Measurements of the centroid position of the target on the detector and its variations could be used to de-correlate the pixel-phase effect on the light curve. We use here the method presented in <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref>; it has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F corr = F[1 + K 1 (x − x 0 ) + K 2 (x − x 0 ) 2 + K 3 (y − y 0 ) + K 4 (y − y 0 ) 2 + K 5 (x − x 0 )(y − y 0 )]</formula><p>, where F and F corr are the fluxes of the star before and after the pixel-phase effect correction, and (x − x 0 ) and (y − y 0 ) are the position in pixel of the source centroid on the detector with respect to the pixel pointing position, located on [x 0 , y 0 ]. Our determination of the centroid position shows a ±0.05-pixel oscillation with a period of ∼ 70 minutes and a linear drift during the 19-hour sequence of 0.1 and 0.2 pixel in the x-and y-direction, respectively. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Spitzer photometry of HD 80606. From top to bottom, the three panels show respectively the raw photometry, the photometry after correction of the pixel-phase and ramp effects, and the residuals. The black points are the measurements (binned per 5) and the red solid lines are the fits. The vertical dotted lines show the mid-transit, the vertical dot-dashed lines show the first and fourth contacts, and the vertical dot-dot-dashed lines show the second and third contacts.</p><p>In addition to the 64 frames of the image # 873 that are corrupted, we iteratively selected and trimmed 1037 outliers by comparison to the fit of the light curve with a transit model. Frames were considered as outliers when they were above 10 to 3 σ, this value being reduced by 0.1-σ steps at each iterations. We binned the obtained transit light curve by a factor of five in order to obtain a better computing efficiency without losing information for the pixel phase effect. Most of the results presented below were obtained using the binned transit light curve.</p><p>We tested several radii for the aperture photometry, several areas for the background measurement, several procedures for the centroid determination and the outliers rejections. The adopted procedure reported above is the one producing the smallest errors, but all of them produced similar results.</p><p>The upper panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows the raw Spitzer light curve of HD 80606 after this extraction. It clearly shows flux variations with a period of ∼ 70 minutes that are due to the pixelphase effect and telescope jitter at this period. Its peak-to-peak amplitude represents ∼ 1 % of the flux, which is larger than the effect seen in the channel 2 of IRAC during the cryogenic Spitzer. Additional variations at higher frequency and with a lower amplitude than the one of the 70-minute oscillation are seen as well, as we fit each individual frame. They could be due to short-term jitter of the satellite which apparently are not periodic. Filtering these high-frequency variations does not significantly change our results. Finally, a slope in the out-of-transit baseline is also seen. Such detector ramp was observed in channels 3 and 4 in pre-cryogenic Spitzer but was not as significant in channel 2 at that time (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deming et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Knutson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Désert et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, 2010</ref>. We discarded the first thousands of frames that were the most affected by the ramp effect (we tested several limits; see Sect. 5.1.4) then normalized the light-curve using a time-dependent function with the form F baseline = A 0 + A 1 × t where F baseline is the target flux out of transit and t is the time. We also tried higher-degree polynomials and logarithmic baselines; this did not improve significantly the fit. The linear correction we adopted is not perfect; remaining uncertainties in the actual shape of the baseline introduces errors in the system parameters derived from the fit (see Sect. 5.1.4). The baseline and pixel-phase-effect parameters are fitted simultaneously with the transit-related parameters (see Sec. 5.1.3); this allows these effects and their uncertainties to be taken into account in the transit parameters determination. The middle panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows the light curve after removal of these instrumental effects and the lower panel shows the residuals to the fit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Observations</head><p>The first half of the January 2010 transit of HD 80606b was visible from Europe so we managed to observe it with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope of HauteProvence Observatory in South of France. SOPHIE is a crossdispersed, environmentally stabilized echelle spectrograph dedicated to high-precision radial velocity measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Perruchot et al. 2008</ref>). Since the discovery of the transit in February 2009, this was the first time that this part of the transit was observable from an observatory with highprecision spectroscopic capabilities. Unfortunately, the 1.93-m telescope started a technical break for maintenance and upgrades in November 2009 that was extended up to February 2010. Due to the importance of this event, some observations could nevertheless be performed thanks to the support of the OHP staff, wich was mandatory due to the ongoing works on the telescope.</p><p>The observations were secured as part of the second subprogram of the SOPHIE Consortium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouchy et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Bouchy et al. , Hébrard et al. 2010b</ref>). The night of the transit, 13 January 2010, observations could start just before 23h (UT) after technical issues were solved and clouds disappeared, and had to be stopped 4.5 hours later due to cloudy weather. A 5.5-hour sequence of good SOPHIE reference observations of HD 80606 could also be performed the 15 January 2010 night. 24 and 33 exposures were secured during the two nights respectively. The exposure times ranged between 5 and 20 minutes, with typical values around 9 minutes; we tuned it in order to maintain a constant signalto-noise ratio per pixel of ∼ 58 at 550 nm despite the weather changes (seeing and absorption).</p><p>The measurements were performed with the same setup as the one we used for our observation of the February 2009 transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. 2009</ref>). We used the fast-read-out-time mode of the CCD detector in order to minimize overheads. Observations were secured in high-resolution mode allowing the resolving power λ/∆λ = 75000 to be reached. The first optical-fiber aperture was put on the target and the second one on the sky; it allows us to check that no diffuse light was polluting the HD 80606 spectra in these Moonless nights. Wavelength calibrations with a thorium lamp were performed with a ∼ 2-hour frequency each night, allowing the interpolation of the spectral drift of SOPHIE for the time of each exposure. A few exposures were performed with simultaneous thorium-lamp light in the second aperture to allow for simultaneous wavelength calibration; those extra-calibration did not improve significantly the radial velocity accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data reduction</head><p>We used the SOPHIE pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouchy et al. 2009</ref>) to extract the spectra from the detector images, to cross-correlate them with a G2-type numerical mask, then to fit the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) by Gaussians to get the radial velocities ( <ref type="bibr">Baranne et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Pepe et al. 2002</ref>. Each spectrum produces a clear CCF, with a 7.82 ± 0.03 km s −1 full width at half maximum and a contrast representing 48.8 ± 0.4 % of the continuum. The accuracy of the measured radial velocities is typically around 4 m s −1 . This includes photon noise (typically ∼ 2 m s −1 ), wavelength calibration (∼ 2 m s −1 ), and guiding errors (∼ 3 m s −1 ) that produce motions of the input image within the fiber ( ). We also re-reduced the SOPHIE observations presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> in order to have a uniform data set reduced with the same version of the pipeline. There was no significant change by comparison with the data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref>, except for one of the reference exposures performed out of the transit for which the correction due to the Moon pollution was significantly improved. SOPHIE measurements of HD 80606 performed in February 2009 and January 2010 have the same properties, except the better signal-to-noise ratios for shorter exposure times obtained in 2010, which is largely due to the primary mirror of the telescope that was realuminized in October 2009.</p><p>The SOPHIE radial velocities of HD 80606 are plotted in Figs. 3 and 7 together with other data sets.</p><p>In the SOPHIE spectra, the cores of the large Ca ii H &amp; K absorption lines of HD 80606 at 3934.8 Å and 3969.6 Å show no chromospheric emissions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Ground-based photometry</head><p>In order to study its intrinsic variability, HD 80606 was also observed several nights before and after the January 2010 transit. Observations during the night of the transit were prevented by bad weather conditions in the observing site, located in Portalegre, Portugal. We gathered a total of nearly 23 hours of observations in 10 nights spread from December 3, 2009 to January 25, 2010. The equipment used is a 12-inch f /5.5 MEADE LX200 telescope, and a SBIG ST8XME 9-micronpixel CCD camera. The field is 28 × 18.7 arcmin 2 and the pixel scale is ∼ 1.1 arcsec/pixel. Observations were taken through a Bessell I filter, using integration times between 40 and 90 seconds.</p><p>The frames were reduced using standard IRAF routines and aperture photometry was obtained for HD 80606, its companion HD 80607 and two additional reference stars located in the same field, located about 7 and 11.5 arcmin away from HD 80606. The size of the photometric aperture was varied on each night, depending on seeing conditions, in order to obtain the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>In every night, the flux ratio between HD 80606 and HD 80607 exhibits a smaller dispersion than the ratio of HD 80606 with any of the other two reference stars, or a combination of HD 80607 and the additional reference stars. Furthermore, the light curves obtained for HD 80607 -using the reference stars -also exhibit a larger dispersion than the flux ratio between HD 80606 and HD 80607. Therefore, the limits to the intrinsic variability of HD 80606 were set using only HD 80607 as reference star.</p><p>The root mean square for the different nights range from about 2.2 to 4.8 mmag, depending mainly on the weather conditions. During each night, no effect was seen due to variation of the sky level, or the position of the stars on the chip or the airmass. On the other hand, the nightly mean of our observations exhibits a dispersion of about 1.7 mmag around its mean value.</p><p>Similar photometric observations of HD 80606 were conducted the weeks around the January 2010 transit with the CCD camera at the 120-cm telescope of Haute-Provence Observatory, using the setup used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref>. The filter used was r Gunn with a neutral density and we did not defocus. Photometric observations started on 6 January and ended on 23 January, with a total of eight sequences ranging from 30 to 120 minutes per night; in total, 187 images have been acquired and analyzed. Exposure times of 10 to 120 seconds have been used to account for varying transparency. An observation of the transit during the January-13 night could be performed with this instrument, on a coverage similar to this of the SOPHIE observations reported in Sect. 3. This ground-based photometry of a part of the transit will be studied in a forthcoming paper.</p><p>The flux has been extracted from aperture photometry using the GCNTRD and APER procedures (Sect. 2.2) on a 8-pixel radius (0.69 arcsec/pixel). The background has been estimated from a sky annulus with radii of 10 to 12 pixels. The root mean square of flux variations ranges from 1.0 to 3.1 mmag per night, and the residual fluctuation has a standard deviation of 3.2 mmag when the transit night is excluded. This is significantly larger than what was observed in Portalegre, which may indicate a real tendency of rotational modulation, or a significant level of systematics. No attempt was done to correct for the long-term behavior in the data, which appears to be compatible with the expected rotational period of the star (as discussed in Sect. 6.5).</p><p>We conclude therefore that HD 80606 is photometrically stable at the level of a few mmag in the optical range, in the timescale of several weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Analysis</head><p>We fitted this whole data set in order to refine the system parameters. As a full transit was observed with Spitzer, possible systematic effects due to the combination of transit portions secured with different ground-based instruments are expected to be reduced here. In addition, together with the new radial velocities secured at phases previously uncovered, the constraints on the spin-orbit angle would be better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Combined fit</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Method</head><p>We first performed a combined fit of our Spitzer photometry of the January-2010 transit together with the available radial velocities of HD 80606. We also included in this combined fit the timing constraint on the eclipse as measured from previous Spitzer measurements by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> and re-analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gillon (2009a)</ref>. As those data are not accurate enough to allow the ingress and egress of the eclipse to be significantly measured, we used the estimated epochs of the mid-time of these two events: HJD = 2 454 424.700 ± 0.005 and 2 454 424.775 ± 0.005.</p><p>We did not include in this combined fit the radial velocity measurements secured during and near the transits. Indeed, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations do constrain the projected stellar rotational velocity V sin I * and the sky-projected angle λ between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis, but they do not constrain significantly the parameters that we measure here in the combined fit. The analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin data is presented below in Sect. 5.2 and takes into account the results of the combined fit presented here in Sect. 5.1. Thus, the combined fit uses the radial velocities secured with the instruments ELODIE at OHP ( ), HRS at HET ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wittenmyer et al. 2009)</ref>, and HIRES at Keck ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. 2009a</ref>). This covers a 9.5-year span. The SOPHIE data are used only for the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit. We note that the ELODIE and SOPHIE radial velocities are absolute heliocentric whereas those from HIRES and HRS are relative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Transit light curve of planets on eccentric orbit</head><p>To calculate the transit light curve using a given set of orbital parameters (period, orbital inclination, semi major axis in unit of stellar radii, eccentricity and longitude of periastron), we calculated the sky projected distance between the planets and the stars center in unit of stellar radius; this last result is then directly input to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> algorithm with limb darkening coefficients. From a theoretical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kurucz 1979)</ref>, the three non-linear limb-darkening coefficients at 4.5 µm as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sing (2010)</ref> has been derived with T eff = 5500 K and log g = 4.5: c 2 = 0.89502981, c 3 = −1.1230710 and c 4 = 0.46541027. The limb darkening is low at this wavelength; <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref> have shown that the uncertainties in the coefficients have no significant effects on the parameters derived from the transit light curve.</p><p>It is worth to note that the speed of the light in the system has to be taken into account when comparing the times of the transit, the eclipse and the periastron. The transit takes place when the planet is at ∼ 0.29 AU from the star (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>); this implies an apparent advance of about 2.5 minutes for the transit. Similarly, the planet is at ∼ 0.03 AU from the star at the eclipse, which implies a delay of 15 seconds. Also because of the planetobserver distance decreases during the transit, the speed of light correction makes the transit appears to last 8 seconds less than its really does. In all the procedure, we implement this speed of light correction. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Plot of the orbital velocity of the planet and orbit direction during the transit. α being the angle between the direction of the planet motion and the line of sight, sin α is the fraction of the planet motion projected onto the sky (upper panel). Although the planet velocity significantly decreases during the transit (middle panel), the change of the orbital direction has the opposite effect such that the planet velocity on the sky is nearly constant (bottom panel). Even more, the planet velocity on the sky is nearly symmetrical around the center of the transit, reinforcing the apparent symmetry of the transit light curve. On the three panels, the vertical dotted lines show the mid-transit, the vertical dot-dashed lines show the first and fourth contacts, and the vertical dot-dotdashed lines show the second and third contacts. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows these parameters drawn on a sketch.</p><p>The orbit of HD 80606b is highly eccentric, and the transit takes place ∼5.7 days after the periastron when the planet is rapidly moving away from the star. During the transit, the starplanet distance increases by about 5.8 % between the first and the fourth contact, and the orbital velocity decreases by about 4.1 % <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. With that in mind, a priori, this would suggest that the transit light curve could be highly asymmetrical with, for instance, an egress lasting longer than the ingress. However, during the transit, the direction of the planet motion also varies by about the same amount (upper panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>. If we define α as the angle between the direction of the planet motion and the line of sight, sin α is the fraction of the planet motion projected onto the sky (see insert in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Between the first contact and the last contact, sin α increases by about 4.3 %, exactly compensating for the decrease of the orbital velocity. As a result, the planet velocity on the sky is nearly constant. In addition to the low variation of the apparent planet velocity on the sky during the transit, it appears that the time variation of this velocity is nearly symmetrical around the center of the transit (bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>. Consequently, the apparent velocity during the egress is extremely close to the velocity during the ingress, the later being only 0.004 % smaller than the former. This reinforces the apparent symmetry of the transit light curve. With the parameters of the best fit, the ingress duration (time between first and second contact) is predicted to last only half a second more than the egress duration (time between third and fourth contact) while both lasts about 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p><p>This surprising symmetry for the transit light curve of a planet on a highly eccentric orbit can be explained by considering the projection on the sky of the gravitational force from the star to the planet. Because the transited star is the same as the attracting star, during the transit the component of the gravitational force projected on the sky is close to zero. As a consequence, the apparent velocity of the planet projected on the sky is nearly constant. Even more, for various positions of the planet, the projected force is also symmetrical around the star center, explaining the symmetry of the time variation of the projected velocity around the center of the transit. As a conclusion, in contrary to the common-sense idea, in any configuration the transit of a planet in front of its parent star is expected to be highly symmetric, even for extremely eccentric orbits (see also Winn 2010a). Our Spitzer observations confirm this result in the case of the highly eccentric HD 80606b's orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3.">Free parameters</head><p>Our combined fit of the radial velocities, the Spitzer transit light curve and the eclipse timing includes 19 free parameters. We list them below, classified in four categories depending on their nature and the data set that constrain them:</p><p>1. two free parameters constrained by photometry only:</p><p>-R p /R * , the ratio of the planetary and stellar radii; -a/R * , the semimajor axis in units of stellar radius; 2. six free parameters constrained both by radial velocities and photometry: -a cos i/R * , the "standard" impact parameter, which is different (for an eccentric orbit) of the actual impact parameter b = d t cos i/R * , where d t is the star-planet distance at mid-transit and i is the inclination of the orbit; -P, the orbital period of the planet, which is proportional to (a/R * ) 3 , and to the inverse of the stellar density ρ * from the Kepler third law; -T 0 , the epoch of the periastron of the planet; -e cos ω and e sin ω, that constrain the two correlated parameters e (the eccentricity of the planetary orbit) and ω (the longitude of its periastron); -K √ 1 − e 2 , that depends both on the eccentricity e and on the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity variations -K actually is constrained by radial velocities only, and is proportional to M p and (M * ) 2/3 , M p and M * being the planetary and stellar masses; 3. four free parameters constrained by radial velocities only:</p><p>-V n=1→4 , the center-of-mass radial velocities for each of the four radial velocity data set used, namely ELODIE -the two parameters A j=1→2 for the baseline; -the five parameters K i=1→5 for the pixel-phase effect.</p><p>The direct, absolute measurements of M * and R * , and consequently those of M p and R p , are not feasible from this fit; none of those four parameters is measurable independently of the other ones from our data set. One exception could be the stellar mass that could be directly determined through the semi-major axis a thanks the third Kepler law. Indeed, by measuring the delay of the eclipse mid-time and the advance of the transit's one that are due to the time the light takes to propagate through the HD 80606 system (∼ 2.5 minutes difference between those two events by comparison to the ephemeris, see Sect. 5.1.2), the semi-major axis could theoretically be directly measured in Astronomical Units. The uncertainties in the transit and eclipse measured midtimes are however of the order of 1.5 and 4 minutes respectively, which implies an accuracy on a of the order of 0.5 AU with this approach; this is not constraining here. Stellar evolution models remain thus mandatory to estimate M * . <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> used isochrones to get M * = 0.98 ± 0.07 M ⊙ from T eff = 5574 ± 50 K, log g = 4.45 ± 0.05 and [Fe/H] = 0.43 dex. Such accuracy is typical for stellar evolution models, from which it is difficult to predict stellar masses at better than ±10 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fernandes &amp; Santos 2004</ref>). Using additional constraints from the transit light curve, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pont et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> estimated the stellar mass of HD 80606 to 0.97 ± 0.04 and 1.05 ± 0.032 M ⊙ , respectively. The 2-σ disagreement between the two estimates shows that we probably reach here the limit of the accuracy that is now achievable. In the following, we adopt the conservative interval M * = 1.01 ± 0.05 M ⊙ that takes into account those two studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4.">Best parameters and error bars</head><p>We used the Prayer Bead method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Moutou et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Gillon et al. 2007</ref>) as applied by <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2009)</ref> to compute the mean values of the free parameters and their statistic and systematic uncertainties (see examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5)</ref>, together with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to provide the best fit at each iteration of our procedure. This method was applied to the Spitzer photometry in order to account for possible correlated noise in the error budget. We simultaneously applied a bootstrap procedure to the radial velocity measurements, after having quadratically added a systematic uncertainty to the radial velocity data sets in order to put to unity their corresponding reduced χ 2 . Thus we quadratically added 12 m s −1 to the ELODIE uncertainties, and 5.0 and 1.7 m s −1 to the HIRES uncertainties (pre-and postupgrade, respectively). In total, 15000 shifts and fits of transit light curves and bootstraps of radial velocity errors were produced to derive the set of parameters and to extract their means and their corresponding standard deviations. In addition, we performed additional fits with the light curve considering data starting at ten different epochs before the ingress; by performing a prayer bead on 1500 shifts for each of those ten fits, we could estimate the errors caused by the uncertainty in the shape of the out-of-transit baseline (see Sect. 2.2).</p><p>The averaged values we obtained for the seven fitted parameters linked to the Spitzer light curve extraction (Sect. 2.2) are: A 1 = 58818 and A 2 = 6.860 for the baseline, and K 1 = 0.2142, K 2 = 0.1538, K 3 = 0.1083, K 4 = 0.0729, and K 5 = 0.0050 for the pixel-phase effect. However, those parameters could be different at different epochs and for different pixel locations, so this is not clear whether the A j and K i values we derived here could be applied to other IRAC observations with Warm-Spitzer.</p><p>The best solution of the combined fit is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, with a ramp cut up to HJD = −2 455 210.325, i.e. the first 1.8 hour of the observation was discarded, corresponding to the first 15000 over the 159232 unbined frames. The upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows the radial velocities and the lower panel shows the Spitzer photometry binned per 250 pixels (the middle panel shows the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit that is discussed below in Sect. 5.2).</p><p>The derived parameters are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> together with their error bars; they are ranked as a function of the way they are derived. First are reported the free parameters of the combined fit that are listed in Sect. 5.1.3 and which are constrained by photometry only, then those that are constrained both by radial velocities and photometry, and then those constrained by radial velocities only. In this last category, the dispersion around the obtained radial velocity shifts are also reported. Twelve adjusted parameters of the combined fit are reported here. Then  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the parameters that are directly derived from the above free parameters of the fit, without any additional hypothesis. This includes the transit and eclipse timings, the latest being obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gillon (2009a)</ref>. The following parameters are those that are derived by assuming the stellar mass M * = 1.01 ± 0.05 M ⊙ (Sect. 5.1.3) together with the parameters derived above and through the Kepler third law. The last parameter set in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> are those relative to the RossiterMcLaughlin fit that are obtained below in Sect. 5.2.</p><p>The dispersion of the Spitzer photometry around the transit light curve fit represents 5.3 × 10 −3 of the stellar flux for unbinned frames. This is the expected level of the photon noise. The amplitude of the correlated noise, as seen for different binsizes of the light curve, is of the order of 1.4 × 10 −4 of the stellar flux <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref>. A bump in the light curve with an amplitude of ∼ 1 mmag is seen just before the transit mid-time (see Sect.6.1).</p><p>It could be instrumental or due to a spot (see Sect. 6.1).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Rossiter-McLaughlin fit</head><p>The radial velocity measurements secured during transits have been fitted in order to measure the sky-projected angle λ between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis. The data we use are the SOPHIE observations of the February-2009 transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. 2009</ref>) and the new ones we secured in January 2010 (Sect. 3). We also used the HIRES data of the June-2009 transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. 2009a</ref>).</p><p>We first measured the radial velocity shift of each data set by comparison to the center-of-mass radial velocity references computed in Sect. 5.1. Radial velocity measurements performed near but off the transit are mandatory to constrain those shifts. A lack of such reference observations could prohibit an accurate measurement of the spin-orbit angle. For example in the case of the recent Rossiter-McLaughlin observation of the planetary system Kepler-8 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jenkins et al. 2010)</ref>, the paucity of off-transit observations makes difficult to conclude if the apparent asymmetry of the Rossiter-McLaughlin shape by comparison to the Keplerian curve is due to an actual spin-orbit misalignment or to a shift due to another cause, as stellar activity and/or instrumental drifts.</p><p>In the case of HD 80606, we used as reference for the February-2009 data the nine SOPHIE measurements performed the nights before and after the transit night, as well as the nine ones performed after the fourth contact the night of the transit. For the 2010 SOPHIE data we used the 33 exposures obtained the January-15 night, i.e. two days after the transit. Finally, for the HIRES data we used the six June-2009 measurements secured before and after the night of the transit (the June-2009 data were excluded from the HIRES post-upgrade data set used in Sect. 5.1 for the fit of the orbit). The radial velocity shift for the three data sets are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We found a shift of 14.4 ± 1.9 m s −1 between the 2009 and 2010 SOPHIE data sets,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. 2009a</ref>), and the lower panel shows the SOPHIE observations around the 13-14 January 2010 transit (Sect. 3). On each of these three panels the data are plotted together with the 1-σ error bars. The fits with and without transit are the solid and dashed lines, respectively. The left panels show the data during the nights of the transits, and the right panels show all the data secured the nights before and after the transits to allow the measurement of the radial velocity shift of each data set. The O-C residuals of the fit including the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly are also plotted. Moreover on all panels, the vertical dotted lines show the mid-transit, the vertical dot-dashed lines show the first and fourth contacts, and the vertical dot-dot-dashed lines show the second and third contacts. and a shift of 3.2 ± 1.3 m s −1 between the HIRES measured in June 2009 and the other post-upgrade HIRES data secured more than one year earlier. These shifts could result from a combination of instrumental effects, unknown component in the system and/or activity-induced jitter.</p><p>The reference observations secured near each of the three transits are plotted in the right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>. Using these offtransit radial velocities, we also computed the uncertainties we had to add to the radial velocities tabulated error bars in order to put to unity the reduced χ 2 corresponding to the Keplerian fit. We thus quadratically added 1.0 m s −1 and 2.5 m s −1 to the SOPHIE measurements secured in 2009 and 2010 respectively, and 1.7 m s −1 to the HIRES measurements (in agreement with the other HIRES post-upgrade data used above, see Sect. 5.1.4).</p><p>We model the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly shape using the analytical approach developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref>. The complete model has 14 parameters: the stellar limb-darkening linear coefficient ǫ, the transit parameters R p /R * , a/R * and i, the orbital parameters (P, T 0 , e, ω, K), the three radial velocity shifts measured above, and finally V sin I * and λ. We computed ǫ = 0.722 in the wavelength range 5300−6300 Å using the same method as in Sect. 5.1.2. The transit and orbital parameters are fixed from the results obtained in Sect. 5.1; their uncertainties are negligible by comparison to those of the two main free parameters of the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit: λ, which is constrained by the asymmetry of the anomaly, and V sin I * , which is constrained by its amplitude. The best fit is plotted in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>. It is obtained for λ = 42 • and V sin I * = 1.7 km s −1 ; its χ 2 is 117.8 for 117 degrees of freedom. The confidence interval contours estimated from χ 2 variations ( <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. 2002)</ref> for the two correlated λ and V sin I * parameters are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref>. The uncertainties obtained this way are ±6 • and ±0.2 km s −1 , respectively. We increased them in order to take into account for the uncertainties in the radial velocity shifts of the three data sets with respect to the Keplerian curve computed in Sect. 5.1. Our final values are λ = 42 • ± 8 • and V sin I * = 1.7 ± 0.3 km s −1 . We checked that the uncertainties on the parameters derived in Sect. 5.1 and used here in the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit imply negligible uncertainties on λ and V sin I * ; similarly, the uncertainty in the ǫ limb-darkening coefficient is negligible.</p><p>The adopted values are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, together with the dispersion of the radial velocities performed during the transit with respect to the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit. The dispersion is in the range 4 − 5 m s −1 for SOPHIE data; we have a similar dispersion around the Keplerian curve for the SOPHIE reference measurements performed before and after the transit. For the HIRES data, the dispersion around the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit is 0.8 m s −1 , whereas it is two times larger (1.7 m s −1 ) for the June-2009 HIRES measurements performed before and after the transit. So it could remain a slight systematic in the HIRES radial velocities secured during the transit. However this effect is small, and is detected here due to the particularly high accuracy of these measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Warm-Spitzer transit light curve</head><p>This planetary transit observations is among the first ones secured with Spitzer in its post-cryogenic mission. This shows that accurate transit light curves can be obtained in this second part of the observatory mission despite enhanced ramp and pixelphase effects. Our Warm-Spitzer transit light curve of HD 80606 has lower uncertainties than those obtained from the ground. The typical durations of the pixel-phase effect (70 minutes) and the planetary transit (12 hours) are on time-scales different enough to avoid significant uncertainties on the derived system parameters due to this instrumental effect. The transit light curve is well detected, without extra signatures of transiting rings or satellites. According to our accuracy, the signature of an hypothetic satellite would have been detected up to a magnitude depth slightly below 1 mmag; this corresponds to an upper limit of 2 R ⊕ on the radius.</p><p>A bump in the light curve is seen just before the transit midtime with an amplitude of ∼ 1 mmag. It could corresponds to the planet occulting a dark spot during the transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pont et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Rabus et al. 2009</ref>). HD 80606 is not an active star, so the probability of such event is low. The stability at the level of a few mmag of the stellar flux observed in the optical (Sect. 4) would correspond to a stability below 1 mmag at 4.5 µm, assuming dark spots are 1000-K cooler than the stellar surface <ref type="bibr">(Désert et al. 2010)</ref>; so the optical photometry cannot exclude that the feature detected in the Spitzer light curve is due to a spot. One can note that at the time of this feature (near 137 hours after the periastron in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>), a simultaneous feature is also seen in the SOPHIE radial velocity data. This could argue in favor of the interpretation of this event in term of phenomenon at the surface of HD 80606. This seems however unlikely, since a photometric feature with this low flux amplitude should a priori not produce such high radial velocity effect. The radial velocity feature is more likely an instrumental systematic. The feature in the Spitzer light curve is detected at a maximal value of the pixelphase effect <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> so we should remain cautious about instrumental effects. We monitored the coordinates of the target on the subarray through the observation in order to test if the bump corresponds to a particular area of the detector. This is not the case: at the epoch of the bump, the target is located on a position of the detector where the target passes numerous times before and after this event, and where the pixel-phase effect apparently is well corrected by our procedure. So we found no strong reasons to particularly favor an instrumental effect to explain the presence of this feature in the Spitzer light curve. The most likely explanation is the presence of a small star spot on the surface HD 80606, above which the planet is transiting.</p><p>Our data set results from the first joined campaign during which space-based photometry and high-precision radial velocities were carried out simultaneously. If large stellar spots are detected during a similar campaign, this would help to better understand the effect of stellar activity on radial velocity measurements. Stellar jitter indeed introduces noise in measured radial velocities and is a significant limitation in high-precision velocimetry (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Saar &amp; Donahue 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Santos et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hébrard et al. 2009a</ref>. No stellar spots large enough to be spectroscopically detected were apparently seen here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Comparison with previous measurements</head><p>The HD 80606's system parameters that we report in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> have better accuracy by comparison with previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Pont et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Gillon 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Winn et al. 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Hidas et al. 2010</ref>). With respect to the ground observation of nearly all the transit phases used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>, the uncertainties presented here are better by factors two to five. Exceptions are the parameters e, ω and K for which the error bars are not significantly reduced. This is due to the fact that most of the constraints on these three parameters come from the radial velocity on a 9.5-year time span and already used by previous studies.</p><p>For most of the parameters, the revised, more accurate values are in agreement within 1 σ with those previously published. There is a 2 − σ disagreement on the inclination i of the orbit, which is found in our study to be slightly lower; this implies a more grazing transit, a larger impact parameter b, and a slightly longer duration for ingress and egress (∼ 10 minutes longer). The a/R * -ratio is also found to be 5 % smaller, a shift by 2 σ according the error bars from <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>.</p><p>The projected stellar rotational velocity we found, V sin I * = 1.7 ± 0.3 km s −1 , is slightly larger than the value obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> from the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit of their HIRES data: V sin I * = 1.12 +0.44 −0.22 km s −1 . Whereas we also used their HIRES in our analysis, our different result is explained by the fact that we use additional SOPHIE data and we measured a smaller R p /R * ratio (see Sect. 6.3). In addition, a difference with the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> is the shift of 3.2 ± 1.3 m s −1 that we found between the HIRES data secured near the transit and the other ones (Sect. 5.2); this implies a slightly larger amplitude for the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly, thus a larger V sin I * . The value V sin I * = 1.7 ± 0.3 km s −1 that we measured nonetheless agrees with those found from synthetic spectral fitting: V sin I * = 1.8 ± 0.5 and 2.0 ± 0.5 km s −1 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>, respectively. The discrepancy noted and discussed by several authors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Winn et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Simpson et al. 2010</ref>) between the V sin I * measured from the RossiterMcLaughlin effect and from the spectral modeling of line broadening is negligible for such slow-rotating star like HD 80606.</p><p>The stellar radius we measured, R ⋆ = 1.007 ± 0.024 R ⊙ , is slightly larger than this obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>, namely R ⋆ = 0.968±0.028 R ⊙ . Both values remain in agreement with the one deduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> from relationships between stellar radius, luminosity, temperature, gravity and mass, namely R * = 0.98 ± 0.07 R ⊙ .</p><p>The radius ratio R p /R * and the timing of the transit that we found significantly differ from the values derived from groundbased observation; this is discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Planetary radius</head><p>The radius ratio we found from the transit observed with Spitzer is R p /R * = 0.1001 ± 0.0006.

(2009)</ref> found the same radius ratio than <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> but with an uncertainty three time larger, mainly due to the lack of ingress observation. The radius ratio measured in the infrared from space is thus ∼ 3 % smaller than the one measured in the optical from ground. This is a 3 − σ difference according the error bar reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>. The two horizontal dotted lines in the lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> show the absorption depths expected with the two values; the infrared radius ratio clearly is smaller than the optical one.</p><p>The uncertainties in the background measurement (Sect. 2.2) are too small to account for such a radius difference. A variation of the stellar brightness due to spots could explain timevariations in the measured radius ratio <ref type="bibr">(Désert et al. 2010</ref>). The upper limit of the brightness variations of the non-active star HD 80606 (Sect. 4) is however too small to explain a ∼ 3 % radius-ratio variation. The planetary thermal emission could produce an underestimation of the measured radius ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kipping &amp; Tinetti 2009)</ref>. The emission level measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> at 8 µm near the periastron is larger than the planetary emission expected at 4.5 µm at the transit; even with this overestimated planetary flux, the effect would be negligible according the error bars on the radius ratio we measure at 4.5 µm.</p><p>The question of possible interpretation in terms of differential atmospheric absorption could be raised. The planet apparent radius as a function of wavelength has been shown to follow the equation dR p /dλ = Hd ln σ/dλ (Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Etangs et al. 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Etangs et al. , 2008b</ref>, where λ is the wavelength, σ is the cross section of the mean atmospheric absorber, H = kT/µg is the atmospheric scale height, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, µ is the molecular mass, and g is the planet gravity which is about 100 m s −2 . If the variation of radius is due to variation of absorption by haze in the atmosphere as in the case of the HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pont et al. 2008</ref>), even assuming Rayleigh scattering which produces the steepest variation of absorption as a function of wavelength, a temperature of about 5 000 K is required to interpret the present measurements, much higher than actually measured ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. 2009</ref>). Indeed, because of the large planetary mass, at a typical temperature of 1000 K the scale height is only 60 km. The difference of measured radius is about 40 times this scale height, and is therefore unlikely due to atmospheric differential absorption.</p><p>We found no astrophysical interpretations able to explain the radius difference between optical and infrared wavelengths. It is more likely that the error bars are slightly underestimated, maybe in the ground-based composite light curve. We note that as we obtain a larger stellar radius than <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref>, we obtain a similar planetary radius despite the different radius ratio: R p = 0.981 ± 0.023 R Jup .</p></div>

This means that the transit mid-time T t we report is in significant advance by about 2.5 minutes in comparison to this predicted from the epoch T 0 we report for the periastron of the planet (see Sect. 5.1.2). Indeed, this latest time is in the referential frame of the radial velocities, which are these of the star. Similarly, the epoch T e of the eclipse reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is delayed by about 15 seconds by comparison to the ephemeris computed from T 0</p><p>The mid-time of the transit we obtain is accurate at the level of 1.5 minute, whereas the accuracy is 6 minutes for the epoch of the periastron. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> obtained a 4-minute accuracy for the mid-time of the eclipse. These accuracies are high, especially when they are compared with the long duration of the transit and the long orbital period. Using radial velocities alone, even if they span a time as long as 9.5 years, the error bars on the eclipse and periastron timing are three times larger. For the transit timing, the radial velocities can not predict it at better than two to three hours. Transit and eclipse detections allow here more accurate timings. This high-accuracy offers opportunity to look for possible transit timing variations (TTVs). According to the mid-transit time and the period we found, we obtain for the February and June 2009 transits a mid-time that is ∼ 23 minutes earlier than the T t time measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> from these events. Their accuracy on this timing was ±7 minutes, so the disagreement is at the level of 3 σ. If it is not caused by underestimated systematic uncertainties, such a difference in the transit timing could in principle be due to the presence of additional bodies in the system, such as satellites of the transiting planet or additional planetary-mass bodies in the system (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Nesvorny &amp; Beaugé 2010</ref>.</p><p>We explored a small region of the parameter space of a hypothetical additional planet in search for a few examples that could explain a ∼ 20-minute difference between two nearby transits. For this, we performed a series of 3-body simulations by integrating the equations of motion using the Burlisch-Stoer algorithm implemented in the Mercury6 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chambers 1999</ref>).</p><p>Planets in resonant orbits could explain such TTV even with masses low enough to prohibit their detection with the available radial velocities. For example, a 15-Earth-mass planet in a circular 4:1-resonant orbit produces the adequate timing anomalies, with many pairs of transits exhibiting a ∼ 20-minute discrepancy. The simulated timing variations exhibit an amplitude of 80 minutes in this case. A 0.17-Jupiter-mass planet at the 6:1 resonance produces similar results, although the overall amplitude is reduced to ∼ 40 minutes. Both cases would imply radial velocity variations with semi-amplitudes K ≃ 1.5 and 4 m s −1 , respectively, so we cannot exclude those two cases: the first one would be undetectable in the available radial velocity data set, whereas the second one would be at the limit of detection. More massive planets on non-resonant orbits could be excluded. For example, a planet located in a circular orbit at 3 AU and having a mass of 1.7 Jupiter masses would imply a small number of pairs of nearby transits exhibit a variation of the order of 20 minutes. It would imply radial velocity variations of K ≃ 30 m s −1 which is detectable with the available radial velocities. In all these cases, the short-term variations (in timescales of the order of 2000 days) exhibited by the orbital parameters of the transiting planet remain below the level of precision reached from our combined fit (Sect. 5.1). However, the variations in timescales of the order of 10 5−6 days are substantially larger in all cases. In particular, some 4:1-resonant cases could be unstable after a few thousands of years.</p><p>We also explored the possibility that the observed discrepancy were produced by a satellite to the transiting planet. In the more favorable case of having a satellite orbiting the planet at the Hill's radius, we found that its mass must be around 3/100 that of HD 80606b for it to be the cause of a ∼ 20-minute delay in the transit occurrence, corresponding to 40 Earth masses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Spin-orbit misalignment</head><p>We confirm the spin-orbit misalignment in the HD 80606 system and reduce the uncertainty in its measurement: λ = 42 ± 8 • . This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be rejected with a high-level of confidence. Such misalignment would imply an asymmetry in the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly as the star is not a perfect sphere but is slightly elongated at the equator due to its rotation. However, the accuracy of the data is not high enough to allow such tiny effect to be detected.</p><p>The λ angle measures the sky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis. Its actual value remains unknown, as the inclination I * of the stellar rotation axis is undetermined. In cases where λ = 0 is measured, it is reasonable to assume I * ≃ 90 • and an actual spin-orbit alignment. In cases as HD 80606 where λ is significantly different from 0, there is certainly no reasons to assume the stellar rotation axis is parallel to the sky plan.</p><p>The projected stellar rotational velocity we get from the Rossiter-McLaughlin fit is V sin I * = 1.7±0.3 km s −1 . According to our measured radius for HD 80606, R ⋆ = 1.007 ± 0.024 R ⊙ , and to the relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bouchy et al. (2005)</ref>, this V sin I * translates into a stellar rotation period P rot / sin I * = 30 ± 5 days. So the stellar rotation period apparently is shorter than 40 days. This is shorter than the limit P rot &gt; 50 days we get in Sect. 3.2 from the low activity of HD 80606. This estimation based on the activity, however, is not accurate especially for long rotation periods. These two values suggest a rotation period in the range 40−50 days, so a I * -angle near 90 • . The value λ = 42±8 • that we measure is thus probably close to the value of the misalignment angle without projection effect. So the actual angle between the spin-axis of HD 80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is about 40 • . <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Sky-projected λ-angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis as a function of the planetary mass, for 21 published systems (see references in Sect. 6.5). Systems with |λ| &gt; 30 • are in filled, red symbols. HD 80606 is marked by a circle.</p><p>The first case of a planetary system with a stellar spin misaligned with the normal of the planetary orbit was discovered by <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2008)</ref> in the XO-3 system. This result was hereafter confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Winn et al. (2009b)</ref>, who however found a lower λ-value. HD 80606 was the second system reported to have a spin-orbit misalignement by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref>. This result was subsequently confirmed and refined successively by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pont et al. (2009)</ref>, Gillon (2009a), <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al. (2009a)</ref> and finally by the present study. Other planetary systems with significantly misaligned spin-orbit have been reported since then: WASP-14 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson et al. 2009</ref>), WASP-17 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al. 2010</ref>), HAT-P-7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al. 2009c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Narita et al. 2009a</ref>), and CoRoT-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pont et al. 2010</ref>). There are thus now six known misaligned systems. Three other systems may be misaligned, but the large uncertainties in the reported λ-values prohibit definitive conclusion: WASP-3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Simpson et al. 2010</ref>), TrES-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Narita et al. 2007</ref>), and <ref type="bibr">CoRoT-3 (Triaud et al. 2009</ref>). The recent case of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-8 (Jenkins et al. 2010</ref>) is presented as moderately misaligned but this requires confirmation (see Sect. 5.2). On the other hand, eleven systems are apparently aligned, namely HD 209458 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Queloz et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, Wittenmyer et al. 2005</ref>), HD 189733 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Winn et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Collier Cameron et al. 2009</ref>), HD 149026 ( <ref type="bibr">Wolf et al. 2007, Winn &amp; Johnson in prep.)</ref>, HD 17156 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cochran et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Barbieri et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Narita et al. 2009b</ref>), HAT-P-1 (Johnson 2008), HAT-P-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Winn et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Loeillet et al. 2008</ref>), HAT-P-13 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Winn et al. 2010b</ref>), WASP-6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gillon et al. 2009b</ref>), TrES-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Winn et al. 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">TrES-4 (Narita et al. 2010</ref>), and CoRoT-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bouchy et al. 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky &amp; Winn (2009)</ref> have shown that the whole sample of the measured λ-angles could be well reproduced with a bimodal distribution, by assuming that a fraction of the orbits have random orientations relative to the stars and the remaining ones are perfectly aligned. The systems of misaligned orbits would be those which experienced gravitational interactions between planets and/or stars, such as Kozai migration.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> we show the measured λ-angles as a function of the planetary masses for the 21 systems with published measurements reported above. This plot suggests a scenario with three distinct populations. Indeed, for the planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter, most of the spins are aligned with the orbits; this is expected for planets that formed in a protoplanetary disk far from the star and that slowly migrated closer-in at a later time. A small fraction of these Jupiter-mass planets however exhibits large λ-angles; this could be the signature of the second population in the scenario by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky &amp; Winn (2009)</ref>, these which experienced gravitational interactions and that apparently are less frequent. These planets also seem to be those than can have extreme λ-values.</p><p>A third population could be formed by the large-mass planets. Indeed, most of them exhibit a misaligned spin-orbit (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson et al. 2009)</ref>, maybe all of them 3 . This is a priori surprising as one can expect the most massive planets are the ones for which exciting the inclination is more difficult. If indeed such misalignments are frequent for the high-mass-planet population, this suggests a different evolution scenario for them. Maybe the more massive planets could not really slowly migrate because of the interactions with the disk. In that case, only more severe interactions with another planet or a star could be the cause of migration for massive planets, such interactions also affecting the inclination of the orbit. We also note that the λ-angles seem lower for the massive planets than those of the misaligned planets with lower masses; this suggests as well a different scenario for the processes able to modify the inclination of low-and largemass planets.</p><p>Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of other systems with transiting massive planets should be performed to confirm or not that there are preferentially tilted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We presented an observation of the 12-hour-long transit of the highly eccentric, 111.4-day-period exoplanet HD 80606b performed in January 2010. The transit light curve we present is among the first ones carried with the post-cryogenic Spitzer. Its shows systematic effects stronger than those seen in the ColdSpitzer but the accuracy remains clearly better that groundbased observations. Together with the SOPHIE measurements acquired at the same epoch, this is one of the first observational <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The only exception, HATP-P-2, could actually be also misaligned as the inclination of the stellar rotation axis is unknown. campaigns performed simultaneously in radial velocities and space-based high-accuracy photometry. With previously available data sets, this allows the parameters of this system to be significantly refined thanks to combined fits. There is a possible detection of a variation in the transit timing, which has to be confirmed by additional observations of HD 80606b transits, from ground or space. A dark spot was also possibly detected on the surface of this inactive star. The spin-orbit misalignment is clearly confirmed and the λ angle is accurately measured. As most of the massive planets for which this angle is measured, the orbit of HD 80606b is misaligned with the equatorial plan of its host star. This suggests a separate evolution scenario for massive planets in comparison with Jupiter-mass planets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

On the three panels, the dashed lines show the models without transit and the solid lines show the models with transit (Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly for radial velocities, and absorption feature for the light curve). The parameters of the fits are reported in Table 1. The vertical dotted lines show the mid-transit, the vertical dot-dashed lines show the first and fourth contacts, and the vertical dot-dot-dashed lines show the second and third contacts. The uncertainty on the timing of the mid-transit is 1.5 minute (corresponding to 9 × 10 −6 in orbital phase), and about two times larger for the timing of the four contacts.</figDesc></figure>
