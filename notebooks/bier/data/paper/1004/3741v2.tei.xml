			<abstract>
				<p>We explore how finite integration times or equivalently temporal binning induces morphological distortions to the transit light-curve. These distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (COROT) and the Kepler Mission (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density, which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such techniques, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short-and long-cadence light-curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are consistent using the techniques discussed here.</p>

(2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Henry et al. (2000)</ref>. The detection of a transit allows for a measurement of the planet-star ratio-of-radii, which may be used to infer the planetary radius once the stellar radius has been determined. Multi-wavelength measurements may be used to retrieve a spectrum of the light being absorbed by the planetary atmosphere and thus a deduction of the molecular constituents (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tinetti et al. 2007</ref>). Timing of the eclipse minima and duration permits for the detection of other bodies in the system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>) and companion moons <ref type="bibr">(Kipping 2009a,b)</ref>. In recent years, various authors have published increasingly ingenious methods of characterizing exoplanets through transits, including thermal emission detections ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deming et al. 2006</ref>), spin-orbit alignment ⋆ E-mail: dkipping@cfa.harvard.edu <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Winn et al. 2005</ref>) oblateness measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Seager &amp; Hui 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter &amp; Winn 2010</ref>) and many more.</p><p>As we look for these small whispers of the exoplanet's nature, we are in fact examining the morphology of the transit light-curve in increasing detail. It is therefore paramount that the methods for modeling these light-curves are in the most precise form possible.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the effects of finite integration time on the transit light-curve, or equivalently the act of temporal binning. Long-cadence (LC) data smears out the transit light-curve signal into a broader shape which will lead to an erroneous retrieval of the system parameters, if unaccounted for.</p><p>We will first outline the nature of the morphological distortions in §2 and then derive analytic expressions for the approximate systematic error in the retrieved parameters, as a function of integration time. It is shown that the effect can be significant enough to even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as being unphysical, unless the effect is correctly accounted for. Obviously, this is critical for missions like CoRoT and Kepler which employ LC photometry to detect new transiting planets. In §3, we will discuss numerical techniques to correctly model the transit light-curve and derive the errors of these methods as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. These expressions allow for a simple evaluation of the expected consequences of finite integration time and thus will guide observers in choosing how to deal with this issue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Ingress/Egress Durations</head><p>For a transit light-curve, there are four critical contact points which define the overall shape, which represent the points where the time derivative is discontinuous. Physically speaking, contact points I and IV occur when the sky-projected planet-star separation is equal to the stellar radius plus to planetary radius. Contact points II and III occur when this parameter equals the stellar radius minus the planetary radius. Defining W as the average of the durations between the 1 st -to-4 th and 2 nd -to-3 rd contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kipping 2010)</ref>, tc as the mid-transit time and τ as the ingress/egress duration, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">tI = tc − W/2 − τ /2<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">tII = tc − W/2 + τ /2<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">tIII = tc + W/2 − τ /2<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">tIV = tc + W/2 + τ /2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The principal effect of finite integration time is to smear out the light-curve into a broader shape (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). The apparent ingress and egress durations will increase and additional curvature will be introduced into the light-curve wings. The ingress/egress stretching can be considered in terms of the apparent positions of the contact points being temporally shifted from their true value. The magnitude of this time shift is dependent on the relative phase difference between the sampling and the transit signal. If we assume that a large number of transits observed with LC photometry are folded about the orbital period, as is typical in transit detection, then the effect becomes much more predictable with the deviation averaging out to I/2.</p><p>Under these conditions, contact points I and IV will appear to move outwards from tc by one half of the integration time each, I/2. Conversely, contact points II and III will appear to move inwards by the same amount. Let us define the apparent contact points as t ′ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t ′ I = tI − I/2<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">t ′ II = tII + I/2<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">t ′ III = tIII − I/2<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">t ′ IV = tIV + I/2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref> showed that several physical system parameters may be retrieved by analysis of the light-curve morphology. Specifically, they define tT = tIV − tI and tF = tIII − tII . Let us define the apparent observed values as t ′ T and t ′ F respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref> showed that the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit divided by the stellar radius, aR, the transit impact parameter, b, and the ratioof-radii, p, are all determined by manipulation of tT , tF and transit depth, δ. These parameters may then be used to determine orbital inclination, i, and stellar density, ρ * . Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kipping (2010)</ref> extended these equations to account for orbital eccentricity and we will here employ these more general expressions in our analysis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">b 2 = (1 − p) 2 − sin 2 [(t F π √ 1−e 2 )/(P ̺ 2 c )] sin 2 [(t T π √ 1−e 2 )/(P ̺ 2 c )] (1 + p) 2 1 − sin 2 [(t F π √ 1−e 2 )/(P ̺ 2 c )] sin 2 [(t T π √ 1−e 2 )/(P ̺ 2 c )]<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">a 2 R = (1 + p 2 ) − b 2 ̺ 2 c sin 2 [(tT π √ 1 − e 2 )/(P ̺ 2 c )] + b 2 ̺ 2 c (10) ρ * = 3π GP 2 a 3 R − p 3 ρP<label>(11)</label></formula><p>We here derive what these retrieved parameters would be if the effect of finite integration time was ignored. In the above expressions, we replace tT &amp; tF with </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">t ′ T = (tT + I) &amp; t ′ F = (tF − I).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">b ′2 = (1 + p) 2 sin 2 √ 1−e 2 Iπ P ̺ 2 c −arcsin √ (1−p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i sin 2 √ 1−e 2 Iπ P ̺ 2 c +arcsin √ (1+p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i − (1 − p) 2 sin 2 √ 1−e 2 Iπ P ̺ 2 c −arcsin √ (1−p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i sin 2 √ 1−e 2 Iπ P ̺ 2 c +arcsin √ (1+p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i − 1 (12) a ′2 R = (1+p) 2 sin 2 √ 1−e 2 πI ̺ 2 c P −arcsin √ (1−p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i −4p sin 2 √ 1−e 2 πI ̺ 2 c P +arcsin √ (1+p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i − (1 − p) 2 ̺ 2 c sin 2 √ 1−e 2 πI ̺ 2 c P −arcsin √ (1−p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i sin 2 √ 1−e 2 πI ̺ 2 c P +arcsin √ (1+p) 2 −b 2 a R ̺c sin i − ̺ 2 c (13) ρ ′ * ≃ 3π GP 2 a ′3 R<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Setting I = 0 returns the original results as expected. Unfortunately, these equations are somewhat overly complex for us to draw any physical intuition. To proceed, let's consider a typical case example by using the system parameters from one of the Kepler planets, since these are discovered using long-cadence data. The following example is for the assumption of zero limb darkening, which is a very poor one for the Kepler bandpass. The effects of limb darkening will be discussed later.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we plot the retrieved stellar density, ρ ′ * , as a function of the true stellar density, ρ * . We fix all other parameters to be that of Kepler-5b, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koch et al. (2010)</ref>. The effect can be seen to be highly significant, caus- ing the retrieved stellar density to be underestimated by a factor which borders on an order-of-magnitude. This scale of underestimation is sufficient to completely reject some planetary candidates as unphysical. However, we note that in reality the underestimation of ρ * will not be this severe due to countering effects of limb darkening suppression discussed later in §2.2.</p><p>Looking at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> again, let us explore the physical reasons for this underestimation. We begin our line of thought by considering the impact parameter, b. If the ingress/egress duration is elongated, what do we expect to happen to the derived impact parameter? Consider two extreme cases. When a planet transits with a very low impact parameter, we have essentially an equatorial transit. This means the vector describing the sky-projected planetary velocity is nearly perpendicular to the stellar limb. As a result, the planet crosses the limb expediently. In contrast, if we have a near-grazing transit, the mutual angle between the stellar limb and the sky-projected planetary velocity vector has become more acute, which has the effect of making the limb-crossing time much longer. Therefore, stretching the ingress/egress duration causes b ′ &gt; b.</p><p>Having established this point, consider the effect on aR. The simplest way to understand the effect on this parameter is to appreciate that b and aR exhibit an extremely strong negative correlation, as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carter et al. (2008)</ref>. So the act of increasing the ingress/egress duration will increase b and therefore decrease aR. Finally, from equation (11) we know that ρ * ∝ a 3 R .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Limb Darkening Effects</head><p>For transit observations at visible wavelengths, limb darkening is quite pronounced producing a well-known curvature in the flat-bottom part of the light-curve. For large integration times, the curvature is smeared out, producing a flatter transit trough morphology. If we were trying to fit such a transit light-curve, and the limb darkening parameters are exactly known, our hypothetical fitting algorithm would move towards a case where limbdarkening is least effective. This occurs for near-equatorial transits. This is because as the transit impact parameter becomes larger and larger, we move closer and closer to the limb of the star where limb darkening accentuates. Therefore, LC data pushes b ′ towards a more equatorial value due to limb darkening i.e. b ′ &lt; b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Two Countering Effects</head><p>In conclusion, finite integration times have two countering effects on b ′ and thus a ′ R and ρ ′ * as well. The ingress and egress smearing causes the ingress to appear larger, which occurs for more grazing transits. In contrast, the limb darkening is suppressed, which occurs for more equatorial transits. Whilst limb darkening is important, especially for transit surveys like CoRoT and Kepler which operate at visible wavelengths, the fundamental change in the transit morphology is sufficiently large that it will tend to dominate. This is because the amplitude of the curvature in the lightcurve trough is usually at least an order-of-magnitude less As an example, we use the system parameters of Kepler-5b to show the effect on the retrieved stellar density as a result of long integration times, in the case of no limb darkening. The 1 min line appears to produce results within the typical uncertainties of the derived stellar density.</p><p>than the amplitude of the transit signal itself. Therefore, the consequences of smearing the overall transit signal will tend to dominate over the suppression of limb darkening.</p><p>The general rule of thumb that b ′ is overestimated will break-down when we have τ ≫ I but tF ∼ O <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>, which occurs for near-grazing transits. In such a case, the fractional change to the ingress durations is minimized but the change in the transit trough curvature is maximized.</p><p>To exactly calculate the net consequence of these two effects though, the integration time should be included when we generate our model light-curves rather than attempting ad-hoc corrections post-analysis. This appears to be the only way to completely account for the effect in a reliable manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Consequences for the Transit Depth</head><p>We will briefly comment on the effect of finite integration time on the transit depth. Assuming no limb darkening is present and tF &gt; I, the transit depth is completely unaffected by the long integration time. This has important consequences for secondary eclipses where the light-curve is unaffacted by stellar limb darkening.</p><p>For cases where we have limb darkening, the net effect on the retrieved p ′ will depend on whether b ′ &gt; b or b &lt; b ′ . Additionally, the effect will be a function of what assumptions were used in the fitting algorithm (e.g. the fixing of various parameters), the true impact parameter and the limb darkening coefficients. Given the large number of correlated factors, predicting the effect of integration time becomes less reliable and we must fit the transit light-curve with a model which accounts for integration time in the first place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Observed Effects with Kepler</head><p>We point out that the effects of long integration times have already been observed by the Kepler Mission. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gilliland et al. (2010)</ref>, shows the transit light-curve of longcadence and short-cadence data for the same planet, TrES2b. The long-cadence light-curve exhibits a broader shape with the apparent position of the contact points shifted by ∼ I/2, as predicted by our model. Notice also that the curvature in the transit trough, due to limb darkening, has also been attenuated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ACCURATE TRANSIT LIGHTCURVE MODELING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Analytic Integration</head><p>The critical problem we have outlined can be simply summarized by the following: Don't fit an unbinned model to binned data. The model usually used to generate a transit lightcurve is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">t → f → z → F (t)</formula><p>Now that we have established the mechanism of generating of a transit light-curve for instantaneous time stamps, F (t), let us consider what the transit light-curve for integrated time stamps would be, ˜ F ( ˜ t). In this case, the integrated flux would be given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">˜ F ( ˜ t) = ˜ t+I/2 t=˜tt=˜ t=˜t−I/2 F (t)dt˜t+I dt˜ dt˜t+I/2 t=˜tt=˜ t=˜t−I/2 dt (15)</formula><p>This equation suffers from the problem that F cannot be written as a function of t analytically, since such a solution would require a closed-form solution to Kepler's equation, which is transcendental. Evaluating this expression for F as a function of z is also not possible since we would find the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">˜ t+I/2 t=˜tt=˜ t=˜t−I/2 F (t)dt = z( ˜ t+I/2) z( ˜ t−I/2) F (t(z)) dt dz (z)dz<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Whilst dz/dt may be evaluated analytically through a chain rule expansion of (dz/df ) × (df /dt), the resultant expression will be as a function of f , rather than z. If we knew f (z), then we would be able to write out the integrand in a closed-form, but f (z) can only be found by solving a quartic equation, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kipping (2008) (K08)</ref>. Unfortunately, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kipping (2010)</ref>, there is no currently proposed method to correspond which roots refer to which orbital conjunction which makes a closed-form expression elusive.</p><p>The only remaining hope for a simple analytic expression would be to express the integral in terms of true or eccentric anomaly, which are inter-changeable. This would yield the following integral:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">˜ t+I/2 t=˜tt=˜ t=˜t−I/2 F (t)dt = f ( ˜ t+I/2) f ( ˜ t−I/2) F (t(f )) dt df (f )df<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The integrand of this expression may be written out in a closed-form, by utilizing the solutions of K08:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">˜ t+I/2 t=˜tt=˜ t=˜t−I/2 F (t)dt = f ( ˜ t+I/2) f ( ˜ t−I/2) F (z(f )) P 2π 1 √ 1 − e 2 D(f )df<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Where D(f ) is the duration function defined by K08, F (z) is given by MA02 and z(f ) is well-known (e.g. Winn 2010). The integral limits do not possess a closed-form solution since once again we must solve Kepler's equation, but in principle the indefinite integral could be analytically evaluated and then the relevant limits applied after a subroutine provides numerical solutions to Kepler's equation. We believe that this strategy would be the most computationally efficient since we have obviated the need for any numerical integration. However, we were unable to find a solution for the indefinite integral for even a uniform-source case and will therefore focus the remainder of this discussion onto numerical techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Numerical Integration</head><p>Having established the significant challenges regarding analytic integration, we now turn our attention to the use of numerical integration techniques. The functions we need to integrate over are in fact very well-behaved and wellapproximated by compositions of polynomials and thus we anticipate even a low-resolution numerical integration technique should provide satisfactory accuracy.</p><p>In this subsection, we first consider the merit of Simpson's Rule or other Newton-Cotes based methods. We aim to avoid using nested quadrature methods like the GaussKronrod or Clenshaw-Curtis, as the number of integrations required is large and we wish to avoid nested methods. For the simplest case of Simpson's rule, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">˜ Fi(N = 3) = F (ti − I/2) + 4F (ti) + F (ti + I/2) 6<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Where N denotes the number of calls needed to the MA02 code and essentially is a measure of the resolution of our numerical integration. This method may be extended to higher intervals by using Simpson's composite rule. Alternatively, we can extend to cubic, quartic, etc interpolations by using the Newton-Cotes formulas. Each time we evaluate F (t) requires another call to the MA02 subroutine, and thus we wish to minimize the number of calls, but maximize the accuracy of the employed technique.</p><p>Simpson's composite rule works by splitting up our integration range into 2m subintervals, therefore requiring N = 2m + 1 calls to the MA02 code. The error on the composite Simpson's rule is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">σ ˜ F (N ) Comp.Simpson = F (4) (ǫ) I 180 I N − 1 4<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Where ǫ is some number between ti − I/2 and ti + I/2. In contrast, the Newton-Cotes formulas move through increasing orders by increasing the interpolation order. For the N = 4 case (which is the cubic interpolation scenario, known as Simpson's 3/8 rule), the equivalent errors between the two methods are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">σ ˜ F (N = 4) Newton−Cotes = F (4) (ǫ) 3 80 I 5<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">σ ˜ F (N = 4) Comp.Simpson = F (4) (ǫ) 1 2880 I 5<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Thus for N = 4, Simpson's composite rule offers greater accuracy than the Newton-Cotes based equation. Moving through the higher orders in the Newton-Cotes family causes the error to have a functional dependence on F (N) , i.e. the N th differential of F . So for N &gt; 4 it is not possible to give an exact comparison between the two methods since F (N) (t) is not known for any N . Therefore, our only reliable comparison is for the N = 4 case, from which we conclude the composite Simpson's rule is superior in terms of accuracy versus computational requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Error in Numerical Integration</head><p>Let us now consider what value of N should be used. There are essentially three segments of the light-curve which exhibit curvature and thus would produce the maximum error in our numerical integrations, which employ linear piece-wise approximations.</p><p>(i) Curvature of the ingress/egress (ii) Curvature of the limb-darkened light-curve trough (iii) Discontinuities at the contact points</p><p>The last of these is due to a discontinuous function and the former two are due to curvatures within continuous functions. We will treat these two different sources of 'curvature' separately, although from the arguments made earlier, we expect the last of these effects to be the largest source of numerical error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Ingress/egress curvature</head><p>The transit light-curve has a depth δ and an ingress duration τ . For most of the ingress, the curvature is close to zero and essentially mimics a linear slope. However, near the contact points, the slope rapidly changes to a flat line of zero gradient. Therefore, near the contact points, the ingress/egress morphology causes large amounts of curvature. These points will exhibit the largest numerical errors in using a technique like Simpson's composite rule.</p><p>A suitable choice of resolution can be made by increasing N until σ ˜ F |max σ ˜ F ,obs , i.e. our calculation should produce a flux which has a maximum systematic error which is less than the observational uncertainty. We will set our resolution to a point where it provides satisfactory accuracy even at the point of highest numerical error, i.e. within the ingress/egress near the contact points.</p><p>Another approach would be to use an adaptive composite Simpson's rule, for example like that proposed by <ref type="bibr">McK- eeman (1962)</ref>. However, our preference here is to avoid using adaptive routines since they would require a new adaption for every single data point and fitting trial, which would be time consuming. The costs versus benefits of using such a method could warrant further investigation in the future. Instead, we choose to use the adaption required for the most troublesome points, which we have already identified. The required interval size in each element of the Simpson's composition should be decreased until we reach:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">|S(a, a + b 2 ) + S( a + b 2 , b) − S(a, b)|/15 &lt; σ ˜ F ,obs<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Where S(α, β) is Simpson's rule evaluated over the interval α to β. In our case, the integral is over time and a = tI and b = tI +(I0/m), where 2m is the number of subintervals we split the integral into and 2m = N − 1 where N is the required factor by which the number of calls to the MA02 code increases by. The reason for the subscript of 0 by the I term will be explained shortly. Our requirement may be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">|S(tI , tI + I 0 2m ) + S(tI + I 0 2m , tI + I 0 m ) − S(tI , tI + I 0 m )| 15 &lt; σ ˜ F ,obs<label>(24)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">S(α, β) = β − α 6 F (α) + 4F α + β 2 + F (β)<label>(25)</label></formula><p>In order to continue, we need to evaluate F (t) in a closed-form, which cannot be achieved due to Kepler's equation. However, there exists a special case where Kepler's equation does yield an exact closed-form solution and this occurs for circular orbits since M = E = f . In such a case, we may write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">z(t) = aR sin 2 2πt P + cos 2 i cos 2 2πt P<label>(26)</label></formula><p>The ingress/egress morphology is dominated by the expressions pertaining to a uniform source. Limb darkening does affect the ingress/egress curvature but this is much less than the amplitude of the uniform source transit signal. In the small-planet limit, MA02 provided the following approximation for the ingress/egress flux:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F (x) = 1 + x p 2 − x 2 − p 2 arccos x p<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Where we have defined z = 1 + x and it understood that −p &lt; x &lt; p for the ingress/egress. For the purposes of the evaluating the maximum error, we know that x ≃ p and thus we may expand the cosine term into second order using a Taylor series. Let us assume we have the simple case of b = 0 which means that i = π/2. We make further smallangle approximations to simplify the resultant expression for the error, which is justified since 2πtI ≪ P . The other adjustment we need to account for is that so we have approximated b = 0 and e = 0. To generalize the result, we consider that the effect of b &gt; 0 and e &gt; 0 is to stretch or shrink the ingress/egress duration by a factor τ /τ0. Therefore our expressions here are actually for I0, which may be written as I0 = I(τ0/τ ). We may now rewrite equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref> as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">σ ˜ F ,obs &gt; ψ 5/2 108m 3 3 24mp − 9ψ− 4 2mp − ψ − 6 4mp − ψ + 8mp − ψ<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Where we have used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ψ = 2πaR P τ0 τ I (29) τ0 τ ≃ √ 1 − b 2 √ 1 − e 2 ̺c (30)</formula><p>Due to the approximations made, we find that this equation is only stable for m 2. For any given data set, we simply need to solve equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref> for m with some sensible estimates of p, b, e, ω, aR and P . As an example, for Kepler-5b, taking the quoted parameters from the Koch et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2010)</ref> paper, we find that even using m = 2 provides an error of 0.1ppm, which is well below the typical measurement uncertainty of 130ppm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Limb-darkened trough-curvature</head><p>Another part of the light-curve where we have significant curvature, and thus expect the maximum numerical integration errors, is the limb-darkened light-curve trough. However, the peak-to-peak size of the changes in flux induced by the limb darkening are much lower than the transit signal itself (i.e. δ); typically an order-of-magnitude. Further, the time scale over which these changes act is greater than that of the ingress/egress curvatures (i.e. tF ≫ τ ) except for grazing transits. So we can see that, in general, the errors in our numerical integration techniques will be dominated by the ingress/egress curvatures rather than the limb-darkeninginduced light-curve-trough curvatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Contact point discontinuities</head><p>The final source of variation in the light-curve gradient is that of the discontinuous change located at the contact points. Estimating the error due to this discontinuity is most easily estimated by assuming a trapezoid approximated light-curve and considering the location where maximal error is induced. The largest error (and in fact only error) will occur for measurements close to contact points, or more specifically |ti − tM | &lt; I/2 where tM is the time of one of the contact points.</p><p>Before the first contact point, we have a flat line at F = 1 and after this point we have a linear slope with a gradient −(δ/τ ). The error in Simpson's composite rule will depend upon the relative phasing between the centre of the integration and the contact point, i.e. (ti − tI ). Generalized to any phase, the true integrated flux of the trapezoid approximated light-curve for the i th time stamp is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">˜ Ftrue,i = 1 − δ τ (2ti + I) 2 8I (31)</formula><p>For each value of m = 1, 2, 3... we choose to set the phase to be such that the difference between the true integrated flux and that from Simpson's method is maximized. Under such a condition, it may be shown that the maximum error is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">σ ˜ F Comp.Simp. = δ τ I 24m 2 (32) = δ τ I 6(N − 1) 2<label>(33)</label></formula><p>For the system parameters of Kepler-5b, we find that using m = 1, 2, 3 induces a maximal error of 371ppm, 93ppm and 41ppm respectively. Given that the measurement uncertainties are 130ppm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koch et al. 2010</ref>), a suitable choice for the resolution would be m = 2 since this means the maximum possible error of a data point in the least-favourable phasing would be below the measurement error.</p><p>It is interesting to see that for m = 2 the error was 0.1ppm for the ingress/egress curvature of the same system, suggesting the discontinuity error dominates the error budget. Actually, this is expected from the arguments made earlier in this paper. Therefore, in most applications, a selection for m based on the error induced by the contact point discontinuities will provide a robust integration resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Resampling</head><p>An additional method for numerically integrating the lightcurve is discussed here. Let us consider that we have observations with integrated time stamps given by the vector˜tvector˜ vector˜t. A second way of calculating˜Fcalculating˜ calculating˜F ( ˜ t) is to resample the time vector into a very fine cadence, at which point we may assume˜F assume˜ assume˜F = F . Let us define our temporary resampled time vector as˜tas˜ as˜t ′ . As an example, for the Kepler data, we may choose to resample the 30 minute integrations into 1 minute integrations would be done by expanding each time stamp, ˜ ti into a sub-vector of 30 equally spaced time stamps with a mean value given by˜tiby˜ by˜ti. Our new temporary time array is used to generate a light-curve using the normal MA02 expressions giving us F ′ ( ˜ t ′ ) (note that F here has no tilde because the MA02 equations can only generate instantaneous flux, not integrated flux). We then rebin the model light-curve back to the original cadence to give F ( ˜ t). Finally, we make the assumptioñ F ( ˜ t ′ ) ≃ F (t), i.e. the high cadence resampled time vector yields a light-curve model consistent with a time vector of infinite cadence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">˜ t → resample˜t resample˜ resample˜t ′ → MA02 F ′ ( ˜ t ′ ) → rebin F ( ˜ t) ≃ ˜ F ( ˜ t)<label>(34)</label></formula><p>It can be seen that resampling into N sub-time stamps will increase the computation time by a factor of ∼ N , since typically the MA02 subroutine uses the majority of a lightcurve fitting algorithm's resources (especially for non-linear limb darkening). In the next subsection, we will show that the computation times can be decreased by selective resampling.</p><p>One advantage of resampling is that we can choose to resample in such a way as to account for read-out and deadtimes, which may be important if the instrument's duty cycle is quite poor 1 . The resampling of the i th time stamp into N sub-time stamps with labels j = 1, 2, ...N − 1, N can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">ti,j = ti + j − N + 1 2 I N (35)</formula><p>The flux of the i th time stamp is found by rebinning all N flux stamps from j = 1 to j = N .</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">˜ Fi = N j=1 Fi,j N (36)</formula><p>Thus for the first few values of N = 2, N = 3 and N = 4 we would have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">˜ Fi(N = 2) = 1 2 F (ti − I/4) + F (ti + I/4) (37) ˜ Fi(N = 3) = 1 3 F (ti − I/3) + F (ti) + F (ti + I/3) (38) ˜ Fi(N = 4) = 1 4 F (ti − 3I/8) + F (ti − I/8) + F (ti + I/8) + F (ti + 3I/8) (39)</formula><p>For a trapezoid approximated light-curve, it can be easily shown that the error in these expressions, as a function of N , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">σ ˜ F Resampling = δ τ I 8N 2 (40)</formula><p>Therefore, the resampling method yields greater accuracy than the composite Simpson's method. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011a)</ref>, both the resampling and Simpson's composite rule were employed in completely independent analyses and the obtained results were consistent. Therefore, whilst we are free to use either method discussed here, the most efficient approach out of the two is resampling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gilliland et al. (2010)</ref> reported that they used a method for fitting the long-cadence light-curve of TrES-2b which we interpret to be equivalent to the resampling method. The authors split the LC intervals into 30 contributing sub-intervals corresponding to the SC cadence i.e. N = 30. For the reported LC r.m.s. noise of 66ppm and the system parameters of TrES-2b taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Winn et al. (2008)</ref>, we estimate that using N = 5 would produce a maximum possible error in the most unfavourably phased data point of 59ppm and thus using N = 30 is excessive for this light-curve. Our equations therefore permit for a reduction in computational time of 600%. Such a saving is highly advantageous in MCMC fitting, which is inherently expensive on the CPU. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011a)</ref> found that the typical time to globally fit 10-14 light-curves for each planet was around 1-2 weeks on modern CPUs. With the accumulation of 3-4 years of transits, CPU efficiency will become increasingly important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Selective Resampling</head><p>Resampling time stamps which satisfy |ti − tC| &gt; (tT + I)/2 and |ti−sC| &gt; (sT +I)/2 is unnecessary since˜Fisince˜ since˜Fi = Fi = 1 in such cases (assuming we have folded multiple transits about the orbital period). Note that we define sC as the mid-time of the secondary eclipse and sT as the duration from contact point I to IV of the secondary eclipse. We label this method of optimization as selective resampling.</p><p>Since (tT + sT )/P ∼ 2/(πaR), this can reduce the number of time stamps which require resampling by an order of magnitude for continuous staring telescopes like Kepler and CoRoT. It should be noted that selective resampling will not be possible if the light-curve model includes phase variations of the planet e.g. HAT-P-7b, <ref type="bibr">Borucki et al. (2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">APPLIED EXAMPLE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Target selection</head><p>The use of numerical integration techniques minimizes the error in the retrieved transit parameters from the LC data, but there is a fundamental loss of information which will mean a certain amount of error is unavoidable. A way to demonstrate both this point and the implementation of our numerical techniques is to provide an example analysis using the Kepler data.</p><p>Kepler discovers planets in LC mode and characterizes those most interesting planets using the SC mode. When Kepler began observations, three transiting planets were already known to reside in the field-of-view and thus Kepler was able to observe these objects in SC mode immediately. These planets are TrES-2b, HAT-P-7b and HAT-P-11b. Out of these three, only TrES-2b's SC data is publicly avaialble and thus will be the subject of our analysis in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data handling</head><p>The quarter 0 (Q0) and quarter 1 (Q1) LC and SC photometry was made available as part of 'Data Release 5' from the Kepler Mission. The data includes 18 transits of TrES2b with no interruptions during the transit events. We make use of the corrected photometry in both cases and details on the various corrective procedures can be found in the DR5 handbook. The photometry is normalized by dividing each time series by the median of the fluxes and then checks were made for any long-term behaviour. We found no significant trends in either time series or correlations with the centroid positions.</p><p>Preliminary fits are implemented to calculate the residuals and therefore identify outlier points. This process is repeated on both sets and points deviating by more than 3.5 standard deviations are removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Lightcurve fitting</head><p>Fits are performed following the same approach as described for method A in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011a)</ref>. We use a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm with 125,000 trials burning out the first 20%. In total we fit for 9 free parameters {tC ,p 2 ,Υ/R * ,b 2 ,OOT,P ,u1,u2}, where tC is the mid-transit time of the first transit, p 2 is the ratioof-radii squared, Υ/R * is the reciprocal of the half-duration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kipping 2010</ref> for details on this parameter), b 2 is the square of the impact parameter, OOT is the baseline flux, P is the orbital period and u1 &amp; u2 are the quadratic limb darkening coefficients. We use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> algorithm to generate limb darkened light-curves and note that because TrES-2b is relatively bright for the Kepler field at V = 11.4, fitting for the limb darkening is viable. We also point out that we assume a circular orbit for the planet for the purposes of simply comparing the two integration modes. A more detailed analysis, including a re-analysis of the RV data and incorporating eccentricity, is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011b)</ref>.</p><p>We account for the blending of the nearby companion TrES-2/C using the z' magnitude differences given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref>. This is achieved by including a blending factor B and following the corrective procedure outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kipping &amp; Tinetti (2010)</ref>.</p><p>For the SC data, we apply no numerical integration since the cadence is short at 58.8 s. For the LC data, we use N = 5 with the resampling method, as calculated in §3.4. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Comparison of the short-cadence data (circles) with overlaid best-fit (dashed line) and the long-cadence data (triangles) with overlaid best-fit (dotted line). The smearing effect of the long integration times is clearly visible, but the retrieved lightcurve parameters are consistent using the numerical integration techniques outlined in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Results</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we show the results of our fits for the SC and LC data, visible in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. We find that comparing parameters from the SC and LC modes leads to differences of less than 1 σ in all cases. Therefore, the two fits are consistent. We do note that the LC fit led to very poorly constrained limb darkening coefficients and thus fitting for limb darkening coefficients may not viable for fainter targets in LC mode. This difficulty likely stems from the fact limb darkening is suppressed as a consequence of the light-curve smearing.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the loss of information caused by binning the data leads to larger errors on the parameters in the LC mode. It would therefore seem that numerical integration techniques are able to reproduce satisfactory values for the light-curve parameters but inevitably lead to larger parameter uncertainties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have explored how long-cadence data, with particular focus on Kepler, causes severe systematic errors in the retrieved physical parameters, unless accounted for. The effect is valid for any finite exposure time but increases with longer cadences. Long-cadence data smears out the light-curve morphology, which acts to stretch out the ingress/egress duration and suppress limb darkening in the light-curve trough. These two effects act to increase and decrease the retrieved impact parameter respectively. Critically, overestimating the impact parameter is shown to lead to severe underestimations of the stellar density which could lead to planetary candidates being rejected on the basis of being unphysical.</p><p>Numerical integration techniques permit for improved modeling of the transit light-curve. We discuss two particular methods, the composite Simpson's method and resampling. We provide expressions for estimating the errors of these techniques and find that both methods produce an error which scales as N −2 where N is the numerical resolution of the techniques. Out of these two discussed methods, the resampling approach yields a greater efficiency. Incorporation of the effects of the finite-integration times for a real light-curve is provided by Kepler photometry of TrES-2b, where the two integration modes are shown to lead to consistent transit parameters using the numerical integration technique. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
