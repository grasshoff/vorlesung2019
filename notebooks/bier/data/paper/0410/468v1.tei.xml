			<abstract>
				<p>The detection of transits is an efficient technique to uncover faint companions around stars. The full characterisation of the companions (M-type stars, brown dwarfs or exoplanets) requires high-resolution spectroscopy to measure properly masses and radii. With the advent of massive variability surveys over wide fields, the large number of possible candidates makes such a full characterisation impractical for all of them. We explore here a fast technique to pre-select the most promising candidates using either near-IR photometry or low resolution spectroscopy. We develop a new method based on the well-calibrated surface brightness relation along with the correlation between mass and luminosity for main sequence stars, so that not only giant stars can be excluded but also accurate effective temperatures and radii can be measured. The main source of uncertainty arises from the unknown dispersion of extinction at a given distance. We apply this technique to our observations of a sample of 34 stars extracted from the 62 low-depth transits identified by OGLE during their survey of some 10 5 stars in the Carina fields of the Galactic disc. We infer that at least 78% of the companions of the stars which are well characterised in this sample are not exoplanets. Stars OGLE-TR-105, OGLE-TR-109 and OGLE-TR-111 are the likeliest to host exoplanets and deserve high-resolution follow-up studies. OGLE-TR-111 was very recently confirmed as an exoplanet with M planet ∼ = 0.53 ± 0.11 MJup (Pont et al. 2004), confirming the efficiency of our method in pre-selecting reliable planetary transit candidates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The search for extra-solar planets (exoplanets) is becoming increasingly important, yielding new insights both in stellar and planetary physics (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gonzalez 2003</ref>). Whilst some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lineweaver &amp; Grether 2003)</ref> suggest that 100% of Sun-like stars may have planets, current surveys appear to be heavily biased by the detection techniques used. The radial velocity technique has proved to be extremely successful over the past decade in discovering exoplanets, even though few planetary characteristics can be derived from the measurements. In contrast, planetary transits may yield many more properties, provided the host stars are well characterised. While transit surveys may monitor many orders of magnitude more stars in a comparatively shorter observing time than radial velocity surveys, they are not devoid of problems. Blending, grazing eclipses and contamination by giant stars, among other problems, make some detections somewhat ambiguous ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dreizler et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Brown et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Drake 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Drake &amp; Cook 2004</ref>). Clearly transit surveys have the ability to discover many interesting exoplanet candidates, but non-planetary events must be filtered out. The best way to perform such a separation is to obtain radial velocities at different phases along the orbit. Whilst this approach is becoming very successful ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dreizler et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bruntt et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Street et al. 2003</ref>), precision radial velocities for all transit candidates, especially those at faint magnitudes, would be far too time consuming, and so pre-selections must be carried out. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dreizler et al. (2002)</ref> made a selection of the best planetary candidates by using low dispersion spectroscopy to refine stellar parameters, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Drake (2003)</ref> used the gravity darkening dependence of the light curves. Another possibility is near-IR photometry which can also be used to discard giant stars, stars with IR excess, and to better determine stellar parameters (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ribas et al. 2003</ref>, for the case of bright stars with 2MASS photometry) and thus the radii of the companion objects. Ellipsoidal variability is also a good way to filter out the larger companions, although the correlation in the photometric time series limits in practice its applicability <ref type="bibr">(Sirko &amp; Paczy´nskyPaczy´nsky 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The characterisation of the companions and their host stars is thus important for two main reasons. First, it allows a pre-selection of the most promising exoplanet candidates, and filters out giant stars and large companions. Second, the depth of the transits depends upon R c /R * , the ratio of the radius of the companion R c to the one from the host star R * . Yet the most important and interesting quantity in the case of exoplanets is the radius R c , as it allows inferences on the planet's composition and evolutionary history.</p><p>Characterising the properties of the host star, and in particular its radius R * is therefore very important for transit candidates.</p><p>In this work we explore the possibility to characterise, through IR photometry and low dispersion spectroscopy, the properties of low-luminosity stars whose transits were discovered by the OGLE-III collaboration ( <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. 2002b</ref>), in order to constrain astrophysical parameters of both stellar and companion objects, some of which may be exoplanets.</p><p>In Sections 2 and 3 we present the observations and data reduction. We describe the estimation of stellar parameters in Section 4 through a novel application of the surface brightness method. The inferred properties of the companions are discussed in Section 5. A brief discussion of the stellar populations observed in these fields is provided in Section 6 with the help of a model of the Galaxy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>In 2002 the second "planetary and low luminosity" companion catalogue was published by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). In this campaign, the OGLE team observed 3 fields in the Carina region of the Galactic disc. These fields were monitored in February-May 2002 searching for lowdepth transits in about 100000 stars, and 62 objects were discovered with transit depths shallower than 0.08 mag in the I band. Many of these objects may be extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs or M-type stars (see <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. 2002b</ref> for further details). In order to characterise both stars and companions, we carried out IR imaging and optical spectroscopy in the two Carina fields <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 1)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> lists the schedule of observations for the subset of planetary transit candidates analysed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Optical V I imaging from OGLE</head><p>The optical photometry in the V and I bands come from the catalogue by OGLE ( <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. 2002b</ref>), whose observations were carried out with the 1.3m Warsaw telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory, Chile (operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington). The camera used was a wide field CCD mosaic of eight 2048 × 4096 pixel SITe ST002A detectors, with a field of view of about 35 ′ ×35 ′ giving a scale of 0. ′′ 26 per pixel. The data were obtained during 76 nights starting from <ref type="bibr">February 17, 2002</ref>. The fields were monitored ∼ 6 hours per night in the I-band filter with 180 seconds exposure time for each image. The median seeing for the all data was about 1. ′′ 2. The names and coordinates for the observed fields are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">K-band imaging</head><p>We have acquired photometric data in the K band for the CAR 104 and CAR 105 fields. Observations of each field covered an area 35 ′ ×45 ′ with the centres listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. Exposure times were 3 seconds per image. The images were taken typically at airmass ≈ 1.2 and the limit magnitude was K ≈ 17.</p><p>These images were taken on January 18, 2003, as a backup program, with the SOFI near-IR array at the 3.5m New Technology Telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. The detector was a Hawaii HgCdTe 1024 × 1024 array with a scale of 0. ′′ 29 per pixel and a field of view of 5 ′ ×5 ′ . The gain was ∼ 5.6 e − /ADU and the readout noise 2.5 ADU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Low resolution spectroscopy</head><p>The spectroscopy was carried out at the Magellan II 6.5m Clay telescope equipped with the Low Dispersion Spectrograph S2 (LDSS2), during the nights of May 10 and 11, 2003. The data were acquired as a backup program on bright nights, with some thin cirrus and seeing of the order of 1 arcsec. We used the 1 ′′ wide slit, with the high resolution grating which gives 6 ˚ A resolution and a spectral coverage from 3700Å3700Å &lt; λ &lt; 7500Å7500Å. The spectra were taken at low airmass (&lt;1.2), and the exposure times ranged from 90 sec to 600 sec for these relatively bright stars (14.4 ≤ V ≤ 18.1). A HeNeAr lamp exposure was acquired immediately after each star's spectrum. We managed to observe a dozen of sources selected from the list of OGLE candidates <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data reduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Optical Photometry from OGLE</head><p>We used the standard, pipeline-reduced data from OGLE-III (second "planetary and low-luminosity object transit" release, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Udalski et al. 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. , 2002b</ref>). The light curves were produced by a difference image analysis (DIA), and the calibration was done using the OGLE-II and OGLE-III data with errors that should not exceed 0.1-0.15 mag. The very precise DIA photometry of some 100,000 stars yielded 62 objects with shallow dips in their light curves, suggesting flat transits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">IR photometry</head><p>The reduction of the K-band data included flat-field and sky substraction, which was carried out with IRAF 1 . The sky frame, which was first subtracted from each image, was made by median-combining 3 to 4 adjacent images. The subsequent flat-fielding was done with a master-flat made from all the frames in the mosaic. The instrumental magnitude was calculated with Sextractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996</ref>) using a median FWHM of about 2.7 pixels for all the stars. The aperture radius was 1 FWHM and the background was taken at 2 FWHM. The zero point calibration was done using the 2MASS (2 Micron All Sky Survey) database. We required a match between the position of our stars and the 2MASS stars within 1 ′′ in RA and DEC. Our magnitude range was between 11 &lt; K &lt; 17 and the error in the zero point calibration was about 0.05 (median for this filter calculated by 2MASS). Note that the error shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> does not include the zero point error. The K-band zero point determined was Z p = 23.43. For the V magnitude, we matched the published list by <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. (2002b)</ref> and a list delivered by the OGLE project in which we have the photometric V and I magnitudes and coordinates for all the stars in the two fields. Because the fields are somewhat crowded, some candidates were surrounded by other stars and the match failed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Spectroscopy</head><p>From the images of the spectra we have subtracted a combined bias, trimmed and divided by a combined normalised flat-field obtained from high S/N quartz lamps. The spectra were extracted using IRAF tasks within the TWODSPEC package, with their background properly removed. The wavelength calibration was done with the HeNeAr lamps, using 14 to 20 lines. The cosmic rays were excised, and the spectra were flux calibrated using the spectrophotometric standards. However the flux calibration is unreliable because of the presence of thin cirrus during the nights. The final spectra are plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Although a qualitative spectral classification can be made by comparing these spectra with a series of templates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dreizler et al. 2002)</ref>, we prefer to measure the effective temperatures using the three most intense lines from the Balmer series. The results are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, and <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that the independent measures from different Balmer lines is in excellent agreement. The weighted mean of the three effective temperatures is given in Column 8 of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, while the measured radial velocities are given in Column 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Determination of stellar parameters</head><p>The determination of the properties of the stars which have transits, based solely on optical and K-band photometry and on low-resolution spectroscopy, is complicated by the lack of information on the extinction along their lines of sight. Even though the Carina fields <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 1)</ref> correspond to regions of the Galactic disc where the reddening and extinction are relatively low, locally, they cross the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at least twice, as shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> where the arms were traced with the distribution of free electrons as determined by dispersion measures on pulsars <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Taylor and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Cordes 1993, Cordes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lazzio 2003)</ref>. Extinction is extremely patchy in these regions of the Carina arm (Wramdemark 1980), which are populated by many star-forming complexes and cavities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Georgelin et al. 2000)</ref>, leading to a wide range not only of extinction values but also of the reddening parameter R V , which in these areas ranges from 3.0 to 5.0, with an average of about 4.0 (Patriarchi, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morbidelli &amp; Perinotto 2003)</ref>, much larger than the anomalous ones seen in the bulge <ref type="bibr">(Udalski 2003</ref>).</p><p>Since the target stars presumably lie, given their magnitudes and spectral types, on the first intersection with the Carina spiral arm, we estimate the reddening along the line of sight with the 3-dimensional model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Drimmel et al. (2003)</ref> as a guide. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the colour excess E(B − V ) as a function of distance (assuming R V = 3.1) predicted by this model for the two fields considered in this study, along with the one assumed by the Besançon Galaxy model which we will use later on to analyse the field population (Section 6). This improves upon the estimation made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mendez &amp; van Altena (1998)</ref>, and appears to be the only practical guide at low galactic latitudes. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Drimmel et al. (2003)</ref> 3-dimensional model predicts two important features long these directions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>). First, the intersection with the spiral arm is reflected by the rapid increase in the absorption at about 2 kpc, and then at about 6.5 kpc, fully consistent with the map shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>. The Besançon Galaxy model is, in comparison, less realistic as this feature is not present. Second, the predicted colour excess at 8 kpc appears extremely large, between 1.4 and 1.7 magnitudes in E(B − V ), while the Besançon Galaxy model reaches an asymptote well below 1 magnitude. The reason of this discrepancy is unclear, but may perhaps be related to the fact that the 3-D model is calibrated on the data of DIRBE/COBE and ISSA/IRAS which may overestimate the reddening by factors up to 1.5 in regions where A V &gt; 0.5 mag <ref type="bibr">(Arce &amp; Goodman 1999</ref>). We also note that simple, homogeneous exponential discs will produce an extinction of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A V = κ o 10 sin |b| (1 − exp [ −10 d sin |b|]) (1)</formula><p>where d is measured in kpc, so that asymptotically when b → 0 the extinction tends to κ o magnitudes per kpc. The Besançon Galaxy model appears to give a distance dependent extinction similar to an exponential disc with κ o = 1.05 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>). To simulate and account for the effect of a possible increase of R V as large as 4, we will also use κ o = 0.70. Note that while the extinction predicted by this series of models at large distances is very different, below 2 kpc the range becomes rather narrow, and the results will largely be independent of the assumed extinction. At large distances, the unknown dispersion of A V at a given distance will be a limiting factor.</p><p>The simultaneous measure of R V and E(B − V ) independently would require a much better absolute flux calibration of the low resolution spectra and U -band photometry or UV spectra, and is clearly beyond the scope of this work. We will assume instead R V = 3.1 and consider a variety of extinctions to account both for a possible variation of R V and the dispersion of extinction at a given distance. To determine the extinction of each star, the colour-colour diagrams ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1</ref>) cannot be used, because the reddening vector happens to have the same direction as the locus of the main sequence stars, and even some giants may also lie close to the sequence.</p><p>One possibility would be to compute reddeningindependent indices based on the standard dependence of extinction with wavelength. For instance,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q VIK = (V − I) − E(V − I) E(I − K) (I − K)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E(V − I) = A V 1.0 − A I A V (3) E(I − K) = A V A I A V − A K A V<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and we adopt A I /A V = 0.479 and A K /A V = 0.113 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cardelli et al. 1989</ref>). The resulting diagram is shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref> where the horizontal shift produced by extinction is clearly visible and amounts, in average, to about E(B − V )= 0.3. If all the stars were on the mainsequence, the reddening would be measured through the horizontal shift required to move the observed position to the main sequence locus. Unfortunately we have no guarantee that all these stars are on the main sequence of solar metallicity, as some may be more metal rich and some giants could well be present, especially in the lower half of the diagram. Clearly another technique has to be used to measure unambiguosly the reddening.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a new method based on the well-known surface brightness (SB) relation which has been recently recalibrated using exclusively direct interferometric measures of angular diameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kervella et al. 2004</ref>). The surface brightness S λ in a given passband is just</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S λ = a − 0.1m λo − 0.5 log θ LD (5)</formula><p>where m λo is the intrinsic, dereddened apparent magnitude in that passband and θ LD its limb-darkened angular diameter. Since the surface brightness is tighly correlated to colour, the equation can be inverted to yield the diameter as a function of colour. Our method has thus three distinct steps. First, a distance is assumed, and hence a reddening (based on the model adopted for extinction). Magnitudes and colours are dereddened. The resulting optical and IR magnitudes are used to infer the limb darkened angular diameter of the star, via the relations</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">log θ LD mas = 0.5170 + 0.0755(V − K) o − 0.2K o (6) log θ LD mas = 0.5149 + 0.1805(I − K) o − 0.2K o (7)</formula><p>where the rms dispersions are less than 1% and 3.7% respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kervella et al. 2004</ref>). Our final estimate is the weigthed mean of these two estimates.</p><p>The second step estimates the effective temperature through the relation log T eff = 4.1788 (8) with a dispersion smaller than 0.6%, which corresponds to a systematic error of 40 K for a G2 V star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kervella et al. 2004</ref>). The combination of the first two steps yields an estimate of the effective temperature which depends on the assumed distance. It also yields directly the intrinsic stellar radius as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R * R ⊙ = 4.434 10 10 d kpc tan θ LD 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The third and last step makes use of the properties of main-sequence stars : the strong correlation between luminosity and mass (L ∼ M β ), and between mass and radius (M ∼ R α ), and hence between effective temperature and radius of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T eff T eff⊙ = R * R ⊙ (αβ−2)/4 ≈ R * R ⊙ 0.64<label>(10)</label></formula><p>using the standard values of α = 1/0.8, β ≈ 3.6 and T eff⊙ = 5770 K. The resulting dependence of this new estimate of the effective temperature with the distance will clearly be different from the one resulting from the surface brightness relation. If a distance exists such that both estimates agree, we have a full solution with all the parameters of a main sequence star that agrees with the optical and IR photometric data. If there is no solution, then either the star is a giant, for which the surface brightness relations that we have used do not apply, or the assumed reddening at that distance is incorrect.</p><p>The procedure is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref> for 4 candidates from the OGLE list. In the case of OGLE-TR-77, the three black lines give the effective temperature as a function of distance (assuming κ o = 1.05) for the mean and the two extreme values of the optical and K-band magnitudes. The relatively large separation between these three estimates is due to the large uncertainties (0.10-0.15 mag) in the OGLE optical magnitudes. The red lines give the constraint from the main sequence (Eq. 10) which appears to be far less sensitive to the photometrical errors. The intersections of the lines yield a unique and accurate solution for the effective temperature, the stellar radius, the distance and the reddening.</p><p>A fully independent estimate comes from the measures of the effective temperatures based on the lowresolution spectra <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. When available, these measures are indicated on Figs. 7 to 10 as a hatched band, independent of distance. As shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref> the agreement for OGLE-TR-77 and OGLE-TR-80 is impressive.</p><p>The method is not devoid of problems, however. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref> illustrates, in the case of OGLE-TR-85 two solutions are possible, and there is no way to select the correct one on the basis of that information only. However, the value of the reddening-free index Q VIK indicates that OGLE-TR-85 must have a spectral class between G2 and K0 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>) and hence the short distance solution is preferred. The steep increase in the SB-derived temperatures in this case was produced by the steep increase in extinction predicted by the 3-D extinction model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Drimmel et al. (2003)</ref>. Other models would not give the second solution, as at that distance the expected scatter in reddening is very small, and so, again, the short distance solution is preferred.</p><p>A second problem arises when the temperatures derived from the SB relation do not agree with the spectroscopic ones. This is the case for OGLE-TR-89 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7)</ref> where the SB-inferred temperature gives a temperature of some 10,000 K while the spectrum indicates 6,000 K. Again the reddening-free index Q VIK (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>) indicates that the position of OGLE-TR-89 is consistent with the locus of A-type stars, pointing either to a problem in the spectrum or else that it is a giant star, in which case the SB-inferred temperature is of course incorrect. The latter explanation is likely, as the SB method points to a large distance (6.9 kpc) which is very unlikely for this bright star.</p><p>While at distances below 2 kpc the inferred measures are independent of the reddening assumed at these distances <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>, at larger distances there is a rather strong dependence on the assumed extinction. For instance, in the case of OGLE-TR-89 or OGLE-TR-118, an extinction larger than the one predicted by the κ 0 = 0.7 exponential model would yield either a very large distance, which is unlikely given their magnitudes, or no solution at all, pointing to supergiant stars.</p><p>In general, the agreement between the SB-inferred temperatures and the spectroscopic ones is very good, as illustrated on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 11</ref>. The only outlier is, in fact, OGLE-TR-89 which is likely to be a giant star, as discussed above. Likewise, the large distance inferred for OGLE-TR-118 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 10</ref>) makes it likely to be a giant star.</p><p>Some other stars deserve comments. OGLE-TR-102 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 8</ref>) appears to have a solution with a very short distance (0.25 kpc), as appropriate for such a low temperature star inferred from the SB method. This temperature is fully consistent with its small Q VIK index which makes it a late main-sequence K star <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 6</ref>). Yet its position on the colour-magnitude <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 14)</ref> shows that it could also be a giant star, at of course a much larger distance. The Galaxy model that we will use in §6 shows that such a small distance is not expected in a sample of stars of this size, providing yet another hint that this star is a giant.</p><p>In summary, OGLE-TR-83, OGLE-TR-98, OGLE-TR-116 and OGLE-TR-119 do not yield any solution and are therefore very likely to be giant stars. As their mainsequence solutions yield large distances, OGLE-TR-89 and OGLE-TR-118 are also likely to be giants. OGLE-TR-102 is also likely to be a giant, even though a reasonable value for its parameters, consistent with all the data, is found assuming that it is a main-sequence star. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Constraints on the companions</head><p>The main objective of our observations is to better characterise the properties of the host stars in order to infer the radii of their companions. They are given straightforwardly through the standard relation (e.g. Seager &amp; Mallén-Orlenas 2003)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R c R * = 10 ∆I/2.5 − 1 1/2 (11)</formula><p>where ∆I is the depth of the transit in magnitudes in the I band, provided by OGLE and given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>Clearly the vast majority of companions are low-mass objects but are not small enough to be exoplanets.</p><p>If we adopt as an example the first extrasolar planet discovered with the transit technique, HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charbonneau et al. 2000)</ref>, which is a close giant planet 2 with a radius of 1.35 ± 0.16 R Jup ∼ 0.14 R ⊙ , only three companions could be exoplanets : OGLE-TR-105, OGLE-TR-109 and OGLE-TR-111.</p><p>OGLE-TR-102 is somewhat dubious because the host star is probably a giant star, as discussed above, in which case the stellar radius has been seriously underestimated. In this case the radius of the component has also been underestimated and the odds are that the transiting object is not an exoplanet.</p><p>OGLE-TR-105 and OGLE-TR-111 are the best candidates, as the stellar radiii are measured to within 3% and they are clearly main sequence stars with mid-K spectral types. OGLE-TR-105 only had 3 transits measured ( <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. 2002b</ref>) and therefore is a bit more dubious that OGLE-TR-111 with 9 measured transits.</p><p>OGLE-TR-109 would have the shortest period (below 1 day) and is a borderline object at R c =0.13 R ⊙ , along with OGLE-TR-90 and OGLE-TR-100. They all share the property that their host stars are rather hot, with effective temperatures around 7,000 K. Some of the MACHO transit candidates, selected from a subset of 180,000 stars in the MACHO database of the Bulge, also appear around this type of stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Drake &amp; Cook, 2004</ref>) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 12</ref> summarises the results by showing the inferred radii of the companions as a function of their orbital period. The candidates selected here all fall within the category of "hot" Jupiters as their periods are close to 3 days and appear to be quite compact. It is beyond the scope of this work to discuss further the physical properties of this subset of possible candidates.</p><p>It is interesting to compare the results of our analysis with the best candidates selected by the OGLE team. They assumed that all the host stars had one solar mass exactly and inferred the corresponding radii of the companions using Eq. 11. Of their 10 best candidates with R c /R ⊙ &lt; 0.14 that we observed, only two are confirmed : OGLE-TR-109 and OGLE-TR-111, and one is unclear. Overall, we exclude at least 70% of their best candidates (with R c /R ⊙ &lt; 0.14) and possibly 80%. The are two reasons for this: in 30% of the cases the star appears to be a giant, while in the rest our revised radii become too large. In addition, one candidate which had R c /R ⊙ = 0.16 appears to have a smaller radius of 0.11 R ⊙ (OGLE-TR-105) and hence enters in the list of possible exoplanets. This proves the effectiveness of our approach in pre-selecting the best candidates for high-resolution spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">The stellar populations in the fields</head><p>The stellar populations present in the Carina fields not only are interesting in their own right but could also shed some light on the properties of the transit candidates. For instance, in our solar neighborhood many of the confirmed planets orbit around main sequence stars of perhaps slightly larger metallicity than solar <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gonzalez 2003</ref>). We have seen ( §4) that the distances of the transit stars inferred from the SB method range from about 1 to 4 kpc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 13 and 14</ref> show the candidates and the field population in optical colour-magnitude and optical-IR colour-magnitude diagrams respectively. The Padova isochrones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Girardi et al. 2002)</ref> for solar age and metallicity, without reddening, are also indicated at 1 kpc (solid line), 2 kpc (dotted line) and 4 kpc (short dashed line), and confirm that the candidate stars are indeed within this range.</p><p>Assuming a solar distance to the Galactic center of R 0 = 8 kpc, the location of these fields has a typical distance of 7.5 kpc from the Galactic centre. The stellar population in these fields should not be too different from that of the solar circle. If we consider the metallicity gradient in the Galactic disk of -0.09 ± 0.02 dex/kpc <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Friel &amp; Janes 1993)</ref>, the mean metallicity in the field should be ∼ 0.04 dex larger in the mean than that of the Solar neighborhood. Such a small difference would hardly matter.</p><p>Further insights can be gained through the comparison with a synthetic model of the Galaxy. The Besançon model has been updated recently ( <ref type="bibr">Robin et al., 2003) 3</ref> and is very convenient for our purposes as we can derive the distribution of stars, their photometric properties and distances in a given direction. In addition, the model provides information on the metallicities and kinematics of these samples. The predicted differences between the two fields, Carina 104 and 105 are small given the sampling fluctuations and the patchy extinction.</p><p>From the model, we selected main sequence stars having the same range of K-band magnitudes as our candidates. Further, we also selected those with a luminosity class equals to V, that is, on the main sequence. We also applied a cut in metallicity, such that −0.25 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5 but this proves to be not very discriminant, because most stars are within this range, given the metallicity gradient observed in the disc, as discussed above. The question that arises is whether the distributions of inferred distances and colour excesses for the candidates could be sampled from the synthetic model. This is important as we did not use the Besançon model for the dependence of reddening with distance, and hence this comparison provides a good test of the procedure, given the model.</p><p>The resulting distribution function of the E(B − V ) colour excess is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> (Top) where for the sake of completeness we have also indicated the distribution for the giant stars. The gaussian-shaped distribution for the selected main-sequence stars appears very similar to the distribution of the inferred E(B − V ) for the candidates (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>), while giant stars present a very skewed distribution, a reflection of the brigher absolute magnitudes and hence larger distances which lead to larger colour excesses, on average. Beyond this qualitative comparison, we can give a quantitative answer to the question of whether the Besançon model could be the parent population out of which the sample of candidates could have been extracted. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15 (Bottom)</ref> gives the cumu-lative distribution functions, and a simple two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives a probability of 57% for the two samples to be drawn from the same population. Note that we removed the likely giants from our OGLE sub-sample. Although this probability is not too high, we can conclude that the Besançon model provides a reasonable agreement, especially since we did not use the underlying reddening model.</p><p>A further sensitive test comes from the distribution of distances. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16</ref> shows the cumulative distribution functions of both candidates and synthetic stars (top panel). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a probability that the sample of candidates is extracted from the parent synthetic population of 20% when we consider all the candidates. If we remove OGLE-TR-102, OGLE-TR-89 and OGLE-TR-118 as likely giant stars, we get a much larger probability of 43%, fully confirming our suspicion that these three stars cannot be drawn from the main-sequence population.</p><p>The detailed distribution of stars in the colourmagnitude diagrams depends heavily on the star formation history, the metallicity distribution function and the initial stellar mass function, in addition to the extinction properties mentioned in §4 and the actual density distributions of the thin and thick discs, which are dominant in these fields. While there are methods to infer the past history of star formation from volumelimited samples close to the solar neighbourhood (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hernandez et al. 2000)</ref>, such an analysis clearly goes beyond the scope of this paper. We will just note here that a nearby field (ℓ = 292.45, b=1.63) has yielded interesting constraints on galactic structure (see the field F3 analysed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Vallenari et al. 2000)</ref> although the results depend strongly on the assumed age and metallicity range of the populations.</p><p>Finally, the kinematics of the model can also be tested since we have a few radial velocities measured from the low-resolution spectra <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 17</ref> gives the radial velocities as a function of the distance along the line of sight for both the candidates and the synthetic stars. The radial velocity along these lines of sight can be also calculated using the accurate model by <ref type="bibr">Nakashini &amp; Sofue (2003)</ref> which fits the observed distribution of Hi gas. As expected, most radial velocities are close to zero, and overall there is an excellent agreement, except perhaps for OGLE-TR-89, OGLE-TR-110 and OGLE-TR-118.</p><p>We conclude that, even though these data are not sufficient to strongly constraint the structure of the Galaxy along these directions, they are consistent with current models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In order to make an efficient pre-selection of possible exoplanets, we obtained K-band photometry for a sample of transit candidates detected by the OGLE collaboration in the CAR 104 and CAR 105 fields of the Galactic disc, along with low-dispersion spectroscopy of 11 promising candidates. By combining these new data with the optical V I photometry from OGLE, we presented a novel application of the surface brightness relations to measure the colour excess of each transit star, its distance, and, more importantly, the effective temperature and radius, and hence to fully caracterise their properties. The method rejects automatically giant stars, and provide accurate solutions for main-sequence stars. A comparison with the temperatures derived from the low-resolution spectra shows an excellent agreement and validates the method. The new measures of stellar radii allow us to further refine the radii of the companions.</p><p>We find that :</p><p>1. The combination of optical with near-IR photometry allows a very good estimate the stellar parameters for most stars and therefore to select the best planetary transit candidates in a very effective way, bypassing the need of high-resolution spectroscopy at this stage of the selection process.</p><p>2. We discard OGLE-TR-83, OGLE-TR-89, OGLE-TR-98, OGLE-TR-102, OGLE-TR-116, OGLE-TR-118 and OGLE-TR-119 for being very probably giant stars.</p><p>3.

Recently, Pont et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2004)</ref> confirmed OGLE-TR-111 as an exoplanet with a mass of 0.53 ± 0.11 M Jup and a radius of 1.0 1.13 0.94 R Jup .

to be measured within 0.03 mag (Bonifacio, Caffau &amp; 
Molaro 2000) independently of any assumption on dis-
tance (although R V cannot be measured in this way). 
Even though it is less costly in telescope time than 
high resolution spectroscopy, it remains unpractical for 
a large systematic follow-up survey.
