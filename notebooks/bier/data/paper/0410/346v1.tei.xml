			<abstract>
				<p>Two years ago, the OGLE-III survey (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) announced the detection of 54 short period multi-transiting objects in the Galactic bulge (Udalski et al., 2002a, 2002b). Some of these objects were considered to be potential hot Jupiters. In order to determine the true nature of these objects and to characterize their actual mass, we conducted a radial velocity follow-up of 18 of the smallest transiting candidates. We describe here our procedure and report the characterization of 8 low mass star transiting companions, 2 grazing eclipsing binaries, 2 triple systems, 1 confirmed exoplanet (OGLE-TR-56b), 1 possible exoplanet (OGLE-TR-10b), 1 clear false positive and 3 unsolved cases. The variety of cases encountered in our follow-up covers a large part of the possible scenarii occuring in the search for planetary transits. As a by-product, our program yields precise masses and radii of low mass stars.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since 1995 the search for planets by radial velocity surveys has lead to the detection of more than 120 planetary candidates. The diversity of orbital characteristics, the mass distribution of the planets (actually only the m sin i) and its link with brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as well as the characteristics of host stars prompted a reexamination of planetary formation theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Udry et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Eggenberger et al. 2004</ref>). The most unexpected fact was the existence of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) in very short orbits. Extra mechanisms, not envisioned by the study of our Solar system, have been suggested to explain these objects, like the migration of planets in the proto-planetary disk and gravitational interactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Lin et al. 1996</ref>).</p><p>Monitoring of photometric transits caused by an EGP passing on the disk of its hosting star and obscuring part of its surface provides an opportunity to determine its actual size. When combined with spectroscopic observations, it leads to the unambiguous characterization of the two fundamental parameters (mass and radius) used for internal structure studies of EGPs. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henry et al. 2000</ref>) led to the first complete characterization of an EGP, illustrating the real complementarity of the two methods. These last years many extensive groundbased photometric programs have been initiated to detect transits by short period EGPs (Horne 2003). The OGLE-III survey (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) announced recently the detection of 137 short-period multi-transiting objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al., 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al., , 2002b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Udalski et al., , 2002c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Udalski et al., , 2003</ref>. The estimated radius of these objects range from 0.5 Jupiter radius to 0.5 solar radius and their orbital periods range from 0.8 to 8 days. The smallest objects could be suspected to be EGPs, but considering only the radius measured by OGLE, one can not conclude on the planetary nature of the objects per se. They could as well be brown-dwarf or low-mass stars since in the low mass regime the radius is independent of the mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guillot, 1999)</ref>. No information on the mass of these companions is given by the transit measurements. Doppler follow-up of these candidates is the only way to confirm the planetary, brown-dwarf or low-mass star nature of the companions. Planetary transit detection suffers also some ambiguity related to the configuration of the system. The radial velocity measurement is therefore very important in that respect to discriminate true central transits from other cases due to, for example, grazing eclipsing binaries, blended system and stellar activity. The spectroscopy of the central star, which is a by-product of radial velocity measurement, is necessary to constrain the star radius and therefore the companion radius. The measurement of the true mass of a companion by the radial velocity orbit, coupled with the measurement of its radius, lead to a direct measurement of its mean density, an essential parameter for the study of internal structure of EGPs, brown dwarfs and low mass stars.</p><p>The difficulties of Doppler follow-up of OGLE candidates come from the faintness of the stars (with V magnitudes in the range 14-18). The fields, which are located in the galactic disk, are furthermore very crowed. To characterize a hot Jupiter, one needs radial velocity precision better than 100 m s −1 and the capability to distinguish whether the system is blended or not by a third star like the triple system HD41004 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Santos et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Several teams are involved in the Doppler follow-up of OGLE candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Konacki et al. (2003a)</ref> announced first that the companion of OGLE-TR-56 is a planet of 0.9 Jupiter mass. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dreizler et al. (2003)</ref> gave an upper limit of 2.5 Jupiter mass for the companion of OGLE-TR-3. This object was however refuted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Konacki et al. (2003b)</ref> who also gave informations on 3 other OGLE companions (OGLE-TR-10, 33 and 58). Additional measurements, conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Torres et al. (2004a)</ref>, lead to improve the mass determination of OGLE-TR-56b to 1.45 Jupiter mass. Recently, we announced the characterization of planets OGLE-TR-113b, OGLE-TR-132b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Moutou et al. 2004</ref>) and OGLE-TR-111b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pont et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>We present in this paper the Doppler follow-up observations of 18 OGLE multi-transiting companions <ref type="bibr">(OGLE-TR-5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19, 33, 34, 35, 48, 49, 55, 56</ref>, 58 and 59) from the 54 detected in the Galactic bulge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al., 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al., , 2002b</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">UVES</head><p>We have obtained 16 hours in service mode with the UVES spectrograph on the ESO-VLT in October 2002 (program 70C.0209A). For this run we selected 3 candidates (OGLE-TR-8, 10 and 12) with an estimated companion radius less than 1.6 Jupiter radius (following the value given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al., 2002a</ref>). We were aware that UVES has no fiber to produce a stable illumination at the entrance of the spectrograph and that the Iodine cell method is unusable for such faint stars. However, using the smallest slit (0.3 arcsec) in a medium seeing condition (0.9-1.4 arcsec), we can minimize the velocity error stemming from the shift of the photo-center on the slit. Considering as well the very good guiding (&lt; 0.1 arcsec) and the centering accuracy of UT2 (about 0.1 arcsec), we simulated that for a 1.0 arcsec seeing one should reach an overall stabilization of the photo-center of about 1/70 of the slit width. This corresponds to a radial velocity error of about 40 m s −1 . In order to check our accuracy we added the bright standard radial velocity star HD162907 (selected from the CORALIE exoplanet survey) close to our 3 candidates. Moreover, in order to track and to correct instrumental calibration drifts we took Thorium exposures before and after each science exposures. With such a procedure we expected an overall radial velocity precision of about 50 m s −1 . We used the red arm of the spec- trograph with a central wavelength of 580 nm. Notice that in order to reach this precision it is mandatory not to conduct this program in good seeing conditions (i.e seeing less than 0.9 arcsec). We noticed that such an unusual requirement is extremely rare in Paranal. We made 8 measurements of each targets with exposure time between 20 and 40 minutes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the result obtained with UVES on HD162907. The dispersion of 93 m s −1 is dominated by the centering error especially during night with good seeing condition. If we eliminate the 4 measurements made with a seeing lower than 0.9 arcsec, the dispersion reaches 54 m s −1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">FLAMES</head><p>The FLAMES facilities on the VLT (available since march 2003) seems to be the most efficient way to conduct the Doppler follow-up of OGLE candidates. FLAMES is a multifiber link which allows to feed the spectrograph UVES with up to 7 targets on a field-of-view of 25 arcmin diameter in addition with the simultaneous thorium calibration. The fiber link allows for a stable illumination at the entrance of the spectrograph and the simultaneous thorium calibration is used to track instrumental drift. Forty five minutes on a 17 magnitude star reach a signal-to-noise ratio of about 8, corresponding to a photon noise uncertainty of about 25 m s −1 on a non-rotating K dwarf star. We have obtained 24 hours in service mode on this instrument (program 71.C-0251A) in order to observe in May and June <ref type="bibr">2003 17 candidates (OGLE-TR-5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19, 33, 34, 35, 48, 49, 55, 56</ref>, 58 and 59) located in 3 FLAMES fields (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). For this program, we selected a sample including 7 candidates with an estimated companion radius less than 1.6 Jupiter radius (following the value given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al., 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al., , 2002b</ref>) and completed each fields with targets having larger companion radius in order to bring constraint in the mass-radius relation of low-mass stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">HARPS</head><p>HARPS is a new fiber-fed spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mayor et al. 2003</ref>) dedicated to high-precision Doppler measurements. During the second commissioning in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Positions of the 54 OGLE candidates on the sky and localization of our 3 selected FLAMES fields. Bold circles correspond to the 17 observed OGLE candidates during our run.</p><p>June 2003, we tested the capability of the instrument to realize radial velocity measurements on faint stars and made 5 measurements of 1-hour exposure on OGLE-TR-56. The 20 first blue spectral orders were not used to compute radial velocity due to their too low S/N (&lt; 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Spectroscopic analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Radial velocities</head><p>The spectra obtained from the FLAMES and UVES spectrographs were extracted using the standard ESO-pipeline with bias, flat-field and background correction. Wavelength calibration was performed with ThAr spectra. The radial velocities were obtained by weighted cross-correlation with a numerical mask constructed from the Sun spectrum atlas. In the case of FLAMES and HARPS, the simultaneous ThAr spectrum was used in order to compute the instrumental drift by crosscorrelation with a Thorium mask. Radial velocity uncertainties (in km s −1 ) were computed as a function of the SNR per pixel of the spectrum, the width (FWHM in km s −1 ) and depth (C in %) of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) through the following relation based on photon noise simulations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">σ RV = 3 · √ FWHM SNR · C .</formula><p>However, our measurements are clearly not photon noise limited and we added quadratically an empirically determined uncertainty of 35 m s −1 in order to take into the account systematic errors probably due to wavelength calibration errors, fiber-to-fiber contamination, and residual cosmic rays. We checked that, on non-rotating dwarf stars, the O-C residuals of our measurements are in agreement with the estimated uncertainties based on this relation. Our best O-C residuals indicate that we reached radial velocity precision lower than 100 m s −1 .</p><p>Our radial velocity measurements and Cross-Correlation Function parameters are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For some candidates observed with FLAMES at very low SNR (SNR&lt; 5), the depth of the CCF is correlated with the SNR. This is a clear indication that the spectra are contaminated by background light due in part to the fiber-to-fiber contamination. We take into consideration this effect in order to correctly estimate the SNR and to compute our radial velocity uncertainties more strictly. Phasefolded radial velocities and results are presented and discussed in section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Rotation velocities</head><p>For each object, the eight observed cross-correlation function were shifted by the observed radial velocity and coadded to give a combined CCF of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Rotationally broadened line profiles were convolved with a Gaussian instrumental profile depending of the instrument and correlation mask: σ = 3.0 km s −1 for UVES and 4.0 km s −1 for FLAMES. The instrumental profile was determined with HD162907 for UVES and the combined spectrum of OGLE-TR-19 and OGLE-TR-49 for FLAMES. We also checked the <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Radial velocity measurements (in the barycentric frame) and CCF parameters. Label a and b indicate that 2 components are present in the CCF. BJD in the range ,  and <ref type="bibr">[809]</ref><ref type="bibr">[810]</ref><ref type="bibr">[811]</ref><ref type="bibr">[812]</ref>  instrumental profile on both spectrographs with the ThAr spectrum. The profiles were fitted to the CCF to determine the projected rotation velocity v sin i of the target objects. The result is displayed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. A quadratic limb-darkening with coefficients u1+u2 = 0.6 was assumed. The computations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barban et al. (2003)</ref> find that such a coefficient is a suitable approximation for a wide range of spectral types in wavelengths corresponding to the V filter. For close binaries, with rotation periods of the order of a few days, we expect that the rotation axis is aligned with the orbital axis, the orbit is circularized and the system is tidally locked (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Levato 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Hut 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Melo et al. 2001</ref>). For known close binaries, the alignment of the axes and the tidal locking are observed to be effective even before orbital circularization. It can therefore be expected that in cases of a massive transiting companion with a short period, the system is tidally locked and v sin i is large. In that case, P rot = P transit and the rotational velocity is directly related to the radius of the primary. Rotation velocities observed in our sample are generally compatible with the hypothesis of tidal locking. In these cases v sin i provides a measurement of R with an estimated accuracy of a few percent. The uncertainty in the determination of v sin i was estimated by computing values on each of the individual CCF and calculating the dispersion of these values. In most cases this "formal" uncertainty is very small, and the dominant source of error is actually the adopted value of the limb darkening coefficient (see Section 6). For the smallest rotational velocities (v sin i &lt; 5 km s −1 ), the dominant uncertainty becomes the adopted value of the instrumental broadening and the stellar micro-turbulence parameter. In order to take into account such systematic uncertainties we fix afterward the lowest uncertainty of v sin i to 1 km s −1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BJD RV depth FWHM SNR σ RV [−2452000 d] [ km s −1 ] [%] [ km s −1 ] [ km s −1 ] OGLE-</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">F.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Existence and periodicity of transit signal</head><p>When the amplitude of the radial velocity variation is small, which may indicate the presence of a planet or a blend with a background eclipsing binary, one must first consider the possibility that the detected photometric signal is not a bona fide transit/eclipse, or that the period of the signal is incorrect. The OGLE photometric data is subject to systematic intra-night drifts in calibration to the level of the hundredth of magnitude, similar to the depth of the smallest detected transit signal. Given the fact that the transit candidates were detected among about 60'000 light curves, it is not impossible that some of them are artefacts. Either the whole detection is spurious or, more likely, one of the detected transit is an artifacts. If there are only two detected transits, this would imply that the periodicity of the event is unknown, and therefore that no information can be derived from the absence of radial velocity variations. Open symbols indicate objects for which the period had to be modified according to the radial velocity data (OGLE-TR-12, 17 and 59), crosses the objects for which no radial velocity variation was detected.</p><p>To quantify the reliability of the transit detection, we divided the value of the transit depth by its uncertainty, yielding a "confidence factor" for the existence of the transit, and plotted this factor as a function of the number of transits (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). Objects with only two or three detected transits and a low confidence factor are more likely to be artefacts. This is the case of objects OGLE-TR-19, 48, 49 and 58 which are possible spurious transit detections and are discussed individually below (Section 5.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10)</ref>.</p><p>In cases when the radial velocity data does not obviously confirm the period of the transit candidates, we also studied the light curve to see if the transit signal were compatible with other periods. For instance, in a two-transit case, several divisors of the interval between the two transits can be possible to put the data in phase. For OGLE-TR-12, 17 and 59, another period than the one given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al. ( , 2002b</ref>) was found to phase the light curve and radial velocity data perfectly. In case of equal mass double-line eclipsing binaries (OGLE-TR-8 and 35), the right period is twice the OGLE period due to the fact that both transits and anti-transits are present in the photometric curve.</p></div>

If the light of the secondary is not negligible compared to the primary, an anti-transit signal can be visible. Even in the absence of anti-transit, the ellipsoidal deformation of the primary under the gravitational influence of the secondary causes sinusoidal variations in the light curve with double the phase of the orbital period.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Analysis of the transit shape</head><p>The depth, width and general shape of the transit signal depend on a combination of physical variables, mainly the radius ratio r, the primary radius R and the impact parameter b (or, equivalently for circular orbits, the angle i of the normal of the orbital plane with the line-of-sight) and the orbital eccentricity. It is also more weakly dependent on the total mass (m + M) -via the orbital period and semi-major axis for a Keplerian orbitand the limb darkening coefficients. The parameter r is mainly constrained by the transit depth, R · (m + M) −1/3 by its duration, and b by its shape. We assumed that all orbits were circular (e = 0). Low-period binaries below P ∼ 10 days are observed to have circularized orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Levato 1976)</ref>, and all objects in our sample have lower periods except OGLE-TR-17, which indeed shows indications of a small eccentricity in the radial velocity curve (See Section 5.1). In all other cases of large-amplitude variations the radial velocity residuals show no significant variations from a circular orbit.</p><p>The light curve were fitted by non-linear least square fitting with analytic transit curves computed according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>, using a quadratic limb darkening model with u1+u2 = 0.3. Notice that this is different from the coefficients used for the determination of the rotational velocity, because the wavelengths are different. The OGLE data was obtained with an I filter while the spectra are centered on the visible. The fitted parameters were r, V T /R and b, where V T is the transversal orbital velocity at the time of the transit.</p><p>Broadly, there are two kinds of cases for the transit shape. Either the transit signal is broad and flat and b has a firm higher bound -a central transit -and in that case r and V T /R are very well constrained by the depth and duration of the transit. Or the V-shaped or indefinite signal shape allows for high values of b -a grazing transit -and in that case r and V T /R are correlated with b and cannot be well determined independently. In real terms, it means that the signal comes either from a small body transiting rapidly across the primary, or a larger body partially obscuring the primary in a slower grazing eclipse. For illustration, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows the fit of the transits of all our candidates.</p><p>The OGLE photometric data is subject to strongly covariant noise.

Bouchy et al.: Doppler follow-up of OGLE</note><p>To compute realistic uncertainties on the values of the transit parameters, we used a technique based on the permutation of the residuals. We compute the residuals by removing the bestfit solution for the transit shape, then exchange the residuals of one night with another randomly chosen night. The fitting procedure is then repeated on the resulting curve with the shuffled residuals, leaving the period as a free parameter. Many Monte Carlo realizations are then carried out to estimate the dispersion of the fitted parameters.</p><p>This permutation procedure has the advantage of "letting the data speak by itself" and automatically incorporates the real characteristics of both the random noise and the systematic intra-night drifts. Its use is especially relevant in objects where the transit was covered in a low number of nights. In that case, intra-night systematic drifts can significantly alter the transit shape, and a χ 2 analysis will yield much too low uncertainties. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> gives an example of the residual permutation procedure on OGLE-TR-12.

In most cases, R is precisely determined from the rotation velocity. Then M is constrained on the one hand by the spectroscopic parameters applied by the models, on the other hand by the V T /R factor in the fit and the transit curve. Parameter r then proceeds from R and r, and m from M and K. Parameter i is mainly derived from b. A low value of the minimum χ 2 ensures that the different constraints are coherent. This procedure yields very satisfactory accuracies on all the derived parameters. Note that the resulting r and m are only weakly dependent on the accuracy of the stellar evolution models, because R is primarily determined from the rotation velocity and M enters the determination of m with a 2/3 exponent.</p><p>There are two cases for which the accuracy on the final parameters is lower: 1) In cases when high values of b (b ∼ 1) are compatible with the light curve data, there is some degeneracy between the impact parameter, the duration of the eclipse and the radius ratio. In that case the upper error bar on r can be large because the light curve data is compatible with a grazing eclipse by a larger object. This is the case of OGLE-TR-12, 17 and 55. 2) If the primary is not in synchronous rotation, then R and M are much more weakly constrained by equations 5 and 6. In that case the influence of the adequacy of the stellar evolution models becomes more important. This is the case of OGLE-TR-34.</p></div>

In this way, we determined an updated or corrected period P, the velocity offset V0, and the velocity semi-amplitude K. Each classes of objects are described in the following subsection and the derived masses and radii are presented and discussed in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">low mass star transiting companions</head><p>The orbital parameters we derived for the 8 low mass transiting stellar companions OGLE-TR-5, 6, 7, 12, 17, 18, 34 and 55 are reported in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 6.</ref> OGLE-TR-5: This candidate is rotating very rapidly (v sin i∼ 88 km s −1 ), in synchronization with its very short orbital period (0.8 days). Systematic ellipsoidal variations in the light curve reveal the deformation of the primary and therefore the massive nature of the secondary. The mass obtained from the transit duration and radial velocity semi-amplitude is compatible with the spectral type and radius for a G+M binary, and all parameters can be determined precisely. OGLE-TR-6: The synchronized rotation of this target allows a precise determination of its radius. The transit shape shows that the impact parameter is small, and therefore all parameters can be computed precisely with our "standard" procedure. OGLE-TR-7: The synchronized rotation of this target allows a precise determination of its radius. The transit shape shows that the impact parameter is small, and therefore all parameters can be computed precisely with our "standard" procedure. The computed values of R and M are compatible with the spectral type for a main-sequence F dwarf. OGLE-TR-12: The radial velocity data show that this candidate is a binary system with a period 1.5 times greater than the period reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a)</ref>. This value is fully compatible with the light curve. The rotation is synchronized with the orbital period. The light curve indicate that the impact parameter b is probably high, causing increased uncertainties on r due to the degeneracy between impact parameters and the r factor. The large uncertainties are of course also due to the fact that there are only two nights in the transit. OGLE-TR-12 was observed with UVES (white points) and FLAMES (dark points). The velocity offset determined between the two set of data indicates a difference of 0.200 km s −1 between the two instruments. OGLE-TR-17: The radial velocity data show that this target is a binary system with P=13.8736 days, 6 times the value in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a)</ref>. This revision is compatible with the light curve data. The estimated rotation velocity of OGLE-TR-17 seems to indicate that this star is not synchronized which is not so surprising considering its quite large period. The shape of the transit allows high values of b, therefore causing degeneracy between the parameters. Moreover, the poor phase coverage of the transit increases the uncertainties. The large O-C residuals clearly indicate a departure from the circular orbit and a complete Keplerian fit indicate a small but significant eccentricity of 0.074±0.008. Note that OGLE-TR-17, with the longest period, is the only candidate which present a significant eccentricity. OGLE-TR-18: The rotation velocity is compatible with synchronous rotation. The fit of the transit parameters yield a high value of b, which increases the uncertainty on r. OGLE-TR-34: The radius given by the rotation velocity assuming synchronization (R = 1.02 ± 0.04 R ⊙ ) is in conflict with the spectral type (R &gt; 1.25 R ⊙ ) and the light curve fit (R ∼ 1.9 R ⊙ ). Releasing the synchronism assumption appears to be the most likely possibility taking into account the quite large period (8.6 days). In that case all the parameters are coherent and well determined. The radius and temperature obtained would put OGLE-TR-34 at the evolved edge of the F main sequence. It is possible that the radius increase at the end of the main-sequence stage has been too rapid to allow synchronization to keep pace, so that the conservation of angular momentum has slowed the rotation down to the observed value. Alternatively, the star could be too young for synchronization to have taken place yet given the 8.6 days period. OGLE-TR-55: The rotation velocity shows synchronization with the orbital period. The light curve, however, does not constrain the parameters with enough accuracy to confine the value of the impact parameter b. Because of the large line broadening caused by the high rotation velocity, our spectral type analysis yields only a broad estimate of the spectral type: F5-G8. The uncertainties on the resulting values r and m are correspondingly large. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.

(2002a)</ref>, which reveals that both the eclipse and anti-eclipse of comparable magnitude were visible in the light curve. The rotation velocities show synchronous rotation on both components. The M sin i of both components are computed from the radial velocity curve, the R sin i from the rotation velocity and period, and the i angle from the light curve. The eclipse has to be grazing because the components are of similar size and the depth of the eclipse is only a few percent. This constraint alone fixes sin i within a very small interval. All parameters are therefore determined with very high accuracy, showing that OGLE-TR-8 is a G-G grazing binary. OGLE-TR-35: The spectroscopic data show that this target is a double-line binary with a period double that given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a)</ref>. Therefore, both the eclipse and antieclipse are visible in the light curve. As for OGLE-TR-8, the combination of the radial velocity orbits, the two rotation velocity and the transit depth fix all the parameters very precisely. OGLE-TR-35 is a F-F grazing binary.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Planetary transits, unsolved cases and false positives</head><p>Six of our targets show radial velocity variations lower than 1 km s −1 , or comparable with the error bars, indicating the possibility that the transit signal is caused by a planet-mass companion. Of these however, only one exhibits the signature of a clear orbital motion -the known planetary system OGLE-TR-56 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Konacki et al. 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Torres et al. 2004a</ref>). For OGLE-TR-10, a planetary explanation is proposed. For 3 other targets, our data do not allow us to conclude but we strongly suspect a false positive transit detection as already examined in section 4.1. For OGLE-TR-58 we present strong evidence of a false positive transit detection. The orbital parameters we derived for the 6 candidates harboring low radial velocity variations OGLE-TR-10, 19, 48, 49, 56 and 58 are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig 9.</ref> For these candidates we fixed the period given and updated by the OGLE team.</p><p>OGLE-TR-10: This candidate was observed with UVES (white points) and FLAMES (black points). The UVES radial velocity was corrected from the offset velocity of  0.200 km s −1 as determined on OGLE-TR-12. Note that the two higher values of UVES were made under "unfavorable" seeing conditions (seeing lower than 0.9 arcsec) and are not taken into account afterward. The fit indicates an orbital signal with K = 81 ± 25 m s −1 which corresponds to a 0.66 ± 0.21 Jupiter mass companion. The reduced χ 2 is 2.3 for a constant velocity curve and 1.4 for a circular orbit. The analysis of the transit shape and the spectroscopic parameters lead to r = 1.54±0.12 R Jup . Such a planet, if confirmed, would have a density quite lower than HD209458. It is also quite interesting to note that OGLE-TR-10 presents an excess of metallicity, as it is well known that the planet-hosts discovered using radial-velocity techniques are, in average, significantly more metal-rich than average field dwarfs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Santos et al. 2001</ref>). In order to examine the possibility that the radial velocity variation is due to a blend scenario, we computed the CCF bisectors as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Santos et al. (2002)</ref>. We did not find any significant bisector effect in the CCF. We also checked the influence of the cross-correlation mask used in the CCF computation and did not find any effect. However further observations are needed to confirm our hypothesis and a blend scenario could not completely be excluded considering the low SNR of our data. Both our observations and the possibility of a blend scenario are in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Konacki et al. (2003b)</ref>. OGLE-TR-19: The phase-folded Doppler measurements indicates a significant variation. The reduced χ 2 is 2.3 for a constant velocity curve and 0.7 for a circular orbit. The fit gives an orbit with K = 146±48 m s −1 which correspond to a 1.2 ± 0.4 Jupiter mass companion. The rotation velocity is comparable with the instrumental broadening, so that synchronous rotation is excluded. The analysis of the transit shape gives r = 0.343 and b in the range [0.79-1.09]. The spectroscopic parameters indicate R = 1.46 ± 0.16 R ⊙ and M = 0.92 ± 0.05 M ⊙ , implying r = 4.9 ± 1.1 R Jup . Such a radius is much larger than any planet model would predict, and reinforces the odds against the planetary explanation. A single star blended with a background eclipsing binary would probably explain the data more convincingly. Our bisectors analysis, limited by the high uncertainties, cannot For OGLE-TR-10, black and white points correspond respectively to FLAMES and UVES measurements. Encircled points correspond to measurements made with a seeing lower than 0.9 arcsec. For OGLE-TR-56, black, white and dotted cross points correspond respectively to FLAMES, <ref type="bibr">HARPS and Torres et al. (2004a)</ref> measurements. For OGLE-TR-10, 19 and 56, the dotted lines correspond to fit curves for lower and upper 1-sigma intervals in semi-amplitude K.</p><p>exclude such a scenario. Alternatively, we note that only two transits were observed for this candidates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>), which puts OGLE-TR-19 among the less secure transit candidates. The "false positive" transit detection could not be excluded and only additional photometric and Doppler measurements will allow a definitive conclusion. OGLE-TR-48: The spectroscopic data reveal that this target is a very rapid rotator, with V rot &gt; 100 km s −1 . Consequently, only very approximate radial velocities could be computed from the spectra on only half of the spectra. These measurements do not show significant variations within the ∼ 10 km s −1 accuracy. The rotation is not synchronous with the transit period for any reasonable value of the primary radius. We suspect that this very high rotation indicates a A or early F star and considering the radius ratio of about 0.14, it seems unlikely that the transit could be due to a planetary companion. The upper limit on the radial velocity variations exclude a companion with mass larger than ∼ 0.15M ⊙ . However, because only two partial transits were observed in the light curve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>), it is not possible to be confident at this stage in the validity of the transit period. The most likely explanation is that one or both detected transits are spurious. OGLE-TR-49: No velocity variation in phase with the transit period and no synchronous rotation are observed for this candidate. The reduced χ 2 is 1.6 for a constant velocity curve. Only two transits were observed in the light curve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>), which puts OGLE-TR-49 among the less secure transit candidates. The interval between the two transits is ∆T = 21.52 days (8 times the period proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al. 2002b</ref>). If we adopt this largest period, radial velocity gives K &lt; 200 m s −1 . The transit is poorly defined and the uncertainties on the transit parameters are large. The spectroscopic parameters do not allow strong constraint on the mass and radius of the primary. Our data can unfortunately not exclude a planetary companion nor an explanation in terms of a background eclipsing binary.</p><p>However, inspection of the light curve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>) favors an explanation in terms "false positive" transit detection. OGLE-TR-56: This candidate was observed with FLAMES (black points) and the HARPS spectrograph (white points). The phase-folded Doppler measurements indicate a clear variation. The reduced χ 2 is 9.1 for a constant velocity curve and 1.1 for a circular orbit. The fit gives an orbit with K = 212 ± 22 m s −1 which correspond to a 1.18 ± 0.13 Jupiter mass companion. The analysis of the transit shape and the spectroscopic parameters lead to r = 1.25 ± 0.09 R Jup . We do not find any bisector effect in the CCF nor influence of the cross-correlation mask used. Our characterization of OGLE-TR-56b is in agreement (within the error bars) with the revised value given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Torres et al. (2004a)</ref> and clearly confirm the planetary nature of this object. OGLE-TR-58: This target shows no radial velocity variation and no synchronous rotation. The reduced χ 2 is 1.0 for a constant velocity curve. The suspicion of a spurious transit signal in the light curve is even stronger as for the previous objects, because the signal detection confidence is the lowest of the whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al. ( , 2002b</ref>) sample, and the light curve shows obvious signs of variability to the level of the hundredth of magnitude. As already noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Konacki et al. (2003b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sirko &amp; Paczynski (2003)</ref>, the mean level has increased by 0.02 mag between one season and the next. Only two possible transits were detected, one in a night showing a clear increase of flux before the transit -so that the average flux over the night is not lower than the normal level for OGLE-TR-58 -and the other consisting of a whole night at lower flux, not a very constraining transit signal (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>). We therefore conclude that OGLE-TR-58 is a "false positive" of the transit detection algorithm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref> summarizes all the available information derived for our objects following our procedure described in section 4.4. The variety of cases encountered in our sample of eighteen objects is striking and covers a large part of the bestiary of possible contaminations in the search for planetary transits. Target OGLE-TR-5, 6, 7, 12, 17, 18, 34, and 55 have clear resolved orbits of eclipsing binaries with a large F/G primary and a small M transiting companion. OGLE-TR-8 and 35 have clear resolved orbits of equal-mass, grazing eclipsing binaries. OGLE-TR-33 and 59 have resolved orbits of eclipsing binaries in a hierarchical triple system. OGLE-TR-56 shows small radial velocity variations in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Torres et al. (2004a)</ref> which confirm the planetary nature of the transiting companion. OGLE-TR-10 shows small radial velocity variations which could be due to planetary companion. OGLE-TR-19, 48 and 49 are unfortunately not yet solved but we strongly suspect false positive transit detections. OGLE-TR-58 shows no radial velocity variations and its light curve presents clear indication that the detected photometric signal is not a bona fide transit. Note that in some cases (OGLE-TR-12, 17 and 59), the initial period identified from the light curve was not correct and that in many cases our secondary radius are very different from the initial value of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Udalski et al. (2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Udalski et al. ( , 2002b</ref>. Our study has yielded precise radii and masses for a certain number of low mass star companions. The mass-radius relation for these objects is given in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>. We note that no brown-dwarves were detected in our sample in agreement with the so-called brown dwarf desert for the short period companions. No stellar companions were detected in the mass domain 0.6-1.0 M ⊙ due to the fact that we selected in priority the smallest candidates of the OGLE survey. OGLE-TR12, 17 and 55 (white points) needs additional photometric measurements in order to properly constrain the impact parameter b of the transits. For the other 5 low mass star transiting companions, the precision on the radius and mass determination are respectively on the range 4.5-10% and 7-13%. This precision is not at the level needed to provide a crucial test of stellar physics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andersen 1991)</ref>. However the empirical Mass-Radius relation remains poorly constrained due to the lack of observations of M-type eclipsing binaries. These 5 new candidates significantly increase the number of known M-type eclipsing binaries and give new observational constraints on models. For comparison we added on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref> the three known M-type eclisping binaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Metcalfe et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Torres &amp; Ribas 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, Ribas 2003</ref>. Although characterized with a significatively lower accuracy, our 5 low mass stars seems to follow the same departure from models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>The OGLE fields are very crowded, and some of the targets are expected to be contaminated by background stars (or foreground fainter stars). Extrapolating the density of bright stars to fainter magnitudes indicates that there may be on average  1.4 contaminants stars per object down to ∆mag = 6. Bright contaminant would be detected by the spectroscopy, but faint contaminants can go unnoticed and contribute a few percent to the light curve. This makes the photometric transit depth shallower, leading to an underestimation of r. Note that this effect is seeing dependent.</p><p>The effect of different assumptions on limb darkening on the derivation of the parameters from the light curve were verified using OGLE-TR-6 (central transit) and OGLE-TR-55 (grazing eclipse). Changing u1+u2 by 0.2 leads to a difference of the order of 2% on r and on V T /R, while removing the limb darkening entirely changes r and V T /R by ∼ 8%. We also test the effect of changing the limb darkening law in the derivation of the rotation velocity from the CCF. Using coefficients u1+u2 = 0.3 instead of u1+u2 = 0.6 modifies V rot sin i by about 3%.</p><p>This program illustrates the capability of ground-based spectrographs like FLAMES, UVES and HARPS to follow the faint transiting candidates found by photometric surveys. It demonstrates the usefulness of such a Doppler follow-up in order to discriminate among a large sample of possible contaminations in the search for planetary systems. We used in average only 2.5 hours of observing time per object, thanks essentially to the very high efficiency of the FLAMES multifibers facility. Our analysis shows that a large part of the transiting candidates could be rejected even a priori through a finetuned light curve analysis (confidence factor, sinusoidal variations and transit shape). It is also clear that more accurate measurements in both photometry and radial velocity will be very useful in order to provide stronger constraints on the mass and radius of transiting companions, especially for the suspected planetary system OGLE-TR-10, for the unsolved cases OGLE-TR-19 and 49 and for the unconstrained radius of the companions of OGLE-TR-12, 17 and 55.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The discovery of HD209458 by both Doppler measurements (Mazeh et al. 2000) and photometric transit (Charbonneau et Send offprint requests to: Francois.Bouchy@oamp.fr ⋆ Based on observations collected with the UVES and FLAMES spectrographs at the VLT/UT2 Kueyen telescope (Paranal Observatory, ESO, Chile: program 70.C-0209 and 71.C-0251)</figDesc></figure>
