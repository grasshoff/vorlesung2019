				<p>Context. In the context of the space-based mission CoRoT, devoted to asteroseismology and search for planet transits, we analyse the accuracy of fundamental stellar parameters (mass, radius, luminosity) that can be obtained from aster-oseismological data. Aims. Our work is motivated by the large uncertainties on planetary radius determination of transiting planets which are mainly due to uncertainties on the stellar parameters. Our goal is to analyse uncertainties of fundamental stellar parameters for a given accuracy of oscillation frequency determination. Methods. We generate grids of equilibrium models of stars and compute their pulsation spectra based on a linear nona-diabatic stability analysis. Using differents methods of comparison of oscillation mode spectra, we derive uncertainties on fundamental stellar parameters and analyse the effect of varying the number of considered modes. Results. The limits obtained depend strongly on the adapted method to compare spectra. We find a degeneracy in the stellar parameter solutions, up to a few % in mass (from less than 1% to more than 7% depending on the method used and the number of considered modes), luminosity (from 2% to more than 10%) or radius (from less than 1% to 3%), for a given pulsation spectrum.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The successful launching of CoRoT produces data for transiting exoplanets with unprecedented accuracy compared to ground-based observations, providing a measure of planetary mass and radius and thus information on the mean density and bulk composition of exoplanets. Unfortunately, a remaining source of uncertainty on the planetary parameters (mass and radius) is due to uncertainties on the stellar parameters.</p><p>The precise determination of gravity by spectroscopy is difficult, and particularly for F stars. The determination of the mass of the star is the main uncertainty on the planet's size. This uncertainty on the mass is generally about 10% (i.e 3% on the radius and 10% on the density). This may be of importance to disantangle a massive planet from a brown dwarf, as in the case of the recently discovered "super-Jupiter" CoRoT-Exo-3b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Leconte et al. 2009</ref>). It may also prevent distinguishing an ocean planet from an earth-like planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Grasset et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>Our goal is to examine the accuracy on the latter parameters , namely mass, luminosity and radius, that could be obtained using asteroseismology with the expected accuracy on oscillation frequencies of CoRoT. We explore the space of stellar parameters, in terms of mass, effective temperature, luminosity, metallicity and mixing length parameter and we analyse the sensitivity of predicted spectrum of oscillation frequencies to these parameters. Adopting variSend offprint requests to: C. Mulet-Marquis, S.Aigrain ous levels of stellar noise and white noise, we analyse the frequency uncertainty for oscillation modes of a given amplitude and lifetime. This analysis is based on the performances of CoRoT in the Asteroseismology and Planet Finder channels described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Auvergne et al. (2009)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Stars studied</head><p>Among all the transiting systems discovered so far, the large difference between the fundamental parameters of XO-3 given by Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Krull et al. (2008)</ref> (M=1.41 ± 0.08 M ⊙ ; R=2.13 ± 0.21 R ⊙ ) and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Winn et al. (2008)</ref> (M=1.213 ± 0.066 M ⊙ ; R=1.377 ± 0.083 R ⊙ ) was a strong motivation to examine how accurately fundamental parameters of a star (mass, radius, luminosity) can be constrained by asteroseismology. In this preliminary study, we first analyse stars with characteristics close to the ones of XO-3 (M ∼ 1.4 M ⊙ , R ∼ 1.5 R ⊙ , Teff ∼ 6400 K). We focus on modes with low order l (0 ≤ l ≤ 3) and radial order n between 5 and 20.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Frequency computation</head><p>The pulsation calculations are performed with a nonradial code originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lee (1985)</ref> and based on a linear non-adiabatic stability analysis. The equations are linearised around hydrostatic equilibrium, and eigenfunctions are expressed with spherical harmonics Y lm . The eigenfrequencies are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">σ = σ r + iσ i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with σ r the oscillation frequency and σ i the damping rate (if positive) or growth rate (if negative) (see details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mulet-Marquis et al. 2007</ref>, and references therein). The system of equations is solved with a Henyey-type relaxation method. Stellar structure models are calculated using the Livermore opacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Iglesias, Rogers, 1996)</ref>. The number of gridpoints of the equilibrium models (4000 gridpoints) is high enough for the uncertainty on the frequency determination by the linear code to be less than the accuracy expected from CoRoT for a pulsation mode with an infinite lifetime and observed for 150 days (i.e 0.1 µHz).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Accuracy of frequency determination</head><p>The photometric performance of CoRoT, described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Auvergne et al. (2009)</ref>, allows for the detection and characterisation of Sun-like oscillations of bright (6 &lt; V &lt; 9) stars in the asteroseismology (AS) channel, and larger amplitude red giant pulsations on fainter (V &gt; 11.5) stars in the planet finding (PF) channel.</p><p>The precision to which mode frequencies can be determined depends on the mode lifetime Γ, the duration T of the dataset, the mode amplitude A and the background, power density B (including stellar and white noise) at the frequency of the mode. In the case of both Sun-like and red giant oscillations, mode lifetimes are of the order of a few days ( <ref type="bibr">Fletcher et al. 2006</ref>), much shorter than a typical CoRoT run (21 or 150 days). We therefore use the formula given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Libbrecht (1992)</ref> for the case where Γ ≪ T to estimate the frequency uncertainty σ ν as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">σ 2 ν = f (β) Γ 4πT ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β = B/A is the inverse signal-to-noise ratio, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (β) = (1 + β) 1/2 (1 + β) 1/2 + β 1/2 3</formula><p>As is common practice in asteroseismology (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kallinger et al. 2009</ref> and references therein), we model B as a sum of broken power-laws of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">B(ν) = i a i 1 + (2πb i ν) ci + d<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where each term in the sum corresponds to the stellar variability associated with a particular type of surface structure (typically active regions and granulation, with in some cases a super-granulation component), a i is the amplitude, b i the characteristic time-scale, and c i the slope of term i, and d represents the white noise.</p><p>As a proxy for the background signal produced by a typical star in which one might search for Sun-like oscillations, we fit a 3-component background (following Eq. 3) to total solar irradiance data obtained by the VIRGO/PMO6 radiometer on the SoHO satellite during a 5-month period close to the last solar activity cycle maximum (for details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aigrain et al. 2004</ref>). We then added white noise at the level expected for a bright (V = 6) star in the CoRoT asteroseismology (AS) channel (all white noise values from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Auvergne et al. 2009</ref>). The resulting background power density spectrum is shown as the thick solid line in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, over the frequency range where oscillations are expected. We also constructed a less favourable case by scaling up the solar background by a factor of 10 (this is not unreasonable, as the Sun is generally thought to be a relatively quiet star) and adding white noise corresponding to a V = 8 star observed by CoRoT (thick dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Finally we also constructed a red-giant case by visually estimating the power density spectrum parameters for such an object from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kallinger et al. (2009)</ref> and adding white noise corresponding to a V = 12 star observed by CoRoT (thick dash-dot line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). The adopted background power density parameters are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We then computed frequency uncertainties as a function of mode frequency, using Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analysis of theoretical oscillation spectra</head><p>We first generate a coarse grid of equilibrium stellar models with various values of mass (1.35 ≤ M M⊙ ≤ 1.45, δM M⊙ = 0.01), luminosity (0.55 ≤ log( L L⊙ ) ≤ 0.65, δ(log( L L⊙ )) = 0.01) and effective temperature (6300K ≤ T ef f ≤ 6500K, δT ef f = 25K). A refined grid is then generated around the stellar parameters which predict close pulsation spectra, according to the results obtained from the coarse grid. On this refined grid (δ(log( L L⊙ )) = 0.005 , δT ef f = 10K, but constant mass because of time computation), we also vary the mixing-length parameter (1.6 ≤ α MLT ≤ 1.8, δ α MLT = 0.05), the metallicity and helium content Y He (0.26 ≤ Y He ≤ 0.28, δY He = 0.005) of the equilibrium model. For this preliminary study, the metallicity Z is varied between Z = 4.10 −3 and Z = 0.02. In a forthcoming study, we plan to include a finer grid for the stellar mass and models with over-solar metallicities.</p><p>We use two methods for the comparison between pulsation spectra computed from two different sets of stellar parameters:</p><p>-the maximum difference of the frequencies δν of the spectra for given values of the radial order n and of the degree l of the mode, -the maximum difference of the large separation ∆ν = ν n,l − ν n−1,l or small separation δν 02 = ν n,0 − ν n−1,2 , ( <ref type="bibr">Kjeldsen et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A comparison of these two methods is given below.</p><p>3.1. Effect of the mixing length parameter α MLT and of the metallicity Z</p><p>We examine the effect of the mixing length parameter α MLT on the spectra in the following way : we fix M , L, T ef f , Y He and Z and compute, for a given mode (n, l), the difference dν between the frequency for a value of α MLT and the frequency for a reference value of α MLT (in this case α MLT,ref = 1.7). The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. We performed a similar exercise to estimate the effect of the metallicity Z. The results are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> using a reference value for the metallicity Z ref =0.01. Our preliminary tests show that a variation of α MLT or of Z, within reasonable values, can yield a variation of the frequency of a given mode of several µHz. These effects need to be investigated in a more systematic study, which we plan for a forthcoming work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Comparison between abolute values of frequencies</head><p>For a given relative mass difference δM/M , the minimum value δν min of δν is determined in the coarse grid. The value of δν min depends on the number of considered modes. We vary this number from 4 (one mode for each value of 0 ≤ l ≤ 3) to 60 (15 modes for each value of 0 ≤ l ≤ 3). The variation of δν min with δM/M , for different numbers of considered modes, is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 4</ref>. The same procedure is applied for a given luminosity difference δL/L or a given radius difference δR/R. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 6</ref> respectively. As expected, the larger the mass/luminosity/radius difference, the larger the spectra difference. Similarly, the   larger the number of considered modes, the larger the spectra difference. These trends are the same on the refined grid, but the values for δν min are much smaller. If we focus on the mass difference, for instance for 40 modes, and δM/M = 0.06, δν min decreases from 3.4 µHz on the coarse grid to 0.6 µHz on the fine grid, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>. The effect is similar for the luminosity difference (for 40 modes, and δL/L = 0.06, δν min decreases from 2.4 µHz on the coarse grid to 0.5 µHz on the fine grid) or the radius difference (for 40 modes, and δR/R = 0.03, δν min decreases from 6.4 µHz on the coarse grid to 1.0 µHz on the fine grid). Since we cannot freely refine the grid because of computing time, the values obtained for δν min on the refined grid may be overestimated : we cannot exclude that a finer grid gives smaller values of δν min .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Large and small separation</head><p>Many asteroseismological studies do not directly compare the pulsation frequencies of two stars but rather compare the large and small separations. For this second method, we define the difference δ sls between two spectra as the maximum value of the large separation or of the small separation (the highest value is retained). The results for the coarse grid, for the mass difference δM/M with 60 considered modes, are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. δ sls is about a factor of two lower than δν. For the luminosity difference, δ sls is also about a factor of two smaller than δν. For the radius difference, δ sls is about a factor of three lower than δν.</p><p>As in paragraph 3.2, the same behaviour is found when using the fine grid for a given δM/M , δL/L or δR/R. The results corresponding to a given δM/M are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.  9</ref>. We also examined a third method, where the difference &lt; δ sls &gt; between two spectra is defined as the difference between the mean large separation or the mean small separation (the highest value is retained). We did not find this method relevant in the present context (&lt; δ sls &gt; is found to be negligible for small values of δM/M , δL/L or δR/R in the grids studied).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>The results obtained in §3 enable us to derive the accuracy of the stellar parameters mass M, luminosity L and radius R determined from asteroseismological data. The accuracy for one parameter is obtained letting all the other parameters remain free. According to §2.3, we adopt the values of 0.2 µHz and 0.3 µHz respectively for the precision of frequency determination based on the CoRoT performances. The smaller value is for a red giant in the PF channel and the larger value corresponds to the accuracy obtained for a Sun-like star in the AS channel (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>The results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 2, 3</ref> and 4 for an accuracy of the frequency determination of 0.2 µHz, and in tables 5, 6 and 7 for an accuracy of the frequency determination of 0.3 µHz. The most stringent constraint is provided by the method using δν. For Sun-like stars as observed in the AS channel, our analysis suggests for instance an uncertainty for the mass as large as 5% if only 20 modes are considered (for the closest models, effective temperatures are compatible within 60K, and radii and luminosities differ by ∼ 2%). With the method based on δ sls , an uncertainty of 5% for the mass remains for up to 50 considered modes (for the closest models, effective temperatures are compatible within 60K, radii differ by 3% and luminosities are equal).    Our work is a first step toward a more systematic study, as it only takes into account variations in the basic input physics of stellar models such as the mixing length parameter, the helium abundance and to a certain extent the metallicity. A more systematic analysis should also explore the effects of different convection models, of core overshoot-    ing and of rotation. These uncertainties in current stellar evolution theory will certainly increase the degeneracy of the pulsation spectra (i.e the limit on the mass, luminosity or radius mentioned above may be significantly larger). Moreover, we have not explored the effect of uncertainties in the stability analysis calculation, such as the sensitivity to boundary conditions. The large and small separations are expected to be less sensitive than absolute frequencies to boundary conditions used in the computation. Obviously, much additional works need to be done. Our work, however, provides an idea of the level of accuracy required by asteroseismological studies in order to improve exoplanet-   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
