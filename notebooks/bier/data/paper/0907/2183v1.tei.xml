				<p>Context. We search for new variable B-type pulsators in the CoRoT data assembled primarily for planet detection, as part of CoRoT&apos;s Additional Programme. Aims. We aim to explore the properties of newly discovered B-type pulsators from the uninterrupted CoRoT space-based photometry and to compare them with known members of the β Cep and slowly pulsating B star (SPB) classes. Methods. We developed automated data analysis tools that include algorithms for jump correction, light-curve detrending, frequency detection, frequency combination search, and for frequency and period spacing searches. Results. Besides numerous new, classical, slowly pulsating B stars, we find evidence for a new class of low-amplitude B-type pul-sators between the SPB and δ Sct instability strips, with a very broad range of frequencies and low amplitudes, as well as several slowly pulsating B stars with residual excess power at frequencies typically a factor three above their expected g-mode frequencies. Conclusions. The frequency data we obtained for numerous new B-type pulsators represent an appropriate starting point for further theoretical analyses of these stars, once their effective temperature, gravity, rotation velocity, and abundances will be derived spectroscopically in the framework of an ongoing FLAMES survey at the VLT.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the forthcoming months and years, the French-European Space mission CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Auvergne et al. 2009</ref>), will measure brightness variations of tens of thousands of different stars in its exoplanet programme, with a precision typically two orders of magnitude better than we can achieve from ground-based observations today. This means that we are able to extend the sample of known pulsating stars to class members with fainter apparent magnitude.</p><p>Send offprint requests to: P. Degroote ⋆ The CoRoT space mission was developed and is operated by the French space agency CNES, with the participation of ESA's RSSD and Science Programmes, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain. All frequency tables, including the identification of combination frequencies, are only available as online material ⋆⋆ Postdoctoral Researcher, Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique -FNRS, Belgium ⋆⋆⋆ Postdoctoral Fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders</p><p>The study of stellar oscillations from the exoplanet data of the mission is part of the Additional Programme ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Weiss et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on CoRoT's Initial Run in the anticentre direction of the Galaxy (IRa01). We first describe our methods of analysis, as future runs will also be addressed with the same methodology. During IRa01, which lasted some 55 days, the CoRoT satellite was pointed at a field in the galactic plane, towards the galactic anticentre (α ≈ 06 h 44 m, δ ≈ −01 • 12 ′ ). We are focusing on the β Cep stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stankov &amp; Handler 2005)</ref> and slowly pulsating B stars (SPBs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Waelkens 1991)</ref> discovered in this field. A short descriptive overview of the main properties of these two classes is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. There is a small overlap between their instability regions, where hybrid pulsators of spectral type near B3, exhibiting both highorder g and low-order p modes, are predicted but not yet observed. On the other hand, these two types of modes have been observed in hotter β Cep stars (ν Eri: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Handler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">12 Lac: Handler et al. 2006</ref>; γ Peg: <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chapellier et al. 2006</ref>). The mechanism that drives the pulsations is the κ mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dziembowski &amp; Pamiatnykh 1993</ref>) because of the Fe-group <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Overview of the main properties of β Cep and SPB pulsators.</p></div>

It would be a huge loss of resources to start analysing all stars in the CoRoT database only to study the B-type pulsators. Therefore, we resort to the results obtained in the framework of the variability classification programme described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Debosscher et al. (2009)</ref>, hereafter termed CVC, which extracts a basic number of relevant parameters from each light curve to compare them with training sets of stars of known type.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on all light curves given a label of either β Cep or an SPB star. We also include the δ Sct and γ Doradus stars to limit the red edge of the SPB instability strip and to discuss possible overlap between β Cep and δ Sct stars, on the one hand, and between SPB and γ Doradus stars on the other, in terms of light curve properties (e.g., frequency values). In total, 540 light curves are extracted. We emphasise that the results from the CVC classifier are only used to select the initial sample of stars from the CoRoT database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Description of the dataset and pre-processing</head><p>All datasets are taken over a period of 55 d. Two time samplings occur, one measurement every ∼ 32 s or one every ∼ 512 s. This sampling is not always constant for one light curve, it may change from low temporal resolution to high temporal resolution during the observing run. The magnitudes of the stars in the sample lie between 12.1 and 16.6 and vary over different scales ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>To have an idea of the different kinds of instrumental effects we can expect, as well as their impact on the analysis, we analysed 100 constant stars and averaged their Fourier periodogram. They were selected with the criterion that their dominant frequency has a p-value &gt; 0.01. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> we can identify at least three different groups of features: a low-frequency powerlaw trend due to instrumental drifts (red noise), which becomes negligible around 0.4 d −1 , peaks at 1, 2, and 4 d −1 and peaks connected with the orbital frequency due to temperature changes. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Auvergne et al. (2009)</ref> for a discussion of the origin of these instrumental peaks and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Samadi et al. (2006)</ref> for The inset is a zoom on the low-frequency region. A lowfrequency powerlaw trend is present, as are the 1 and 2 day alias and the orbital frequency with many of its harmonics and day aliases.</p><p>a description of the CoRoT data pipeline and treatment of data during the passage of the South Atlantic Anomaly.</p><p>The most variable feature is the low-frequency powerlaw trend, because of which we introduced a pre-processing step to minimise its potential influence. Two phenomena add up to this trend: discontinuities in the light curve and long-term effects, possibly of instrumental origin. It is impossible to decide whether or not these longterm trends are real variations in the star's light curve, but because we do encounter trends suspiciously linear or exponential, we choose to eliminate them. This also means that we effectively remove possible oscillating behaviour and intrinsic trends on the timescale of the time series itself.</p><p>Long-term trends are removed in the following iterative way. First, jumps are detected by sliding two adjacent bins over the lightcurve. Physically, we only expect to find a gradual, continuous rise or decay in the measured flux. To accomodate for the dependence of amplitude and present pulsations, we compare the difference between the average of the bins to the overall difference. If at any point the difference is too high to be considered continuous, as defined by the entire light curve, we identify the point as a discontinuity, perform a piecewise detrending of the two separate parts of the lightcurve and try to detect other jumps. If no more jumps are detected, the piecewise detrending is redone using the original light curve and the discontinuities previously detected. There is some arbitrariness in the choice of parameters (bin width, threshold value etc.), so they were fixed empirically. For the piecewise detrending, the best fit of three simple models was chosen for each part; either a linear, a quadratic, or an exponential trend. An example is provided in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Basic treatment</head><p>To analyse all jump-corrected and detrended light curves, we describe the flux F(t) as <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Correction of one discontinuity in the light curve of SPB candidate 102815542. The first part and second parts were detrended using a quadratic polynomial and exponential decay model, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F(t i ) = µ + C + n i=1 A i sin(2π( f i t + φ i )) + ǫ i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ǫ i is a Gaussian noise component, µ the observed average flux level, and C a usually small correction parameter on µ. In this model, there are n nonlinear parameters f i , for which the values are estimated using the Lomb-Scargle version of the discrete Fourier transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lomb 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Scargle 1982)</ref>. The linear parameters A i and φ i describe the amplitude and the phase of the corresponding pulsation, respectively, and are estimated by ordinary least squares regression. The error on the frequency determination (and other parameters) is calculated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Montgomery &amp; O'Donoghue (1999)</ref>. These error determinations underestimate the real error because of correlation effects in the data. In our sample, this factor lies between 1 and 4 for the first frequency, and decreases for subsequent frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schwarzenberg-Czerny 2003)</ref>. Traditionally, the frequency acceptance criterion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Breger et al. (1993)</ref>, using a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) lower limit of SNR = 4 in the amplitude periodogram for a peak to be considered genuine, has been proven to be very successful, since very few frequencies identified this way (if at all) had to be refuted afterwards. However, there is no rule about how large one has to choose the interval in the periodogram to use for noise calculation. Second, this method is not suited to detecting regions of power excess, either due to densely packed frequencies or stochastically excited frequencies. Third, related to the previous argument, the SNR method does not guarantee that, if a peak is considered as due to noise, there is no other, possibly even smaller, peak in the periodogram that is not noise. Therefore, the SNR method is not fully objective in its use.</p><p>Instead of using the classical SNR criterion, we make an assumption on what the datasets should look like when devoid of instrumental effects and variability from the star itself. A reasonable (yet not perfect) assumption is that we are dealing with white Gaussian noise and that the number of datapoints is large. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Degroote et al. (2009)</ref> provide an extensive discussion of the deviation from white Gaussian noise and have shown that it can be ignored in the frequency analysis, as long as a correction factor for correlated data is used. Under this assumption, the distribution of the Scargle power spectrum (normalised with the total variance of the data) belongs to the exponential family <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Scargle 1982)</ref>, and thus the noise level is located at a height of z = 1. In reality, we never test a single frequency, but cover a wide range of possible frequencies, between 0 and the highest detectable frequency, the Nyquist frequency f Ny . In theory, this number is well-defined regardless of the time spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eyer &amp; Bartholdi 1999</ref>). In practice, however, this frequency is usually too high to be of any use (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Koen 2006</ref>). A better practical guess for the Nyquist frequency in uneven time sampling is obtained via</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(z) = exp(−z),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">f Ny = 1 2∆t ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with ∆t in our case the value of the larger timesteps.</p><p>To account for the simultaneous testing of all frequencies up to f Ny , we apply the Bonferroni correction (Scargle 1982) to Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P B (z) = 1 − [1 − exp(z)] N i .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For equally spaced data, theory predicts that the number of independent frequencies N i between 0 en f Ny scales with the number of observations N obs as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N i = 2N obs .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In the case of unevenly spaced data, this parameters N i loses its meaning (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frescura et al. 2008</ref>). However, a simulation study shows that expression (5), combined with definition (3), turns out to be a useful and conservative approximation of the true number of independent frequencies. For eight different time templates taken from a CoRoT light curve, we generated 10 000 light curves consisting of white Gaussian noise. Next, we calculated the height z of the maximum peak in the Scargle periodogram. These were combined, and a false alarm function of the form (4) fitted through the data, to determine the free parameter N i . The result can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, and shows that the CoRoT data allow the use of Eq. (5). Although the sampling rate is usually much higher than strictly needed, we choose not to rebin the data or to convert the flux to magnitude, because such manipulations alter the shape of a light curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Search for combination frequencies</head><p>In particular cases, model (1) can be expanded further to lower the number of dependent parameters and thus simplify the model in terms of f i . Neglecting this effect implies imposing a linear model on all observed light curves, thus treating every found pulsation frequency as an independent mode. Identifying dependent frequencies can be seen as a basic correction of the linear model for nonlinear effects:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F(t) = µ + C + n f k=1 A k sin[2π( f k t i + φ k )] + m f l=1 A l sin[2π( f l t i + φ l )]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f l = n 1 l f 1 l + n 2 l f 2 l + n 3 l f 3 l ,</formula><p>where n f &lt; n and f l represent combination frequencies.

In model (6), the linear parameters still have to be fitted, but are sometimes expected to be in phase or in anti-phase with each other. In contrast to the window frequencies, combination frequencies and harmonics are not artificially introduced, because they have a real physical interpretation. It is thus important to derive them.</p><p>The search for combination frequencies is done in the following way: for each frequency, the harmonics are identified using all empirically found frequencies with higher amplitude than the one under investigation. Those are then excluded from the list of independent frequencies. For the remaining frequencies, all second and third order combinations are tested, again using only the frequencies with higher amplitude, and not part of a combination so far (in order to avoid higher order 'combinations of combinations'). To keep the parameter space manageable, frequencies of order n are only considered if at least one of order (n−1) is previously identified. We are limited by the total time of observations, so there is some ambiguity in the choice of possible deviation from the exact combination. Because the Rayleigh limit of L R = 1/T is a natural measure of maximum uncertainty on the frequency determination, we consider this a reasonable value to test the presence of combinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Search for period and frequency spacings</head><p>The variability detected in SPB stars is interpreted as stemming from low degree, high-order modes whose periods are known to be sensitive to the structure of the stellar core. The first-order asymptotic approximation developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tassoul (1980)</ref> shows that the period spacing (∆P) between modes of consecutive order and same degree is constant and can be approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆P = 2π L 1 x 0 N x dx −1 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where L = [ℓ(ℓ + 1)] 1/2 (with ℓ the mode degree), x the normalized radius, x 0 corresponds to the boundary of the convective core and N the Brunt-Väisälä frequency. Moreover, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miglio et al. (2008)</ref>, deviations from a uniform period spacing are very sensitive probes of the chemical composition gradient in the star that develops near the edge of the convective core. A sound detection of period spacing in SPB stars would therefore allow direct inferences on the near-core structure of B stars. A theoretical estimate of the expected average ∆P for ℓ = 1 modes is reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>, where main-sequence models between 2.5 and 8 M ⊙ , computed with and without overshooting, are considered. We have to recall, however, that such a regular period spacing could be strongly affected by the effects of rotation on such long oscillation periods (see e.g.  for a discussion).</p><p>Analogously to the case of g-mode periods, a regular frequency spacing can occur for p modes. Other situations where a form of spacing can be found, is in frequency multiplets originating from stellar rotation, where deviations from the equidistance case can also occur. A systematic search for recurrent frequency/period spacings therefore represents a valuable tool for a theoretical interpretation of the large number and variety of pulsating stars detected by CoRoT. The total time span of 55 days for the Initial Run puts an upper limit of ∼ 0.02 d −1 on the frequency resolution. For rich SPB pulsators, the frequencies are expected to be densely packed, thus detecting period spacings may be difficult.</p><p>To detect spacings in a list of frequencies ( f 1 , . . . , f n ) or periods (P 1 , . . . , P n ), we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kawaler (1988)</ref> and the inverse variance test of O' <ref type="bibr">Donoghue (1994)</ref>. In addition, a third new test is proposed here. For the latter, we first construct a vector containing all possible differences between the periods. This way, we are left with a vector of length Binom(n, 2), and elements ∆ i j = |P i − P j |. For a test spacing ∆P, we calculate for each element of these entries ∆ i j ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">r = ∆ i j − ∆ i j ∆P ∆P,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ⌊x⌋ is the greatest integer smaller than x. We count the number s o of elements in the intervals</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">s o → [0, ǫ] ∪ [∆P − ǫ, ∆P]· P. Degroote et al.: Asteroseismology of B stars in CoRoT's Initial Run Exofield 5</formula><p>This number s captures the observed extreme values, which are defined through the customizable tolerance parameter ǫ. If we assume that these differences are uniformly distributed, we can express the expected number s e of extreme values by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">s e = 2ǫ ∆P n i .</formula><p>Application of the plain matrix test implies computation of the p value according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P(X i ∈ [0, ǫ] ∪ [∆P − ǫ, ∆P]) = ǫ ∆P .</formula><p>This test is appropriate if some periods are missing or not detected. However, we may prefer to only take those pairs into account for which the difference between the two members is exactly ∆P, and not a multiple. This we can do using the distinct number test. It works the same as the matrix test, except that we keep track of the term</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m = ∆ i j ∆P ∆P from Eq. (8).</formula><p>Only those spacings where m = 1 and r &lt; ǫ or where m = 0 and ∆P − r &lt; ǫ are considered as valid periodspacing candidates. The possible disadvantage of using this test is that we can end up with a lot of periods belonging to the same ∆P, but where no single triplet is detected. Of course, this can be an advantage as well, e.g., in the search for rotational splittings; the matrix distinct number test will detect doublets with the same spacing, far apart around different frequencies. Finally, if we are interested in the number of periods belonging to each test spacing ∆P, we can simply count the number of different periods belonging to each test spacing period set.</p><p>To illustrate the performance of these tests, we simulate a collection of periods, in which we have put 3 different spacings (in arbitrary units): ∆P 1 = 0.1315 (8 periods), ∆P 2 = 0.4332 (6 periods), and ∆P 3 = 0.3579 (3 periods). On top of that, we added 8 random periods, to arrive at a total number of 25 periods. We additionally allowed each period to deviate from the rigid spacing according to a random normal fluctuation of σ = 0.0005. The results of the different tests are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test locates only the most obvious period spacing, but suffers from a strong bifurcation artifact, already noticed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kawaler (1988)</ref>. The inverse variance test shows lack of power in this dense pack of periods; it is only able to detect a spacing of ∆P 1 /2. This contrasts to the matrix tests; their statistic is almost devoid of noise, and only show peaks at the true period spacings and their multiples. The matrix test and distinct number test show great similarity in their peak structure, because they have the same basic calculation method. The reason the matrix test favours the larger spacing ∆P 2 , although it has fewer members than ∆P 1 , is how we set up the statistic: we gave larger spacings less chance of happening.</p><p>Regardless of the succes of these tests, we must be careful in interpreting the results: because of the occurrence of other random periods, we may by chance pick up other pairs of periods with the same spacing, but totally unrelated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Additional StrömgrenStr¨Strömgren photometry</head><p>To determine the effective temperature T eff and gravity log g of the stars in the initial run, Strömgren photometry was obtained using the Wide Field Camera attached to the Isaac Newton Telescope at the La Palma observatory, Spain. Because of time constraints, no β index measurements could be obtained. This implied that we did not have a direct measurement of the gravity. We thus proceeded in an iterative way. First, we computed the dereddened photometric indices by using an appropriate spectral type for each of the pulsators: B2V for the candidate β Cep stars, B5V for the candidate SPBs, A2V for the δ Sct candidates, and F2V for the γ Dor candidates. Next, we used c 0 to predict the β index following the relation between these two quantities derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balona (1994)</ref> for main sequence stars. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balona (1994)</ref> has shown that this procedure has advantages over using the measured indices to compute β, due to imperfections in the calibrations. With these dereddened indices and β estimates, the effective temperatures and gravities were subsequently estimated, using Balona's (1994) calibration.</p><p>The procedure described above delivers an estimate of T eff and log g with an internal error, i.e., an error assuming that the dereddened input colours are error-free. It is well known, however, that this procedure for determining the fundamental parameters suffers from systematic uncertainties connected with the limitations of the model grids used to explain the behaviour of standard stars. To get a handle on these systematic errors, we also used the calibrations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moon &amp; Dworetsky (1985)</ref>, which are valid along the entire main sequence as well. The standard deviation between the values for T eff and log g derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balona's (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moon &amp; Dworetsky's (1985)</ref> calibrations was considered to be a good approximation of the systematic uncertainties, so these were added to the statistical errors.</p><p>As a test of the validity of the obtained fundamental parameters for the new B-type candidate pulsators, we placed all stars in the HRD and compared their position with the instability strips <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7)</ref>. The numerous new δ Sct stars match the classical instability strip perfectly, which gives us confidence that the estimates of T eff and log g obtained from our procedure are appropriate.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref> we see that the classification is very powerful for extracting candidate new pulsators from a large sample on the basis of white-light photometry alone (as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Debosscher et al. (2009)</ref>), but it is not perfectly reliable on the scale of individual stars. Moreover, we do not expect so many candidate β Cep stars compared to SPBs and δ Sct stars, considering the mass-dependence of the initial mass function and of main-sequence lifetimes: this implies that several of them might have a different character. We therefore decided to regroup all new candidate B stars in the sample, by using the T eff and log g information, along with the obtained frequency spectra. This additional classification should allow a better distinction between the classes of pulsators along the main sequence than just using the white-light photometry alone, since we add information on the fundamental parameters. The new clusters we obtain in this way are discussed by means of typical and atypical examples, some of which are shown in the text, while others are reported in the electronic Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Candidate pulsators situated between the SPB-and δ Sct instability strips</head><p>The most obvious result from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref> is undoubtedly the appearance of p-mode type variations (in terms of frequency values), not only far from the theoretical β Cep instability strip, but also outside any instability strip. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the CVC not containing classes of spotted or differentially rotating stars, or ellipsoidal variables. Unavoidably, the main frequency overlaps with the β Cep pulsation range for some of these stars. Moreover, many hot stars in our sample turn out to be good Be star candidates (Neiner, private communication). These are or will be studied and published elsewhere (  102922479, and to a lesser extent also the almost constant star CoRoT 102850576, have a well-structured frequency spectrum consisting of equally spaced frequencies <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. A.1</ref> in the Appendix). The results of the spacing tests and a time-frequency analysis of the detrended light curves are shown in Figs 8 and 9, and indicate that a spacing of ∼ 0.70 d −1 is common. The amplitude of the main peaks are of the order of 0.1%. The frequency range overlaps that of β Cep stars on the low side, but also reaches lower frequencies. The determined temperatures place all these stars consistently between the SPB and δ Sct instability strips.</p><p>CoRoT 102861067, 102790063, 102790331, 102729531, 102862454 and 102771057 constitute a second well-separated group. They share a complex frequency spectrum containing between ∼20 and ∼170 significant peaks spread over a wide range and amplitudes below 0.1%. Two examples are shown in Figs A.2 and A.3, while schematic oscillation spectra are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. A.4</ref> in the Appendix. Dense 'forests' of closely spaced peaks are identified around some frequencies. Based on the 55 days of photometric observations alone, it is hard to make the distinction between real multiplets and non-stationarity of the amplitudes.</p><p>Close to the δ Sct instability strip, there is another small group of multiperiodic variables: CoRoT 102933855, 102703484, 102850502, and 102816758. Although these stars have a rich frequency spectrum, they are different from the previous group because their spectrum shows more isolated frequencies with higher amplitudes (∼ 0.5%).

However, some of the stars on the red side of the SPB instability strip show variability on longer time scales (&lt; 4 d −1 ), e.g. Figs A.6 and A.7 in Appendix A. Not all of this periodic variability is sinusoidal or even approximately sinusoidal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">SPB candidate examples</head><p>As is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>, the SPB star candidates from the initial classification agree with their instability strip. The 15 clearest SPB candidates, in order of decreasing amplitude, from ∼ 1% to ∼ 0.2%, are <ref type="bibr">CoRoT 102844894, 102754851, 102728830, 102855391, 102739246, 102797587, 102938439, 102769848, 102848506, 102848506, 102956197, 102943966, 102968674</ref> and 102871668. Their effective temperature and gravity locates them well within the theoretical SPB instability strip. Besides the typical closely spaced g mode pulsations, we also find a resid-     pulsation range predicted for excited modes of ℓ &lt; 3 modes. The theoretical instability strip reaches the observed range of frequencies for modes with a higher ℓ value, but at the same time, disk-averaging effects reduce the observed amplitudes. For ℓ = 4, this reduction factor amounts to about 30, which is still above the CoRoT noise level for many of the SPB candidates, so we cannot exclude the higher observed frequencies being due to high-degree modes. We illustrate the nature of the observed variability for a prototype of these stars (CoRoT 102938439) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 14, 15</ref>, and 13. Other examples can be found in <ref type="bibr">Figs. A.9 to A.12)</ref>. After prewhitening all low frequencies, the largest feature in the amplitude spectrum turns out to be a collection of closely spaced peaks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 15)</ref>. At least two phenomena can cause these features: unresolved stable modes with a complex beating pattern, or time-dependent oscillation frequencies and/or amplitudes. In the first case, we expect a region with blended or nearly blended frequency peaks, without any amplitude structure. In the second case, we expect a frequency region with a peak at the excited frequency, and Lorentzian shape farther away from the central peak. When a residual light curve of these stars is constructed by prewhitening a nonlinear least squares fit of all frequencies below ∼1.5 d −1 , the same amplitude structure emerges for all of them, which points towards the same physical origin given that the pattern is not chaotic. The amplitudes of the detected modes are highly variable over time (see <ref type="bibr">Figs A.9 and A.10)</ref>. The observed features could come from modes with a finite lifetime or to nonlinear nonresonant distortion leading to time-dependent phenomena. An analysis of the evolution of the amplitudes shows that the period over which the modes appear and dissappear is of the order of one to a few days. Instead of a sinusoidal shape, the light curve maxima are narrower and sharper, while the minima are shallow and broad <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 13)</ref>. This is very similar to the light curves of some white dwarf pulsators and is explained by nonlinear effects for these objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Vuille et al. 2000)</ref>. We notice that a similar feature of disappearing and reappearing frequencies was also found in the Be star HD 49330 and was interpreted as the cause of an outburst <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huat et al. 2009</ref>). It could very well be that this is a general phenomenon at low amplitudes for B stars, but that it only leads to mass loss for the most rapid rotators among them.</p><p>A second manifestation of nonlinearity can be found in many detected combination frequencies. In contrast to the timedependent phenomenon described above, these are stable on the scale of the total time span, thus resulting in isolated frequency peaks in the spectra (see online frequency tables). A detailed description of these modes is difficult based on the short time span of the Initial Run and the long periods of these modes (&lt; 2 d −1 ), but will surely be possible for similar new pulsators in the CoRoT long run data.</p><p>Secondary good SPB star candidates include <ref type="bibr">CoRoT 102863407, 102752912, 102773435, 102917802, 102826973, 102838201, 102888003, 102915048, 102813396</ref>, and 102945383 of which the last four also show evidence for modes of finite lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Other variable objects</head><p>Brightness variations need not necessarily be due to pulsations (alone). For example, when two binaries are physically close to each other and the stars are of comparable luminosity and size, and the grazing eclipses can resemble one single, stable sinusoidal pulsation. A DFT analysis puts more power in the double frequency of the orbital frequency, folding both the primary and secondary eclipse onto each other. Therefore, close binaries with an orbital period roughly between 0.25 and 0.5 d −1 can easily be mistaken for a β Cep star, whereas a wider system can be misinterpreted as an SPB. Examples of close or contact binaries are <ref type="bibr">CoRoT 102725806, 102858055, 102876625, 102930503, 102784048, 102768686, 102732139, 102873761</ref>, and 102812372. The phase diagram of the first candidate, CoRoT 102725806, is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. We find an orbital frequency of f = 2.925(7) d −1 , independently confirmed with the phase dispersion minimization and information entropy method. The amplitude of the primary eclipse is A 1 = 8.56%, compared to the average flux level. The double system was mistaken for a single β Cep star by the CVC because of the small difference between the amplitude of the primary and secondary eclipse; A 1 − A 2 = 0.87%. The duration of the primary eclipse in phase units is P 1 ≈ 0.08, which is almost equal to the duration of the secondary eclipse, P 2 ≈ 0.10.</p><p>The possibility of a binary system and an SPB candidate are not mutually exclusive, because CoRoT 102918586, 102912741 and CoRoT 102793963 turn out to be candidate SPBs in close binaries, of which the latter shows a single sinusoidal variation, synchronised with the orbit of the binary. These systems in particular can be of interest for asteroseismology, because the binary orbit can help to constrain the mass and radius of the SPB star.</p><p>Another group of SPB candidates have frequencies in a very broad range, e.g. <ref type="bibr">CoRoT 10282445, 102764403, 102818535, 102816987, 102837646, 102804931, 102887852, 102930369, 102790135</ref>, and 102856178. CoRoT 10282445, for example, shows periodic variations with time scales around ∼ 1 d −1 , ∼ 4 d −1 and ∼ 15 d −1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 16)</ref>. The main frequency f 1 = 1.0411(7) d −1 can be connected to the third frequency f 3 = 1.1533(3) d −1 , resulting in a beating period of almost 10 days. The second frequency f 2 = 15.271(9) is connected to f 29 = 14.739(4) d −1 , and the same spacing of 0.52 d −1 is found throughout the whole frequency spectrum (Table A.1). Although the spacing connects the three main frequency regions where variability occurs, current stellar models do not offer any interpretation in terms of a single SPB, β Cep, or δ Sct star, while we can exclude contamination from nearby stars on the CCD. The possibility of a binary system consisting of a hybrid β Cep and a δ Sct remains, as well as the one of a triple system. Spectra will help us to unravel the exact cause of the variation in this light curve.</p><p>For a couple of light curves (CoRoT 102910610, 102968526, 102857565, and 102876625, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 17</ref>), spot models seem more appropriate for describing them than a pulsation model; the resemblance to simulated light curves of rotating spotted stars is indeed apparent (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Strassmeier &amp; Bopp 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lanza et al. 1993</ref>). Their frequency spectra agree with those models, and few frequencies are detected in a very narrow interval. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref> illustrates that it can be difficult to distinguish simple beating patterns from spot related variability. By assuming that the star rotates differentially like the Sun, the multiplet structure can be used to determine the level of differential rotation ∆Ω, e.g., for CoRoT 102968526, ∆Ω = 0.0538±0.0002 d −1 .

(2005)</ref>. All stellar models were computed with overshooting from the convective core (α OV = 0.2) and a mixing-length parameter α MLT = 2.0, both expressed in localpressure, scale-height units. OP opacity tables ( <ref type="bibr">Badnell et al. 2005</ref>) with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Asplund et al. (2005)</ref> metal mixture were adopted. We refer to <ref type="bibr">Miglio et al. (2007a,b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zdravkov &amp; Pamyatnykh (2008)</ref> for a detailed study of the effect of considering different opacity tables and metal mixtures on the excitation of pulsation modes in B-type stars. The distinct islands of instability populat-  ing the log T eff -Period diagram of Figs 19 correspond (from left to right) to β Cep-, SPB-, δ Sct-, and γ Dor-type pulsations.</p><p>Stars classified as SPBs are in overall agreement with the theoretically expected domain (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 7 and 19)</ref>, though in some cases with frequencies higher than those of a typical SPB star (which could be due to the strong effects of rotation on the periods of oscillation). On the other hand, several stars classified as β Cep are in the typical T eff instability domain of SPBs. These stars have frequency peaks in the β Cep frequency domain: their modes could be prograde SPB-type modes as proposed in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Saio et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of rotation may also affect the determination of T eff for a few stars that have a frequency spectrum resembling the one of fast-rotating SPBs but that, based on their position in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 19</ref>, are cooler than the red edge of the SPB instability strip (e.g. CoRoT 102833548 and 102729531). A more reliable spectroscopic T eff determination of these stars is thus needed to clarify the nature of these targets. Such spectroscopic data will become available in the next months.</p><p>The comparison with theoretical expectations will also greatly benefit from the determination of the number of pulsating B stars relative to all the B stars observed in CoRoT's IRa01 EXOfield. The absence of typical β Cep pulsators (in terms at the same time of frequency spectrum and T eff ) can be ascribed simply to the expected scarcity of early B-type stars in the field, following the initial mass function and stellar evolution models. This requires the determination of stellar parameters for a large number of stars and will be addressed in a future work. It is clear from these first general remarks that the relevance of CoRoT's photometric variability survey goes beyond the simple definition of instability domains of expected and known types of pulsators. Particular theoretical interest is provided by the unexpected variability detected in several targets on the red side of the SPB instability strip, a region where several claims of the detection of pulsations were made (the so-called "Maia" stars, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Scholz et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aerts &amp; Kolenberg 2005</ref>). The theoretical instability mechanisms proposed as an explanation for these stars do not cover the full area in the HertzsprungRussell diagram where such pulsations have been claimed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Townsend 2005 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Savonije 2005)</ref>. The forthcoming spectroscopic observations of those targets will shed new light on these most interesting targets, and allow theoretical interpretation of the detected variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We constructed a frequency analysis pipeline and additional post-processing tools to efficiently analyse pulsators in CoRoT's exoplanet database. The method also includes a jump correction and detrending algorithm, as well as an automated search for combination frequencies and spacings among frequencies or periods. In the particular case of the Initial Run, many combination frequencies and spacings were found, but the total time span of ∼ 55 d was too short to draw firm conclusions on the frequency or period spacings of g modes and to confront them with theoretical models. There were too few convincing candidates in the more massive β Cep class to commence an interpretation in terms of nonlinear resonant coupling. However, our techniques revealed clear frequency spacings in high-frequency variables on the cool side of the SPB instability strip.</p><p>Most of the stars that seemed good β Cep candidates in terms of the values of the first three frequencies are to be refuted. This was to be expected, because the number of candidate β Cep stars found by the CoRoT Variability Classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Debosscher et al. 2009</ref>) was anomalously high compared to the number of candidate SPBs. Only one star on the blue side of the SPB instability strip matches a typical β Cep frequency spectrum. Four other stars were found to be δ Sct/β Cep-like, but again were far off their theoretical location in the log T eff − log g diagram. Instead, we detected many different types of variable stars among the β Cep candidate sample. Several turned out to be low-amplitude pulsators whose frequencies are spread over a wide range and which are located on the red side of the SPB instability strip, where no oscillations are predicted by theory. According to the theoretical computations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Townsend (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Savonije (2005)</ref>, mid-B type rapidly rotating pulsators with retrograde mixed g modes could occur in a part of this region, exhibiting many of these properties. However, they could also simply be fast-rotating classical SPB or δ Sct stars, or Be pulsators. Future spectroscopic observations will allow us to distinguish between these possibilities, by supplying information on rotational velocities, abundances, and improved log g − log T eff values. Besides these interesting stars, also binary stars and a few suspectedly differentially rotating stars (with or without additional pulsations), were detected among the β Cep candidates.</p><p>Similar conclusions apply to the sample of SPB candidates, although the number of good candidates is vastly greater for this class than for the β Cep candidates. Interestingly, the highest amplitude SPB candidates all show two distinct signs of nonlinear behaviour: first, clear unexpected power excess in the region between 2 and 6 d −1 , which seems to point to modes with finite lifetimes. These could originate from nonlinear nonresonant harmonic distortion, leading to time-dependent amplitudes and/or frequencies. Second, we identified combination frequencies, which are stable on the time scale of the measurements. These are likely to be caused by nonlinear resonant mode locking. On top of that, we also find some rich and low-amplitude SPB pulsators, with frequencies in a lower range than the similar stars in the β Cep sample.</p><p>Our follow-up studies of new pulsating B stars in the CoRoT long runs, which typically last 150 d, as well as future spectroscopy, will be very valuable in evaluating the new type of os-cillations found in the Initial Run data as reported here in more detail. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. A.4</ref>.

Because of its low amplitude and long period, the g-mode frequency can possibly be influenced by instrumental effects.
