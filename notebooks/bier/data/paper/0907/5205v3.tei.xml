			<abstract>
				<p>We present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009 June 5 transit of the exo-planet HD 80606b. We report the first detection of the transit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 ± 0.25 hr and allowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. Keck spectra obtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitive evidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary or-bital axis are misaligned. The Keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle λ is between 32-87 deg with 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. Thus the orbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e = 0.93) but is also tilted away from the equatorial plane of its parent star. A large tilt had been predicted, based on the idea that the planet&apos;s eccentric orbit was caused by the Kozai mechanism. Independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3 exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planets on eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate through a different channel than lower-mass planets on circular orbits.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Discovered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Naef et al. (2001)</ref>, HD 80606b is a giant planet of approximately 4 Jupiter masses whose orbit carries it within 7 stellar radii of its parent star. Yet it is no ordinary "hot Jupiter": the other end of the planet's 111-day orbit is about 30 times further away from the star. With an orbital eccentricity of 0.93, HD 80606b presents an extreme example of the "eccentric exoplanet" problem: the observation that exoplanets often have eccentric orbits, despite the 20th-century expectation that more circular orbits would be common <ref type="bibr">(Lis- sauer 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wu and Murray (2003)</ref> proposed that HD 80606b formed on a wide circular orbit that was subsequently shrunk and elongated by a combination of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kozai (1962)</ref> effect and tidal friction. In this scenario, the gravitational perturbation from the companion star HD 80607 excites large-amplitude oscillations of the planet's orbital eccentricity and inclination. During high-eccentricity phases, tidal friction drains the orbital energy and shrinks the orbit until the oscillations cease due to competing perturbations arising from stellar asphericity or general relativity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine (2007)</ref> noted that a probable consequence of this scenario is that the starplanet orbit was left tilted with respect to its original orbital plane, which was presumably aligned with the stellar equator. Hence, a demonstration that the planetary orbital axis and stellar spin axis are misaligned would be supporting evidence for the Kozai scenario. For a transiting planet, it is possible to measure the angle between the sky projection of those two axes through observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, a distortion of spectral lines resulting from the partial eclipse of the rotating stellar surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Rossiter 1924</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, McLaughlin 1924</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Queloz et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">see Fabrycky &amp; Winn 2009</ref> for a recent summary of results). In a series of fortunate events, it recently became known that the orbit of HD 80606b is viewed close enough to edge-on to exhibit transits and thereby permit RM observations. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laughlin et al. (2009)</ref> detected an occultation of the planet by the star, an event that is visible from only 15% of the sight-lines to HD 80606. Then, three groups detected a transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moutou et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Fossey et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Garcia- Melendo &amp; McCullough 2009</ref>, which was predicted to occur with only 15% probability even after taking into account the occurrence of occultations.</p><p>All three groups detected the transit egress, but not the ingress. The lack of information about the ingress, and hence the transit duration, hampered previous determinations of this system's parameters. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moutou et al. (2009)</ref> gathered radial-velocity data bracketing the transit egress that dis-plays the RM effect, but due to the unknown transit duration it was not immediately clear whether meaningful constraints could be placed on the angle λ between the sky projections of the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pont et al. (2009)</ref> concluded that λ is nonzero based on a Bayesian analysis of the available data, but their results were sensitive to prior assumptions regarding the stellar mean density, the stellar rotation rate, and the treatment of correlated noise, and were therefore not as robust as desired. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We report here on a campaign to observe the photometric transit ingress of UT 2009 June 5, and to measure more precise radial velocities during the transit. We also present and analyze data that have been accumulated by the California Planet Search over the 8 years since the planet's discovery. Our observations and data reduction are presented in § 2, our analysis is described in § 3, and the results are summarized and discussed in § 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Photometry</head><p>The ingress was expected to begin between UT 23:00 June 4 and 06:00 June 5, and to last 4-5 hr. However, in June, HD 80606 is only observable from a given site for a few hours (at most) following evening twilight. To overcome this obstacle we organized a transcontinental 17 campaign, with observers in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Indiana, Texas, Arizona, California, and Hawaii.</p><p>On the transit night, each observer obtained a series of images of HD 80606 and its neighbor HD 80607. In most cases, we used only a small subraster of the CCD encompassing both stars, and defocused the telescope, both of which allow an increase in the fraction of time spent collecting photons as opposed to reading out the CCD. Defocusing also has the salutary effects of averaging over pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations, and reducing the impact of natural seeing variations on the shape of the stellar images.</p><p>Each observer also gathered images on at least one other night when the transit was not occurring, to establish the baseline flux ratio between HD 80606 and HD 80607 with the same equipment, bandpass, and range of airmass as on the transit night. Details about each site are given below. (Observations were also attempted from Brookline, MA; Princeton, NJ; Lick Observatory, CA; and Winer Observatory, AZ; but no useful data were obtained at those sites due to poor weather.) In what follows, the dates are UT dates, i.e., "June 5" refers to the transit night of June 4-5 in U.S. time zones.</p><p>George R. Wallace Jr. Astrophysical Observatory, Westford, MA. Thick clouds on the transit night prevented any useful data from being obtained. However, out-of-transit data in the Cousins R band were obtained on June 3 using a 0.41 m telescope equipped with a POETS camera ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Souza et al. 2006</ref>), and a 0.36 m telescope equipped with an SBIG STL-1001E CCD camera.</p><p>Rosemary Hill Observatory, Bronson, FL. We observed in the Sloan i band using the 0.76 m Tinsley telescope and SBIG ST-402ME CCD camera. Conditions were partly cloudy on the transit night, leading to several interruptions in the time series. Control data were also obtained on June 11.</p><p>De Kalb Observatory, Auburn, IN. We used a 0.41 m f /8.5</p><p>Ritchey-Chretien telescope with an SBIG ST10-XME CCD camera. Data were obtained in the Cousins R band on May 30 and on the transit night. Conditions were clear on both nights. McDonald Observatory, Fort Davis, TX. Two telescopes were used: the McDonald 0.8m telescope and its Loral 2048 2 prime focus CCD camera with an R C filter; and the MONETNorth <ref type="bibr">18</ref> 1.2m telescope with an Alta Apogee E47 CCD camera and SDSS r filter, controlled remotely from Göttingen, Germany. Conditions were partly cloudy on the transit night, shortening the interval of observations and causing several interruptions. Control data were obtained with the McDonald 0.8m telescope on June 11, and with the MONET-North 1.2m telescope on May 31 and June 4.</p><p>Fred L. Whipple Observatory, Mt. Hopkins, AZ. We used the 48 in (1.2m) telescope and Keplercam, a 4096 2 Fairchild CCD camera. Cloud cover prevented observations on the transit night, but out-of-transit data were obtained on June 6 in the Sloan riz bands. Out-of-transit data in the i band were also obtained on Feb. <ref type="bibr">13 and 14, 2009</ref>.</p><p>Mount Laguna Observatory, San Diego, CA. We observed in the Sloan r band with the 1.0m telescope and 2048 2 CCD camera. Conditions were humid and cloudy. The target star was observable through a thin strip of clear sky for several hours after evening twilight. Out-of-transit data were obtained on June 8.</p><p>Mauna Kea Observatory, HI. We used the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope and the Orthogonal Parallel Transfer Imaging Camera (OPTIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tonry et al. 1997</ref>). Instead of defocusing, we used the charge-shifting capability of OPTIC to spread the starlight into squares 40 pixels (5. ′′ 4) on a side ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howell et al. 2003</ref>). We observed with a custom "narrow z" filter defining a bandpass centered at 850 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 40 nm. Out-of-transit data were obtained on June 4.</p><p>Reduction of the CCD images from each observatory involved standard procedures for bias subtraction, flat-field division, and aperture photometry. The flux of HD 80606 was divided by that of HD 80607, and the results were averaged into 10 min bins. This degree of binning was acceptable because it sampled the ingress duration with ≈15 points. We estimated the uncertainty in each binned point as the standard deviation of the mean of all the individual data points contributing to the bin (ranging in number from 8 to 63 depending on the telescope). We further imposed a minimum uncertainty of 0.001 per 10 min binned point, to avoid overweighting any particular point and out of general caution about timecorrelated noise that often afflicts photometric data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pont et al. 2006</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows the time series of the flux ratio based on the data from the transit night of June 5, as well as the out-of-transit flux ratio derived with the same telescope.</p><p>Determining the out-of-transit flux ratio and its uncertainty was an important task. Since it was not possible to gather outof-transit data on June 5, we needed to compare data from the same telescope that were taken on different nights. Systematic errors are expected from night-to-night differences in atmospheric conditions and detector calibrations. We believe this uncertainty to be approximately 0.002 in the flux ratio, based on the following two tests.</p><p>First, in two instances the out-of-transit flux ratio was measured on more than one night, with differences in the results of 0.0004 and 0.0017 from the MONET-North and FLWO tele-  NOTE. -Based on data from our campaign, except for the data from the University of London Observatory which was kindly provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fossey et al. (2009)</ref>. The quoted uncertainties represent only the "statistical error," defined as the standard error of the mean of the flux ratios derived from all the images. a A custom "narrow z" bandpass, centered at 850 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 40 nm. scopes respectively. In the latter case, the data were separated in time by 112 days, raising the possibility that longer-term instabilities in the instrument or the intrinsic variability of the stars contribute to the difference, and that the night-to-night repeatability is even better than 0.0017.</p><p>A second comparison can be made by including data from different telescopes that employed the same nominal bandpass. This should give an upper bound (worst-case) estimate for the systematic error in the measurement from a single telescope on different nights. Using the data in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we asked for each bandpass: what value of σ sys must be chosen in order for</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">χ 2 = N i=1 ( f oot,i − ¯ f oot,i ) 2 σ 2 i + σ 2 sys = N − 4,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f oot,i is the ith measurement of the out-of-transit flux ratio, σ i is the statistical uncertainty in that measurement, and ¯ f oot,i is the unweighted mean of all the out-of-transit flux ratio measurements made in the same nominal bandpass as f i . There are N = 15 data points, and N − 4 is used in Eq. (1) because there are 4 independent bandpasses for which means are calculated. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> In this sense, we fitted a model to the out-oftransit flux-ratio data with 4 free parameters. The quantities ( f oot,i − ¯ f oot,i ) are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The result is σ sys = 0.0018. In our subsequent analysis we assumed the error in the outof-transit flux ratio to follow a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation given by the quadrature sum of 0.0020 and statistical error given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Given the preceding results, we believe this to be a reasonable and even a conservative estimate of the systematic error. Though it may seem too small to those readers with experience in synoptic photometry, it must be remembered that this is an unusually favorable case: the Universe was kind enough to provide two stars of nearly equal brightness and color separated by only 20 ′′ . It is also worth repeating that for our analysis we did not need to place data from different telescopes on the same flux scale; we needed only to align data from the same telescope obtained on different nights.</p><p>We call attention to a few key aspects of the time series in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> All the observers measured the flux ratio between HD 80606 and HD 80607 to be smaller on the transit night than it was on out-of-transit nights. We conclude that the transit was detected. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> The data from Rosemary Hill and De Kalb show a decline in the relative brightness of HD 80606 over several hours. We interpret the decline as the transit ingress. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> The data from McDonald, Mt. Laguna, and Mauna Kea show little variability over the interval of their observations, suggesting that the "bottom" (complete phase) of the transit had been reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Radial Velocities</head><p>We measured the relative radial velocity (RV) of HD 80606 using the Keck I 10m telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. We used the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vogt et al. 1994</ref>) in the standard setup of the California Planet Search program ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Howard et al. 2009</ref>), as summarized here. We employed the red cross-disperser and used the iodine gas absorption cell to calibrate the instrumental response and the wavelength scale. The slit width was 0. ′′ 86 and the exposure time ranged from 240-500 s, giving a resolution of 65, 000 and a typical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 210 pixel −1 . Radial velocities were measured with respect to an iodine-free spectrum, using the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Butler et al. (1996)</ref> as improved over the years.</p><p>The 73 measurements span 8 yr, from 2001 to the present. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> gives all of the RV data. There are 39 data points obtained prior to the upgrade of the HIRES CCDs in August 2004, and 34 data points obtained after the upgrade. Results from the pre-upgrade data, and some of the post-upgrade data, were published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Butler et al. (2006)</ref>. For our analysis we re-reduced the post-upgrade spectra using later versions of the analysis code and spectral template. Due to known difficulties in comparing data obtained with the different detectors, we allowed for a constant velocity offset between the pre-upgrade and post-upgrade data sets in our subsequent analysis.</p><p>The post-upgrade data include nightly data from the week of the June 5 transit, which in turn include a series of 8 observations taken at 30 min intervals on the transit night. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> shows the RV data as a function of time, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> shows the RV data as a function of orbital phase. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref> is a close-up around the transit phase. Shown in all of these figures is the best-fitting model, described in § 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ANALYSIS</head><p>We fitted a model to the photometric and RV data based on the premise of a single planet in a Keplerian orbit around a star with a quadratic limb-darkening law and uniform rotation The gray line is the best-fitting model. The data were transformed into the center-of-mass frame of the star-planet system by subtracting a constant velocity offset, and the error bars represent the quadrature sum of the measurement errors quoted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> and a term representing possible systematic errors ("stellar jitter"). For the pre-upgrade and post-upgrade data, the constant velocity offsets are 184.55 and 182.45 m s −1 , and the systematic error terms are 5 and 2 m s −1 , respectively.</p><p>of its photosphere. The model flux was computed using the equations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. The model RV was given by v O (t) + ∆v R (t), where v O is the line-of-sight component of the Keplerian orbital velocity and ∆v R is the anomalous velocity due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect.</p><p>To compute ∆v R as a function of orbital phase we used the "RM calibration" procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Winn et al. (2005)</ref>: we simulated spectra exhibiting the RM effect at various orbital phases, and then measured the apparent radial velocity of the simulated spectra using the same algorithm used on the actual data. We found the results to be consistent with the simple formula ∆v R = −(∆ f )v p ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ohta et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Giménez 2006</ref>), where ∆ f is the instantaneous decline in relative flux and v p is the radial velocity of the hidden portion of the photosphere. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The model parameters can be divided into 3 groups. First are the parameters of the spectroscopic orbit: the period P, a particular midtransit time T t , the radial-velocity semiamplitude K, the eccentricity e, the argument of pericenter ω, and two velocity offsets γ 1 and γ 2 (for the pre-upgrade and postupgrade data). Next are the photometric parameters: the planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R ⋆ , the orbital inclination i, the <ref type="bibr">20</ref> We also found this to be true for the cases of HAT-P-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al. 2008</ref>) and TrES-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Winn et al. 2008a</ref>), although for other cases a higherorder polynomial relation was needed. It is noteworthy that the 3 systems for which the linear relation is adequate are the slowest rotators. This is consistent with work by T. <ref type="bibr">Hirano et al. (in preparation</ref>) that aims at an analytic understanding of the RM calibration procedure. scaled stellar radius R ⋆ /a (where a is the semimajor axis), and the out-of-transit flux ratio f oot,i specific to the data from each telescope. Finally there are the parameters relevant to the RM effect: the projected stellar rotation rate v sin i ⋆ and the angle λ between the sky projections of the orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis [for illustrations of the geometry, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ohta et al.

If the new point has a lower χ 2 than the previous point, the jump is executed; if not, the jump is executed with probability exp(−∆χ 2 /2) and otherwise the current point is repeated in the chain. We set the sizes of the random deviates such that ∼40% of jumps are executed. We created 10 chains of 10 6 links each from different starting conditions, giving for each parameter a smoothly varying a posteriori distribution and a Gelman &amp; Rubin (1992) statistic smaller than 1.05. The phase-space density of points in the chain is an estimate of the joint a posteriori probability distribution of all the parameters, from which may be calculated the probability distribution for an individual parameter by marginalizing over all of the others. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> gives the results for the model parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The poorly constrained transit duration was the main limiting factor in previous determinations of the system parameters of HD 80606b. The duration is now known to within 2.2%, from a combination of the transit ingress detected in our transcontinental campaign, the photometric egress detected during the previous transit, and the orbital period that is known very precisely from the RV data. In addition, our new and more precise RV data show definitively that at midtransit the starlight is anomalously blueshifted. This is interpreted as the partial eclipse of the redshifted half of the rotating photosphere. For this to happen at midtransit, the orbital axis of the planet and the rotation axis of the star must be misaligned.</p><p>Despite these achievements, the RV signal during the later phase of the transit is known less precisely, and the RV signal during the early phase of the transit remains unmeasured. This incompleteness leads to relatively coarse bounds on the projected spin-orbit angle λ in comparison with many other systems.</p><p>As described in § 1, the Kozai migration scenario of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wu &amp; Murray (2003)</ref> carried an implicit prediction that the stellar spin and planetary orbit are likely to be misaligned. In this sense, the finding of a nonzero λ corroborates the Kozai migration hypothesis. The quantitative results for λ derived in this paper are in good agreement with the theoretical spinorbit angle of 50 • predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine (2007)</ref> in an illustrative calculation regarding HD 80606b (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>. This agreement should not be overinterpreted, given the uncertainties in the measurement, the issue of the sky projection, and the uncertainties in some parameters of the calculation. Nevertheless the calculation demonstrates that values of λ of order 50 • emerge naturally in the Kozai scenario.</p><p>The Kozai scenario is not without shortcomings. The orbital plane of the stellar binary must be finely tuned to be nearly perpendicular to the initial planetary orbit. This would be fatal to any scenario that purported to explain the majority of exoplanetary orbits, but it may be forgivable here, since we are trying to explain only one system out of the several hundred known exoplanets. Another possible problem is that (depending on the initial condition, and the characteristics of the stellar binary) the relativistic precession may have been too strong to permit Kozai oscillations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Naef et al. 2001)</ref>. In this case the theory might be rescued by the existence of a distant planet that is responsible for the Kozai effect, rather than the stellar companion. On the other hand, assuming HD 80607 is responsible, additional planets would spoil the effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wu &amp; Murray (2003)</ref> used this fact to predict upper bounds on the masses and orbital distances of any additional planets.</p><p>Another mechanism that can produce large eccentricities and large spin-orbit misalignments is planet-planet scattering, in which close encounters between planets cause sudden alterations in orbital elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Chatterjee et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Nagasawa et al. 2008</ref>]. However, <ref type="bibr">Ford &amp; Ra- sio (2008)</ref> found that planet-planet scattering rarely produces eccentricities in excess of 0.8, unless the orbit was initially eccentric (due perhaps to the Kozai effect, but without the need for such extreme tuning) or the other planet that participated in the encounter remained bound to the system. For these reasons, further theoretical work is warranted, as is continued RV monitoring to seek evidence for additional planets. On an empirical level, it is striking that the only three exoplanetary systems known to have a strong spin-orbit misalignment all have massive planets on eccentric orbits: the present case of HD 80606b (4.2 M Jup , e = 0.93), WASP-14b (7.3 M Jup , e = 0.09; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Joshi et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Johnson et al. 2009</ref>), and XO-3b (11.8 M Jup , e = 0.26; Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krull et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Hébrard et al. 2008</ref>). There are also two cases of massive planets on eccentric orbits for which λ was found to be consistent with zero: HD 17156b (3.2 M Jup , e = 0.68; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cochran et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Barbieri et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Narita et al. 2009</ref>) and HAT-P-2b (8.0 M Jup , e = 0.50; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Winn et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Loeillet et al. 2008</ref>). Thus although less massive planets on circular orbits seem to be well-aligned, as a rule, it remains possible that more than half of the massive eccentric systems are misaligned. Such systems are fruitful targets for future RM observations.</p><p>We thank Carly Chubak for measuring the heliocentric radial velocity, Debra Fischer for help with measuring v sin i ⋆ , and Dan Fabrycky for interesting discussions about the Kozai mechanism.

Blue solid curves show the results when fitting the photometry and the Keck/HIRES RVs with no prior constraint on v sin i ⋆ . Red dotted curves show the effect of applying a Gaussian prior v sin i ⋆ = 1.9 ± 0.5 km s −1 based on analyses of the stellar absorption lines in Keck/HIRES spectra.

(2009) obtained during the February 2009 transit. By leaving out the SOPHIE data we have provided as independent a determination of λ as possible. Fig. 5 shows that the SOPHIE data seem to agree with the Keck data, and with the best-fitting model constrained by the Keck data. When the SOPHIE data are fitted simultaneously with the Keck data (with no prior constraint on v sin i ⋆ ), the results for λ are sharpened to 59 +21 −16 deg at 68.3% confidence, and 59 +63 −35 deg at 99.73% confidence.</figDesc></figure>
