				<p>An abstract should be given e use the model for the migration of planets introduced in Del Popolo, Yesilyurt &amp; Ercan (2003) to calculate the observed mass and semimajor axis distribution of extra-solar planets. The assumption that the surface density in planetesimals is proportional to that of gas is relaxed, and in order to describe disc evolution we use a method which, using a series of simplifying assumptions, is able to simultaneously follow the evolution of gas and solid particles for up to 10 7 yr. The distribution of planetesimals obtained after 10 7 yr is used to study the migration rate of a giant planet through the model of this paper. The disk and migration models are used to calculate the distribution of planets as function of mass and semimajor axis. The results show that the model can give a reasonable prediction of planets&apos; semi-major axes and mass distribution. In particular there is a pileup of planets at a ≃ 0.05 AU, a minimum near 0.3 AU, indicating a paucity of planets at that distance, and a rise for semi-major axes larger than 0.3 AU, out to 3 AU. The semi-major axis distribution shows that the more massive planets (typically, masses larger than 4M J) form preferentially in the outer regions and do not migrate much. Intermediate-mass objects migrate more easily whatever the distance they form, and that the lighter planets (masses from sub-Saturnian to Jovian) migrate easily.</p>

This is a statistically significant sample from which it is possible to determine meaningful distributions of planetary characteristics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al. 2003</ref>, and useful constraints for the planet-building models, and then possibly discriminate between the different proposed scenarios. Some features in the period versus mass diagram start to emerge and provide strong observational constraints for the migration scenario.</p><p>After the discovery of solar-like stars showing evidences of planets orbiting around them <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Butler et al. 2001</ref>) a number of questions about the formation mechanisms of such systems have been raised.

The lack of massive planets on short-period orbits can be explained by means of a low migration efficiency for higher mass planets. When the mass of the planet becomes of the order of a significant fraction of the characteristic disc mass with which it interacts, the inertia of the planet becomes important and slows down the orbital evolution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trilling et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nelson et al. 2000</ref>).</p><p>Using a model assuming a simple impulse approximation for the type II migration, no ad-hoc stopping mechanism in the center and neglecting type I migration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al.

Plausible mechanisms include gravitational interactions between the planet and other planets, stellar companion, or the protoplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lin &amp; Ida 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> close-in surviving pseudo-planets have smaller masses and distant surviving pseudo-planets have larger masses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armitage et al. (2002)</ref> extended the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref> including a physical mechanism for disc dispersal into a model for the formation and migration of massive planets, and made quantitative comparisons with the observed distribution of planetary orbital radii. They found good agreement with the Trilling work.</p><p>A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Masset &amp; Papaloizou (2003)</ref> gives some insight into the observed lack of small-mass planets (M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J ) on intermediate-period orbits (P ≥ 100 days) (see the Results section of the present paper, for details).</p><p>The aim of the present paper is to check the predictions of the migration model introduced in DP1, for the semi-major axes and mass distribution of extra-solar planets, and to compare them with the observed distribution of known extra-solar planets. This goal is reached by allowing giant planets to evolve and migrate in circumstellar disks with various initial conditions (different values of planet mass, disk mass, viscosity, etc.), assuming one planet per disk, and determining the final semi-major axis and mass distributions. The fundamental differences to previous studies in literature lie in the disk model used and the migration model.</p><p>A fundamental issue in studying planet migration is the disk model. From Del Popolo, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gambera and Ercan (2001)</ref> to Del Popolo, Yesilyurt and Ercan (2003) (hereafter DP3), there was a noteworthy improvement in the disk model used. In the current work, as in DP3, the disk model we used is a time-dependent accretion disk, and moreover we relaxed the assumption of Del Popolo &amp; Ek¸siEk¸si (2002) (hereafter DP2) that the surface density in planetesimals remains proportional to that of gas: Σ s (r, t) ∝ Σ(r, t). It is well-known that the distribution of planetesimals emerging from a turbulent disk does not necessarily reflect that of gas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Stepinski &amp; Valageas 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Stepinski &amp; Valageas 1997</ref>.</p><p>In order to take into account that the evolution of the distribution of solids is also governed by coagulation, sedimentation and evaporation/condensation, we use the method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1997)</ref> which is able to simultaneously follow the evolution of gas and solid particles for up to 10 7 yr.</p><p>The second fundamental issue in studying planet migration is the migration mechanism. A detailed discussion of the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the presence of planets at small orbital distances are summarized in DP1 and DP2, and in those papers we showed that dynamical friction between a planet and a planetesimal disk is an important mechanism for planet migration. Coupling the two models to obtain the migration rate of planets is possible, as shown in DP1, DP2, and DP3, and this can be used to calculate the distribution in terms of semimajor axes and mass.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we revise the disk and migration model used to obtain the radial distribution of the planetesimals. In Sect. 3, we describe our results. Sect. 4 is devoted to conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Distribution and evolution of gas and solids</head><p>In this section, we summarize the models used for the disk and migration. Interested readers are referred to DP3, and previous papers of the same author, for more details.</p><p>In order to obtain a better description of the planets' migration, it is necessary to model how the structure of the disk changes in time. This cannot be handled by the minimum-mass model nor by steady-state models. and characterized by continuous changes during their life. This evidence has led to a large consensus about the nebular origin of the Solar System. In addition, one also needs to describe the global evolution of the solid material which constitutes, together with the gas, the protoplanetary disk. The knowledge of this distribution and its time evolution is important both to understand how planets form and to calculate the migration rate.</p><p>The time evolution of the surface density of the gas Σ is given by the familiar equation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas 1997</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂Σ ∂t − 3 r ∂ ∂r r 1/2 ∂ ∂r r 1/2 ν t Σ = 0 (1)</formula><p>where ν t is the turbulent viscosity. Since ν t is not an explicit function of time, but instead depends only on the local disk quantities, it can be expressed as ν t = ν t (Σ, r) and Eq.(1) can be solved subject to boundary conditions on the inner and outer edges of the disk. The opacity law needed to compute ν t is obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ruden &amp; Pollack (1991)</ref>. Then, Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> is solved by means of an implicit scheme. Note that the evolution of the gas is computed independently of the evolution of particles (which only make ∼ 1% of the gas mass). Next, from Σ(r, t) we can algebraically find all other gas disk variables.</p><p>Next, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1997)</ref> the evolution of the surface density of solid particles Σ s is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂Σ s ∂t = 3 r ∂ ∂r r 1/2 ∂ ∂r (ν s Σ s r 1/2 ) + 1 r ∂ ∂r 2rΣ s v φ s Ω k t s .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the effective viscosity ν s is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ν s = ν t Sc with Sc = (1 + Ω k t s ) 1 + v 2 V 2 t . (3)</formula><p>where Sc is the Schmidt number, which measures the coupling of the dust to the gas turbulence, v is the relative velocity between a particle and the gas, V t the turbulent velocity, Ω k is the Keplerian angular velocity and t s the so-called stopping time.</p><p>The first diffusive term in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> is similar to Eq.(1), the second advective term in Eq.(2) arises from the lack of pressure support for the dust disk compared to the gas disk. Thus, it is proportional to the azimuthal velocity difference v φ between the dust and the gas. The average .. s refers to the vertical averaging over the disk height weighted by the solid density. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1997)</ref> for a more detailed presentation, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kornet et al.(2001)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the radial motion described by Eq.(2), the dust surface density also evolves through evaporation/condensation and coagulation. The method used to incorporate these processes into calculations relies on keeping Eq. (2) as the principal mathematical description of the global evolution of particles, but freeing its parameters from constraints of single-size and thermal indestructibility assumptions. Thus, the method can be characterized as solving a radial advection-diffusion problem modulated by coagulation, with the possibility of a cut-off by the evaporation. This method requires that the mass distribution of particles at any given radial location of a disk is narrowly peaked about a mean value particular for this location and a given time instant.</p><p>Such an assumption may appear quite arbitrary; however, it has a reasonable physical justification as collisions with small particles do not significantly increase the size of a test particle and the bulk of the solid mass is concentrated in the largest particles. This is supported by numerical simulations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mizuno et al. 1988</ref>) of grain growth in is nevertheless always concentrated in the largest particles. Therefore, we assume that the mass distribution of particles at any given radial location r is narrowly peaked about the mean value m d (r, t) = (4/3)πs 3 (r, t)ρ s , where s(r,t) is the size. The goal is to evaluate the functional dependence of s on r and t. Particles are assumed to be spheres with a bulk density of ρ s . The density of matter concentrated into solid particles is ρ s (r). Then, within this approximation, coagulation does not influence the dust surface density Σ s since it conserves the total mass of solids. Thus, the coagulation of solid particles only appears through the evolution of the radial distribution s(r, t)</p><p>of the typical size of the dust grains. We model this process as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1997)</ref>. We only consider collisional coagulation and we disregard gravitational interactions which would come into play at late times when large planetesimals have formed.</p><p>On the other hand, we take into account the evaporation of solid particles which takes place at the radius r evap where the temperature reaches T evap . We also include the condensation of the vapor below T evap onto the solid grains. As In DP3, we consider only one species of solid particles: high-temperature silicates with T evap = 1350 K and a bulk density ρ bulk = 3.3 g cm −3 . Thus, in our simplified model we follow the evolution of three distinct fluids: the gas, the vapor of silicates and the solid particles.</p><p>In this fashion, we obtain the radial distribution of the planetesimal swarm after 10 7 yr. This yields the surface density of solids Σ s (r, t) and the mid-plane solid density ρ s (r, t). We also obtain the size distribution s(r, t) reached by hierarchical coagulation. Of course, at these late times where planetesimals have typically reached a size of a few km or larger, gravitational interactions should play a dominant role with respect to coagulation. However, if these interactions do not significantly affect the radial distribution of solids (note that the radial velocity of such large particles due to the interaction with the gas is negligible) we can still use the outcome of the fluid approach described above to study the migration of giant planets, as detailed below.</p><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1997)</ref>, we consider an initial gas surface density of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σ 0 (r) = Σ 1 1 + (r/r 1 ) 2 −3.78 + Σ 2 (r/1AU) −1.5 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The quantities Σ 1 , r 1 and Σ 2 are free parameters which we vary in order to study different disk masses. The values we use are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, where M d is the gas disk mass (in units of M ⊙ ), J 50 is the disk angular momentum (in units of 10 50 g cm 2 s −1 ), Σ 1 and Σ 2 are in g cm −2 and r 1 is in AU. The first term in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> ensures that there is some mass up to large distances from the star, while the second term corresponds to the central concentration of the mass and sets the location of the evaporation radius. Note however that the evaporation radius for the high-temperature silicates we study here remains of the order of 0.1 AU. As previously explained, we consider only one species of solid: high-temperature silicates with T evap = 1350 K. We initialize the dust subdisk at time t = 10 4 yr (i.e. after the gas distribution has relaxed towards a quasi-stationary state) by setting the solid surface density Σ s as: Σ s (r, t = 10 4 yr) = 6 × 10 −3 Σ(r, t = 10 4 yr), similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Stepinski &amp; Valageas (1996</ref>, in order to account for cosmic abundance.</p><p>The assumed initial surface density profile is arbitrary. Fortunately, the specific form of the profile does not influence the subsequent evolution of the gas, inasmuch as the process governed by Eq. (1) is diffusive in nature and the details of initial distribution are forgotten after a time short in comparison with the evolutionary timescale.</p><p>Taking advantage of the "memory" of the gaseous component, we introduce solid particles into the calculation only after 10 4 yr during which the gas evolves alone to remove the arbitrariness in the initial conditions. Upon  The calculations are carried out for up to t = 10 7 yr, a period of time equal, within an order of magnitude, to observationally deduced lifetimes of protoplanetary disks ).</p><p>As shown in DP3, after times of the order of 10 6 − 10 7 yr, the coagulation process gives rise to large particles (&gt; 10 5 cm) which have a small radial velocity, and hence a negligible radial motion. This leads to a freezing of the solid surface density to the value reached at times of the order of 10 7 yr. In other words, once solids are in the form of planetesimals, the gas coupling becomes unimportant and the radial distribution of solids does not change and can only change on a much longer timescale by processes not considered in our model (like mutual gravitational interactions between planetesimals first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Safronov 1969)</ref>. 3 This is why we do not need to calculate its evolution for times longer than 10 7 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Migration model</head><p>With regard to the migration model, we consider a planet revolving around a star of mass M * = 1M ⊙ . The equation of motion of the planet can be written as¨r</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">as¨as¨r = F ⊙ + R (5)</formula><p>where the term F ⊙ represents the force per unit mass from the star, while R is the dissipative force (i.e. the dynamical friction term-see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Melita &amp; Woolfson 1996)</ref>. Then, the frictional drag on the test particles may be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R = −k v 1 e − k ⊥ v 1⊥ e ⊥ (6)</formula><p>where e and e ⊥ are two unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the disk plane, and k v 1 and k ⊥ v 1⊥ are given in DP3. We assume a disk-shaped matter distribution with constant velocity dispersions σ (parallel to the plane) and σ ⊥ (perpendicular to the plane) and with a ratio simply taken to be 2:1 (i.e. σ =2σ ⊥ ). Since the damping of eccentricity and inclination is more rapid than radial migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ida 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ida &amp; Makino 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">DP1)</ref>, we only deal with radial migration and we assume that the planet has negligible inclination and eccentricity (i p ∼ e p ∼ 0)</p><p>and that the initial distance from the star to the planet is 5.2 AU. The planet was set at an initial distance of 5.2 AU for similarity with choices made in previous papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murray et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Trilling et al. 1998</ref> In the calculation, we consider a two-component system, consisting of one protoplanet and many equal-mass planetesimals. The velocity dispersion of planetesimals in the neighborhood of the protoplanet depends on the 3 Note that 10 6 yr is the time required for Σs (or ρs) to converge everywhere. However, this convergence is not uniform mass of the protoplanet. When the mass of the planet, M p , is ≤ 10 25 g, the value of &lt; e 2 m &gt; 1/2 ( e m being the eccentricity of the planetesimals) is independent of M p therefore:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">e m ≃ 20(2m/3M ⊙ ) 1/3<label>(7)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr">Ida &amp; Makino 1993)</ref> where m is the mass of the planetesimals. When the mass of the planet reaches values larger than 10 25 -10 26 g at 1 AU, &lt; e 2 m &gt; 1/2 is proportional to M 1/3 p :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">e m ≃ 6(M p /3M ⊙ ) 1/3<label>(8)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr">Ida &amp; Makino 1993)</ref>. As a consequence, the dispersion velocity in the disc is also characterized by two regimes, being connected to the eccentricity by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">σ m ≃ (e 2 m + i 2 m ) 1/2 v c<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where i m is the inclination of planetesimals and v c is the Keplerian circular velocity. Following Stern (1996) and</p><p>Del <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Popolo et al. (1999)</ref> we assume that i 2 m = e 2 m /4. In the simulation we assume that the planetesimals all have equal masses, m, and that m &lt;&lt; M p . This assumption does not affect the results, since dynamical friction does not depend on the individual masses of these particles but on their overall density (see DP3). Therefore, we do not need to follow the evolution of the size distribution of planetesimals. We merely use the planetesimal density ρ s reached after 10 7 yr, assuming that the height of the planetesimal disk does not evolve significantly.</p><p>Other details, and a discussion about the back reaction of the planet on the swarm, can be found in DP1, DP2, DP3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Further assumptions and the distribution calculation method</head><p>In order to determine the distribution of semimajor axes and mass, it is necessary to investigate the dependence of the giant planet migration on the properties of the protoplanetary disk and planet mass M p . Similarly to what we did in DP3, we integrated the model introduced in the previous sections for several values of the initial disk surface density (i.e. several disk masses), different values of α, and planet mass. In this way, it was possible to obtain a semimajor axis corresponding to a given value of α, disk mass, and M p . As previously reported, the assumptions and model are the same as in DP3.</p><p>Since, similarly to DP3, we are mainly interested in studying the planet migration due to the interaction with planetesimals, we assume that the gas is almost dissipated when the planet starts its migration. We know that, usually, while the gas tends to be dissipated, (some evidence shows that the disk lifetimes range from 10 5 yr to 10 7 yr, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ruden &amp; Pollack 1991)</ref>, the coagulation process induces an increase of the density of solid particles with time and gives rise to objects of increasing dimensions. Clearly the effect of the presence of gas should be that of accelerating the loss of angular momentum of the planet and to reduce the migration time. In our case, there is still gas after 10 7 yrs, but it is in quantity inferior to that of planetesimals, especially in the case of lower mass discs, in which it can be even two order of magnitude less than planetesimals. Moreover, as noticed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kominami &amp; Ida (2002)</ref> dynamical friction and gravitational gas drag are essentially the same dynamical process and the effect of the gravitational gas drag is incorporated in that of dynamical friction. In our case, other forces, such as aerodynamical gas drag, can be neglected when compared to gravitational gas drag (Kominami &amp; Ida In order to calculate the fraction of planets in terms of semi-major axes and mass, we used the model described in the previous section, and we have performed a statistical study of planet migration in systems in which both disk mass and disk viscosity are varied in turn. The initial orbital semi-major axes of all planets are 5.2 AU.</p><p>Initial planet masses are taken to be fractional values of Jupiter masses, between 0.1 and 18 Jupiter masses (with intervals of 0.1M J ), considering one planet per system. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref>, for the varied parameters, we adopt nominal values and vary each parameter over a given range. In the case of disk mass, we adopt a nominal disk mass of 0.02M ⊙ (after <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beckwith et al. 2000</ref>), and calculate model cases between 10 −4 &lt; M d &lt; 0.6 × 10 −1 M ⊙ (with intervals of 0.01M ⊙ ). This range spans disk masses from less than the minimum mass disk for a system containing a Jupiter, to a disk so massive that direct binary star production is more likely than giant planet  where y = log x and y 0 = log x 0 , where x is equal to the value of the varied parameter, x 0 is the nominal value for the parameter being varied, and where σ (describing the width in log space of the Gaussian parameter distribution) is equal to 0.5. In other words, the half-width of the Gaussian physical parameter distribution is a factor of √ 10. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We use this Gaussian weighting in all results discussed in this paper. Weighting is achieved by assigning a significance to each planet as P (y). Thus, planets from extreme disks which survive but whose initial conditions are extremely unlikely are not overrepresented in the statistical results. Note that because probabilities are assigned after all model runs are completed and are simple functions of the nominal values and a description of a Gaussian distribution, other probability weightings can be installed to represent other experiments. Future work includes deriving both x 0 and σ more directly from observations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gullbring et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hartmann et al. 1998</ref>) and testing non-Gaussian probability distributions. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Thus, a parameter value which is √ 10 times greater or less than the nominal value has a probability one half of the </p></div>

In the first, we represent the distribution of semi-major axis of planets. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, the light solid line represents the semi-major axis distribution obtained with the data given at www.exoplanets.org (see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marcy et al. 2003</ref>) while the dashed thick line is the distribution obtained with the model of this paper.</p><p>The plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> shows that we obtain a reasonable agreement with the data. However, the main point of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.   1</ref> is to show that the observed distribution of orbital periods can be easily recovered from our model, and with reasonable values for α and M d .</p><p>The plot shows that at a ≃ 0.05 AU there is a pile-up of planets. This pile up seems not to be an artifact of observational selection (see Kuchner &amp; Lecar 2002 and subsection 3.3), and it suggests that some mechanism must be responsible for halting the migration of planets at an orbital period of 3 days.</p><p>As stressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kuchner &amp; Lecar (2002)</ref>, phenomena like the interaction between two planets and a star, that can leave a planet trapped by stellar tides into a circular orbit of ≃ 0.04 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rasio &amp; Ford 1996)</ref>, or halting of planet migration by loss of mass to the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trilling et al. 1998</ref>), are rare. The migration through resonant interaction with planetesimals in the disk (Murray 2002) provides a natural way of halting the planet but unfortunately to change the orbit of a Jupiter-mass planet requires approximatively a Jupiter mass of planetesimals and a too massive disk. The other possibility to explain the pile-up of planets seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (see also DP3)</ref> is a gas disk truncated at a temperature of 1500 K by the onset of Magneto-Rotational instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kuchner &amp; Lecar 2002</ref>). Thus, disk temperature determines the orbital radii of the innermost surviving planets. In our model, the distribution of DP2, this model does not have the drawback of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murray (2002)</ref>, namely that of requiring a too-large disk mass for migration, and at the same time it has the advantage of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murray (2002)</ref> of having an intrinsic natural mechanism that provides halting of migration. As shown in DP3, the same model used in this paper is able to explain the peak at 3-4 days for the orbital period.</p><p>A second feature visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 is a minimum near 0.</ref>3 AU, indicating a paucity of planets at that distance.</p><p>One interpretation of this minimum is that the migration mechanism rarely allows them to stop near 0.3 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jones et al. 2003</ref>). There is the suggestion of a rise for semi-major axes larger than 0.3 AU, out to 3 AU. Beyond 3 AU, the Doppler surveys have had inadequate lifetimes (≃ 8 yr) to securely detect planets in the correspondingly long orbital periods (the decrease observed after 3 AU is due at least in part to observational bias). 5 Thus, observations summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> strongly indicate the existence of a rise in the distribution of planets with increasing orbital distance from the host star. The increasing numbers of planets in larger orbits is consistent with models that invoke orbital migration, like that of this paper, and a contemporaneous clearing of the gaseous disk to explain the final positions of giant planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. 2002)</ref>. If we have planets that initially reside at 5 AU or at larger distances, and if the disk clears its gas on a time scale shorter than the migrational time scale, then giant planets beyond 5 AU could be more numerous than the extrasolar planets discovered so far.</p><p>In conclusion, we can tell that the disk model and migration mechanism used in this paper are able not only to predict the planet distribution at short semi-major axes, with a peak at 3-4 days, but also the distribution of planets at larger distances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Mass versus period</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>, we plot planet mass vs. orbital semi-major axis. There is a lack of massive planets having small semimajor axes. Within ≃ 0.3 AU (≃ 60 days) there are no planets with masses larger than ≃ 4M J and moreover there are few massive planets with semi-major axis &lt; 1 AU.</p><p>With now more than 100 extra-solar planets discovered, the lack of short-period massive planetary companions becomes even clearer, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>. When we neglect the multiple-star systems 6 , a complete void of candidates is observed in the diagram for masses larger than ≃ 2M J and periods smaller than ≃ 100 days.</p><p>This feature can be explained by several processes: 1) Type II migration.</p><p>2) Processes related to planet-star interactions when the planet reaches the central regions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al. 2003</ref>).</p><p>3) Multi-planet chaotic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weidenschilling &amp; Marzari 1996)</ref>.</p><p>In relation to type II migration, the feature can be explained assuming that the migration process has a low efficiency (planets rarely migrate inward) or too high an efficiency (planets migrate all the way into the star) for massive planets (mass &gt; 4M J ). The first alternative (low efficiency) is the most probable. This view is supported by simulations of single-planet migration and by the model of this paper. More massive planets create larger gaps than smaller planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trilling et al. 1998</ref>). For the most massive planets, the length of time it takes to fully form <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Indeed, there is poor detectability of planets for semi-major axes greater than 2 AU, where planets with Mp &lt; 1MJ are currently difficult to detect, given the precision and duration of surveys.</p><p>6 In these systems the planetary formation or evolution could follow different paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zucker &amp; Mazeh 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al.</ref> the gap can be quite long and during gap formation there is no Type I migration since the planet has already opened a gap; there is also little Type II migration because most Lindblad resonances already fall within the growing gap. If the timescale for gap growth is longer than the disk lifetime, then the planet will not migrate far.</p><p>Therefore, overall, close-in surviving model planets have smaller masses and distant surviving models planets have larger masses.</p><p>The explanation of the lack of short-period massive planetary companions is similarly explained in our model.</p><p>As discussed in DP2, DP3 (in connection with the back reaction of the planet on the swarm), when the protoplanet becomes massive enough (10 25 − 10 26 g) to influence the velocity distribution of small planetesimals, the random velocities and velocity dispersion of planetesimals are heated by the protoplanet and become larger than in the early stage. Furthermore, the protoplanet would scatter neighboring planetesimals and give rise to a gap in the spatial distribution of planetesimals (see As shown in DP3, the drift velocity behaves as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">dr dt ∝    M M ≤ 10 25 g constant M &gt; 10 25 g<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The linear dependence on the planet's mass of the drift velocity corresponds to the type I drift in the density wave approach (Ward 1997), while the part independent of the planet's mass corresponds to type II drift. The transition between the two regimes entails a velocity drop of between one to three orders of magnitude (according to the value of α). As the threshold is exceeded, the motion fairly abruptly converts to a slower mode in which the drift velocity is independent of mass 7 . The phenomenon is equivalent to that predicted in the density wave approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ward 1997)</ref>. This leads to similar conclusions obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref>, with a type II migration model: higher mass planets migrate on longer timescales. More massive planets preferentially form in the outer regions where a larger amount of building material is available, and that from those distances they need longer times to migrate towards the inner region.</p><p>we have to add some hints on the way migration was calculated in the case the disc mass, M d , is smaller than that of the protoplanet. One can think that less massive discs are not able to move a more massive planet. This idea is not completely correct. As we know, when the planet mass is less than or comparable to the local disc mass, the planet behaves as a representative particle in the disc, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lin &amp; Papaloizou (1986)</ref>. When the protoplanet has a mass larger than that of the disc, the satellite acts as a dam against the viscous evolution of the disc, and can lead to a substantial change in the disc structure in the vicinity of the planet. The coupled disc-planet evolution in this case has been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Syer &amp; Clarke (1995)</ref> and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ivanov et al. (1999)</ref>, who showed that the inertia of the planet plays an important role in this case (see <ref type="bibr">Nelson et al. 2000, Eq. 9</ref>). The effect of the interaction between the secondary and the disc leads to accumulation of the disc matter in the region behind the protoplanet (see Eq. 12 and 39 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Syer &amp; Clarke 1995)</ref>. In order to calculate the migration in our model, we used the surface density given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ivanov et al. (1999)</ref>.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>, another very interesting feature comes out of the period/separation distribution: there is a shortage of planets with periods between roughly 10 and 100 days. This observational property is mainly due to the light candidates (M p sin i ≤ 2M J ). As seen in the previous section, massive planets orbiting single stars are almost exclusively found on longer-period orbits. They probably form and stay further out. On the other hand, lighter planets (0.75 ≤ M p sin i ≤ 2M J ), are found at all distances from their stars, unlike massive planets.</p><p>A third feature emerging from the mass-period diagram is the apparent lack of very light planets (M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J ) with periods larger than ≃ 100 days. Assuming that it is not produced by small number statistics, an explanation of this feature has been advanced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Masset &amp; Papaloizou (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al. (2003)</ref>. Masset &amp; Papaloizou (2003) studied the effect of co-orbital corotation torque on migrating protoplanets. In particular they showed that if the mass deficit created by the radial drift with the planet of the material trapped in the co-orbital region is larger than the planet mass, the migration rate undergoes a runaway which can rapidly vary the protoplanet semi-major axis by a large amount (50% over a few tens of orbits). This typically corresponds to planet masses in the sub-Saturnian to Jovian mass range embedded in massive protoplanetary disks.</p><p>Moreover, the simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Masset &amp; Papaloizou (2003)</ref> show that the limit in planetary mass for the appearance of the runaway regime is very steep (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 12-14)</ref>. There is a critical mass relatively well-constrained (M crit ≃ 1M J ) under which runaway is likely provided that the protoplanetary disk is not too lightweight, and above which runaway is impossible. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>, it is shown that in the calculations of this paper, light planets, M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J , are found predominantly at periods shorter than 100 days, but some planets are found also at larger distances. In others words, following the mass trend seen for other planets, smaller mass planets migrate to smaller periods, but differently from observations, some light planets, M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J , are observed also at periods larger than 100 days. This suggests that if there is a larger probability of finding light planets with smaller periods, it is also possible that some light planets can be found on larger orbits, depending on particular characteristics of the disk. The fact that in the sample of ≃ 100 planets we have now the light planets are found exclusively on periods shorter than 100 days can be related to the fact that the detection probability decreases with increasing distances and with decreasing mass: light planets M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J are more and more difficult to detect at larger distances. In other words, this feature could be related to the observational bias (see subsection 3.3) inherent to the radial-velocity technique for planet search that makes the detection more difficult for distant and/or lighter planets (but see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al. 2003</ref>).</p><p>P.J. Armitage (private communication) suggested that the probability that the observational evidence of the lack of planets with M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J with P &gt; 100 days is a real effect is only marginal. This comes from the fact that plotting the mass vs semi-major axis distribution, the lower edge of the distribution nearly follows the line defined by constant stellar radial velocity amplitude (i.e. ∝ √ a). If there is a lack of low mass planets present at 1 AU separation, there are only maybe one or two planets "missing", leading to the conclusion that the planet 3.3. Bias and significance of the data.</p><p>Here we add some statements about the significance of the observational data, in general. No massive planets (M sin i ≥ 2M J ) are found on short periods orbits (P ≤ 100 d) around single stars. This feature has been pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Udry et al (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zucker &amp; Mazeh (2002)</ref>. The same authors verified its statistical significance and examined the possible influence of binarity on the mass-period relation of exoplanets, an indication of potentially different formation and evolution processes for planets in binaries and planets around single stars. The observed feature is most probably not an observational bias since these objects are the easiest to detect.</p><p>The second important feature that emerges from observations is a planet shortage in in the 10 and 100-day periods, the "period valley", following <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Udry et al. (2003)</ref>. The features appearing in the planetary period distribution peak at short periods and rising at intermediate periods seem significant and not due to observational biases. The peak at short periods is formed by the pile-up of migrating planets, stopped close to the central star.</p><p>The rise of the distribution at longer periods is more clearly emerging thanks to the increase of the timebase of the radial-velocity surveys. More and more long period planets are being detected. This rise is significant in the sense that, for a given mass range, similar planets on shorter period orbits would have been easier to detect than the actual ones. The other, previously quoted feature is the lack of planets with M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J with P &gt; 100 days. This feature could be related to the observational bias inherent to the radial-velocity technique for planet search that makes the detection more difficult for distant and/or lighter planets. In order to check the statistical significance of the effect, <ref type="bibr">Udry et al. (2002)</ref> performed Monte-Carlo simulations. They conclude that the considered region is indeed empty of planets with a confidence level of about 99.97 %. This conclusion is only valid if the observational biases are correctly taken into account. For example, activity-induced radial-velocity jitter may screen planet detection. Another concern relates to the difficulty encountered when trying to actually derive the values for the orbital elements, which are different to just detecting radial-velocity variability.</p><p>As previously observed, a different point of view is that the probability that the effect is a real effect is only marginal. This comes from the fact that plotting the mass vs semi-major axis distribution, the lower edge of the distribution is close to following the line defined by constant stellar radial velocity amplitude (i.e. ∝ √ a).</p><p>More quantitative constraints for the different mass regimes will require a better detection by the surveys, to diminish the effect of the observational bias in the distributions and thus increase the confidence we can put in the derived trends, especially for the lower-mass planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Comparison with other studies</head><p>A comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref> is performed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>. In this plot the thick dashed line represents the model of this paper while the light solid line Trilling's prediction. As previously reported, using a model assuming a simple impulse approximation for the type II migration, no ad-hoc stopping mechanism in the center and neglecting type I migration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref> show that, for identical initial disk conditions, close-in surviving pseudoplanets have smaller masses and distant surviving pseudo-planets have larger masses. They also find that planets forming farther out migrate less rapidly and that higher-mass planets migrate on longer timescales. Thus, there</p><p>should be more massive planets at intermediate and large semi-major axes than found close-in. Conversely, the Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al (2002)</ref>, the present paper concludes that close-in surviving pseudo-planets have smaller masses and distant surviving pseudo-planets have larger masses. Differently from <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref>, in the model of this paper the pile-up of planets at small periods is naturally explained. In our model, the distribution of internal planets is naturally connected to the evaporation of planetesimals at very short radii. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref>, the observed peak at small separations is not reproduced because they have not introduced any process to stop migration close to the central star.</p><p>The lack of a peak in Trilling's result at small separation is clearly visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 3 (light solid line)</ref>, this last figure also shows that for r ≥ 3 AU Trilling's simulations give a larger number of planets than the present paper. In other words, the model of this paper gives a better prediction, with respect to Trilling's model, of the distributon of planets observed to date both at small and large radii, while at small radi the model of this paper is probably a better description of data, at larger radii future surveys may help determine whether the model of this paper or Trilling's is a better description of data. As is known, the radial velocity technique is most sensitive to planets at small semi-major axes, because the magnitude of the stellar wobble is greatest for close-in planets.</p><p>Additionally, since the highest precision radial velocity surveys have relatively short baselines of data, planets with longer periods are only beginning to be identified (e.g., 55 Cnc d, with ≃15 year orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Marcy et al. 2002)</ref>). Thus, a large population of Jupiter-like planets could be as yet undetected. Another interesting comparison is with Udry et al <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref>. The authors showed that: 1) No massive planets (M p sin i ≥ 2M J ) are found on short-period orbits (P ≤ 100 days) around single stars.</p><p>2) The maximum mass of detected planets per period interval increases with distance to the central star (their <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>).</p><p>3) The migration rate of planets decreases with increasing mass of the planetary companion.</p><p>4) Up to now, no planet candidates with very low masses (M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J ) have been detected in orbits with periods longer than ≃ 100 days.</p><p>5) There is a shortage of planets with periods in the 10-100 days range.</p><p>The previous results are in agreement with the results of this paper, except, partially, with point 4. In this paper, low-masses planets (M p sin i ≤ 0.75M J ) tend to move towards small periods, but some can be found at periods larger than 100 days. This could be due to the fact that planet detectability is poorer for increasing values of semi-major axis and small planet mass. If this feature is confirmed in future studies, showing a sharp feature in the period versus mass diagram, this could provide a proof of the importance of the runaway migration process recently studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Masset &amp; Papaloizou (2003)</ref>.</p><p>Our model, similarly to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trilling et al. (2002)</ref>, does not deal with the distribution of orbital eccentricities of the known radial velocity companions. The discussion of whether radial migration in gaseous or particulate disks produces eccentric orbits is an ongoing one (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ward 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ward , 1997b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryden et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kley 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Papaloizou et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murray et al. 2002)</ref>. The presence of high eccentricities suggests that multiple giant planet formation eccentricities. The stochastic nature of such interactions precludes their inclusion in an analysis such as the one we present. Further, until the orbital inclinations can be determined, an important clue to the genesis of the eccentricities is missing. Regardless of the mechanism(s) by which eccentricity is created, except for extreme cases, our results regarding the semi-major axis distribution are hardly affected 8 . Additional modest semi-major axis evolution associated with eccentricity pumping does not alter our results significantly. Dramatic three-planet interactions that would leave giant planets in vastly altered orbits and greatly affect our statistics are arguably rare. In summary, while we do not calculate eccentricities induced by gas drag in our one-dimensional model, the results based on the statistics of semi-major axis distribution remain robust.</p><p>We recall that <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Woolfson (2003)</ref> showed that even in a model of planet formation that produces planets on extensive eccentric orbits, the presence of a disk-like resisting medium can explain all types of planetary orbits that have been observed, when parameters are varied in a systematic manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the period and mass distribution of extra-solar planets, obtained using the migration model introduced in DP1. The results show several features of those distributions that are in almost all cases in agreement with observations. In the case of period distribution, the paper shows:</p><p>1) A pile-up of planets at a ≃ 0.05 AU.

In the case of a finite mass ratio between planet and disk, however, there is a feedback torque from the planet onto the disk, and the planetary migration timescale is seen to be a function of planetary masses (Lin &amp; Papaloizou 1986; Trilling et al. 1998; Bryden et al. 2000; Nelson et al. 2000; Kley 2000; D&apos;Angelo et al. 2002).
