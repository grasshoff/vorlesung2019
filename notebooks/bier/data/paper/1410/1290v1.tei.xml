				<p>A unique short-period (P = 0.65356(1) days) Mercury-size Kepler exoplanet candidate KIC012557548b has been discovered recently by Rappaport et al. (2012). This object is a transiting disintegrating exoplanet with a circum-planetary material-comet-like tail. Close-in exoplanets, like KIC012557548b, are subjected to the greatest planet-star interactions. This interaction may have various forms. In certain cases it may cause formation of the comet-like tail. Strong interaction with the host star, and/or presence of an additional planet may lead to variations in the orbital period of the planet. Our main aim is to search for comet-like tails similar to KIC012557548b and for long-term orbital period variations. We are curious about frequency of comet-like tail formation among short-period Kepler exoplanet candidates. We concentrate on a sample of 20 close-in candidates with a period similar to KIC012557548b from the Kepler mission. We first improved the preliminary orbital periods and obtained the transit light curves. Subsequently we searched for the signatures of a circum-planetary material in these light curves. For this purpose the final transit light curve of each planet was fitted with a theoretical light curve, and the residuals were examined for abnormalities. We then searched for possible long-term changes of the orbital periods using the method of phase dispersion minimization. In 8 cases out of 20 we found some interesting peculiarities, but none of the exoplanet candidates showed signs of a comet-like tail. It seems that the frequency of comet-like tail formation among short-period Kepler exoplanet candidates is very low. We searched for comet-like tails based on the period criterion. Based on our results we can conclude that the short-period criterion is not enough to cause comet-like tail formation. This result is in agreement with the theory of the thermal wind and planet evaporation (Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2013). We also found 3 cases of candidates which showed some changes of the orbital period. Based on our results we can see that orbital period changes are not caused by comet-like tail disintegration processes, but rather by possible massive outer companions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation, aims and sample selection</head><p>Our main aim is to search for comet-like tails similar to KIC012557548b and for long-term orbital period variations.</p><p>We are curious about frequency of comet-like tail formation among short-period Kepler exoplanet candidates. Close-in exoplanets, like KIC012557548b, are subjected to the greatest planet-star interactions. We therefore concentrate on the short-period exoplanet candidates with periods similar to KIC012557548b. Kepler mission exoplanet candidates are described in the catalog of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. (2013)</ref>. From this catalog we chose a sample of 20 candidates with the shortest orbital period. An overview of our sample is in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This sample covers the orbital periods in the range of 0.370 to 0.708 days, and stellar effective temperatures in the range of T ef f 3900 − 6600 K. Consequently, the incident flux hitting the exoplanet may not be exactly the same as in the case of KIC012557548b, but may slightly vary by about 1-2 orders of magnitude. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> An overview of our sample ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). This sample covers the orbital periods in the range of 0.370 to 0.708 days, and stellar effective temperatures in the range of T ef f 3900 − 6600 K. using the method of phase dispersion minimization (PDM) described later. The data were cut into segments each covering one orbital period. Each segment of data was fitted with a linear function. During the fitting procedure the part of the data covering the transit was excluded from the fit. Consequently, the linear trend was removed from each chunk of data (including the transit data). The final value of the orbital period was then found in this detrended data. Finally the data were phased with this new orbital period. We used phase 0.5 for transits. This method can effectively remove the long term variability (mainly variability of the host star due to spots and rotation) while it does not introduce any nonlinear trend to the phase light curve. To reduce the noise, the phased light curve was subject to a running window averaging. We used a window with the width of 0.01 and step of 0.001 (in units of phase) in all cases.</p><p>We searched for the signatures of a circum-planetary material in these light curves. For this purpose the final transit light curve of each planet was fitted with a theoretical light curve (see left panels in appendix A), and the residuals were examined for abnormalities (see mid panels in appendix A). We employed the <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> transit model with the free parameters: mid transit time T c (in TDB-based BKJD), period P (days), planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s , normalised semi-major axis (R p +R s )/a, line-of-sight inclination i (deg), and quadratic limb darkening parameters q 1 = (u 1 +u 2 ) 2 and q 2 = 0.5u 1 (u 1 +u 2 ) −1 parameterised as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kipping (2013)</ref>. We first compute the light curve for a single transit epoch, sampled at 0.0005 in phase (&lt; 1 minute sampling for a 1 day period candidate). The model light curve is then convolved with a box-car with width of 30 minutes, simulating the integration time of a long-cadence exposure. This template transit model is then interpolated using a B-spline, and evaluated at the time stamps of the observed light curve to arrive at the final model. To speed up the computation process, we reduce the number of points by selecting only the in-transit and 0.1 phase of the out-of-transit portions of the light curve for the fitting. This cropping of the light curve is justified since we are interested in only the distortions to the transit shape, not the out-of-transit variations. To find the best fit parameters and explore the degeneracies and uncertainties, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) minimisation using the emcee ensemble sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). To better account for sources of errors in the photometry, individual measurement errors of the light curves are inflated such that the reduced χ 2 is at unity before the MCMC routine, enabling a more realistic estimate the posterior probability distribution. The best fit parameters and their errors are derived from the marginalised posterior probability distributions after the MCMC analysis.</p><p>We also searched for possible long-term changes of the orbital period. First we improved the preliminary orbital period of the extrasolar planet using the method of phase dispersion minimization (PDM -Stellingwerf 1978; application PDM2 ver. 4.13 <ref type="bibr">1 -Stellingwerf 2004</ref>) and then using the Fourier analysis (FA). The detrended data were used for this purpose (as described earlier in this section). We assumed that the period changes linearly:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P = P 0 + βt (1)</formula><p>where β is a dimensionless value, but is often expressed in days/million years (d/Myr). The output from the analysis (PDM2 4.13 in this case) is a curve (see right panels in appendix A), which shows the dependence of Θ min as a function of β. Θ min is a dimensionless statistical parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stellingwerf 1978)</ref>. The minimum value of Θ min indicates the value of the period change -β.</p><p>For candidates where the PDM analysis indicated potential period variations, we broke the light curve into segments of 2000/4000 points, and re-performed the MCMC analysis. The minimisation is performed globally such that all the light curve segments are fitted simultaneously, allowing individual T c values for each segment of the light curve, but shared transit geometry parameters R p /R s , (R p + R s )/a, and i. We fixed P to the best fit period from the initial analysis. The fitted T c values are then inspected for non-linear variations with respect to the centre time of each light curve segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Exoplanet candidate KIC012557548b</head><p>To test the effectiveness of our techniques, we first applied the procedure, described above, to this exoplanet candidate. The transit light curve of KIC012557548b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>; analyzed by Budaj 2013), cropped to enhance the asymmetric features. It shows a significant pre-transit brightening, sharp ingress followed by a short sharp egress and long smooth egress, and a weak posttransit brightening.  very interesting. It shows a significant brightening just before the eclipse -pre-transit brightening, sharp ingress followed by a short sharp egress and long smooth egress, and a weak post-transit brightening ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budaj 2013)</ref>. A close-up of the transit features are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  2</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the candidate exhibits strong variability in the transit core on timescale of one day <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rappaport et al. 2012</ref>), and variability in the egress on the timescale of about 1.3 years (Budaj 2013). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rappaport et al. (2012)</ref> suggest that KIC012557548b is a slowly disintegrating/evaporating planet what creates a comet-like tail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budaj (2013)</ref> reanalyzed the light curve in detail and both validated the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling. Both brightenings are caused by the forward scattering on dust particles in the tail, which have typical radii of about 0.1-1 micron. Strong variability in the transit depth is a consequence of changes in the cloud optical depth.</p><p>Subsequently, we fitted the observed light curve with the theoretical model light curve, assuming a spherical planet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>, and obtained transit residuals of KIC012557548b <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> as per Section 3. The best fit quadratic limb darkening coefficients were q 1 = 0.98(8) and q 2 = 0.98(7). The best fit system parameters are: mid transit time T c = 0.0404(2) (BKJD), period P = 0.65355 days, planet-tostar radius ratio R p /R s = 0.3(1), normalised semi-major axis (R p + R s )/a = 0.60(5), and line-of-sight inclination i = 58(4) (deg). <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows a significant fluctuation in these residuals. This signature of the residuals indicate the circum-planetary material. The residuals also reveal the pretransit brightening between 0.39 &lt; P &lt; 0.45, as well as the smooth egress between 0.55 &lt; P &lt; 0.65. We can see the pre-transit brightening as a positive fluctuation, and the smooth egress as a negative fluctuation. Large scatter observed between 0.45 &lt; P &lt; 0.55 indicate the variability in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> The transit residuals of KIC012557548b obtained similarly as transit residuals in appendix A (see Section 3 and mid panels in appendix A). A standard Mandel-Agol transit fits this candidate poorly. We can see the pre-transit brightening between 0.39 &lt; P &lt; 0.45, as well as the smooth egress between 0.55 &lt; P &lt; 0.65. Large scatter observed between 0.45 &lt; P &lt; 0.55 indicate the variability in the transit depth. the transit depth. These additional features of transit residuals suggest the comet-like tail.  We then searched for evidence of transit-timing variations in KIC012557548b using the PDM method. Since KIC012557548b is close-in exoplanet candidate that is apparently being disintegrated and losing material, one might expect all kinds of interaction that could lead to the longterm period variation. That is why Budaj (2013) also searched for possible long-term changes of the orbital period with the PDM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stellingwerf 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr">application PDM2 4.13 -Stellingwerf 2004)</ref>. He obtained β = 0.3±0.5 d/Myr, which means that there is no significant evidence for the long-term period change. Since Budaj (2013) searched for possible long-term changes of the orbital period based on 14 quarters of Kepler data, we repeated this analysis using 17 quarters of data. We can confirm the author's result that there is no significant evidence for the long-term orbital period variation: β = 0.9 ± 1.1 d/Myr <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>). We also improved the orbital period of the exoplanet KIC012557548b and obtained P = 0.65355390 days using the PDM and P = 0.65355380 days using the FA method. These results are very similar to the fit period result. These values are also in the good agreement with the values reported in Rappaport et al. <ref type="formula">(2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budaj (2013), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">van Werkhoven et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Exoplanet candidate KIC3848972</head><p>The Kepler exoplanet candidate KIC3848972 is interesting for several reasons. Although the transit light curve ( <ref type="figure">Fig. A1</ref> -see left panel) does not show signs of a pre-transit brightening, post-transit brightening, nor significant variability in the transit depth, an other hand its transit is significantly deeper (0.002) then transits of other planets from our sample, and it has a V-type shape, which might indicate a grazing eclipsing binary. Subsequently, we fitted the light curve ( <ref type="figure">Fig. A1</ref> -see left panel) and obtained transit residuals of KIC3848972 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. A1</ref> -see mid panel). The transit residuals of KIC3848972 show only a linear downward trend from sine-like background variability. We obtained the best fit quadratic limb darkening coefficients of q 1 = 0.9(1) and q 2 = 0.9(3) for the star. The best fit system parameters are: mid transit time T c = 534.34045(5) (BKJD), period P = 0.37053 days, planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s = 0.18(8), normalised semi-major axis (R p + R s )/a = 0.71(4), and line-of-sight inclination i = 49(6) (deg). The parameter R p /R s = 0.0435, presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>, is very different from what we got for R p /R s , due to the degeneracy between R p /R s , inclination i, and (R p +R s )/a. Indeed Colón, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ford &amp; Morehead (2012)</ref>, based on a significant color change during the transit event, identify KIC3848972 as a false positive, which may consist of an evolved giant star that is redder and several magnitudes brighter than the eclipsing star. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Slawson et al. (2011)</ref> found an orbital period for this system that is twice as long. Moreower, we found a small difference between the odd and even transits in this system (0.000140) and a weak periodic background variability, which is very similar to an RS Canum Venaticorumlike distortion wave (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Luddington 1978)</ref>. That is why we consider the eclipsing binary alternative as possible. We also observed a similar peculiarity at KIC9761199 (see subsection 5.7). On <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> we can see that the sine-like distortion wave is extends throughout the double-period phase folded light curve. The distortion wave is slightly shifting in phase during the Kepler observations, but we always observed only one sine-wave. The background variations may potentially be due to spot modulation from one of the stars. The double-period phase-folded light curve of KIC3848972. The system exhibits a small difference between the odd and even transits, and a sinusoidal background variability.</p><p>Next we searched for long-term orbital period changes. First we improved the orbital period. We obtained period P = 0.37052870 days using the PDM and P = 0.37052750 days using the FA method, which are very similar to the fit period result. These values are also in the good agreement with the value P = 0.3705290 days, reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. (2013)</ref>. However, based on our period analysis, the two times alias orbital period is also possible. If the period is indeed two times longer, both stars would have very similar temperatures. <ref type="figure">Fig. A1</ref> -right panel shows that there is no significant evidence for the long-term period change (β = −0.8 ± 1.4 d/Myr).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Exoplanet candidate KIC8561063</head><p>The Kepler exoplanet candidate KIC8561063 is similar to the previous exoplanet candicate. It shows relatively deep transit (0.0015) with a V-type shape, which needs to be checked, since it may be indicative of an eclipsing binary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. A2 -see left panel)</ref>. An other hand, we do not find significant difference between the odd and even transits in this system. The light curve also does not show any signs of a pre-transit brightening, post-transit brightening, nor significant variability in the transit depth. We modelled the transit light curve and obtained transit residuals from 0.35 to 0.65</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">www.an-journal.org c 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim</formula><p>in phase units. They are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. A2</ref> -mid panel, and also do not show any signs of a comet-like tail. The fitting derived model has quadratic limb darkening coefficients of q 1 = 0.0001(8) and q 2 = 0.7(1). The best fit system parameters are: mid transit time T c = 488.7930(1) (BKJD), period P = 0.45329 days, planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s = 0.044(4), normalised semi-major axis (R p + R s )/a = 0.2(1), and line-of-sight inclination i = 76(2) (deg).

Its transit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. A18 -see left panel)</ref> is very deep (0.0045) and has a V-type shape, which might indicate a grazing eclipsing binary. The transit light curve does not show any signs of a pre-transit brightening, post-transit brightening, nor significant variability in the transit depth. Apart from that, the out-of-transit light curve exhibits a periodic background variability, which is very similar to an RS Canum Venaticorum-like distortion wave (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ludding- ton 1978)</ref>. That is why we consider the eclipsing binary alternative as possible. The background variability is also very similar to the distortion wave observed by KIC3848972 (see subsection 5.1), but contrary to the KIC3848972, this wave is stronger.

The parameter R p /R s = 0.06943, presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al.

The transit residuals show only a relatively stronger linear trend from sine-like background variability. Contrary to the KIC3848972, the linear trend in this case has an upward direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ofir &amp; Dreizler (2013)</ref> proposed that KIC9761199 is an eclipsing binary with twice the orbital period as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al.

We did not see any evidence of ellipsoidal and reflection phase variations from this system. In addition, the sinusoidal variability shifted in phase during the Kepler observations, suggesting that it is not due to beaming. The background variations may potentially be due to stellar spot modulation from both of the stars when we observe double sine-wave, and from one of the stars, when we observe single sine-wave throughout the double-period phase folded light curve.</p><p>Further we searched also for long-term orbital period change.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary and conclusions</head><p>Our main aim was to search for comet-like tails similar to KIC012557548b and for long-term orbital period variations. We were curious about frequency of comet-like tail formation among short-period Kepler exoplanet candidates. Close-in exoplanets, like KIC012557548b, are subjected to the greatest planet-star interactions. We therefore concentrated on the short-period exoplanet candidates with periods similar to KIC012557548b. We chose 20 exoplanet candidates observed by the Kepler mission, with the shortest orbital periods, ranging from 0.370 up to 0.708 days. We first improved the preliminary orbital periods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>) and obtained the transit light curves of our exoplanet candidates. Subsequently, we searched for the signatures of a circum-planetary material in these light curves. For this purpose the final transit light curve of each planet was fitted with a theoretical light curve, and the residuals were examined for abnormalities. We also searched for possible long-term changes of the orbital period using the method of phase dispersion minimization (PDM). For candidates where the PDM analysis indicated potential period variations, we broke the light curve into segments of 2000/4000 points, and re-performed the T c -free MCMC analysis. To test the effectiveness of our techniques, we first applied this procedure to KIC012557548b. The light curve of this c <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> An overview of the best fit parameters. Table contains the best fit qadratic limb darkening coefficients of the host stars (q 1 and q 2 ), and the best fit system parameters: mid transit time T c , period P , planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R s , normalised semi-major axis (R p + R s )/a, and line-of-sight inclination i. exoplanet is peculiar, caused by a pre-transit brightening, post-transit brightening and strong variability in the transit depth. Subsequently, we fitted the observed light curve with the theoretical model light curve, assuming a spherical planet, and obtained transit residuals. We observed a significant fluctuation in these residuals. We then searched for a long-term orbital period variation using the PDM method. Previously, Budaj (2013) obtained β = 0.3 ± 0.5 d/Myr using 14 quarters of Kepler data, indicating no change in the transit period. We repeated the analysis using 17 quarter of data, revealing no significant long-term period variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KIC Number</head><p>We then analyzed the transit light curves and residuals of our sample similarly as per KIC012557548b. We searched for significant fluctuations in these residuals, strong variabilities in the transit depth, pre-transit and posttransit brightenings in light curves, which could indicate presence of the circum-planetary material. In 8 cases out of 20 we found some interesting peculiarities (KIC3848972, KIC8561063, KIC6666233, KIC6047498, KIC9030447, KIC11774303, KIC9761199, KIC5972334). We found 4 cases of exoplanet candidates with relatively deep V-shape of the transits (KIC3848972, KIC8561063, KIC6047498, KIC9761199). We detected differences between the odd and even transits in 5 cases (KIC3848972, KIC6666233, KIC6047498, KIC11774303, KIC9761199). In cases of KIC3848972, KIC8561063, KIC6666233, KIC6047498, KIC11774303 and KIC9761199 we consider the eclipsing binary alternative as possible. Excepting KIC11774303, the PDM/FA based two times alias orbital period is also possible. We found 2 cases of exoplanet candidates with sinusoidal out-of-transit periodic background variability, which is very similar to an RS Canum Venaticorum-like distortion wave (KIC3848972 and KIC9761199). In addition, the sinusoidal background variability shifted in phase during the Kepler observations, suggesting that it is not due to Doppler beaming. The background variations may potentially be due to stellar spot modulation. The exoplanet candidate KIC9030447 is also peculiar, because its light curve shows a small brightening, approximately half a phase from the transit, and a secondary eclipse-like signal approximately at phase 0.85. Further we discovered that these additional features of the light curve slighly shifted in phase during the Kepler observations. Moreover, the secondary eclipse-like signal is changing its depth. That is why we consider the eclipsing binary on eccentric orbit alternative as more possible as exoplanet transits or stellar pulsations.</p><p>None of the exoplanet candidates shows signs of a comet-like tail. We did not find any significant fluctuations in residuals, strong variabilities in the transit depth, nor pre-transit and post-transit brightenings in light curves. We found only a linear downward/upward residual trend from sine-like background variability in cases of exoplanet candidates KIC3848972 and KIC9761199, and a small residual fluctuation in case of exoplanet candidate KIC9030447 due to the poor fit. It seems that the frequency of comet-like tail formation among short-period Kepler exoplanet candidates is very low. We searched for comet-like tails based on the period criterion. Based on our results we can conclude that the short-period criterion is not enough to cause comet-like tail formation. This result is in agreement with the theory of  the thermal wind and planet evaporation ( <ref type="bibr">Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2013)</ref>. This theory predicts that catastrophic evaporation, which leads into creation of a comet-like tail, can occure only in relatively low-mass planets with masses less than that of Mercury. Since all the exoplanet candidates out of 20 have planet-to-star radius ratio higher than 0.003 (see parameter R p /R s in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>; the value 0.003 approximately valids for the planet Mercury), they are likely to be more massive than Mercury and, consequently, lack the catastrophic evaporation contrary to KIC012557548b.</p><p>We also found 3 cases of candidates (KIC6047498, KIC9761199 and KIC5972334) which showed some changes of the orbital period. In one case (KIC5972334) we observed an orbital period increasing, other exoplanet candidates showed orbital period shortenings. Since the PDM analysis indicated a potential period variation in these cases, we broke the light curve into segments of 2000/4000 points, and re-performed the T c -free MCMC analysis. In case of exoplanet candidate KIC6047498 we found a semi-periodic TTV signal associated with the transit, indicative of an outer companion with an orbital period of &gt; 2000 days. In case of exoplanet candidate KIC9761199 this analysis also confirmed our results from the PDM analysis about long-term period change and revealed a periodic TTV signal with a period of ∼ 1500 days, indicative of a possible massive outer companion. In case of exoplanet candidate KIC5972334 this analysis did not find any TTV signal. Based on our results we can see that orbital period changes are not caused by comet-like tail disintegration processes, but rather by possible massive outer companions. Moreover, nor KIC012557548b with comet-like tail disintegration, did not show any long-term orbital period variation.</p><p>We also improved the preliminary orbital periods using PDM/FA methods. We did not confirm the preliminary orbital period in case of exoplanet candidate KIC5972334. We obtained period P = 15.35747382 days using the PDM and P = 15.36051120 days using the FA method, which is in the agreement with period P = 15.359 days found by <ref type="bibr">Stef- fen et al.
