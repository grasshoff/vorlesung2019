				<p>Prevalence of Earth-size Planets Orbiting Sun-like Stars In this thesis, I explore two topics in exoplanet science. The first is the prevalence of Earth-size planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. To determine the occurrence of planets having different sizes, orbital periods, and other properties, I conducted a survey of extrasolar planets using data collected by NASA&apos;s Kepler Space Telescope. This project involved writing new algorithms to analyze Kepler data, finding planets, and conducting follow-up work using ground-based telescopes. I found that most stars have at least one planet at or within Earth&apos;s orbit and that 26% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet with an orbital period of 100 days or less. The second topic is the connection between the properties of planets and their host stars. The precise characterization of exoplanet hosts helps to bring planet properties like mass, size, and equilibrium temperature into sharper focus and probes the physical processes that form planets. I studied the abundance of carbon and oxygen in over 1000 nearby stars using optical spectra taken by the California Planet Search. I found a large range in the relative abundance of carbon and oxygen in this sample, including a handful of carbon-rich stars. I also developed a new technique called SpecMatch for extracting fundamental stellar parameters from optical spectra. SpecMatch is particularly applicable to the relatively faint planet-hosting stars discovered by Kepler. i For Alana. ii</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Exoplanets: A Brief History</head><p>The study of extrasolar planets touches on some of the core questions that define us as a species: "Are there other Earths?" "Is there life among the stars?" and "Are there other beings that revel at the miracle of life and ponder their own origins?" These questions were debated by the philosophers of ancient Greece. Some, like Democritus (c. 460 -c. 370 BC) and Epicurus <ref type="bibr">(341 -270 BC)</ref>, thought that there were other planets like Earth. Epicurus wrote, "There are infinite worlds both like and unlike this world of ours . . . We must believe in all worlds there are living creatures and plants and other things we see in this world" <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Seager &amp; Lissauer 2010)</ref>. The idea that there might be a plurality of worlds was also considered, but rejected, by Plato (c. 420 -c. 348 BC) and Aristotle <ref type="bibr">(384 -332 BC)</ref>. Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy had a profound influence on Western thought, while only fragments of Democritus' and Epicurus' work survive today <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Billings 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Astronomical techniques capable of detecting extrasolar planets emerged in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1952, Otto Struve wrote a two-page paper outlining two techniques that could detect planets around other stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Struve 1952</ref>). The first technique involves looking for the slight wobble of a star as it is tugged by an unseen planetary companion. The wobble of a star can be detected by Doppler shifts in the star's spectral lines over a planet's orbital period. This technique is called the radial velocity (RV) or Doppler technique. For circular orbits seen edge on, the line of sight velocity of a planet hosting star is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v = M p M v p ,</formula><p>where M p and M are the masses of the planet and host star and v p is the orbital velocity of the planet. For inclined orbits, we replace M p by M p sin i where i is the orbital inclination. 1 Struve also noted that planets that happen to pass in front of their host stars as seen from Earth would dim their stellar hosts once per orbit. A transiting planet dims its host star by an amount equal to the fraction of the stellar disk blocked:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆F F = R P R 2 ,</formula><p>where R P and R are the planet and star radii, respectively. As a point of reference, Jupiter dims the Sun by 1%, while the Earth blocks only 0.01% of the Sun's light. The radial velocity and transit techniques have enabled the vast majority of exoplanet discoveries to date.</p><p>Doppler searches for extrasolar planets began in earnest the early 1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Campbell 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Marcy 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Mayor &amp; Maurice 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Latham 1985)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Latham et al.

From December 2009 to May 2013, Kepler took a picture of a 10 • ×10 • region of the sky in the constellation Cygnus every thirty minutes. On the ground, these images were converted into brightness measurements of ∼150,000 stars. Kepler has completely transformed our knowledge of planets outside the Solar System. The left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.1 shows known planets when Kepler was launched. We see a large population of giant planets with orbital periods of a year and longer, a number of hot Jupiters, which are favored by selection effects, and a small number of close-in planets the size of Neptune (4 R ⊕ ) and smaller. The right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.1 includes planets found in the first year of Kepler photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Batalha et al. 2013)</ref>. Planets with sizes between Earth and Neptune are common around other stars, while absent in our own Solar System.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Exoplanet Demographics</head><p>Once it became clear that other stars had planets, the natural next question is "what fraction of stars have planets?" The emerging field of exoplanet demographics parallels the work of Hertzsprung, Russell, and others a century ago. Just as the HR diagram shaped our understanding of stellar physics, the prevalence of planets with different sizes, orbital distances, and other properties is shaping our understanding of planet formation and evolution.</p><p>The key measured quantity in exoplanet demography is planet occurrence, f p , which is simply</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f p = N p N ,</formula><p>the number of planets divided by the number of stars. However, all planet surveys contain biases and selection effects, which require careful attention. Prior to Kepler , RV surveys probed giant planet occurrence out to ∼10-year orbits as well the occurrence of smaller planets on close-in orbits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref> found that 10.5% of Sun-like stars have a giant planet with an orbital period less than 5.5 years (Jupiter has a 12-year orbit). While these "exo-Jupiters" are reminiscent of the giant planets in our own solar system, they are often found on highly elliptical orbits in contrast to the nearly circular orbits of the Solar System planets. Hot Jupiters, while easy to detect, are relatively rare. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Marcy et al. (2005)</ref> found an occurrence of 1.2 ± 0.1% for hot Jupiters (P 12 d). Through intense monitoring of restricted stellar samples, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Howard et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref> found that close-in (P &lt; 50 d) planet occurrence rises steeply toward small planet sizes. Roughly 15% of GK stars have a 3-10 M E planet with P &lt; 50 d.</p><p>One way in which planet occurrence ties in with planet formation is through planet population synthesis modeling. These models attempt to capture the important aspects of planet formation physics to produce synthetic populations of planets that can be compared with observations. One such study is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ida &amp; Lin (2008)</ref>  Distance from Star (AU) When only planet mass is known, planet size is estimated according to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Weiss et al. (2013)</ref> mass-radius relationship. Two distinct populations of planets are visible. Longperiod giant planets (many of which are on eccentric orbits) and close-in "hot Jupiters" (which have inflated radii due to poorly understood processes). By 2012, this picture had changed dramatically with the analysis of just over one year of Kepler data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). Planets closer than 1 AU between the size of Earth and Neptune are a common outcome of planet formation, yet are absent in our own solar system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">PRECISION CHARACTERIZATION OF STARS</head><p>6 between 1 and 30 M E and P &lt; 1 year should be extremely rare. However, the RV surveys of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Howard et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref> and the Kepler -based surveys of <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Petigura et al. (2013a)</ref> showed that sub-Neptune-size planets are very common. The migration models have since been modified to more closely match the observed distribution of planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Mordasini et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Precision Characterization of Stars</head><p>Another component of my thesis involves the precise characterization of stars with extrasolar planets. Planet formation is believed to occur early in a star's lifetime. Millimeter observations of young stars show that gas disks dissipate within roughly 10 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Haisch et al. 2001)</ref>. Gas giant planets are thought to form during this time frame. In order to understand planet formation, we would like to observe planets during the process of formation. However, detecting planets around young stars is challenging due to high activity levels which hamper transit and RV methods. However, the composition of the host star offers a window into the protoplanetary disk from which planets form.</p><p>Stellar metallicity is thought to be a good tracer of the amount of solids available in a protoplanetary disk. There is a well-established correlation between giant planet occurrence and host star metallicity (Gonzalez 1997; <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Santos et al. 2004;</ref>. However, smaller planets are found around stars having a wide range of metallicities. This new trend was observed among the RV-detected planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Buchhave et al. 2012</ref>). The spectra taken during the course of RV planet detection surveys are valuable in probing the connection between planet and host star.</p><p>In Chapter 6, I study the carbon and oxygen abundances of over 1000 stars from the California Planet Search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Marcy et al. 2008</ref>). I find that planet-hosting stars have a wide range of carbon and oxygen abundances. Of particular interest are planets around stars with carbon to oxygen ratios approaching unity. Terrestrial planets in carbon-rich environments are thought to have radically different compositions compared to planets that form in environments with C/O &lt; 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kuchner &amp; Seager 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bond et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Another reason for studying host star properties is that in many cases, our understanding of planet properties is limited by our imperfect knowledge of the host star. In fitting a transit profile, we measure the planet-star radius ratio, R P /R , not on the physical size of the planet itself. Most stars in the Kepler field have photometrically determined stellar radii which are uncertain at the 35% level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Burke et al. 2014</ref>). Large uncertainties in planet size can hide features in the properties of large ensembles of planets. For example, any sharp features in the planet radius distribution that would indicate an important size scale for planet formation are smeared by planet radius errors.</p><p>Extracting stellar parameters for Kepler host stars presented new challenges compared to similar efforts for nearby stars. Stars in the Kepler field are typically ∼1 kpc from Earth. A Sun-like star at 1 kpc has V = 14.7. Traditional spectroscopic methods often utilize high SNR spectra. For example,  analyzed Keck HIRES spectra with</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Introduction</head><p>The Kepler Mission is ushering in a new era of exoplanet science. Landmark discoveries include Kepler -10b, a rocky planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>); the Kepler -11 system of six transiting planets ( ); earth-sized <ref type="bibr">Kepler -20e and 20f (Fressin et al. 2012</ref>); KOI-961b, c, and d -all smaller than earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Muirhead et al. 2012</ref>); and Kepler -16b a circumbinary planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Doyle et al. 2011</ref>). While Kepler has revealed exciting individual systems, the mission's legacy will be the first statistical sample of planets extending down to earth size and out to 1 AU. Kepler is the first instrument capable of answering "How common are earths?" -A question that dates to antiquity. Planet candidates are detected by a sophisticated pipeline developed by the Kepler team Science Operations Center. In brief, systematic effects in the photometry are suppressed by the Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) module, the output of which is fed into the Transiting Planet Search (TPS) module. For further information, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jenkins et al. (2010a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">INSTRUMENTAL NOISE IN KEPLER PHOTOMETRY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9</head><p>The Kepler mission was designed to study astrophysical phenomena with a wide range of timescales, which include 1-hour transits of hot Jupiters, 10-hour transits of planets at 1 AU, and weeklong spot modulation patterns. The PDC module is charged with removing instrumental noise while preserving signals with a vast range of timescales. We review sources of instrumental errors in § 2.2, highlighting the effects that are most relevant to transit detection.</p><p>The Kepler team has released candidate planets based on the first 4 and 16 months of data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>). Many of the candidates have additional followup observations from the ground and space aimed at ruling out false positive scenarios. In addition, statistical arguments suggest that 90-95% of all candidates and that ∼ 98% of candidates in multi-candidate systems are bonafide planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Morton &amp; Johnson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>While Kepler's false positive rate is low, its completeness is largely uncharacterized. If the completeness decreases substantially with smaller planet size or longer orbital periods, the interpretations regarding occurrence drawn from the  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref> catalogs will be incorrect. Hunting for the smallest planets, including earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, will require exquisite suppression of systematic effects. Without optimal detrending, systematic noise will prevent the detection of the smallest planets, possibly the habitable-zone earth-sized planets, which is the main goal of the Kepler mission. Therefore, it is essential for independent groups to develop pipelines that compliment both PDC and TPS. An early example of an outside group successfully identifying new planet candidates is the Planet Hunters project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Fischer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lintott et al. 2012</ref>), which uses citizen scientists to visually inspect light curves. In addition, existing pipelines from the HAT ground-based search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Huang et al. 2012</ref>) and the CoRoT space mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Ofir &amp; Dreizler 2012</ref>) have been brought to bear on the Kepler dataset yielding ∼ 100 new planet candidates.</p><p>We present the Transiting Exoearth Robust Reduction Algorithm (TERRA) -a framework for identifying and removing systematic noise. We identify systematic noise terms by searching for photometric trends common to a large ensemble of stars. Our implementation is tuned toward finding trends with transit-length timescales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Instrumental Noise in Kepler Photometry</head><p>The Kepler spacecraft makes photometric observations of ∼156,000 targets. Long cadence photometry is computed by summing all the photoelectrons within a predefined target aperture during a 29.4 minute integration. The Kepler team makes this "Simple Aperture Photometry" available to the scientific community <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Fraquelli &amp; Thompson 2012)</ref>. Simple aperture photometry contains many sources of noise other than Poisson shot noise. We illustrate several noise sources in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.1, where we show the normalized photometry (δF ) of KIC-8144222 ( <ref type="bibr">Kp = 12.4)</ref>. δF = (F − F )/F where F is the simple aperture photometry.</p><p>The dominant systematic effect on multi-quarter timescales is "differential velocity aber- We show a detailed view of KIC-8144222 photometry from Quarter 6 (Q6) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.1. The decaying exponential shapes are caused by thermal settling after data downlinks. Each month, Kepler rotates to orient its antenna toward earth. Since Kepler is not a uniformly colored sphere, changing the spacecraft orientation with respect to the sun changes its overall temperature. After data downlink, Kepler takes several days to return to its equilibrium temperature <ref type="bibr">(Jeffrey Smith, private communication, 2012)</ref>. KIC-8144222 photometry also shows a ∼0.1% effect with a 3-day period due to thermal coupling of telescope optics to the reaction wheels. We explore this 3-day cycle in depth in § 2.3.3.</p><p>Since all of the previously mentioned noise sources are coherent on timescales longer than one cadence <ref type="bibr">(29.4 minutes)</ref>, the RMS of binned photometry does not decrease as 1/ √ N , where N is the number of measurements per bin. In order to describe the noise on different timescales, the Kepler team computes quantities called CDPP3, CDPP6, and CDPP12 which are measures of the photometric scatter in 3, 6, and 12-hour bins. KIC-8144222 has CDPP12 35.4 ppm and is a low-noise star (bottom 10 percentile). For a more complete description of noise in Kepler data see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Christiansen et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>As a comparison, we selected stars which were similar to KIC-8144222 in position on the Field of View (FOV), noise level, and brightness (mod.out = 16.1, CDPP12 &lt; 40 ppm, 12.0 &lt; Kp &lt; 13.0). From this 13-star sample, we randomly selected 3 stars and show their light curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.1. The photometry from the comparison stars is strikingly similar to the KIC-8144222 photometry. Since much of the variability is correlated, it must be due to the state of the Kepler spacecraft. Common trends among stars can be identified and removed. The Kepler team calls this "cotrending," a term we adopt.</p><p>Correlated noise with timescales between 1 and 10 hours can mimic planetary transits and requires careful treatment. To illustrate the transit-scale correlations among a large sample of stars, we show a correlation matrix constructed from 200 Q6 light curves in Figure 2.2. The Kepler photometer is an array of 42 CCDs arranged in 21 modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Fraquelli &amp; Thompson 2012</ref>). We organized the rows and columns of the correlation matrix by module. We constructed the correlation matrix using the following steps:</p><p>1. We randomly selected 10 light curves from each of the 20 total modules 1 from stars with the following properties: 12.5 &lt; Kp &lt; 13.5 and CDPP12 &lt; 40 ppm.</p><p>2. To highlight transit-scale correlations, we subtracted a best fit spline from the photometry. The knots of the spline are fixed at 10-day intervals so that we remove trends 10 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Identification of Photometric Modes</head><p>We have shown that there is significant high-frequency ( 10 days) systematic noise in Kepler photometry. In order to recover the smallest planets, this noise must be carefully characterized and removed. We isolate systematic noise by finding common trends in a large ensemble of stars. This is an extension of differential photometry, widely used by groundbased transit surveys to calibrate out the time-variable effects of the earth's atmosphere. We find these trends using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). This is similar to the Sys-Rem, TFA, and PDC algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Tamuz et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kovács et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Twicken et al. 2010</ref>), but our implementation is different. We briefly review PCA in the context of cotrending a large ensemble of light curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">PCA on Ensemble Photometry</head><p>Consider an ensemble of N light curves each with M photometric measurements. We can think of the ensemble as a collection of N vectors in an M-dimensional space. Each light curve δF can be written as a linear combination of M basis vectors that span the space,   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.2: Top: Correlation matrix constructed from 200 Q6 light curves. The correlation (R-value) between two stars is represented by the gray scale, which ranges from 0.1 to 0.9. The diagonal elements have R = 1. The stars are ordered according to module and the red lines delineate one module from another. We enlarge several 10x10 regions in the lower panels. Stars in some modules (such as module 2) are highly correlated, while other modules (such as module 12) show little correlation. The module 22 -module 16 correlation matrix is an example of significant inter-module correlation. We observed the same patterns in a correlation matrix constructed from ∼ 1200 stars, but we show the 200-star correlation matrix so that individual elements are discernible as pixels.</p><p>V is an M x M matrix where the columns are the eigenvectors of D T D or "principle components," and the diagonal elements of S are the corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues {s 1,1 , . . . , s M,M } describe the extent to which each of the principle components capture variability in the ensemble and are ordered from high to low. The columns of U are the eigenvectors of DD T . Both U and V are unitary matrices, i.e. UU T = I and VV T = I.</p><p>As we saw in § 2.2, stars show common photometric trends due to changes in the state of the Kepler spacecraft. The most significant principle components will correspond to these common trends. If we identify the first N M ode principle components as instrumental noise modes, we can remove them via</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">δF i,cal = δF i − N M ode j=1 a i,j V j (2.2)</formula><p>where δF cal is an ensemble-calibrated light curve. However since the collection of {V i , . . . V M } spans the space, the higher principle components describe astrophysical variability, shot noise, and exoplanet transits. We must be careful not to remove too many components because we would be removing the signals of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">PCA implementation</head><p>We construct a large reference ensemble of light curves {δF 1 , . . . , δF N } of 1000 stars (12.5 &lt; Kp &lt; 13.5, CDPP12 &lt; 40 ppm) drawn randomly from the entire FOV. Before performing SVD, we remove thermal settling events and trends 10 days as described in § 2.2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Interpretation of Photometric Modes</head><p>In this section, we associate the variability captured in the principle components to changes in the state of the Kepler spacecraft that couple to photometry. The three-day cycle isolated in our first principle component is due to a well-known, three-day momentum management cycle on the spacecraft ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Christiansen et al. 2011</ref>). To keep a fixed position angle, Kepler must counteract external torques by spinning up reaction wheels. These reaction wheels have frictional losses which leak a small amount of heat into the spacecraft, which changes the PSF width and shape of the stars.</p><p>We can gain a more detailed understanding of this effect, by examining how the mode weights for each reference star corresponding to V 1 , i.e. {a 1,1 , . . . , a N,1 }, vary across the FOV. We display the RA and Dec positions of our 1000-star sample in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.4 and colorcode the points with the value of a i . The a 1 and a 2 mode weights show remarkable spatial correlation across the FOV. That a 1 is positive in the center of the FOV and negative at the edges of the FOV means the systematic photometric errors in these two regions respond to the momentum cycle in an anticorrelated sense. The telescope is focused such that the PSF is sharpest at intermediate distances from the center of the FOV. Since stars in the center and on the extreme edges have the blurriest PSFs (Van Cleve &amp; Caldwell 2009), they respond most strongly to the momentum cycle.</p><p>The mechanism behind the variability seen in V 2 is less clear. V 2 includes a high frequency component with a period of 1.68 hours. The Kepler team has also noticed this periodicity in the pixel scale <ref type="bibr">(Douglas Caldwell, private communication, 2012)</ref>. A possible explanation is thermal coupling of the telescope optics to a heater that turns off and on with a ∼20 minute period. The 1.68 hour variability would be an alias of this higher frequency with the observing cadence of 29.4 minutes. The gradient in a 2 across the FOV suggests the heater is coupled to the telescope optics in a tip/tilt rather than piston sense.</p><p>The higher-order components a 3 and a 4 do not show significant spatial correlation, which suggests that V 3 and V 4 are not due to changes in the local PSF. Since V 3 and V 4 have a ∼10-day timescale, they could be the high frequency component of the differential velocity aberration trend that was not removed by our 10-day spline.</p></div>

We achieve uniform residuals using only 2 of our modes as we show quantitatively below. The simplicity of our model buys some insurance against overfitting. The fact that the sign and magnitude of a 1 depends on distance from the center of the FOV supports the idea that the variability captured by V 1 is due to PSF breathing of the telescope which is driven by the three-day momentum management cycle. The gradient in a 2 could be due to the thermal coupling of an onboard heater to the optics in a tip/tilt sense. Mode weights a 3 and a 4 show no spatial correlation and do not seem to depend on changes in the PSF width. photometry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Conclusions</head><p>TERRA is a new technique for using ensemble photometry to self-calibrate instrumental systematics in Kepler light curves. We construct a simple noise model by running a highpass filter and removing thermal settling events before computing principle components. For a typical 12.5 &lt; Kp &lt; 13.5 and CDPP12 &lt; 40 ppm star, TERRA produces ensemblecalibrated photometry with 33 ppm RMS scatter in 12 hour bins. With this noise level, a 100 ppm transit from an exoearth will be detected at ∼ 3σ per transit.</p><p>A potential drawback of removing thermal settling events is discarding photometry that contains a transit. Thermal settling events amounted to 14% of the valid cadences in Q1-Q8 photometry. Since signal to noise grows as the square root of the number of transits, removing 14% of the photometry results in a 7% reduction in the signal to noise of a given transit. The completeness of the survey may decrease slightly, since some borderline transits will remain below threshold. One further complication arises due to the fact that gaps due 2.5.

Given the right epoch, a planet with a period that is a multiple of ∼ 30 days may repeatedly transit during a gap. Thus, removing gaps amounts to a more significant reduction of survey completeness for specific regions in period-epoch space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Ensemble-based cotrending is most effective when the timescales in the ensemble are matched to the signal of interest. We are skeptical that a "one size fits all" approach exists and we encourage those who wish to get the most out of Kepler data to tune their cotrending to the timescale of their signals of interest. We carry out an independent search of Kepler photometry for small transiting planets with sizes 0.5-8.0 times that of Earth and orbital periods between 5 and 50 days, with the goal of measuring the fraction of stars harboring such planets. We use a new transit search algorithm, TERRA, optimized to detect small planets around photometrically quiet stars. We restrict our stellar sample to include the 12,000 stars having the lowest photometric noise in the Kepler survey, thereby maximizing the detectability of Earth-size planets. We report 129 planet candidates having radii less than 6 R ⊕ found in 3 years of Kepler photometry (quarters 1-12). Forty-seven of these candidates are not in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref>, which only analyzed photometry from quarters 1-6. We gather Keck HIRES spectra for the majority of these targets leading to precise stellar radii and hence precise planet radii. We make a detailed measurement of the completeness of our planet search. We inject synthetic dimmings from mock transiting planets into the actual Kepler photometry. We then analyze that injected photometry with our TERRA pipeline to assess our detection completeness for planets of different sizes and orbital periods. We compute the occurrence of planets as a function of planet radius and period, correcting for the detection completeness as well as the geometric probability of transit, R /a. The resulting distribution of planet sizes exhibits a power law rise in occurrence from 5.7 R ⊕ down to 2 R ⊕ , as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>. That rise clearly ends at 2 R ⊕ . The occurrence of planets is consistent with constant from 2 R ⊕ toward 1 R ⊕ .

Cleanly measuring and debiasing this distribution will be one of Kepler's great legacies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>, H12 hereafter, took a key step, showing that the planet radius distribution increases substantially with decreasing planet size down to at least 2 R ⊕ . While the distribution of planets of all periods and radii contains a wealth of information, we choose to focus on the smallest planets. Currently, only Kepler is able to make quantitative statements about the occurrence of planets down to 1 R ⊕ .</p><p>The occurrence distributions in H12 were based on planet candidates 1 detected in the first four months of Kepler photometry ( ). These planet candidates were detected by a sophisticated pipeline developed by the Kepler team Science Operations Center ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Twicken et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jenkins et al. 2010a</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Understanding pipeline completeness, the fraction of planets missed by the pipeline as a function of size and period, is a key component to measuring planet occurrence. Pipeline completeness can be assessed by injecting mock dimmings into photometry and measuring the rate at which injected signals are found. The completeness of the official Kepler pipeline has yet to be measured in this manner. This was the key reason why H12 were cautious interpreting planet occurrence under 2 R ⊕ .</p><p>In this work, we focus on determining the occurrence of small planets. To maximize our sensitivity to small planets, we restrict our stellar sample to include only the 12,000 stars having the lowest photometric noise in the Kepler survey. We comb through quarters 1-12 (Q1-Q12) -3 years of Kepler photometry -with a new algorithm, TERRA, optimized to detect low signal-to-noise transit events. We determine TERRA's sensitivity to planets of different periods and radii by injecting synthetic transits into Kepler photometry and measuring the recovery rate as a function of planet period and radius.</p><p>We describe our selection of 12,000 low-noise targets in Section 3.2. We comb their photometry for exoplanet transits with TERRA, introduced in Section 5.2. We report candidates found with TERRA (Section 3.4), which we combine with our measurement of pipeline completeness (Section 3.5) to produce debiased measurements of planet occurrence (Section 3.6).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Best12k Stellar Sample</head><p>We restrict our study to the best 12,000 solar type stars from the perspective of detecting transits by Earth-size planets, hereafter, the "Best12k" sample. For the smallest planets, uncertainty in the occurrence distribution stems largely from pipeline incompleteness due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an Earth-size transit.</p><p>Our initial sample begins with the 102,835 stars that were observed during every quarter from Q1-Q9. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> From this sample, following H12, we select 73,757 "solar subset" stars that are solar-type G and K having T eff = 4100-6100 K and log g = 4.0-4.9 (cgs). T eff and log g values are present in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) which is available online. 4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.1 shows the KIC-based T eff and log g values as well as the solar subset. KIC stellar parameters have large uncertainties: σ(log g) ∼ 0.4 dex and σ(T eff ) ∼ 200 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011</ref>). As we will discuss in Section 3.4, we determine stellar parameters for the majority of TERRA planet candidates spectroscopically. For the remaining cases, we use stellar parameters that were determined photometrically, but incorporated a main sequence prior ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>). After refining the stellar parameters, we find that 10 of the 129 TERRA planet candidates fall outside of the T eff = 4100-6100 K and log g = 4.0-4.9 (cgs) solar subset.</p><p>From the 73,757 stars that pass our cuts on log g and T eff , we choose the 12,000 lowest noise stars. Kepler target stars have a wide range of noise properties, and there are several ways of quantifying photometric noise. The Kepler team computes quantities called CDPP3, CDPP6, and CDPP12, which are measures of the photometric scatter in 3, 6, and 12 hour bins ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jenkins et al. 2010a</ref>). Since CDPP varies by quarter, we adopt the maximum 6-hour CDPP over Q1-Q9 as our nominal noise metric. We use the maximum noise level (as opposed to median or mean) because a single quarter of noisy photometry can set a high noise floor for planet detection. One may circumvent this problem by removing noisy regions of photometry, which is a planned upgrade to TERRA. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.2 shows the distribution of max(CDPP6) among the 73,757 stars considered for our sample.</p><p>In choosing our sample, we wanted to include stars amenable to the detection of planets as small as 1 R ⊕ . We picked the 12,000 quietest stars based on preliminary completeness estimates. The noisiest star in the Best12k sample has max(CDPP6) of 79.2 ppm. We estimated that the ∼ 100 ppm transit of an Earth-size planet would be detected at SNR CDPP ∼ 1.25. 5 Given that Q1-Q12 contains roughly 1000 days of photometry, we expected to detect a 5-day planet at SNR CDPP ∼ 1.25 × 1000/5 ∼ 18 (a strong detection) and to detect a 50-day planet at SNR CDPP ∼ 1.25 × 1000/50 ∼ 5.6 (a marginal detection). In our detailed study of completeness, described in Section 3.5, we find that TERRA recovers most planets down to 1 R ⊕ having P = 5-50 days. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We ran TERRA on Q1-Q12 photometry, but we selected the Best12k sample before Q10-Q12 were available. 4 http://archive.stsci.edu/Kepler/kic.html 5 SNR CDPP , the expected SNR using the max(CDPP6) metric, is different from the SNR introduced in Section 3.3.2. SNR CDPP is more similar to the SNR computed by the Kepler team, which adopts SNR CDPP &gt; 7.1 as their detection threshold. We draw stars from the H12 solar subset for two reasons. First, we may compare our planet occurrence to that of H12 without the complication of varying occurrence with different stellar types. We recognize that subtle differences may exist between the H12 and Best12k stellar sample. One such difference is that the Best12k is noise-limited, while the H12 sample is magnitude-limited. H12 included bright stars with high photometric variability, which are presumably young and/or active stars. Planet formation efficiency could depend on stellar age. Planets may be less common around older stars that formed before the metallicity of the Galaxy was enriched to current levels. This work assesses planet occurrence for a set of stars that are systematically selected to be 3-10 Gyr old by virtue of their reduced magnetic activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">THE BEST12K STELLAR SAMPLE</head><p>The second reason for adopting the H12 solar subset is a practical consideration of our completeness study. As shown in Section 3.5, we parameterize pipeline efficiency as a function of P and R P . Because M-dwarfs have smaller radii than G-dwarfs, an Earth-size planet dims an M-dwarf more substantially and should be easier for TERRA to detect. Thus, measuring completeness as a function of P , R P , and R (or perhaps P and R P /R ) is appropriate when analyzing stars of significantly different sizes. Such extensions are beyond the scope of this paper, and we consider stars with R ∼ R .  Noise level is the maximum value of CDPP6 over Q1-Q9. Of the 73,757 stars that pass our cuts on T eff and log g, we select the 12,000 most quiet stars. The line shows max(CDPP6) = 79.2 ppm, corresponding to the noisiest star in the Best12k sample, well below the median value of 143 ppm.</p></div>

Our pipeline is called "TERRA" and consists of three major components. First, TERRA calibrates photometry in the time domain. Then, TERRA combs the calibrated photometry for periodic, box-shaped signals by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a finely-spaced grid in transit period (P ), epoch (t 0 ) and duration (∆T ). Finally, TERRA fits promising signals with a <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> transit model and rejects signals that are not consistent with an exoplanet transit.

For computational efficiency, we employ the "Fast Folding Algorithm" (FFA) of Staelin (1969) as implemented in <ref type="bibr">Petigura &amp; Marcy (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">in prep.)</ref>. Let P cad,0 be a trial period that is an integer number of long cadence measurements, e.g. P cad,0 = 1000 implies P = 1000 × 29.4 min = 20.43 days. Let N cad = 51413 be the length of the Q1-Q12 time series measured in long cadences.

In our search from 5-50 days, P cad,0 ranges from 245-2445, and we evaluate SNR at ∼ 10 5 different periods. At each P cad,i we evaluate SNR for P cad,0 different starting epochs. All told, for each star, we evaluate SNR at ∼ 10 9 different combinations of P , t 0 , and ∆T . Due to runtime and memory constraints, we store only one SNR value for each of the trial periods. TERRA stores the maximum SNR at that period for all ∆T and t 0 . We refer to this one-dimensional distribution of SNR as the "SNR periodogram," and we show the KIC-3120904 SNR periodogram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.3 as an example. Because we search over many ∆T and t 0 at each trial period, fluctuations often give rise SNR ∼ 8 events and set the detectability floor in the SNR periodogram. For KIC-3120904, a star not listed in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref> planet catalog, we see a SNR peak of 16.6, which rises clearly above stochastic background. We evaluate SNR over a finelyspaced, three-dimensional grid of P , t 0 , and ∆T . We store the maximum SNR for each trial period, resulting in a one-dimensional distribution of SNR. A planet candidate (not in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>) produces a SNR peak of 16.6 at P = 42.9 days, which rises clearly above the detection floor of SNR ∼ 8.</p></div>

We chose 12 as our SNR threshold by trial and error. Note that the median absolute deviation of many samples drawn from a Gaussian distribution is 0.67 times the standard deviation, i.e. σ MAD = 0.67σ STD . Therefore, TERRA SNR = 12 corresponds roughly to SNR = 8 in a BLS or TPS search.</p><p>Since TERRA only passes the (P ,t 0 ,∆T ) triple with the highest SNR on to DV, TERRA does not detect additional planets with lower SNR due to either smaller size or longer orbital period. As an example of TERRA's insensitivity to small candidates in multi-candidate systems, we show the TERRA SNR periodogram for KIC-5094751 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al.

Although the SNR periodogram shows two sets of peaks coming from two distinct candidates, TERRA only identifies the first peak. Automated identification of multi-candidate systems is a planned upgrade for TERRA. Another caveat is that TERRA assumes strict periodicity and struggles to detect low SNR transits with significant transit timing variations, i.e. variations longer than the transit duration.</p></div>

TERRA vets the TCEs in a step called "data validation," again following the nomenclature of the official Kepler pipeline. Data validation (DV), as implemented in the official Kepler pipeline, is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jenkins et al.

Adopting SNR = 12 as our threshold balances two competing needs: the desire to recover small planets (low SNR) and the desire to remove as many non-transit events as possible before DV (high SNR). As discussed below, only 129 out of all 738 events with SNR &gt; 12 are consistent with an exoplanet transit, with noise being responsible for the remaining 609. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.5, that number grows rapidly as we lower the SNR threshold. For example, the number of TCEs grows to 3055 with a SNR threshold of 10, dramatically increasing the burden on the DV component.</p><p>A substantial number (347) of TCEs are due to harmonics or subharmonics of TCEs outside of the P = 5-50 day range and are discarded.

We describe the four metrics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>.1 along with the criteria the TCE must satisfy in order pass DV. The metrics and cuts were determined by trial and error. We recognize that the TERRA DV metrics and cuts are not optimal and discard a small number of compelling exoplanet candidates, as discussed in Section 3.7.3.

In brief, SpecMatch compares a stellar spectrum to a library of ∼ 800 spectra with T eff = 3500-7500 K and log g = 2.0-5.0 (determined from LTE spectral modeling). Once the target spectrum and library spectrum are placed on the same wavelength scale, we compute χ 2 , the sum of the squares of the pixel-by-pixel differences in normalized intensity. The weighted mean of the ten spectra with the lowest χ 2 values is taken as the final value for the effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, and metallicity. We estimate SpecMatchderived stellar radii are uncertain to 10% RMS, based on tests of stars having known radii from high resolution spectroscopy and asteroseismology. For 27 stars where spectra are not available, we adopt the photometrically-derived stellar parameters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref>. These parameters are taken from the KIC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011</ref>), but then modified so that they lie on the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Demarque et al. (2004)</ref>. The resulting stellar radii have uncertainties of 35% (rms), but can be incorrect by a factor of 2 or more. As an extreme example, the interpretations of the three planets in the KOI-961 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Muirhead et al. 2012</ref>) changed dramatically when HIRES spectra showed the star to be an M5 dwarf (0.2 R as opposed to 0.6 R listed in the KIC).

Such a model has three free parameters: R P /R , the planet to stellar radius ratio; τ , the time for the planet to travel a distance R during transit; and b, the impact parameter. In this work, R P /R is the parameter of interest. However, b and R P /R are covariant, i.e. a transit with b approaching unity only traverses the limb of the star, and thus produces a shallower transit depth. In order to account for this covariance, best fit parameters were computed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We find that the fractional uncertainty on R P /R , σ(R P /R) R P /R can be as high as 10%, but is generally less than 5%. Therefore, the error on R P due to covariance with b is secondary to the uncertainty on R .</p><p>We show the distribution of TERRA candidates in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.7 over the two-dimensional domain of planet radius and orbital period.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Completeness of Planet Catalog</head><p>When measuring the distribution of planets as a function of P and R P , understanding the number of missed planets is as important as finding planets themselves. H12 accounted for completeness in a rough sense based on signal-to-noise considerations. For each star in their sample, they estimated the SNR over a range of P and R P using CDPP as an estimate of the photometric noise on transit-length timescales. H12 chose to accept only planets with SNR &gt; 10 in a single quarter of photometry for stars brighter than Kp = 15. This metric used CDPP and was a reasonable pass on the data, particularly when the pipeline completeness was unknown. Determining expected SNR from CDPP does not incorporate the real noise characteristics of the photometry, but instead approximates noise </p></div>

Moreover, identifying small transiting planets with transit depths comparable to the noise requires a complex, multistage pipeline. Even if the integrated SNR is above some nominal threshold, the possibility of missed planets remains a concern. We characterize the completeness of our pipeline by performing an extensive suite of injection and recovery experiments. We inject mock transits into raw photometry, run this photometry though the same pipeline used to detect planets, and measure the recovery rate. This simple, albeit brute force, technique captures the idiosyncrasies of the TERRA pipeline that are missed by simple signal-to-noise considerations.</p><p>We perform 10,000 injection and recovery experiments using the following steps:</p><p>1.

We do not, however, perform the visual inspection described in Section 3.3.</p><p>3. An injected transit is considered recovered if the following two criteria are met: (1) The highest SNR peak passes all DV cuts and (2) the output period and epoch are consistent with the injected period and epoch to within 0.01 and 0.1 days, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">Figure 6</ref>.12 shows the distribution of recovered simulations as a function of period and radius. Nearly all simulated planets with R P &gt; 1.4 R ⊕ are recovered, compared to almost none with R P &lt; 0.7 R ⊕ . Pipeline completeness is determined in small bins in (P ,R P )-space by dividing the number of successfully recovered transits by the total number of injected transits in a bin-by-bin basis. This ratio is TERRA's recovery rate of putative planets within the Best12k sample. Thus, our quoted completeness estimates only pertain to the low photometric noise Best12k sample. Had we selected an even more rarified sample, e.g. the "Best6k," the region of high completeness would extend down toward smaller planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Occurrence of Small Planets</head><p>Following H12, we define planet occurrence, f , as the fraction of a defined population of stars having planets within a domain of planet radius and period, including all orbital inclinations. TERRA, however, is only sensitive to one candidate (highest SNR) per system,  Results from the injection and recovery of 10,000 synthetic transit signals into actual photometry of randomly selected stars from our Best12k stellar sample. Each point represents the planet radius and orbital period of a mock transiting planet. The blue points represent signals that passed the DV post-analysis and where TERRA recovers the correct period and epoch. Signals that did not pass DV and/or were not successfully recovered, are shown as red points. Pipeline completeness is simply the number of blue points divided by the total number of points in each bin. The figure shows that for planet sizes above 1.0 R ⊕ , our pipeline discovers over 50% of the injected planets, and presumably accomplishes a similar success rate for actual transiting planets. The completeness for planets larger than 1 R ⊕ is thus high enough to compute planet occurrence for such small planets, with only moderate completeness corrections needed (less than a factor of 2). Note that we are measuring the recovery rate of putative planets in the Best12k sample with TERRA. Had we selected a lower noise stellar sample, for example the "Best6k," the region of high completeness would extend to even small radii.</p><p>so we report occurrence as the fraction of stars with one or more planets with P = 5-50 days. Our occurrence measurements apply to the Best12k sample of low-noise, solar-type stars described in Section 3.2.</p><p>In computing planet occurrence in the Best12k sample, we follow the prescription in H12 with minor modifications. Notably, we have accurate measures of detection completeness described in the previous section. In contrast, H12 estimated completeness based on the presumed signal-to-noise of the transit signal, suffering both from approximate characterization of photometric noise using CDPP and from poor knowledge of the efficiency of the planet-finding algorithm for all periods and sizes.</p><p>For each P -R P bin, we count the number of planet candidates, n pl,cell . Each planet that transits represents many that do not transit given the orientation of their orbital planes with respect to Kepler 's line of sight. Assuming random orbital alignment, each observed planet represents a/R total planets when non-transiting geometries are considered. For each cell, we compute the number of augmented planets, n pl,aug,cell = i a i /R ,i , which accounts for planets with non-transiting geometries. We then use Kepler's 3 rd law together with P and M to compute a/R assuming a circular orbit. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> To compute occurrence, we divide the number of stars with planets in a particular cell by the number of stars amenable to the detection of a planet in a given cell, n ,amen . This number is just N = 12,000 times the completeness, computed in our Monte Carlo study. The debiased fraction of stars with planets per P -R P bin, f cell , is given by f cell = n pl,aug,cell /n ,amen . We show f cell on the P -R P plane in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.10 as a color scale. We also compute d 2 f cell /d log P/d log R P , i.e. planet occurrence divided by the logarithmic area of each cell, which is a measure of occurrence which does not depend on bin size. We annotate each P -R P bin of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.10 with the corresponding value of n pl,cell , n pl,aug,cell , f cell , and d 2 f cell /d log P/d log R P .</p><p>Due to the small number of planets in each cell, errors due to counting statistics alone are significant. We compute Poisson errors on n pl,cell for each cell. Errors on n pl,aug,cell , f cell , and d 2 f cell /d log P/d log R P include only the Poisson errors from n pl,cell . There is also shot noise associated with the Monte Carlo completeness correction due to the finite number of simulated planets in each P -R P cell, but such errors are small compared to errors on n pl,cell . The orbital alignment correction, a/R , is also uncertain due to imperfect knowledge of stellar radii and orbital separations. We do not include such errors in our occurrence estimates.</p><p>Of particular interest is the distribution of planet occurrence with R P for all periods. We marginalize over P by summing occurrence over all period bins from 5 to 50 days. The distribution of radii shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.11 shows a rapid rise in occurrence from 8.0 to 2.8 R ⊕ . H12 also observed a rising occurrence of planets down to 2.0 R ⊕ , which they modeled as a power law. Planet occurrence is consistent with a flat distribution from 2.8 to 1.0 R ⊕ , ruling out a continuation of a power law increase in occurrence for planets smaller than 2.0 R ⊕ . We find 15.1 +1.8 −2.7 % of Sun-like stars harbor a 1.0-2.0 R ⊕ planet with P = 5-50 days.</p></div>

Below 2.8 R ⊕ , the occurrence distribution is consistent with flat. This result rules out a power law increase in planet occurrence toward smaller radii. Adding up the two smallest radius bins, we find 15.1 +1.8 −2.7 % of Sun-like stars harbor a 1.0-2.0 R ⊕ planet within ∼ 0.25 AU.

H12 observed a similar leveling off in their analysis which included planets larger than 2 R ⊕ . We fit the domains above and below 10.8 R ⊕ separately with power laws, df /d log P = k P P α . We find best fit values of k P = 0.185 +0.043 −0.035 , α = 0.16±0.07 for P = 5-10.8 days and k P = 8.4 +0.9 −0.8 ×10 −3 , α = 1.35±0.05 for P = 10.8-50 days. Speculatively, we extrapolate the latter power law fit another decade in period and estimate 41.7 +6.8 −5.9 % of Sun-like stars harbor a planet Earth-size or larger with P = 50-500 days. As in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.11, the gray portion of the histogram shows uncorrected occurrence while the red region shows our correction for pipeline incompleteness. Note that the number of detected planets decreases as P increases from 10.8 to 50 days, while occurrence remains nearly constant. At longer periods, the geometric transit probability is lower, and each detected planet counts more toward df /d log P .</p></div>

The Kepler pipeline should also be detecting these high SNR candidates.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>51</head><p>best chance for the detection of small, Earth-size planets in the Kepler field and will one day be among the stars from which η ⊕ -the fraction of Sun-like stars bearing Earth-size planets in habitable zone orbits-is estimated. In this work, we focus on the close-in planets having orbital periods of 5-50 days and semi-major axes 0.25 AU. Earth-size planets with these characteristics are statistically at the margins of detectability with the current ∼ 3 years of photometry in Kepler quarters Q1-Q12.</p><p>Our TERRA pipeline has two key features that enable confident measurement of the occurrence of close-in planets approaching Earth size. First, TERRA calibrates the Kepler photometry and searches for transit signals independent of the results from the Kepler Mission's official pipeline. In some cases, TERRA calibration achieves superior noise suppression compared to the Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the official Kepler pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Petigura &amp; Marcy 2012</ref>). The transit search algorithm in TERRA is efficient at detecting low SNR transits in the calibrated light curves. This algorithm successfully rediscovers 82 of 86 stars bearing planets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref>. Recall that the current version of TERRA only detects the highest SNR transit signal in each system. Thus, additional planets orbiting known hosts are not reported here. We report the occurrence of stars having one or more planets, not the mean number of planets per star as in H12 and elsewhere. Our pipeline also detects 37 planets not found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref> (19 of which were not in the catalog of the Kepler team as of August 8 th , 2012), albeit with the benefit of 6 quarters of additional photometry for TERRA to search.</p><p>The second crucial feature of TERRA is that we have characterized its detection completeness via the injection and recovery of synthetic transits in real Kepler light curves from the Best12k sample. This completeness study is crucial to our occurrence calculations because it allows us to statistically correct for incompleteness variations across the P -R P plane. While the Kepler Project has initiated a completeness study of the official pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Christiansen et al. 2012</ref>), TERRA is the only pipeline for Kepler photometry whose detection completeness has been calibrated by injection and recovery tests. Prior to TERRA, occurrence calculations required one to assume that the Kepler planet detections were complete down to some SNR limit, or to estimate completeness based on SNR alone without empirical tests of the performance of the algorithms in the pipeline. For example, H12 made cuts in stellar brightness (Kp &lt; 15) and transit SNR (&gt; 10 in a single quarter of photometry) and restricted their search to planets larger than 2 R ⊕ with orbital periods shorter than 50 days. These conservative cuts on the planet and star catalogs were driven by the unknown completeness of the official Kepler pipeline at low SNR. H12 applied two statistical corrections to convert their distribution of detected planets into an occurrence distribution. They corrected for non-transiting planets with a geometric a/R correction. They also computed the number of stars amenable to the detection (at SNR &gt; 10 in a single quarter) of each planet and considered only that number of stars in the occurrence calculation. H12 had no empirical way to determine the actual detection efficiency of the algorithms in the pipeline. Here, we apply the geometric a/R correction and correct for pipeline completeness across the P -R P plane by explicit tests of the TERRA pipeline efficiency, which naturally incorporates an SNR threshold correction as in H12.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.2">Planet Occurrence</head><p>H12 found that for close-in planets, the planet radius function rises steeply from Jupiter size to 2 R ⊕ . For smaller planets of ∼ 1-2 R ⊕ , occurrence was approximately constant in logarithmic R P bins, but H12 were skeptical of the result below 2 R ⊕ because of unknown pipeline completeness and the small number statistics near 1 R ⊕ in the  planet catalog. In this work, we strongly confirm the power law rise in occurrence from 4 to 2 R ⊕ using a superior assessment of completeness and nine times more photometry than in H12. Using TERRA, we can empirically and confidently compute occurrence down to 1 R ⊕ .</p><p>Our key result is the plateau of planet occurrence for the size range 1-2.8 R ⊕ for planets having orbital periods 5-50 days around Sun-like stars. In that size range of 1-2.8 R ⊕ , 23% of stars have a planet orbiting with periods between 5 and 50 days. Including the multiple planets within each system, we find 0.28 planets per star within the size range 1-2.8 R ⊕ and with periods between 5-50 days. These results apply, of course, to the Kepler field, with its still unknown distribution of masses, ages, and metallicities in the Galactic disk.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.10, TERRA detects many sub-Earth size planets (&lt; 1.0 R ⊕ ). These sub-Earths appear in regions of low completeness, and, provocatively, may represent just the tip of the iceberg. A rich population of sub-Earths may await discovery given more photometry and continued pipeline improvements. With 8 years of total photometry in an extended Kepler mission (compared to 3 years here), the computational machinery of TERRA-including its light curve calibration, transit search, and completeness calibrationwill enable a measurement of η ⊕ for habitable zone orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.3">Interpretation</head><p>We are not the first to note the huge population of close-in planets smaller or less massive than Neptune. Using Doppler surveys, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Howard et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref> showed that the planet mass function rises steeply with decreasing mass, at least for close-in planets. In Kepler data, the excess of close-in, small planets was obvious in the initial planet catalogs released by the Kepler Project ( ). H12 characterized the occurrence distribution of these small planets as a function of their size, orbital period, and host star temperature. These occurrence measurements, based on official Kepler planet catalogs, were refined and extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Youdin (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Traub (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Dong &amp; Zhu (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Beaugé &amp; Nesvorný (2013)</ref>, and others. Our contribution here shows a clear plateau in occurrence in the 1-2.8 R ⊕ size range and certified by an independent search of Kepler photometry using a pipeline calibrated by injection and recovery tests. The onset of the plateau at ∼ 2.8 R ⊕ suggests that there is a preferred size scale for the formation of close-in planets.</p><p>H12 and Youdin (2011) noted falling planet occurrence for periods shorter than ∼ 7 days. We also observe declining planet occurrence for short orbital periods, but find that the transition occurs closer to ∼ 10 days. We consider our period distribution to be in qualitative agreement with those of <ref type="bibr">H12 and Youdin (2011)</ref>. Planet formation and/or migration seems to discourage very close-in planets (P 10 days).</p><p>Close-in, small planets are now the most abundant planets detected by current transit and Doppler searches, yet they are absent from the solar system. The solar system is devoid of planets between 1 and 3.88 R ⊕ (Earth and Neptune) and planets with periods less than Mercury's (P &lt; 88.0 days). The formation mechanisms and possible subsequent migration of such planets are hotly debated. The population synthesis models of <ref type="bibr">Ida &amp; Lin (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Mordasini et al. (2012)</ref> suggest that they form near or beyond the ice line and then migrate quiescently in the protoplanetary disk. These models follow the growth and migration of planets over a wide range of parameters (from Jupiter mass down to Earth mass orbiting at distances out to ∼ 10 AU) and they predict "deserts" of planet occurrence that are not detected.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Hansen &amp; Murray (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Chiang &amp; Laughlin (2012)</ref> have argued for the in situ formation of close-in planets of Neptune size and smaller. In these models, close-in rocky planets of a few Earth masses form from protoplanetary disks more massive than the minimum mass solar nebula. Multiple planets per disk form commonly in these models and accretion is fast (∼ 10 5 years) and efficient due to the short dynamical timescales of close-in orbits. The rocky cores form before the protoplanetary disk has dissipated, accreting nebular gas that adds typically ∼ 3% to the mass of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2012)</ref>. But the small amounts of gas can significantly swell the radii of these otherwise rocky planets. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. (2008)</ref> found that adding a H/He gas envelope equivalent to 0.2-20% of the mass of a solid 5 M E planet increases the radius 8-110% above the gas-free value.</p><p>We find the in situ model plausible because it naturally explains the large number of close, sub-Neptune-size planets, the high rate of planet multiplicity and nearly co-planar and circular orbits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Fang &amp; Margot 2012)</ref>, and does not require tuning of planet migration models. Our result of a plateau in the planet size distribution for 1-2.8 R ⊕ with a sharp falloff in occurrence for larger planets along with decreasing occurrence for P 10 days are two significant observed properties of planets around Sun-like stars that must be reproduced by models that form planets in situ or otherwise and by associated population synthesis models. The in situ model seems supported by the sheer large occurrence of sub-Neptune-size planets within 0.25 AU. It seems unlikely that all such planets form beyond the snow line at ∼ 2 AU, which would require inward migration to within 0.25 AU, but not all the way into the star. Such models of formation beyond the snow line seem to require fine tuning of migration and parking mechanisms, as well as the tuning of available water or gas beyond 2 AU, while avoiding runaway gas accretion toward Jupiter masses. Still, in situ formation seems to require higher densities than those normally assumed in a minimum mass solar nebula <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2012</ref>) in order to form the sub-Neptune planets before removal of the gas. If this in situ model is correct, we expect these sub-Neptune-size planets to be composed of rock plus H and He, rather than rock plus water <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2012</ref>). Thus, a test of the in situ mode of formation involves spectroscopic measurements of the chemical composition of the close-in sub-Neptunes.

In brief, TERRA conditions Kepler photometry in the time-domain, removing outliers, long timescale variability (&gt; 10 day), and systematic errors common to a large number of stars. TERRA then searches for transit signals by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of prospective transits over a finelyspaced three-dimensional grid of orbital period, P , time of transit, t 0 , and transit duration, ∆T . This grid-based search extends over the orbital period range 0.5-400 days.</p><p>TERRA produced a list of "Threshold Crossing Events" (TCEs) that meet the key criterion of a photometric dimming signal-to-noise ratio, SNR &gt; 12. Unfortunately, an unwieldy 16227 TCEs met this criterion, many of which are inconsistent with the periodic dimming profile from a true transiting planet. Further vetting was performed by automatically assessing which light curves were consistent with theoretical models of transiting planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. We also visually inspected each TCE light curve, retaining only those exhibiting a consistent, periodic, box-shaped dimming, and rejecting those caused by single epoch outliers, correlated noise, and other data anomalies. The vetting process was applied homogeneously to all TCEs and is described in further detail in the SI.</p><p>To assess our vetting accuracy, we evaluated the 235 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) among Best42k stars having P &gt; 50 days which had been found by the Kepler Project and identified as planet "candidates" in the official Exoplanet Archive. 1 Among them, we found four whose light curves are not consistent with being planets. These four <ref type="bibr">KOIs (364.01, 2224</ref><ref type="bibr">KOIs (364.01, .02, 2311</ref>.01, and 2474.01) have long periods and small radii (see SI). This exercise suggests that our vetting process is robust, and that careful scrutiny of the light curves of small planets in long period orbits is useful to identify false positives.</p><p>Vetting of our TCEs produced a list of 836 eKOIs, which are analogous to KOIs produced by the Kepler Project. Each light curve is consistent with an astrophysical transit, but could be due to an eclipsing binary (EB), either in the background or gravitationally bound, instead of a transiting planet. If an EB resides within the software aperture of a Kepler target star (within ∼10 arcsec), the dimming of the EB can masquerade as a planet transit when diluted by the bright target star. We rejected as likely EBs any eKOIs with these characteristics: radii larger than 20 R ⊕ , observed secondary eclipse, or astrometric motion of the target star in and out of transit (SI). This rejection of EBs left 603 eKOIs in our catalog.</p><p>Kepler photometry can be used to measure R P /R with high precision, but the extraction of planet radii is compromised by poorly known radii of the host stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>. To determine R and T eff , we acquired high-resolution spectra of 274 eKOIs using HIRES spectrometer on the 10-m Keck I telescope. Notably, we obtained spectra of all 62 eKOIs that have P &gt; 100 days. For these stars, the ∼35% errors in R were reduced to ∼10% by matching spectra to standards.</p><p>To measure planet occurrence, one must not only detect planets but also assess what fraction of planets were missed. Missed planets are of two types, those whose orbital planes are so tilted as to avoid dimming the star and those whose transits were not detected in the photometry by TERRA. Both effects can be quantified to establish a statistical correction factor. The first correction can be computed as the geometrical probability that an orbital plane is viewed edge-on enough (from Earth) so that the planet transits the star. This probability is, P T = R /a, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.</p><p>The second correction is computed by the injection and recovery of synthetic (mock) planet-caused dimmings into real Kepler photometry. We injected 40,000 transit-like synthetic dimmings having randomly selected planetary and orbital properties into the actual photometry of our Best42k star sample, with stars selected at random. We measured survey completeness, C(P, R P ), in small bins of (P ,R P ), determining the fraction of injected synthetic planets that were "discovered" by TERRA (SI). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.1 shows the 603 detected planets and the survey completeness, C, color-coded as a function of P and R P .</p><p>The survey completeness for small planets is a complicated function of P and R P . It decreases with increasing P and decreasing R P as expected due to fewer transits and less dimming, respectively. It is dangerous to replace this injection and recovery assessment with noise models to determine C. Such models are not sensitive to the absolute normalization of C, only providing relative completeness. Models also may not capture the complexities of a multistage transit-finding pipeline that is challenged by correlated, non-stationary, and non-Gaussian noise. Measuring the occurrence of small planets with long periods requires injection and recovery of synthetic transits to determine the absolute detectability of the small signals buried in noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Planet Occurrence and Orbital Period</head><p>We computed f (P, R P ) in a 6 × 4 grid of P and R P shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.2. We start by first counting the number of detected planets, n cell , in each P -R P cell. Then we computed f (P, R P ) by making statistical corrections for planets missed because of non-transiting orbital inclinations and because of the completeness factor, C. The first correction augments each detected transiting planet by 1/P T = a/R , where P T is the geometric transit probability, to account for planets missed in inclined orbits. Accounting for the completeness, C, the occurrence in a cell is f (P, R P ) = 1/n i a i /(R ,i C i ), where n = 42,557 stars and the sum is over all detected planets within that cell. Uncertainties in the statistical corrections for a/R and for completeness may cause errors in the final occurrence rates of ∼10%. Such errors will be smaller than the Poisson uncertainties in the occurrence of Earth-size planets in long period orbits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.2 shows the occurrence of planets, f (P, R P ), within the P -R P plane. Each cell is color-coded to indicate the final planet occurrence: the fraction of stars having a planet with radius and orbital period corresponding to that cell (after correction for both completeness factors). For example, 7.7 ± 1.3% of Sun-like stars have a planet with periods between 25 and 50 days and sizes between 1 and 2 R ⊕ .</p><p>We compute the distribution of planet sizes, including all orbital periods P = 5-100 days, by summing f (P, R P ) over all periods. The resulting planet size distribution is shown in Planets with orbital periods of 5-100 days have a characteristic shape to their size distribution <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 3b)</ref>. Jupiter-sized planets (11 R ⊕ ) are rare, but the occurrence of planets rises steadily with decreasing size down to about 2 R ⊕ . The distribution is nearly flat (equal numbers of planets per log R P interval) for 1-2 R ⊕ planets. We find that 26 ± 3% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet (1-2 R ⊕ ) with P = 5-100 days, compared to 1.6 ± 0.4% occurrence of Jupiter-size planets (8-16 R ⊕ ).</p><p>We also computed the distribution of orbital periods, including all planet sizes, by summing each period interval of f (P, R P ) over all planet radii. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.3b, the occurrence of planets larger than Earth rises from 8.9 ± 0.7% in the P = 6.25-12.5 day domain to 13.7 ± 1.2% in the P = 12.5-25 day interval and is consistent with constant for larger periods. This rise and plateau feature was observed for 2 R ⊕ planets in earlier work Youdin (2011); <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Howard et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Two effects lead to minor corrections to our occurrence estimates. First, some planets in multi-transiting systems are missed by TERRA. Second, a small number of eKOIs are false detections. These two effects are small, and they provide corrections to our occurrence statistics with opposite signs. To illustrate their impact, we consider the small and long period (P &gt; 50 days) planets that are the focus of this study.</p><p>TERRA detects the highest SNR transiting planet per system, so additional transiting planets that cause lower SNR transits are not included in our occurrence measurement. Using the Kepler Project catalog (Exoplanet Archive), we counted the number of planets within the same cells in P and R P as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.2, noting those that did not yield the highest SNR in the system. Inclusion of these second and third transiting planets boosts the total number of planets per cell (and hence the occurrence) by 21-28% over the P = 50-400,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">R P = 1-4 R ⊕ domain (SI).</formula><p>Even with our careful vetting of eKOIs, the light curves of some false positives scenarios are indistinguishable from planets.  <ref type="formula">(2012)</ref> sample by false positives that were not removed by the Kepler Project vetting process. They determined that the largest source of false positives for Earth-size planets are physically bound stars with a transiting Neptunesize planet with an overall false positive rate of 8.8-12.3%. As we have shown ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4.2)</ref>, the occurrence of Neptune-size planets is nearly constant as a function of orbital period, in log P intervals. Thus, this false positive rate is also nearly constant in period. Therefore, we adopt a 10% false positive rate for planets having P = 50-400 days and R P = 1-2 R ⊕ . Planet occurrence, shown in Figs 4.2 and 4.3, has not been adjusted to account for false positives or planet multiplicity. The quoted errors reflect only binomial counting uncertainties. Note that for Earth-size planets in the 50-100 day and 100-200 day period bins, planet occurrence is 5.8 ± 1.8% and 3.2 ± 1.6%, respectively. Corrections due to false positives or planet multiplicity are smaller than fractional uncertainties due to small number statistics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Earth-Size Planets with Year-Long Orbital Periods</head><p>Detections of Earth-size planets having orbital periods of P = 200-400 days are expected to be rare in this survey. Low survey completeness (C ≈ 10%) and low transit probability (P T = 0.5%) imply that only a few such planets would be expected, even if they are intrisically common. Indeed, we did not detect any such planets with TERRA. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We can place an upper limit on their occurrence: f &lt; 12% with 95% confidence using binomial statistics. We would have detected one or two such planets if their occurrence were higher than 12%.</p><p>However, one may estimate the occurrence of 1-2 R ⊕ planets with periods of 200-400 days by a modest extrapolation of planet occurrence with P . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.5 shows the fraction of stars with 1-2 R ⊕ planets, whose orbital period is less than a maximum period, P , on the horizontal axis. This cumulative period distribution shows that 20.4% of Sun-like stars harbor a 1-2 R ⊕ planet with an orbital period, P &lt; 50 days. Similarly, 26.2% of Sun-like stars harbor a 1-2 R ⊕ planet with a period less than 100 days. The linear increase in cumulative occurrence implies constant planet occurrence per log P interval. Extrapolating the cumulative period distribution predicts 5.7 +1.7 −2.2 % occurrence of Earth-size (1-2 R ⊕ ) planets with orbital periods of ∼ 1 year (P = 200-400 days). The details of our extrapolation technique are explained in the SI. Extrapolation based on detected planets with P &lt; 200 days predicts that 5.7 +1.7 −2.2 % of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet on an Earth-like orbit (P = 200-400 days).</p><p>Naturally, such an extrapolation caries less weight than a direct measurement. However, the loss of Kepler's second reaction wheel in May 2013 ended observations shortly after the completion of the nominal 3.5 year mission. We cannot count on any additional Kepler data to improve the low completeness to Eartha analog planets beyond what is reported here. Indeed, low survey sensitivity to Earth analogs was the primary reason behind a fouryear extension to the Kepler mission. Modest extrapolation is required to understand the prevalence of Earth-size planets with Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars.</p><p>We offer empirical and theoretical justification for extrapolation out to 400 days. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Fig. 4</ref>.2, the prevalence of small planets as a function of log P is remarkably uniform. To test the reliability of our extrapolation into a region of low completeness, we used the same technique to estimate occurrence in more complete regions of phase space and compared the results with our measured occurrence values.</p><p>Again, assuming uniform occurrence per log P interval, extrapolating the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕ planets from 50-200 day orbits out to 400 days predicts 6.4 +0.5 −1.2 % occurrence of planets in the domain of R P = 1-2 R ⊕ and P = 200-400 days. The extrapolation is consistent with the measured value of 5.0 ± 2.1% to within 1 σ uncertainty. Futhermore, extrapolation based on 1-2 R ⊕ planets with P = 12.5-50 days predicts 6.5 +0.9 −1.7 % occurrence within the R P = 50-100 day bin. Again, the measured value of 5.8 ± 1.6% agrees to better than 1 σ.</p><p>While planet size is governed by non-linear processes such as runaway gas accretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Ida et al. (2013)</ref>, which favors certain planet sizes over others, no such non-linear processes occur as a function of orbital period in the range, 200-400 days. Extrapolation out to orbital periods of 200-400 days, while dangerous, seems unlikely to be unrealistic by more than factors of two.</p></div>

One may adopt F P = 0.25-4 F ⊕ as a simple definition of the HZ, which corresponds orbital separations of 0.5 to 2.0 AU for solar analog stars. This definition is more conservative than the range of published HZ boundaries that extend from 0.38 AU to 10 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Zsom et al.

Using the definition of F P and Kepler's third law, F P is proportional to P −4/3 . Therefore, uniform occurrence in log P translates to uniform occurrence in log F P . We find that the occurrence of 1-2 R ⊕ planets is constant per log F P interval for F P = 100-1 F ⊕ . If one were to adopt F P = 0.25-4 F ⊕ as the HZ and extrapolate from the F P = 1-4 F ⊕ domain, then occurrence of HZ Earth-size planets is 22% for Sun-like stars.</p><p>One may adopt alternative definitions of both the properties of Earth-size planets and the domain of the HZ. We showed previously that the occurrence of planets is approximately constant as a function of both R P (for R P &lt; 2.8 R ⊕ ) and P (in logarithmic intervals). Thus, the occurrence of planets in this domain is proportional to a logarithmic area in the R P -F P parameter space being considered. For example, the occurrence of planets of size 1.0-1.4 R ⊕ in orbits that receive 0.25-1.0 F ⊕ in stellar flux is 22%/4 = 5.5%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Conclusions</head><p>Using Kepler photometry of Sun-like stars (GK-type), we have measured the prevalence of planets having different orbital periods and sizes, down to the size of the Earth and out to orbital periods of one year. We gathered Keck spectra of all host stars of planets having periods greater than 100 days to accurately determine their radii. The detection of planets with periods longer than 100 days is challenging, and we have characterized our sensitivity to such planets by using injection and recovery of synthetic planets in the photometry. After correcting for orbital tilt and detection completeness, we find that 26 ± 3% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size (1-2 R ⊕ ) planet with P = 5-100 days. We also find that 11 ± 4% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet that receives nearly Earth-levels of stellar energy</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">(F P = 1-4 F ⊕ ).</formula><p>We have shown that small planets far outnumber large ones. Only 1.6 ± 0.4% of Sun-like stars harbor a Jupiter-size (8-16 R ⊕ ) planet with P = 5-100 days compared to 23 ± 3% occurrence of Earth-size planets. This pattern supports the core accretion scenario in which planets form by the accumulation of solids first and gas later in the protoplanetary disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Levy &amp; Lunine (1993)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Pollack et al.

The details of this family of models are hotly debated, including the movement of material within the disk, the timescale for planet formation, and the amount of gas accretion in small planets. Our measurement of a constant occurrence of 1-2.8 R ⊕ planets per log P interval establishes an important observational constraint for these models.</p><p>The occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with decreasing stellar light intensity from 100 F ⊕ down to 1 F ⊕ . If one were to assume that this pattern continues down to 0.25 F ⊕ , then the occurrence of planets having flux levels of 1-0.25 F ⊕ is also 11 ± 4%.</p><p>Earth-size planets are common in the Kepler field. If the stars in the Kepler field are representative of stars in the solar neighborhood, then Earth-size planets are common around nearby Sun-like stars. If one were to adopt a 22% occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in habitable zones of Sun-like stars, then the nearest such planet is expected to orbit a star that is less than 12 light-years from Earth and can be seen by the unaided eye. Future instrumentation to image and take spectra of these Earths need only observe a few dozen nearby stars to detect a sample of Earth-size planets residing in the habitable zones of their host stars.

The color scale shows survey completeness measured by injection and recovery of synthetic planets into real photometry. Dark regions represent (P ,R P ) with low completeness, C, where significant corrections for missed planets must be made to compute occurrence. The most common planets detected have orbital P &lt; 20 days and R P ≈ 1-3 R ⊕ (at middle-left of graph).

Section 5.3 describes "data validation," how we prune the large number of "Threshold Crossing Events" into a list of 836 eKOIs, analogous to KOIs from the Kepler Project. Section 5.4 shows four KOIs in the current online Exoplanet Archive <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akeson et al. (2013)</ref> that failed the data validation step. Section 5.5 describes the procedure by which we remove astrophysical false positives from our list of eKOIs. Section 5.6 describes how we refine our initial estimate of planet radii using using spectra of the eKOIs coupled with MCMC-based light curve fitting. Section 5.7 contains a description of the fundamental component of this study: measuring the completeness of our planet search by injecting synthetic transit light curves, caused by planets of all sizes and orbital periods, directly into the Kepler photometry, and analyzing the photometry with our pipeline to determine the fraction of planets detected. In Section 5.8 we provide details describing our calculation of planet occurrence and discuss the effects of multiplanet systems and false positives.</p></div>

(2013b)</ref>. We review the major components of TERRA below, noting the changes since P13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Time-domain pre-processing of raw Kepler Photometry</head><p>TERRA begins by conditioning the photometry in the time-domain. TERRA first searches for single cadence outliers, mostly due to cosmic rays. TERRA also searches for abrupt drops in the raw photometry known as Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Drops (SPSDs) discussed by Stumpe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Stumpe et al. (2012)</ref>. SPSDs are particularly challenging since they mimic transit ingress, and aggressive attempts to remove them run the risk of removing real transits. TERRA removes the largest SPSDs, but they remain a source of non-astrophysical false positives that we remove during manual triage (Section 5.3.2).</p><p>TERRA also removes trends longer than ∼10 days. In P13, this high-pass filtering was implemented by fitting a spline to the raw photometry with the knots of the spline separated by 10 days. But in this work we employ high-pass filtering using Gaussian Process regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Rasmussen &amp; Williams (2006)</ref>, which gives finer control over the timescales removed. We adopt a squared exponential kernel with a 5-day correlation length. After this high-pass filter, TERRA identifies systematic noise modes via principle components analysis on large number of stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Grid-based transit search</head><p>We search for periodic box-shaped dimmings by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a putative transit over a finely-spaced grid of period, P ; epoch, t 0 ; and transit duration, ∆T . In P13, we searched over a period range, P = 5-50 days, and over transit durations ranging from 1.5-8.8 hr. But in this work, we extend our search in orbital period to P = 0.5-400 days. Since we search over nearly three decades in orbital period, and because transit duration is proportional to P 1/3 , we let the range of trial transit durations vary with period. We break our period range into 10 equal logarithmic intervals. Then, using photometrically determined parameters for each star, namely M and R , we compute an approximate, expected transit duration (∆T circ ) for the simple case of circular orbits with impact parameter, b = 1. However, we actually search over ∆T = 0.5-1.5 ∆T circ to account for a range of impact parameters and orbital eccentricities and for mis-characterized M and R . As an example, <ref type="table" target="#tab_41">Table 5</ref>.2.2 shows our trial ∆T for a star with solar mass and radius. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Data Validation</head><p>If TERRA detects a (P , t 0 , ∆T ) with SNR &gt; 12, we flag the light curve for additional scrutiny. While the grid-based component of TERRA is well-matched to exoplanet transits, there are other phenomena that can produce SNR &gt; 12 events and contaminate our planet sample. We distinguish between two classes of contaminates: "astrophysical false positives" such as diluted eclipsing binaries (EBs), and "non-astrophysical false positives" such as noise that can mimic a transit. We establish a series of quality control measures called "Data Validation" (DV), designed to remove formally strong dimmings (i.e. SNR &gt; 12) found by the blind photometric pipeline that are not consistent with an astrophysical transit. DV consists of two steps:</p><p>1. Machine triage: Select potential transits by automated cuts.</p><p>2. Manual triage: Manually remove light curves that are inconsistent with a Keplerian transit.</p><p>Manual triage is accomplished by inspection of DV summary plots which contain numerous useful diagnostics necessary to warrant planet status. The diagnostics permit a multi-facted evaluation of the integrity (as a potential planet candidate) of a given dimming identified by the photometric pipeline. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.3 shows an sample DV report, this for KIC-5709725 that passed examination.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.3: DV summary plots for KIC-5709725. Top row: SNR "periodogram" of box-car photometric search for transiting planets, ranging from 0.5 to 400 days. The red dot shows the P and SNR of the most significant peak in the periodogram at P = 86.5 days (also found by the Kepler Project as KOI-555.02). Also visible is a second set of peaks corresponding to KOI-555.01 at P = 3.702 days. TERRA does not search for more than one planet per system. Moreover, KOI-555.01 would be excluded from our planet sample since P &lt; 5 days. The autocorrelation function,"ACF", plot at upper right shows the circular auto-correlation function from the phase folded photometry, used to identify secondary eclipses and correlated noise in the photometry. Second row: at left "Phase" shows the phase-folded photometry, where black points represent detrended photometry near the time of transit, green symbols show median flux over 30 min bins, and the dashed line shows the best-fitting Mandel-Agol transit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. At second from left, "Phased Zoom" shows a zoomed y-axis to highlight the transit itself. For this TCE, the transit model is a good match to the photometry. At third from left, "Phased 180" shows phase folded photometry 180 • in orbital phase from transit center. At fourth from left, "Secondary eclipse" shows how TERRA notches out the putative transit and searches for secondary eclipses. We show the photometry folded on the second most significant dimming. For KIC-5709725, this phase is 0.9 • relative to the primary transit, so close in phase that the primary transit is still visible. This transit does not show signs of a secondary eclipse. Transit SES -transit single event statistic as a function of transit number. Conceptually, SES is the depth of the transit in ppm, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Petigura and Marcy Petigura &amp; Marcy (2012)</ref>. "Season SES" shows the SES statistic grouped according to season. Bottom row: At left, "SES stack" shows SES for the entire light curve, split on the best-fitting transit period and stacked so that transit number increases downward. Compelling transits appear as a sequence of SES peaks at phase = 0 • . "Transit stack" shows for TCEs with fewer than 20 transits a plot of the TERRA-calibrated photometry of each transit (transit number increases downward).</p><p>The product of the DV quality control is a list of "eKOIs," for which most instrumental events identified preliminarily and erroneously by the photometric pipeline have been rejected. The resulting planet candidates are analogous to the KOIs Kepler Project. Astrophysically plausible causes (i.e. transiting planets and background eclipsing binaries) are retained among our eKOIs. We address astrophysical false positives in Section 5.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Machine Triage</head><p>Prior to the identification of final eKOIs, we carry out machine triage to identify a set of "Threshold Crossing Events" (TCEs) that can be classified by a human in a reasonable amount of time. TCE status requires a SNR &gt; 12; however, we find that 16227 light curves (out of the 42000 target stars) meet this criterion. Outliers and correlated noise are responsible for the majority of SNR &gt; 12 events. We show set of diagnostic plots for such an outlier in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.4. Here, an uncorrected sudden pixel sensitivity dropoff at t = 365.3 days, raises the noise floor to SNR∼15 for P 100 days. Its contribution to SNR is averaged down for shorter periods.</p><p>We flag such outliers by comparing the most significant period, P max , to nearby periods. We call the ratio of the maximum SNR to the median of the next tallest five peaks between [P max /1.4, P max × 1.4] the s2n_on_grass statistic. We require s2n_on_grass &gt; 1.2 for TCE status. After that cut, 3438 TCEs remain. We also require P max &gt; 5 d, which leaves 2184 TCEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Manual Triage</head><p>The sample of 2184 TCEs has a significant degree of contamination from non-astrophysical false positives. In P13, we relied on aggressive automatic cuts that removed nearly all of the non-astrophysical false positives (final sample was ∼ 90% pure). However, by comparing our sample to that of Batalha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Batalha et al. (2012)</ref>, we found that these automatic cuts were removing a handful of compelling planet candidates.</p><p>In this work, we aim for higher completeness and rely more heavily on visual inspection of light curves. We assess whether a TCE is due to a string of three or more transits or instead caused by outlier(s) such as SPSDs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.5 shows an example of a light curve that passed machine triage, but was removed manually. During manual triage, we do not attempt to distinguish between planets and astrophysical false positives. The end product is a list of 836 eKOIs, which are analogous to KOIs produced by the Kepler Project in that they are highly likely to be astrophysical in origin but false positives have not been ruled out. Here, an uncorrected SPSD at t = 365.3 days resulted in a SNR∼40 event with P = 353.965 days, seen in the SNR periodogram. SES stack plot shows this high SNR TCE is due to a single spike in SES due to the SPSD. P = 353.965 days is favored over nearby periods because the anomaly aligns with gaps in the photometry. We flag cases like this with our s2n_on_grass statistic. We find several nearby peaks with nearly equal SNR. For KIC-1570270, s2n_on_grass is less than our threshold of 1.2 and does not pass machine triage. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.5: DV summary plots (defined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5.</ref>3) for the KIC-1724842 TCE at P = 354.680 days that we removed during the manual triage. This photometry contains two pixel sensitivity drops spaced by 354.680 days. These two data anomalies combine to produce SNR = 16.035 event, which is substantially higher than the background ("grass" = 13.294) Since s2n_on_grass = 1.206 &gt; 1.2, this event passed our TERRA software-based triage. However, such data anomalies are easily identified by eye.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">KOIs That Fail Data Validation</head><p>As a cross-check of our DV quality control methods, we performed the same inspection on 235 KOIs that had been identified by the Kepler Project and which appear currently in the online Exoplanet Archive <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akeson et al. (2013)</ref>. These KOIs have periods longer than 50 days, representative of long period transiting planets that enjoy a reduced number transits (compared to short-period planets) during the 4-year lifetime of the Kepler mission. We found four KOIs, 2311.01, 2474.01, 364.01, and 2224.01, that are not consistent with an astrophysical transit. We show the raw light curves around the published ephemerides in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.6. All four have R P ≤ 2.04 R ⊕ , and three have P ≥ 173 days. Due to the small number of KOIs near the habitable zone, inclusion of these KOIs would bias occurrence measurements upward by a large amount. Vetting all 3000 KOIs in the Exoplanet Archive requires a substaintial effort, and is beyond the scope of this paper. However, these four KOIs are a reminder than detailed, expert, and visual vetting of DV diagnostics existing KOIs is useful. Figure 5.6: Four small KOIs with long orbital periods that fail our manual vetting. We show 4-day chunks of raw photometry ("SAP_FLUX" in fits table) around the supposed transits.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Removal of Astrophysical False Positives</head><p>We take great care to cleanse our sample of false positives (FPs). Some transits are so deep (δF 10%) that they can only be caused by an EB. However, if an EB is close enough to a Kepler target star, the dimming of the EB can be diluted to the point where it resembles a planetary transit. For each eKOI, we assess four indicators of EB status. Here, we list the indicators along with the number of eKOIs removed from our planet sample due to each cut:</p><p>1. Radius too large (115). We consider any transit where the best fit planet radius is larger than 20 R ⊕ to be stellar. Planets are generally smaller than 1.5 R J = 16 R ⊕ especially for P &gt; 5 days, where planets are less inflated. Our cut at 20 R ⊕ allows some margin of safety to account for mis-characterized stellar radii.</p><p>2. Secondary eclipse (44). The expected equilibrium temperature for a planet with P &gt; 5 days is too small to produce a detectable secondary eclipse. Therefore, the presence of a secondary eclipse indicates the eclipsing body is stellar. We search for secondary eclipses by masking out the primary transit and searching for additional transits at the same period. If an eKOI, such as KIC-8879427 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.7, has a secondary eclipse, we designate it an EB.</p><p>3. Variable depth transits <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Since Kepler photometric apertures are typically two or three pixels (8 or 12 arcsec) on a side, light from neighboring stars can contribute to the overall photometry. A faint EB, when diluted with the target star's light, can produce a dimming that looks like a planetary transit. If the angular separation between the two stars is large enough, the EB will contribute a different amount of light at each Kepler orientation. For eKOIs like KIC-2166206 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.8, the contribution of a nearby EB results in a season-dependent transit depths. Since the target apertures are defined to include nearly all ( 90%) of the light from the target star, variations between quarters produce a negligible effect on transits associated with the target star, i.e. fractional changes of 1%. We remove a small number of eKOIs <ref type="formula">(11)</ref> with V-shaped transits. Since planets are so much smaller than their host stars, ingress/egress durations are short compared to the duration of the transit, i.e. planetary transits are box-shaped. Stellar eclipses tend to be V-shaped. Limb-darkening, the 30-minute integration time, and the possibility of grazing incidence blur this distinction. We assessed transit shape visually rather than using more detailed approaches based on light curve fitting and models of Galactic structure Torres et al.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>96</head><p>(2011); Morton (2012). Only 1.3% of eKOIs are removed in this way and are a small effect compared to other uncertainties in our occurrence measurements.</p><p>We also remove five eKOIs with large TTVs. Since TERRA's light curve fitting assumes constant period, fits are biased toward smaller planet radii in the presence of transit timing variations ∆T . If the resulting error is 25%, we remove that eKOI. While these eKOIs are likely planets, our constant period model results in a significant bias in derived planet radii. Given the small number of eKOIs with such large TTVs, our decision to remove them has small effect on our statistical results based off of hundreds of planets.</p><p>We compute planet occurrence from the 603 eKOIs that survive the above cuts. We show the distribution of TERRA candidates and FPs on the P -R P plane in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.9. All 836 eKOIs are listed in   Season SES plot shows that the transit depths vary significantly for different observing seasons. Since the apparent dimming is a strong function of the orientation of the spacecraft, the dimming is likely not associated with KIC-2166206, but rather an EB displaced from the target by several arc seconds. </p></div>

SpecMatch compares a target stellar spectrum to a library of ∼ 800 spectra from stars that span the HR diagram (T eff = 3500-7500 K; log g = 2.0-5.0). Parameters for the library stars are determined from LTE spectral modeling. Once the target spectrum and library spectrum are placed on the same wavelength scale, we compute χ 2 , the sum of the squares of the pixel-by-pixel differences in normalized intensity. The weighted mean of the ten spectra with the lowest χ 2 values is taken as the final value for the effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, and metallicity. We estimate SpecMatch-derived stellar radii are uncertain to 10% RMS, based on tests of stars having known radii from high resolution spectroscopy and asteroseismology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Completeness</head><p>When measuring planet occurrence, understanding the number of missed planets is as important as the planet catalog itself. We measure TERRA's planet finding efficiency as a function of P and R P using the injection/recovery framework developed for P13. We briefly review the key aspects of our pipeline completeness study; for more detail, please see P13. We generate 40,000 synthetic light curves according to the following steps:</p><p>1. Select a star randomly from the Best42k sample, 2. draw (P ,R P ) randomly from log-uniform distributions over 5-400 d and 0.5-16 R ⊕ , 3. draw impact parameter and orbital phase randomly from uniform distributions over 0-1, 4. synthesize a Mandel-Agol model <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>, and</p><p>5. inject the model into the "simple aperture photometry" of a random Best42k star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">COMPLETENESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>101</head><p>We process the synthetic photometry with the calibration, grid-based search, and DV components of TERRA. We consider a synthetic light curve successfully recovered if the injected (P , t 0 ) agree with the recovered (P ,t 0 ) to 0.1 days. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.10 shows the distribution of recovered simulations as a function of injected planet size and orbital period. Pipeline completeness is determined in small bins in (P ,R P )-space by dividing the number of successfully recovered transits by the total number of injected transits on a bin-by-bin basis. This ratio is TERRA's recovery rate of putative planets within the Best42k sample. Pipeline completeness is higher among a more rarefied sample of low noise stars. However, a smaller sample of stars yields fewer planets.</p><p>We show survey completeness for a dense grid of P and R P cells in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.11. Completeness falls toward smaller R P and longer P . Above 2 R ⊕ , completeness is greater than 50% even for the longest periods searched (except for the R P = 2-2.8 R ⊕ , P = 283-400 days bin). Completeness falls precipitously toward smaller planet sizes; very few simulated planets smaller than Earth are recovered. Compared to a 1 R ⊕ planet, a 2 R ⊕ planet produces a transit with 4 times the SNR and is much easier to detect. For planets larger than 2 R ⊕ , we note a gradual drop in completeness toward longer periods, that steepens at ∼300 days. Above ∼300 days, the probability that a two or more transits land in data gaps becomes appreciable, and the completeness falls off more rapidly.</p><p>Measuring completeness by injection and recovery captures the vagaries in planet search pipeline. Real and synthetic transits are treated the same way, up until the manual triage section. Recall from Section 5.3.2 that 836 of 2184 TCEs pass machine triage. We perform no such manual inspection of TCEs from the injection and recovery simulations. A potential concern is that a planet may pass machine triage, but is accidentally thrown out in manual triage. Such a planet would be missing from our planet catalog, but not properly accounted in the occurrence measurement by lower completeness. However, because our SNR &gt; 12 threshold for TCE status is high, distinguishing non-astrophysical false positives and eKOIs is easy. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that they are cut during the manual triage stage, and do not expect the lack of manual vetting of the injected TCEs to bias our completeness measurements. .10: P and R P of 40,000 injected planets color coded by whether they were recovered by TERRA. Completeness over a small range in P -R P is computed by dividing the number of successfully recovered transits (blue points) by the total number of injected transits (blue and red points). For planets larger than 2 R ⊕ , completeness is &gt; 50% out to 400 d. Completeness rapidly falls over 1-2 R ⊕ and is 10% for planets smaller than 1 R ⊕ . </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.1">Occurrence of Earth-Size Planets on Year-Long Orbits</head><p>In the main text, we reported 5.7 +1.7 −2.2 % occurrence of planets with R P = 1-2 R ⊕ and P = 200-400 days based on extrapolation from shorter periods. The use of such extrapolation is supported by uniform planet occurrence per log P interval. Cumulative Planet Occurrence (CPO) is helpful to understand the detailed shape of the planet period distribution. If planet occurrence is constant per log P interval, CPO is a linear function in log P . The slope of the CPO conveys planet occurrence: the higher the planet occurrence, the steeper the slope of the CPO. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.12 shows CPO for R P = 2-4 R ⊕ planets. Planet occurrence increases with period from 5 days up to ∼ 10 days, and is consistent with uniform for larger periods.

The CPO steepens from 5 to ∼ 10 days, corresponding to increasing planet occurrence in the 5-10 day range. For P 10 days, the CPO has a constant slope, reflecting uniform planet occurrence per log P interval. Planet occurrence in the R P = 2-4 R ⊕ , P = 200-400 day domain is predicted to be 6.4 +0.5 −1.2 % by extrapolation from shorter periods, which is consistent with our measured value of 5.0 ± 2.1%.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.12, but showing the CPO for 1-2 R ⊕ planets.

(1993)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Pierrehum- bert and Gaidos Pierrehumbert &amp; Gaidos (2011)</ref> found it could extend to 10 AU for planets with thick H 2 atmospheres. Here, we adopt an intermediate value of 2 AU for solar analogs where the stellar flux is 1/4 that incident on the Earth. This outer edge is consistent with the presence of liquid water on Mars in its past. Mars might still have liquid water today, if it were more massive. Thus following the theory of planetary habitability, we adopt a habitable zone for stars in general based on stellar flux between 4x and 1/4 the solar flux falling on the Earth:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">F P = 0.25-4 F ⊕ .</formula><p>The stellar light flux hitting a planet, F P , depends linearly on stellar luminosity, L , and inversely as the square of the distance between the planet and the star. Stellar luminosity, L , is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">L = 4πR 2 σT eff 4 ,</formula><p>where σ = 5.670 × 10 −8 W m −2 K −4 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. In our study, the stellar radii and temperatures, T eff , are computed two ways. We obtained high SNR spectra with high spectral resolution using the Keck Observatory HIRES spectrometer for all of the 62 stars that host planets with periods over 100 days, approaching the HZ. For those 62 stars, we performed a SpecMatch analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Petigura et al. (2013b)</ref> to determine T eff and the surface gravity, log g, and metalicity, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. These stellar values were matched to stellar evolution models (Yonsei-Yale) to yield the radii and masses of the stars. The resulting values of stellar radii are uncertain by 10%, as determined by calibrations with nearby stars having parallaxes and hence having more accurately determined stellar radii. The values of T eff are accurate to within 2%. Thus, summing the fractional errors in quadrature, the resulting stellar luminosities for the 62 stars (having P &gt; 100 days) are measured but carry uncertainties of 25%. For those stars without Keck spectra, we adopted photometric stellar radius and mass, for which the stellar radii are in error by 35% and the T eff values are uncertain by 4%, giving errors in luminosity of 80%. We estimated the star-planet separation (a) using P , M , and Kepler's third law. The stellar light flux falling on a planet is now easily calculated from F P ∝ L /a 2 . In what follows, we quote the flux falling on a planet relative to that falling on the Earth. We find 10 planets having radii 1-2 R ⊕ that fall within the stellar incident flux domain of the habitable zone, 0.25-4 F ⊕ . As a reference, we plot their phase folded light curves in Figure 5.15 along with the KIC identifier, period, radius, and stellar light flux. To compute the prevalence of such planets within the HZ, we apply the usual geometric correction for orbital tilts too large to cause transits, augmenting the counting of each transiting planet by a/R total planets. We compute F P for each synthetic planet in our completeness measurement study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.16 shows stellar flux level and radii of the 10 habitable zone planets, having size 1-2 R ⊕ , along with the synthetic HZ planets from our completeness study. Because the number of synthetic trials is small for F P &lt; 1 F ⊕ , we compute occurrence using the 8 planets with F P = 1-4 F ⊕ . We find 11 ± 4% of Sun-like stars have a R P = 1-2 R ⊕ planet that receives F P = 1-4 F ⊕ light energy from their host star.</p><p>We account for the entire HZ (extending out to 0.25 F ⊕ ) by extrapolating occurrence in F P , assuming constant planet occurrence per log P interval.

Planet occurrence is constant from ∼ 100 F ⊕ down to ∼ 4 F ⊕ , beyond which, small number fluctuations are significant. Assuming the occurrence of planets is constant in log F P implies that the same number of 1-2 R ⊕ planets have incident fluxes of 1-0.25 F ⊕ as have fluxes of 1-4 F ⊕ where we computed directly the occurrence of planets to be 11%. Thus, 22 ± 8% of Sun-like stars have a R P = 1-2 R ⊕ planet within our adopted habitable zone with fluxes of 0.25-4.0 F ⊕ .   show TERRA-calibrated photometry folded on the best fit ephemeris listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_41">Table 5</ref>.2.

The actual rate of planet occurrence is higher than we report when the missed planets in these multi-transiting systems is included. (Note that this correction only applies to multi-transiting system and not all multi-planet systems.) We estimate the size of this effect using the Q12 sample of KOIs from the Kepler project, which includes stars with multiple planets. We selected the 1190 "candidates" with well-determined periods (σ(P ) &lt; 0.1 days) that orbit stars in the Best42k. In order to make a fair comparison between our planet sample and the Q12 sample, we computed the SNR of each of the 1190 candidates using TERRA. We excluded 82 KOIs with SNR &lt; 12, i.e. candidates that would have been deemed sub-significant by TERRA.</p><p>For each planet in a multi-transiting system, we rank order each candidate by its "Relative SNR" defined as:</p><p>Relative SNR = δF ∆T P . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">Figure 5</ref>.17 shows the distribution of Q12 candidates in the Best42k as points on the P -R P plane. We highlight points corresponding to the most significant planet. We assess the boost in planet counts due to multi-transiting systems for different domains in P and R P . For P &gt; 50 days and R P &lt; 4 R ⊕ , this multi-boost factor ranges from 21 to 28%, neglecting bins with fewer than 8 detected planets that suffer from small number fluctuations. Had we included additional planets, our occurrence measurements would rise by ∼ 25%, which is comparable to or slightly smaller than the fractional occurrence error for small planets in long-period orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.4">Correction due to False Positives</head><p>As discussed earlier, the sample of eKOIs is polluted by astrophysical false positives. Like the Kepler team, we do our best to identify and remove transits that are clearly due to eclipsing binaries, but cannot remove all eclipsing binary configurations. Thus, our sample, as well as those produced by the Kepler team, still contain a false positive component.  <ref type="formula">(2012)</ref> by FPs that were not removed by the Kepler Project vetting process. FPs include background eclipsing binaries, physically associated eclipsing binaries (hierarchical triples), and physically associated stars, which themselves have a transiting planet.

Planets that are either single or are the most significant planet in a multi-planet system are shown in red. Blue points correspond to additional planets in multi planet systems. For each cell with 10 or more planets, we compute the boost in planet counts due to multiplanet systems, the total number of planets divide by the number of most significant planets. For planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ and P 50 days, the boost ranges from 21-28%. Thus, including multis, we expect ∼ 25% higher occurrence.</p><p>12.3 ± 3.0% for 0.8-1.25 R ⊕ planets. Again, note that this fractional occurrence correction is small compared to our reported errors for small planets in long-period orbits. Stars with bound companions with transiting planets are the dominant fraction of FPs for small planets (76% for 1.25-2.0 R ⊕ planets and 66% for 0.8-1.25 R ⊕ planets). FPs of this type are very difficult to identify. A Sun-like star with V = 14.7 mag (typical for our sample) is 1 kpc away. The binary star separation distribution peaks at 50 AU Raghavan et al. <ref type="formula">(2010)</ref> or 0.05 arcsec assuming a face-on orbit. Detecting companions separated by 0.05 arcsec is near the limits of current ground-based AO. Even if a companion was detected, we still wouldn't know which star harbored the transiting planet.</p><p>We adopt a 10% FP rate for planets having P = 50-400 days and R P = 1-2 R ⊕ . Adopting a false positive rate that is constant with period is justified because the occurrence of Neptune-sized planets is approximately constant with period, as shown in the main text. In the context of the occurrence of Earth-size planets with P = 200-400 days (5.7 +1.7 −2.2 %) and Earth-size planets in the HZ (22 ± 8%), FPs contribute 10% fractional uncertainty and are secondary compared to statistical uncertainty.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akeson et al.

The general consensus is that the weak, forbidden <ref type="bibr">[OI]</ref> transition at 6300 Å is the best indicator because it is less sensitive to departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium than other indicators. In dwarf stars, this line suffers from a significant NiI blend, which is an isotopic splitting of 58 Ni and 60 Ni ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Johansson et al. 2003</ref>).

Iodine lines are ∼ 0.5% deep in the CI region-comparable to the photon noise. In the [OI] region, they are a ∼ 5% effect and must be removed. For a given iodine cell in observation, we locate the most recent iodine observation (usually at the beginning of the night). We account for any shift of the CCD between the two observations by cross-correlating spectral orders 8, 9, and 10 (λ = 5608 -5895Å, where the iodine lines are strongest). After removing any shift, we divide the iodine cell in observations by the iodine reference observations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">Figure 6</ref>.7 shows a stellar spectrum, an iodine spectrum, and the ratio of the two.</p><p>Dividing the iodine spectrum from an iodine cell in spectrum cannot be done to within photon statistics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.5">Fitting Abundances</head><p>We converge on abundance by iterating three χ 2 minimization routines that fit the continuum, line center, and abundance.

A short description of each routine is given below:</p><p>1. Continuum. Given the shallowness of our indicators, a small error in the continuum level will have a significant effect on the derived abundance. We refine the continuum value by registering the level of the spectrum so that χ 2 is minimized.</p><p>2. Line center. The wavelength zero point and dispersion is initially determined from a thorium lamp calibration taken each night and refined by cross-correlating the observed spectrum with the solar spectrum.

For example, at 5000K, the line depth in a solar analog is 1%. We do not report carbon abundances for stars cooler than 5300 K.</p><p>3. Statistical scatter. We choose to report abundances for stars where the scatter in derived abundance is less than 0.30 dex or, in other words, stars where our measurements are precise to a factor of 2. Our estimates of measurement precision are based on empirical scatter and a Monte Carlo analysis, which we describe in sections § 6.4.2 &amp; § 6.4.3. While our measurement precision is based on a variety of factors including line depth and signal to noise, stars that fail this cut generally have sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances.</p><p>With our large stellar sample, it is possible to detect and correct for systematic trends that would be invisible in smaller samples. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">Figure 6</ref>.9 shows carbon and oxygen abundances plotted against temperature. We believe that the Kurucz (1992) model atmospheres are most accurate for solar analogs and that errors in the atmosphere profile grows as we move away from T ef f = T = 5770 K.</p><p>We model the systematic behavior of implied abundance with T eff by fitting a cubic to the data. Simply subtracting out the cubic would artificially force the mean [X/H] to zero, but there is no reason why the mean disk abundance should be solar. Therefore, we let the solar abundance fix the constant term in the cubic by requiring the systematic correction be zero at 5770 K. This correction reaches 0.11 dex for oxygen and 0.15 dex for carbon. We have removed the temperature trend for all abundances quoted henceforth.</p><p>By removing abundance trends with T eff for the sake of correcting errors in atmosphere models, we may have erased a real astrophysical trend of [X/H] with T eff . For example, hotter stars are more massive and have shorter main sequence lifetimes than cool stars. Therefore, the hotter stars in our sample are on average younger and formed at a later time in the galactic chemical enrichment history. However, we chose to remove the T eff trends because we believe uncertainties in atmospheric models are the dominant effect.</p><p>We report our temperature-corrected values for [O/H] and [C/H] with 85% and 15% confidence limits along with other stellar data in the Appendix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.3">Nickel Systematics</head><p>Since we are deriving oxygen from a line that is blended with nickel, the errors in nickel abundance are covariant with errors in oxygen abundance. FV05 quote a uniform error of 0.03 dex for their nickel measurements. The amount that <ref type="bibr">[OI]</ref> and NiI contribute to the blend is different for every star. Therefore, we evaluate the effect of the 0.03 dex error in nickel abundance on oxygen abundance on a star-by-star basis. We begin with a synthetic spectrum at our quoted oxygen abundance. We then refit the oxygen line to a spectrum with 0.03 dex more and 0.03 dex less nickel. These errors are added in quadrature to the statistical errors.</p><p>There are many other sources of systematic error in our abundance measurements such as inaccurate solar reference abundances, additional blends, and our assumption of LTE. However, these effects should be largely consistent between stars, so we expect them to contribute little to errors in our differential abundances.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Introduction</head><p>The ability to extract fundamental stellar parameters from spectra is essential in understanding a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from exoplanet host star characterization to the study of galactic stellar kinematics and chemical enrichment history. Recently, research in extrasolar planets has spawned a renewed interest in the fundamental properties (e.g. masses, radii, effective temperates, ages) of stars, particularly for M-dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boyajian et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mann et al. 2013</ref>). New observational techniques such as asteroseismology using space-based photometers like <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Chaplin et al. 2014</ref>) and interferometric measurements of stellar radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boyajian et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boyajian et al. , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">von Braun et al. 2014</ref>) are providing new empirical touchstones that serve to improve spectroscopic methods.</p><p>The observation, analysis, and interpretation of exoplanets is closely linked to the fundamental properties of their host stars. In some cases, the presence of an extrasolar planet can improve our knowledge of the host star beyond that from spectroscopy or photometry alone. For example, the transit profile can constrain mean stellar density, ρ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Torres et al. (2012)</ref> used transit-constrained ρ to refine host star properties beyond existing spectroscopic analyses. In most cases, however, knowledge of planetary properties like planet mass, size, and equilibrium temperature is limited by our knowledge of stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature.</p><p>In this paper, we present a new technique called SpecMatch that extracts the following properties from high-resolution optical spectra: effective temperatures, T eff ; surface gravities, log g; metallicities, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>; and projected rotational velocities, v sin i. Throughout this paper, T eff is measured in Kelvin; log g is log 10 (g) = GM /R 2 , measured in cgs units; metallicity is [Fe/H] = log 10 (n Fe /n H ) − log 10 (n Fe, /n H, ), where n Fe and n H are the number densities of iron and hydrogen, respectively; and v sin i is measured in km s −1 .</p><p>Here, we briefly review the processes that connect an observed stellar spectrum to the physical properties of the star (for a more thorough review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gray 2005</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>202</head><p>temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and rotation all affect the depths and detailed shapes of spectral lines. The dependence is perhaps the most straightforward; stars with higher <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, have deeper iron lines. The energy level populations of absorber species is set by the Boltzmann equation for neutral species, and by the Saha equation for ionized species. Both the Boltzmann and Saha equations have an exponential sensitivity to temperature. Thus the relative strength of different lines having different excitation potentials is a good diagnostic of temperature.</p><p>Surface gravity is much harder to measure. The Saha equation has a linear dependence on the local electron pressure which is a probe of the surface gravity. One diagnostic of log g is the relative strength of lines corresponding to different ionization states of the same element. Fe I and Fe II are often used. Another approach involves modeling the wings of so-called "pressure-sensitive" lines like Na I D doublet, Ca II H&amp;K, Mg I b triplet, and Ca I at 4227 Å. However, modeling in detail how, as an example, the Mg I b line profile changes with differing surface gravities is challenging, especially considering the covariant effects of temperature and Mg abundance. Temperature, surface gravity and metallicity all influence a star's spectrum in different, but non-orthogonal ways. Measurements of T eff , log g, [Fe/H] are often complicated by covariances between all three parameters.</p><p>Lastly, rotation broadens spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Lines formed at the receding limb of the star are red-shifted and blue shifted if they are formed on the approaching limb. Rotation is relatively easy to measure in the case of moderate stellar rotation (v sin i 5 km s −1 ) by fitting the profiles of unsaturated lines. For slowly rotating stars, rotational broadening becomes sub-dominant compared to other broadening terms like, macroturbulence, microturbulence, thermal broadening, pressure broadening, and the instrumental profile of the spectrometer.</p><p>Determining T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin i for planet-hosting stars has a wide variety of applications. Combining spectroscopic T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> with isochrone-fitting offers dramatic improvements over photometrically determined stellar masses, radii, and luminosities, which result in more precise planet masses, radii, and equilibrium temperatures. For example, photometric radii from the Kepler Input Catalog are uncertain at at the ∼35% level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Burke et al. 2014</ref>) while spectroscopicallyderived radii have uncertainties ranging from 1-10%, depending on the type of star . Correlations between planet occurrence and stellar metallicity probe the connection between planet formation efficiency and the composition of the protoplanetary disk. Projected rotational velocity can constrain the inclination of the stellar spin axis (and star-planet spin orbit alignment) if the star's equatorial velocity is known (by, for example, rotation modulation).</p><p>Previous spectroscopic studies of nearby stars often enjoy high SNR spectra. For example,  measured T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin i for 1040 stars using spectra where SNR &gt; 100/pixel. While SpecMatch is a general purpose tool, it was designed to measure spectroscopic properties of faint Kepler stars with the HIRES spectrometer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Vogt et al. 1994</ref>) on the Keck I telescope. At 1 kpc, a typical distance to a Kepler target star, a solar analog has V = 14.7. Obtaining a spectrum with SNR = 100/pixel would take 7.2. SPECMATCH 203 2.5 hours and is not feasible for large samples of stars. We designed SpecMatch in order to yield reliable stellar parameters when SNR 40/pixel. This chapter is organized as follows: In Section 7.2 we describe how we condition observed spectra and extract spectroscopic parameters. In Section 7.3 we assess the reliability of SpecMatch parameters. We present a detailed Monte Carlo study of the precision SpecMatch as a function of spectral SNR and assess systematic uncertainties by analyzing spectra of touchstone stars from the literature. We summarize our results in Section 7.4, and expand on several compelling applications of SpecMatch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">SpecMatch</head><p>In brief, SpecMatch works by comparing an observed high-resolution optical spectrum to a library of synthetic model spectra from <ref type="bibr">Coelho et al. (2005) (C05, hereafter)</ref> that span a range of T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. In its current implementation, SpecMatch accepts spectra taken with HIRES on the Keck I telescope. However, SpecMatch can be easily adapted to work with other high resolution optical spectrometers. In this section we describe how we condition observed spectra and extract stellar parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Reduction and Calibration of Target Spectra</head><p>We remove the blaze function by dividing the target spectrum by the spectrum of a rapidly rotating B star. The California Planet Search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Marcy et al. 2008</ref>) routinely takes spectra of rapidly rotating B stars which have nearly featureless spectra that, when observed with HIRES, provide a good description of the shape of the blaze function. We divide the target spectrum by the average of 20 B stars having weak stellar absorption lines. The resulting spectra still show variations at the few percent level due to differences in slit illumination and changes optics of HIRES. A low-order polynomial is fit to the 95 percentile level of the spectrum to remove residual curvature.</p><p>After normalizing out the continuum, we place the star's spectrum onto its rest wavelength scale. We cross-correlate chunks of the target spectrum with a model template spectrum, taken from the C05 library of synthetic spectra. We use one of six model spectra with parameters listed in 7.3 as our wavelength standard. We cross-correlate a segment 1 of the target star spectrum with each of the 6 models and select the model spectrum with the highest cross-correlation peak as the wavelength standard.</p><p>For each of the 16 orders, we cross-correlate seven segments of 1000 pixels wide. </p><formula xml:id="formula_71">   ,</formula><p>where δv i,j corresponds to the velocity shift of segment j in order i. We compute the average shift (with sigma clipping) over each of the columns of δv and fit a linear relationship to derive δv as a function of pixel number. This average velocity shift is applied to all orders to place the target spectrum on its rest wavelength scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Comparison to Library Spectra</head><p>We compare the target spectrum to a suite of model spectra from the C05 library. C05 modeled spectra over a grid in T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7.</ref>1. The SpecMatch library consists of a 15 × 9 × 7 regular grid of C05 model spectra. C05 used model atmospheres from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2003)</ref>. Line lists came from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barbuy et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Meléndez &amp; Barbuy (1999)</ref>. Oscillator strengths were taken from the NIST database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Reader et al. 2002)</ref>, other works (see references in C05), as well as empirically by fitting line profiles to the solar spectrum. Damping constants (γ) for strong neutral lines were taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Anstee &amp; O'Mara (1995)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barklem &amp; O'Mara (1997);</ref><ref type="bibr">and</ref><ref type="bibr">Barklem et al. (1998, 2000</ref>). Damping constants for other lines were fit manually to the solar spectrum or assumed to have an interaction constant of C 6 = 0.3 × 10 −31 . C05 synthesized model spectra over λ = 3000-18,000 Å with 0.02 Å sampling using the PFANT radiative transfer code <ref type="bibr">(Spite 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cayrel et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barbuy et al. 2003</ref>). C05 used the following prescription for microturbulence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">v t =   </formula><p>1.0 km s −1 : log g ≥ 3.0 1.8 km s −1 : 1.5 ≤ log g ≤ 3.0 2.5 km s −1 : log g ≤ 1.0 Each target-model comparison involves subtracting the model spectrum from the observed spectrum. We filter the residuals and remove trends longer than 400 pixels (∼ 8.6 Å) before computing χ 2 . This high-pass filtering ensures that well-matched models are not penalized on account of low-frequency noise (due to imperfect continuum fitting).</p><p>The comparisons are performed independently on different segments of stellar spectra. We found by trial and error that the five spectral regions listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.2 produced parameters that were in close agreement with touchstone stars from <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Huber et al. (2013)</ref> (with asteroseismic constraints) and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Torres et al. (2012)</ref> (with transit-constrained ρ ). We also identified, by inspection, certain lines that poorly matched observed spectra and constructed a mask to exclude these regions from the computation of χ 2 f . Figures 7.12-7.16 show the five spectral regions for a KOI-1, a star with nearly Solar parameters 3 The   masked regions are grayed out. The SpecMatch spectral segments are characterized by having relatively few saturated and overlapping lines. One aspect that makes SpecMatch suitable for low SNR spectra is that it uses a wide region (380 Å) of optical spectrum. As a point of comparison the VF05 analysis used ≈ 170 Å. One surprise was that the HIRES order containing the Mg I b triplet produced log g values in poor agreement with asteroseismology. The Mg I b line is a so-called "pressure sensitive" line and is often used as a log g diagnostic. While the wings of the line are, in principle, good probes of stellar surface gravity, we excluded them because of the observed tension with asteroseismology. There may be issues with the C05 treatment of these lines or that strong covariances with T eff or magnesium abundance (which may not scale with <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>) are complicating the fit to the Mg I b lines.</p><p>The C05 model spectra incorporate natural, thermal, collisional, and microturbulent broadening. Since the model spectra do not account for broadening due to rotation, macroturbulence, or the instrumental profile, lines in the C05 models are narrower than observed spectra. During each target-model comparison we convolve the model spectrum with a standard rotational broadening kernel (see p. 374 of Gray 1992) to account for additional broadening. v sin i is allowed to float as a free parameter. Note that v sin i is acting as a stand-in for other broadening terms besides rotation like macroturbulence and the instrumental profile. In a later polishing step (Section 7.2.5), macroturbulence and the instrumental profile are treated individually. The instrumental profile is determined empirically for each spectrum using telluric lines, following a procedure described in Section 7.2.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.3">Stellar Parameters from Linear Combinations of Spectra</head><p>We zero in on a best-fit T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> by taking linear combinations of m model spectra that have lowest χ 2 f , when compared to the target spectrum. This linear combination can be represented as, MA, where, M is an n × m matrix of best-match model spectra and A is a m × 1 matrix of coefficients. We solve for the set of positive coefficients that minimize χ 2 using a non-negative least-squares solver, 4 i.e. argmin A ||MA − S|| 2 for A ≥ 0.</p><p>By trial and error, we found that using m = 8 model spectra to construct M gave the fitter adequate flexibility while keeping the number of free parameters manageable. We arrive at the target star's T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> by taking a average of the T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> associated with each of the best m models, weighted by A. This averaging is done for each of the stellar parameters associated with each wavelength segment. The T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] determined from each segment are averaged again to determine a single set of T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> for the target star spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.4">Measuring the Instrumental Profile with Telluric Lines</head><p>Properly treating the width of the instrumental profile is especially important for v sin i work. If our model of the instrumental profile is too narrow, SpecMatch will increase v sin i in order to correctly match the width of absorption lines. While telluric lines are broadened by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere to ∼ 100 m s −1 , telluric lines remain narrow compared to the instrumental profile of HIRES (several km s −1 ) and are good diagnostics its width. For each target spectrum, fit the O 2 B-X band of telluric lines with a comb of Gaussians:</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">I(λ) = 1 − i a i e − 1 2 λ−λ c,i σ IP 2 , (7.1)</formula><p>where a i and λ i specifies line depths and centers respectively and σ IP sets the width of the Gaussians. In the fit, σ IP is allowed to float as a free parameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.1 shows the fit to the telluric lines HD 209458 spectrum, a high SNR spectrum (SNR ∼ 160/pixel). We show the fits to the KOI-2 spectrum in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.2 with SNR ∼ 45/pixel. The width of the instrumental profile, σ IP , depends on seeing, the HIRES slit width, and the performance and focus of the spectrometer optics. We illustrate this variability in PSF-width in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.3, where we show the measured line widths, for 43 spectra of stars from the Albrecht et al. (2012) Rossiter-McLaughlin sample (see Section 7.3.2) organized by HIRES decker. The wider deckers, B5 and C2, have a sky projected width of 0.861" and larger σ IP , than the B1 and B3 deckers (0.574" projected width). For different observations with the same decker, the instrumental profile width varies by ∼ 0.4 pixels = 0.5 km s −1 . Thus, adopting a single instrumental profile width would produce errors in v sin i as large as ∼ 0.5 km s −1 , hampering the measurement of small v sin i.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_74">∆log g = c 0 T eff − 5770 K 100 K + c 1 [Fe/H] 0.1 dex + c 2 ,</formula><p>where <ref type="formula">c</ref>  2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Photon-Limited Errors</head><p>We explored how photon noise affects our derived parameters using a Monte Carlo approach. Starting with 10 high SNR spectra from the VF05 catalog (SNR/pixel∼150), we injected noise to simulate lower SNR spectra. Spectra were degraded to SNR/pixel of 80, 40, 20, and 10. To understand the degree to which pixel-to-pixel fluctuations affect T eff , log g, and [Fe/H], we generated 20 realizations of each stellar spectrum at each SNR level (20 × 10 × 4 = 800 total realizations). We adopted the standard deviation of the best fit values of T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> for the 20 realizations as the error associated with Poisson fluctuations for each spectrum at each SNR level. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.7 shows the standard deviation of best fit T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> for each star at each SNR level. Scatter in the derived parameters grows with decreasing SNR. Poisson errors tend be larger for hotter stars since they have fewer lines in the SpecMatch spectral regions. We list the median photon-limited error for T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> for different SNR levels in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.4. At SNR/pixel = 40, photon-limited errors are 14 K in T eff , 0.03 dex in log g, and 0.012 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and as we will show in Section 7.3.2, photon-limited errors are second order compared to systematic uncertainties.</p><p>Photon-limited errors have the biggest impact on the PSF-fitting component of SpecMatch, For example, the top left panel shows the standard deviation of the best fit temperatures computed from 20 SNR/pixel = 80 realizations for 10 diagnostic stars. The median standard deviation in temperature for all 10 stars 4 K. The SNR levels in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 80, 40, 20, and 10, respectively. As SNR declines, the scatter in the SpecMatch-derived parameters increases for the Monte Carlo simulated spectra. This scatter is representative of photon-limited errors at different SNR levels. At SNR/pixel = 40, slightly below the typical SNR/pixel = 45 for CKS, photon-limited errors are 14 K in T eff , 0.03 dex in log g, and 0.012 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and is second order compared to expected systematic uncertainties. Note that the statistical error in T eff is larger hotter T eff stars. At higher T eff , there are fewer lines, so pixel-by-pixel errors have more of an impact on the derived best fit parameters. </p></div>

(2013)</ref> was 0.10 dex before any calibration, we adopt σ(log g) = 0.10 dex errors in surface gravity for stars with T eff &lt; 5700 K.</p><p>Comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Torres et al. (2012)</ref> An additional sample of comparison stars comes from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Torres et al. (2012)</ref> (T12, hereafter). T12 measured T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] for 56 stars with transiting planets. T12 measured these parameters spectroscopically using three different techniques: SME <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996;</ref>); SPC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Buchhave et al. 2012)</ref>, and MOOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Sneden 1973)</ref>. When making comparisons, we use the SME parameters. Because these stars host transiting planets, mean stellar density, ρ , may be extracted from the transit light curve. Surface gravities with the additional constraint of ρ from transit fitting may be more accurate than surface gravities based on spectroscopy alone. However, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  8</ref> in H13 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Sliski &amp; Kipping (2014)</ref>, ρ from transit-fitting can disagree at the &gt; 50%-level compared to ρ from asteroseismology. When fitting a transit profile, strong degeneracies exist between impact parameter and ρ , and H13 found that disagreements in ρ were largest for high impact parameters.</p><p>Using SpecMatch, we measured T eff , log g, and [Fe/H] for 43 main-sequence stars from the T12 analysis having T eff = 4700-6700 K. We list the SpecMatch and T12 parameters in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.7. We show a graphical comparison in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.9. Dispersion about the 1-to-1 line is 89 K in T eff , 0.077 dex in log g, and 0.11 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. The fact that surface gravities agree to 0.077 dex, even when main sequence stars with T eff &lt; 5700 K are included, supports our adoption of σ(log g) = 0.10 for stars cooler than 5700 K.</p><p>We note a systematic trend in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, where above 0.2 dex, SpecMatch produces iron values that are higher compared to T12. Also, we note a systematic trend in the T eff , below ∼6000 K, SpecMatch runs hot compared to T12, while above ∼6000 K, SpecMatch runs cool. However, we are note able to tell whether these systematics are due to errors in the C05 models, the SpecMatch fitting procedure, or the joint SME/ρ analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Torres et al.

(2012)</head><p>Stellar rotation broadens stellar lines by an amount equal to twice the projected rotational velocity of the star, or v sin i. Although often treated as a nuisance parameter, v sin i contains information about a star's spin axis (when combined with v eq ) and a star's suitability to precise RV followup. Measuring accurate v sin i when v sin i is small (&lt; 5 km s −1 ) is notoriously difficult because rotational broadening competes with other broadening mechanisms like microturbulence, macroturbulence, and the instrumental profile of the spectrometer.</p><p>We adopt stars from Albrecht et al. (2012) (A12 hereafter) as touchstones to assess the accuracy of SpecMatch-based v sin i. Stars with RM measurements offer a robust calibration sample for v sin i, given that the amplitude of the anomalous Doppler shift during transit depends on v sin i. A12 compiled RM measurements from 53 stars, from which we select 43 stars with v sin i uncertainties of less than 2 km s −1 as a calibration sample for our v sin i values. We list the decker, measured instrumental profile width, and v sin i measurements from SpecMatch A12 v sin i for each of these stars in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.9. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.10 compares SpecMatch v sin i with the RM-based v sin i from A12. There is good v sin i agreement down to v sin i of ∼ 1 km s −1 . Below 2 km s −1 , v sin i is so small compared to other broadening terms that we do not consider SpecMatch v sin i values reliable. SpecMatch yeilds σ(v sin i) = 1 km s −1 down to v sin i = 2 km s −1 . For lower rotational velocity, we adopt an upper limit on stellar v sin i at 2 km s −1 .</p><p>Comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Valenti and Fischer (2005)</ref> As discussed in Section 7.2.6, we ran SpecMatch on 352 stars from the VF05 catalog. We list the VF05 and SpecMatch parameters in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.8, and compare the two parameters graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">Figure 7</ref>.11. VF05 list two log g values: a "spectroscopic log g," based solely on the SME analysis and a "isochrone log g," which incorporates constraints on log g based on R (determined from T eff and absolute magnitudes) and Yonsei-Yale isochrones. We choose to compare our log g values to the "spectroscopic log g" because SpecMatch does not impose any constraints based on isochrones. Dispersion about the 1-to-1 line is 66 K in T eff , 0.161 dex in log g, and 0.04 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> (recall that T eff and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> have been calibrated to the VF05 scale).</p><p>We use the scatter in the differences between SpecMatch and VF05 effective temperatures and metallicities to assess our systematic uncertainties in these parameters. If systematics effects are independent during the SpecMatch and VF05 fitting, the scatter in ∆T eff and ∆[Fe/H] represent systematic errors in T eff and log g for both analyses, added in quadrature. We adopt σ(T eff ) = 60 K and σ([Fe/H]) = 0.04 which makes the conservative assumption that the VF parameters contribute negligibly to the errors. Zero-point offsets remain a concern given that both techniques relied on optical spectra and model atmospheres with similar provenience. SME used <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kurucz (1992)</ref> atmospheres and SpecMatch uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2003)</ref> atmospheres. However, SpecMatch and SME used different line lists and spectral regions.</p><p>The differences in log g between SpecMatch and VF05 were the highest of any of the comparison samples. That we see lower dispersion and no systematic offset comparing SpecMatch to H13 and T12, which incorporate additional constraints on log g from asteroseismolgy and transit light curves suggests lower log g precision in VF05. In the SME analysis of VF05, the measured log g was largely driven by the model fit to the wings of the Mg I b lines. Modeling these lines requires careful treatment of the continuum and the effects of pressure broadening, which could be hampering the log g precision of SME. Recall that SpecMatch T eff and log g have been placed on the SPOCS scale (see Section 7.2.6) but that for most stars the correction is smaller than 60 K and 0.04 dex.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Conclusions</head><p>We developed new tool, SpecMatch, that can reliably extract stellar parameters from high-resolution optical spectra. We have assessed the systematic errors associated with SpecMatch parameters by analyzing high SNR spectra of well-characterized touchstone stars  . These errors are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_133">Table 7</ref>.5. The fact that SpecMatch uses a robust model template fitting procedure involving a large spectral region (380 Å) results in reliable parameters even for low SNR spectra. As we showed in Section 7.3.1, photon-limited uncertainties become comparable to systematic uncertainties at SNR/pixel = 10. Such a spectrum requires 100× less integration time than the SNR/pixel = 100 spectra often used for stellar parametrization. This corresponds to a reduction from 2.5 hours to 1.5 minutes of integration time for a V = 14.7 star, typical of Kepler planet hosts, observed with HIRES on Keck I.</p><p>SpecMatch is a powerful tool for the characterization of large samples of planet-bearing stars from Kepler . Here, we elaborate on some of the science applications for SpecMatch as applied to Kepler planet-hosting stars. SpecMatch can be used to improve the radii of large samples of Kepler planets. With Kepler , the planet to star radius ratio, R P /R , which depends on the transit depth to first order, is typically measured with high precision. 8 Stellar radii based on photometry in the Kepler Input Catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) are uncertain at the ∼35% level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Burke et al. 2014</ref>). Thus, our knowledge of the sizes of Kepler planets is limited by stellar radius uncertainties. One of the key results of the Kepler mission is the distribution of planet sizes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Petigura et al. 2013b</ref>) which provides important constraints for planet formation models. If the underlying radius distribution contains sharp features that would indicate an important size scale for planet formation are blurred by photometric radius errors. Combining SpecMatchderived parameters with Dartmouth isochrones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Dotter et al. 2008</ref>) yields stellar radii good to ≈ 5%, for solar analog stars. By improving stellar radii, SpecMatch will reveal smaller details in the planet radius distribution.</p><p>SpecMatch can help probe the connection planet formation and the composition of pro-toplanetary disks. Among nearby stars, there is a well-established correlation between giant planet occurrence and host star metallicity (Gonzalez 1997; <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Santos et al. 2004;</ref>. Higher metallicity stars are thought to have more massive protoplanetary disks which appear to form giant planets more efficiently. However, planets the size of Neptune and smaller are found around stars with a wide range of metallicities, both in the solar neighborhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>) and in the Kepler field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Buchhave et al. 2012</ref>). Finally, for transiting planets detected by Kepler , v sin i can be combined with the stars equatorial velocity (derived from photometric rotational modulation) to derive the inclination of the star's spin axis with respect to the Earth. Transiting planets have orbital inclinations very close to 90 • . The 1 km s −1 precision of SpecMatch v sin i measurements, can probe star-planet spin-orbit misalignment for planets that are too small and stars that are too faint for current Rossiter-McLaughlin techniques.    Note. -For WASP-8, v sin i was misprinted as 20±0.6 km s −1 , instead of 2.0±0.6 km s −1 in the original reference (Queloz 2010).

When only planet mass is known, planet size is estimated according to the Weiss et al. (2013) mass-radius relationship. Two distinct populations of planets are visible. Longperiod giant planets (many of which are on eccentric orbits) and close-in "hot Jupiters" (which have inflated radii due to poorly understood processes). By 2012, this picture had changed dramatically with the analysis of just over one year of Kepler data (Batalha et al. 2013).

Here, an uncorrected SPSD at t = 365.3 days resulted in a SNR∼40 event with P = 353.965 days, seen in the SNR periodogram. SES stack plot shows this high SNR TCE is due to a single spike in SES due to the SPSD. P = 353.965 days is favored over nearby periods because the anomaly aligns with gaps in the photometry. We flag cases like this with our s2n_on_grass statistic. We find several nearby peaks with nearly equal SNR. For KIC-1570270, s2n_on_grass is less than our threshold of 1.2 and does not pass machine triage.</figDesc></figure>

KIC-5094751 

Figure 3.4: SNR periodogram of KIC-5094751 photometry, demonstrating TERRA's insensi-
tivity to lower SNR candidates in multi-candidate systems. Batalha et al. (2012) lists two 
planets belonging to KIC-5094751, KOI-123.01 and KOI-123.02 with P = 6.48 and 21.22 
days, respectively. TERRA detected KOI-123.01 with a period of 6.48 days (highest SNR peak). 
Sub-harmonics belonging to KOI-123.01 are visible at [2, 3, . . .] × P = [13.0, 19.4, . . .] days. 
A second set of SNR peaks due to KOI-123.02 (P = 21.2 days) is visible at [0.5, 2, . . .] × P = 
[10.6, 42.4, . . .] days. Had we removed the transit due to KOI-123.01, KOI-123.02 would be 
easily detectible due its high SNR of ∼ 80. TERRA does not yet include multi-candidate logic 
and is thus blind to lower SNR candidates in multi-candidate systems.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> The middle chip on HIRES has 16 orders. We label the orders starting from zero, i.e. 0, 1, ... 15, from bluest to reddest. Order number 2 is used to select the model spectrum acting as wavelength standard. 2 A shift of one HIRES pixel is equivalent to a velocity displacement of∼1.3 km s −1 . The seven segments are evenly-spaced, starting at pixel number 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.5">Polishing the Parameters by Forward Modeling</head><p>The linear combination approach gives good initial guesses for the parameters. We refine these parameters using a forward modeling approach. Here, we synthesize model spectra with an arbitrary T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, v sin i, and instrumental profile according to the following three steps:</p><p>1. We select the eight model spectra with parameters that enclose the desired set of T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> in a box in the 3D space of T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. We synthesize an intermediate spectrum within this box using trilinear interpolation.</p><p>2. We then account for rotation and macroturbulence (parametrized by ξ) by constructing a combined rotational-macroturbulent profile (equation 17 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hirano et al. 2011</ref>) and convolving it with the spectrum from step 1. For stars with moderate v sin i and ξ, it is possible to solve for v sin i and ξ independently, with very high SNR and very high spectral resolution. For our CKS spectra there is a large degeneracy between v sin i and ξ, so we adopt the following relationship from :</p><p>3. We convolve the spectrum from step 2 with a Gaussian to model the effects of the HIRES instrumental profile, which is determined from telluric lines, as described in Section 7.2.4.</p><p>After synthesizing the model spectrum, we re-compute χ 2 f according to the procedure outlined in Section 7.2.3. We refine the parameters determined during the linear combination step (Section 7.2.3) by varying T eff , log g, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin i in search of the best match. We converge on the best match using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. As an example, we show the spectrum of KOI-1 along with the best-fitting model spectrum in Figures 7.12-7.16.  While spectroscopy routinely achieves effective temperature precision of &lt; 100 K, zeropoint and temperature-dependent offsets persist at the ∼100 K level. These offsets are observed when comparing effective temperatures based on photometry and spectroscopy and when comparing effective temperatures based on different spectroscopic techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Casagrande et al. 2010</ref>). Further work is needed to anchor the spectroscopic effective temperatures to the absolute effective temperatures from L and R . , VF05 hereafter, used the "Spectroscopy Made Easy" (SME) spectrum synthesis code <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996</ref>) to measure stellar properties for 1040 nearby FGK stars. We choose to anchor SpecMatch effective temperatures to the VF05 scale</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>210</head><p>because the VF05 catalog is an important touchstone in the literature. We analyzed spectra of 352 stars from the VF05 catalog using SpecMatch. We use these shared stars to link the SpecMatch effective temperatures to the SME scale. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.4, we show the difference between SpecMatch and VF05 effective tempeartures, ∆T eff . We fit these differences using a linear relationship,</p><p>where c 0 = −4.23 and c 1 = −7.6 K. Subsequent effective temperatures presented in this work have been calibrated against this relationship. The VF05 catalog is also an important with respect to planet-metallicity work. Using the VF05 catalog,  firmly established the correlation between Jovian planet occurrence and host star metallicity. We elect to anchor SpecMatch [Fe/H] to the VF05 scale in order to facilitate comparisons between the two studies. Kepler planet hosts where asteroseismic modes were detected. Analysis of power spectra of Kepler short cadence photometry revealed solar-like oscillations in these 77 stars. H13 measured the large frequency separation, δν, which depends on M and R , and ν max , which depends on M , R , and T eff -2 equations and three unknowns. Starting with an initial temperature from spectroscopy, H13 solved for M and R and hence log g. log g was then fixed in the spectroscopic analysis and T eff and [Fe/H] were re-derived from modeling spectra. T eff was fed back into the asteroseismic equations iteratively until convergence.</p><p>Because asteroseismology offers exquisite log g precision for bright stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">5</ref> we use 75 stars 6 from the H13 sample to calibrate SpecMatch surface gravities in the following two regions of the HR diagram:</p><p>1. For stars with log g = 3.5-5.0 (cgs) and T eff = 5700-6500 K, we note a weak dependence of ∆ log g = log g (SM) − log g (H13) on T eff and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, which is shown in the top </p></div>			</div>
