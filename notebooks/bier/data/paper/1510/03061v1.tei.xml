				<p>The Mg-Si-O system is the major Earth and rocky planet-forming system. Here, through quantum variable-composition evolutionary structure explorations, we have discovered several unexpected stable binary and ternary compounds in the Mg-Si-O system. Besides the well-known SiO 2 phases, we have found two extraordinary silicon oxides, SiO 3 and SiO, which become stable at pressures above 0.51 TPa and 1.89 TPa, respectively. In the Mg-O system, we have found one new compound, MgO 3 , which becomes stable at 0.89 TPa. We find that not only the (MgO) x · (SiO 2) y compounds, but also two (MgO 3) x · (SiO 3) y compounds, MgSi 3 O 12 and MgSiO 6 , have stability fields above 2.41 TPa and 2.95 TPa, respectively. The highly oxidized MgSi 3 O 12 can form in deep mantles of mega-Earths with masses above 20 M ⊕ (M ⊕ :Earth&apos;s mass). Furthermore, the dissociation pathways of pPv-MgSiO 3 are also clarified, and found to be different at low and high temperatures. The low-temperature pathway is MgSiO 3 ⇒ Mg 2 SiO 4 + MgSi 2 O 5 ⇒ SiO 2 + Mg 2 SiO 4 ⇒ MgO + SiO 2 , while the high-temperature pathway is MgSiO 3 ⇒ Mg 2 SiO 4 + MgSi 2 O 5 ⇒ MgO + MgSi 2 O 5 ⇒ MgO + SiO 2. Present results are relevant for models of the internal structure of giant exoplanets, and for understanding the high-pressure behavior of materials. 3</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Several astonishing discoveries have been recently achieved in planetary science, e.g, the discovery of super-Earth Gliese 830c <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.This planet weighs at least 5 M ⊕ (M ⊕ : Earth's mass) and is the nearest candidate for habitable planet so far; a new type of planet, Kepler-10c, weighing 17 times as much as Earth, is also found to be a rocky planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Such a planet was previously believed to be impossible to form, because anything so heavy would grab hydrogen gas as it grew, and become a Jupiter-like gas giant. For now, this planet is the biggest rocky planet ever discovered, much bigger than previously discovered "super-Earths" (with masses 1 to 10 M ⊕ ), making it a "mega-Earth" (with masses over 10 M ⊕ ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These breakthroughs emphasize the importance of the exploration of internal structure and mineralogy of super-Earths and mega-Earths.</p><p>After the mysterious anomalies at the Earth's D" layer have been at least partly explained by the discovery of the new mineral phase post-perovskite (pPv) MgSiO 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, one wonders whether phase transitions exist in MgSiO 3 under further compression, which is the key information to understand and model the internal structure of exoplanets. It was first reported that pPv-MgSiO 3 will decompose into MgO and SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> under high pressure. However, with discovery of two new silicates, MgSi 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> [6] and Mg 2 SiO 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the dissociation pathway of pPv-MgSiO 3 became a complex three-step process at zero Kelvin: pPv-MgSiO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , which is extremely important to evaluate the stability of minerals in exoplanet mantles, has not been considered.</p><p>Recently numerous counterintuitive compounds have been discovered under pressure. For instance, in Li-H system, besides "normal" LiH, new "counterintuitive" compounds LiH 2 , LiH <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and LiH 8 are predicted to be stable under pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; moreover, experimental synthesis and characterization confirm the existence of unexpected Na-Cl compounds (such as Na <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Cl and NaCl 3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; what's more, magnesium oxide (MgO), one of the most abundant phases in the Earth mantle, was long believed to be the only binary compound in the Mg-O system. Nevertheless, two extraordinary compounds, MgO 2 and Mg 3 O 2 have been discovered to be stable above 116 GPa and 500 GPa, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>These fascinating discoveries inspired us to explore possible stable binary and ternary compounds in the Mg-Si-O system.</p><p>In this work, we have performed comprehensive structure searches and investigations of the Mg-Si-O system in the pressure range 0.5-3 TPa. Due to the complexities of the ternary system, the Mg-Si, Si-O and Mg-O bounding binaries are discussed first. All of the ternary stable compounds (including the stable compounds discovered in this work) fall into the pseudo-binary MgO-SiO 2 and MgO 3 -SiO 3 joins. Hence, we discuss ternary compounds in these two pseudo-binary systems separately. Lattice dynamics calculations for all the investigated structures show no imaginary vibrational frequencies, suggesting their dynamical stability throughout the pressure ranges reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussions</head><p>Variable-composition structure searches using the USPEX code with up to 64 atoms in the unit cell at pressures ranging from 0.5 TPa to 3 TPa for the Mg-Si-O system have been carried out, identifying important low energy structures that are likely to gain stability within this chemical system. Before we talk about binary and ternary compounds in the Mg-Si-O system, crystal structures of elemental Mg, Si and O should be clarified. For elemental Mg, several phase transitions are predicted in the pressure range 0.5-3 TPa. In excellent agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, our calculations demonstrate that Mg adopts the fcc structure at 0.5 TPa, then it transforms into the simple hexagonal (sh) structure at 0.76 TPa; interestingly, when pressure increases to 1.07 TPa, it transforms into the simple cubic (sc, or α-Po) structure. Elemental Si adopts the fcc structure at 0.5 TPa, in agreement with literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but no phase transformation occurs in the pressure range of 0.5-3 TPa. Elemental O adopts a hexagonal hp8 structure at 0.5 TPa (Several similar structures are very close in enthalpy in the pressure range of 0.5 to 1.9 TPa. For more details, we refer to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) and then transforms into the orthorhombic oC16 structure at 1.9 TPa, in good agreement with literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mg-Si binary system</head><p>Mg 2 Si is the only binary compound in the Mg-Si system at ambient pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. When pressure is increased above 0.5 TPa, Mg 2 Si remains the only stable binary compound in the Mg-Si system, until it decomposes into Mg and Si at 1.41 TPa (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S3a</ref> in Supplementary Materials). In this pressure range, it adopts the well-known AlB 2 -type structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Si-O binary system</head><p>Even though silicon monoxide SiO can exist in the gas phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, no evidence shows that it can exist in the crystalline form, and the amorphous black solid form of silicon monoxide indeed is a mixture of amorphous silicon and silicon dioxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, silicon dioxide SiO 2 is still the only known oxide in the Si-O system. In agreement with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, pyrite-type SiO 2 transforms into the Fe 2 P-type phase at 0.69 TPa. Nevertheless, if crystal structure exploration is carried out in the entire Si-O binary system, some unforeseeable structures are found. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref> demonstrates the pressure-composition phase diagram of the Si-O system. A new oxide, SiO 3 , becomes thermodynamically stable at 0.51 TPa with the tI32 (í µí°¼4 ) structure. Interestingly, this tI32-SiO 3 can further transform into the mP16 (P2 1 /c) structure at 0.82 TPa. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref> and c, both structures can be constructed by tricapped trigonal prism SiO 9 polyhedra, which is exactly the same coordination polyhedron as in Fe 2 P-type SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In order to further distinguish polyhedra in the two structures of SiO 3 , effective coordination numbers (ECoN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have been calculated. A large increase of the ECoN at the phase transition point from tI32 (ECoN = 7.48) to mP16 (ECoN = 8.05) phase can be observed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1f</ref>, indicating that accommodation of increased coordination is the primary reason for the stability of mP16-SiO 3 compared to tI32-SiO 3 . When pressure increases further, the ECoN of mP16-SiO 3 reaches 8.5, equal to the mean value of the SiO 9 polyhedron in Fe 2 P-SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Perhaps surprisingly, the Si-O distances are in the range from 1.53 to 1.95 Å in tI32-SiO 2 and 1.54 to 1.82 Å in mP16-SiO 3 at 0.7 TPa, respectively. These distances are unexpectedly long under such a high pressure, and comparable to the values (1.6 Å) in silica and silicates at ambient pressure. This phenomenon is likely a consequence of geometry, since the typical bond-length must increase in order to accommodate the dramatic increase in Si-O coordination. Therefore, the relative Si-O bond length must necessarily increase with increasing coordination as the bonding polyhedra's size expands to fill the space, a general phenomenon that is well-represented by a recently proposed coordinated hard sphere mixture model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The same situation is also observed in Fe 2 P-SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which indicates the tendency to form highly coordinated structures instead of shrinking the Si-O distances to lower the system energy.

Letter A refers to the strong interstitial electronic attractor in the Si 4 tetrahedron. (f) ECoN for tI32-SiO 3 and mP16-SiO 3 as a function of pressure. The mean ECoN value for Fe 2 P-SiO 2 is shown by a green dashed line, and the ideal CoN of 9 is given by a purple dashed line. The densities of states of tI32-SiO 3 , mP16-SiO 3 , and tP4-SiO show that they are insulators at 0 K, see Supplementary Materials.</p><p>When pressure is raised further, stable solid silicon monoxide appears in the Si-O system with the tP4 structure (P4/nmm) at 1.89 TPa, see <ref type="figure">Fig</ref> As tI32-SiO 3 and mP12-SiO 3 display similar charge transfer and chemical bonding features, mP12-SiO 3 has been selected for the following discussion. In mP12-SiO 3 at 1 TPa, the net Bader charge <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> on Si is +3.42 e, indicating a very large degree (~85%) of charge transfer from Si to O atoms. Based on Bader analysis, two types of O atoms exist in the mP12-SiO 3 structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.1d)</ref>, the net charges on O1 and O2 are -1.63 e and -0.89 e, respectively. Therefore O1 attracts almost two electrons and attains a stable s 2 p 6 electron configuration. Furthermore, the O-O bond distance between O2 atoms is 1.19 Å, the O-O bond distance for molecular crystal hP8-O 2 at 1 TPa is 1.09 Å while the non-bonding O-O distances for MgSiO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and SiO 2 are in the range of 1.7 Å to 2.0 Å, which clearly indicates a covalent bond and the presence of a peroxide-ion <ref type="bibr">[</ref> For tP4-SiO at 1.5 TPa, the net charge on Si is +1.83 e, and the net charge on O is -1.83 e. Thus, O atom attains a stable electronic configuration. ELF distribution of tP4-SiO shows that besides accumulated electrons surrounding O atoms, we can also observe a strong interstitial electron localization in the Si 4 tetrahedron as marked by letter A in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1e</ref>. Considering the Si-Si distance (1.86 Å) is out of the range of core-core orbital overlap, the strong interstitial electron localization is due to the formation of multicenter covalent bonds between Si atoms. Each Si atom has four nearest such electron localization regions, which accumulate two valence electrons, indeed creating an octet and explaining why each Si atom can be stabilized with two valence electrons and why SiO adopts a Si-Si-O-O ordered layered structure.</p></div>

Intriguingly, if we further increase pressure, another extraordinary compound, tP8-MgO 3 with í µí±4 2 1 í µí± symmetry, becomes thermodynamically stable at 0.89 TPa as shown in the pressure-composition phase diagram of the Mg-O system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2a)</ref>.  </p></div>

Here, thermodynamic properties of these phases were investigated within the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), using the computed phonon spectra. Previous work suggests that the P-T conditions of interest are within the range of validity of the QHA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">23]</ref>.

We have found that all the compounds discussed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.4b</ref> shows very small electronic effects at these temperatures. For instance, for the decomposition reaction of MgSiO 3 into Mg 2 SiO 4 and MgSi 2 O 5 under 0.75 TPa at 10 kK, the enthalpy changes only 0.0006 eV/atom after taking electronic entropy into consideration, and the dP/dT slope of this reaction in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4b</ref> becomes more negative, but the change is so tiny that we can safely neglect the electronic entropy contribution. Other reactions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4b</ref> shows similar behavior.</p><p>In order to further understand this question, we have calculated the band gaps of these compounds under different pressures as listed in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> in the supplementary materials. We can observe that all the compounds discussed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3d</ref>    relatively high temperature well within the P-T range of mega-Earth mantles. This decomposition pathway is most likely for giant exoplanets and has not been reported before. These phase transitions and reactions are expected to impact the complex dynamics of exoplanet interiors: as exothermic transformations (dP/dT &gt; 0) generally enhance heat transfer within convecting systems, while endothermic transformations (dP/dT &lt; 0) decrease it <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>.As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4b</ref>, the phase transition of MgSi 2 O 5 to Mg 2 SiO 4 and SiO 2 holds positive dP/dT slope, and should thus help to drive convection, while all other phases transitions shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4b</ref> hold negative dP/dT slopes, partially inhibiting convection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Methods</head><p>Searches for stable compounds and structures were performed using the variable-composition evolutionary algorithm, as implemented in the USPEX code <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[31]</ref> merged with first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory (the Vienna Ab initio Simulation</p><p>Package VASP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">33]</ref> for the calculation of the total energies, relaxation of crystals, and their corresponding electronic structures. The electronic structure and force calculations at finite temperatures were implemented within the Fermi-Dirac-smearing approach <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. The most significant feature of USPEX we used in this work is the capability of optimizing the composition and crystal structures simultaneously -as opposed to the more usual structure predictions at fixed chemical composition. The compositional search space is described via chemical building blocks.</p><p>The whole range of compositions of interest is initially sampled randomly and sparsely. To ensure the child structures are within the desired area of compositional space, the chemistry-preserving constraints in the variation operators are lifted and replaced by the block correction scheme. A special "chemical transmutation" is introduced to reinforce the search efficiency. Stable compositions are determined using the convex hull construction: a compound is thermodynamically stable if the enthalpy of its decomposition into any other compounds is positive. For first-principles calculations we employed the all-electron projector augmented wave(PAW) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[34]</ref> and the generalized gradient approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[35]</ref> for the exchange-correlation energy, along with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 800 eV and dense uniform -centred k-point meshes with a reciprocal space resolution of 2π×0.03 Å -1 .

In addition, phonon dispersions throughout the Brillouin zone were derived using the finite-displacement approach as implemented in the Phonopy code <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[36]</ref>. Thermodynamic properties of these phases were investigated using their phonon spectra within the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (a) Pressure-composition phase diagram of the Si-O system.

Each Si atom is coordinated by five O atoms and eight Si atoms. Therefore, SiO retains high coordination numbers, like SiO 2 and SiO 3 , despite the drop of oxygen content. SiO 3 and SiO are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable, and it is still puzzling what stabilizes these exotic compounds. Based on classical chemical valence, only SiO 2 can be expected. To unravel the nature of these new phases, their electronic structure and chemical bonding have been analyzed.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Furthermore</head><label></label><figDesc>, Mg 3 O 2 decomposes into MgO and Mg at 0.95 TPa, while MgO 2 decomposes into MgO and MgO 3 at 1.43 TPa, and above 1.43 TPa MgO 3 and MgO are the only two stable magnesium oxides. As shown in Fig. 2b, each Mg atom within MgO 3 has 8 nearest O neighbors (O1 atoms) forming a cubic coordination (just as in B2-MgO) and 4 second nearest O neighbors (O2 atoms). Mg and O1 atoms form a distorted fluorite-type structure, empty voids of which are stuffed with O2 atoms. According to Bader analysis, in tP8-MgO 3 at 1 TPa the net charge on Mg is +1.75 e, indicating the nearly complete transfer of valence electrons of Mg to O atoms. The net charges on O1 and O2 are -0.74 e and -0.18 e, respectively, while the Mg-O1 and Mg-O2 distances are 1.63 Å and 1.83 Å, respectively. Considering the O-O distance between O1 and O2 is 1.22 Å,and the O-O bond distance for molecular crystal hP8-O 2 at 1 TPa is 1.09 Å while the non-bonding O-O distances for MgSiO 3 and SiO 2 are in the range of 1.7 Å to 2.0 Å, we can conclude that two O1 atoms and one O2 atoms form a bent singly bonded [O-O-O] 2-group. From the ELF isosurface of tP8-MgO 3 illustrated in Fig. 2c, we can also confirm the existence of [O-O-O] 2-, with a significant electronic accumulation between O1 and O2 atoms. As far as we know, this type of trioxide group is found here for the first time.</figDesc></figure>

Excitingly, we have discovered two new stable magnesium silicates which belong to the MgO 3 -SiO 3 pseudo-binary system. As shown in Fig. 5a, MgSi 3 O 12 with 64 atoms in the unit cell and cF64(Fm 3 ) structure becomes stable at 2.41 TPa. By increasing pressure further, another ternary compound, MgSiO 6 (cP8, Pm 3 ) gains stability at 2.95 TPa. The two compounds share many similar structural features, as illustrated in Fig. 5b and c. Both are ordered cubic superstructures of the Cr 3 Si-type structure. Recently[9] we have discovered a novel compound NaCl 3 with the Cr 3 Si-type structure, and a related compound NaCl 7 . This structure is stable under pressure because of high density and high coordination numbers. Mg and Si atoms in MgSiO 6 and MgSi 3 O 12 are both icosahedrally coordinated (CN and ECoN = 12).</figDesc></figure>

The density of states of cP8-MgSiO 6 is shown in Fig. S8 in Supplementary Materials.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>For</head><label></label><figDesc>these new ternary magnesium silicates, we need to clarify the nature of their stability. In both compounds, one can see infinite non-intersecting O-chains along the x, y and z axes. The O-O distances in cF64-MgSi 3 O 12 are in the range 1.29-1.33 Å, which are much longer than in MgSiO 6 . Taking into account the O-O bond distance of oI16-O at 3 TPa is 1.10 Å, we can conclude that the O-O bonding in cF64-MgSi 3 O 12 are much weaker than covalent singly O-O bond. From Bader analysis, for cP8-MgSiO 6 at 3 TPa, the net charge on Mg and Si are +1.59 e and +3.48 e, respectively, while the net charge on O is -0.85 e, indicating the nearly complete transfer of valence electrons of Mg and Si atoms to O atoms. For cF64-MgSi 3 O 12 at 3 TPa, the net charges on Mg and Si are +1.6 e and +3.49 e, respectively, i.e. practically the same values as in cP8-MgSiO 6 , while the charge on O is -1.01 e, which is much higher than the value (-0.85e) of O atom in cP8-MgSiO 6 . The density of states of cF64-MgSi 3 O 12 (Fig. 5d) shows that MgSi 3 O 12 is a metal, with DOS near the Fermi level exhibiting features of a 1D-metal, which is consistent with the infinite-non-intersecting O-chains in this structure. It is worth emphasizing that all the other oxides discussed in this work are insulators, which demonstrates the unique electronic structure of cF64-MgSi 3 O 12 .</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>MgSiO 6 and MgSi 3 O 12 are much more significant and can't be neglected. For instance, the enthalpy changes 0.10 eV/atom for MgSiO 6 under 3.0 TPa at 10 kK after taking electronic entropy into account. MgSiO 6 behaves more like a semi-conductor with band gap of 1.49 eV under 3.0 TPa, therefore bottom of the conduction band of MgSiO 6 becomes populated and the phonon frequencies changes at high temperature. This effect is even larger for MgSi 3 O 12 since MgSi 3 O 12 is a metal, the enthalpy changes 0.11 eV/atom for MgSi 3 O 12 under 2.0 TPa at 10 kK after taking electronic entropy into account. Here we have calculated the P-T phase diagram of MgSi 3 O 12 with and without the Fermi-Dirac-smearing. As shown in Fig. 6, the reaction from MgO3 and SiO3 to MgSi3O12 is affected significantly by electronic entropy, and the phase boundary line shifts toward lower pressure zone. For Fig. 6, we can also observe that the stability of MgSi 3 O 12 increase with the increasing of temperature. For O-rich exoplanet, MgSi3O12 are expected to exist at high temperature and pressure. It's worth emphasizing that MgSiO6 is not stable under 3.0 TPa after considering zero-point energy, that's why MgSiO6 cannot be observed in Fig. 6. Furthermore, for metallic and semiconducting compounds predicted in this work (MgSiO 6 , MgSi 3 O 12 ), there is an intriguing possibility of their enhanced solubility in metallic iron-rich cores of exoplanets.</figDesc></figure>

respectively. Interestingly, besides the well-known (MgO) x · (SiO 2 ) y compounds, we have discovered 

two (MgO 3 ) x · (SiO 3 ) y compounds, MgSi 3 O 12 , MgSiO 6 , which can form at 2.41 TPa and 2.95 TPa, 

respectively, in the Mg-Si-O system. Surprisingly, MgSi 3 O 12 is predicted to be a metallic oxide with 

1D-metalicity while all other oxides discussed in this work are semiconductors or insulators. 

As the dissociation pathway of pPv-MgSiO 3 is clarified, the mineralogy and internal structure of 

planetary mantles can be understood much deeper. pPv-MgSiO 3 can survive in super-Earths with masses smaller than 6 only have binary MgO and SiO 2 near the CMB. For strongly oxidized planets, MgO 3 and SiO 3 can 

be expected to be found. The newly discovered MgO 3 , SiO 3 , MgSiO 6 , MgSi 3 O 12 hold non-traditional 

stoichimetries, which fall off of the MgO-SiO 2 binary system. Given their apparent thermodynamic 

and lattice dynamic stability, these new compounds must be included in future models of exoplanet 

mineralogy in order to better understand the role that they play in massive planetary structure and 

evolution. The highly-oxidized MgSi 3 O 12 can be formed in the lowermost of mantle of mega-Earths 

with masses above 20 M ⊕ , and a metallic layer can even exist. For O-rich planets, the extraordinary 

O-rich compounds MgO 3 , SiO 3 , MgSi 3 O 12 and perhaps MgSiO 6 can be important planet-forming 

minerals. They may also appear in gas giants, as a result of reaction between Mg-silicate solid core 

and H 2 O-rich fluid mantle. In future, the consideration of other important elements (e.g., Fe, Al), will 

likely reveal additional important high-pressure phases with similarly strange stoichiometries.
