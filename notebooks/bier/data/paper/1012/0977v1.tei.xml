<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>For exoplanet direct detection mission concepts such as Terrestrial Planet Finder or Exoplanet Probe, light from the exozodiacal dust tends to obscure any exoplanets present in the image. Data analysis methods to identify point sources against this background have been very simple, traditionally with the simplifying assumption that the exozodi is uniformly distributed, just as our local zodiacal background is uniform over several-arcsec scales. However, the typical size of an exozodi cloud is expected to be comparable to the typical exoplanet orbital radii, or at least those of greatest interest -the "habitable zone" range from 0.7-1.5 AU.</p><p>We expect every target star to have zodiacal dust clouds, of unknown brightness Exozodi increases integration times  DC background for the planet signal  increases shot noise and integration times</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exozodi profile features can mimic small exoplanets</head><p>• Exozodi profile traditionally assumed symmetric or even uniform -Neglects difficulties in fitting exozodi and isolating the planet • Asymmetry in the image can be caused by -Dynamics of the planetary system (giant planets  pericenter shift) -Occulter decenter and asymmetry -Requires a more general exozodi profile model for planet detection analysis • Broad PSF (small telescope) leaves ambiguity between point sources and exozodi features</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Terrestrial planet detection requires fitting a fully general exozodi model</head><p>• From panchromatic camera or integral field spectrograph data • Fit exozodi shape and brightness, coronagraph suppression, and exoplanet position • Correct for expected exozodi profile features, based on measurements • Uncertainty in exozodi profile increases uncertainties in exoplanet position, brightness, and spectrum When a direct detection instrument is reduced in size for cost reasons, the point spread function (PSF) becomes broader, making it more difficult to distinguish a point source from a "blob" of exozodi light. In this case, the shotnoise limited integration time may not be enough; instead we may need an elevated signal-to-noise ratio and/or later measurements to resolve ambiguities in the image data, identify a point source with a calculable and high confidence level, and isolate the exozodi and exoplanet contributions to the observed light profile. We will examine some typical profiles and a few methods of analyzing image data, with the goal of structuring an approach to this data analysis problem. Baseline case</p></div>
